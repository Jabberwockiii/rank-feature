Many optimization techniques are iterative: the optimization\nstarts from an initial solution, then iteratively updates the solution to optimize the objective func-\ntion (Amari, 1993; Qian, 1999; Kingma & Ba, 2015; B\u00e4ck & Schwefel, 1993; Rios & Sahinidis,\n2013; Reeves, 1993). The optimization algorithm typically needs to be customized for an individual\ntask to deal with the specific challenges posed by the decision space and the performance landscape,\nespecially for derivative-free optimization.\nIn this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to\nutilize large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. With the advancement of prompting techniques,\nLLMs have achieved impressive performance on a variety of domains (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a; Madaan et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023e).\nTheir ability to understand natural language lays out a new possibility for optimization: instead of\nformally defining the optimization problem and deriving the update step with a programmed solver,\nwe describe the optimization problem in natural language, then instruct the LLM to iteratively generate\nnew solutions based on the problem description and the previously found solutions. Optimization\nwith LLMs enables quick adaptation to different tasks by changing the problem description in the\nprompt, and the optimization process can be customized by adding instructions to specify the desired\nproperties of the solutions.\nTo demonstrate the potential of LLMs for optimization, we first present case studies on linear\nregression and the traveling salesman problem, which are two classic optimization problems that\nunderpin many others in mathematical optimization, computer science, and operations research. On\nsmall-scale optimization problems, we show that LLMs are able to find good-quality solutions simply\nthrough prompting, and sometimes match or surpass hand-designed heuristic algorithms.\nNext, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to optimize prompts: the optimization goal is to find a\nprompt that maximizes the task accuracy. Specifically, we focus on natural language processing\ntasks where both the task input and output are in text formats. LLMs are shown to be sensitive to the\nprompt format (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2023; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022);\nin particular, semantically similar prompts may have drastically different performance (Kojima et al.,\n2022; Zhou et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023), and the optimal prompt formats can be model-specific\nand task-specific (Ma et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023c). Therefore, prompt engineering is often\nimportant for LLMs to achieve good performance (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). However, the large\nand discrete prompt space makes it challenging for optimization, especially when only API access to\nthe LLM is available. Following prior work on continuous and discrete prompt optimization (Lester\net al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023), we assume a training set is\navailable to compute the training accuracy as the objective value for optimization, and we show in\nexperiments that optimizing the prompt for accuracy on a small training set is sufficient to reach high\nperformance on the test set.\nThe prompt to the LLM serves as a call to the optimizer, and we name it the meta-prompt. Figure 3\nshows an example. The meta-prompt contains two core pieces of information. The first piece is\npreviously generated prompts with their corresponding training accuracies. The second piece is the\noptimization problem description, which includes several exemplars randomly selected from the\ntraining set to exemplify the task of interest. We also provide instructions for the LLM to understand\nthe relationships among different parts and the desired output format. Different from recent work\non using LLMs for automatic prompt generation (Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023), each\noptimization step in our work generates new prompts that aim to increase the test accuracy based on\na trajectory of previously generated prompts, instead of editing one input prompt according to natural\nlanguage feedback (Pryzant et al., 2023) or requiring the new prompt to follow the same semantic\nmeaning (Zhou et al., 2022b). Making use of the full optimization trajectory, OPRO enables the\nLLM to gradually generate new prompts that improve the task accuracy throughout the optimization\nprocess, where the initial prompts have low task accuracies.\nWe conduct comprehensive evaluation on several LLMs, including text-bison 1 and Palm 2-L\nin the PaLM-2 model family (Anil et al., 2023), as well as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 in the GPT\n1Available here: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/\nmodels.\n2\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nscores\ngenerated\nsolutions\nLLM as\noptimizer\nobjective function\nevaluator\nreturn top solutions\nwhen finish\nmeta-prompt\nsolution-score pairs\ntask description\nFigure 2: An overview of the OPRO framework. Given the meta-prompt as the input, the LLM\ngenerates new solutions to the objective function, then the new solutions and their scores are added\ninto the meta-prompt for the next optimization step. The meta-prompt contains the solution-score\npairs obtained throughout the optimization process, as well as a natural language description of\nthe task and (in prompt optimization) a few exemplars from the task. See Figure 3 for a sample\nmeta-prompt for prompt optimization.\nmodel family 2. We optimize prompts on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun\net al., 2022), which are reasoning benchmarks where prompting techniques have achieved remarkable\nperformance breakthrough (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Suzgun et al., 2022). Starting\nfrom initial prompts with low task accuracies, we show that all LLMs in our evaluation are able to\nserve as optimizers, which consistently improve the performance of the generated prompts through\niterative optimization until convergence (see Figure 1). In particular, while these LLMs generally\nproduce instructions of different styles (see Table 1), with zero-shot prompting, their best generated\ninstructions match the few-shot chain-of-thought prompting performance when applied to PaLM\n2-L (Anil et al., 2023), outperforming the zero-shot performance with human-designed prompts by\nup to 8% on GSM8K. Additionally, we observe that the OPRO-optimized prompts transfer to other\nbenchmarks of the same domain and also deliver notable performance gain.\n2\nOPRO: LLM AS THE OPTIMIZER\nFigure 2 illustrates the overall framework of OPRO. In each optimization step, the LLM generates\ncandidate solutions to the optimization task based on the optimization problem description and\npreviously evaluated solutions in the meta-prompt. Then the new solutions are evaluated and added to\nthe meta-prompt for the subsequent optimization process. The optimization process terminates when\nthe LLM is unable to propose new solutions with better optimization scores, or a maximum number\nof optimization steps has reached. We first outline the desired features of LLMs for optimization,\nthen describe the key design choices based on these desirables.\n2.1\nDESIRABLES OF OPTIMIZATION BY LLMS\nMaking use of natural language descriptions. The main advantage of LLMs for optimization is\ntheir ability of understanding natural language, which allows people to describe their optimization\ntasks without formal specifications. For instance, in prompt optimization where the goal is to find a\nprompt that optimizes the task accuracy, the task can be described with a high-level text summary\nalong with input-output examples.\nTrading off exploration and exploitation. The exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental\nchallenge in optimization, and it is important for LLMs serving as optimizers to balance these two\ncompeting goals. This means that the LLM should be able to exploit promising areas of the search\n2Available here: http://openai.com/api/.\nThis work uses gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and\ngpt-4-0613.\n3\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nspace where good solutions are already found, while also exploring new regions of the search space\nso as to not miss potentially better solutions.\n2.2\nMETA-PROMPT DESIGN\nAs the input to the LLM that acts as the optimizer, the meta-prompt contains the following two\nessential parts.\nOptimization problem description. The first part is the text description of the optimization problem,\nincluding the objective function and solution constraints. For example, for prompt optimization,\nthe LLM can be instructed to \u201cgenerate a new instruction that achieves a higher accuracy\u201d, and we\ndenote such instructions in the meta-prompt as meta-instructions. We can also provide customized\nmeta-instructions as an informal regularization of the generated solutions, such as \u201cthe instruction\nshould be concise and generally applicable\u201d.\nOptimization trajectory. Besides understanding natural language instructions, LLMs are also\nshown to be able to recognize patterns from in-context demonstrations (Wei et al., 2023; Madaan &\nYazdanbakhsh, 2022; Mirchandani et al., 2023). Our meta-prompt makes use of this property and\ninstructs the LLM to leverage the optimization trajectory for generating new solutions. Specifically,\nthe optimization trajectory includes past solutions paired with their optimization scores, sorted in the\nascending order. Including optimization trajectory in the meta-prompt allows the LLM to identify\nsimilarities of solutions with high scores, encouraging the LLM to build upon existing good solutions\nto construct potentially better ones without the need of explicitly defining how the solution should be\nupdated.\n2.3\nSOLUTION GENERATION\nAt the solution generation step, the LLM generates new solutions with the meta-prompt as input. The\nfollowing are the key optimization challenges we address in this stage.\nOptimization stability. In the optimization process, not all solutions achieve high scores and\nmonotonically improve over prior ones. Due to the sensitivity of in-context learning to the prompt,\nLLM output can be drastically affected by low-quality solutions in the input optimization trajectory,\nespecially at the beginning when the solution space has not been adequately explored. This sometimes\nresults in optimization instability and large variance. To improve stability, we prompt the LLM to\ngenerate multiple solutions at each optimization step, allowing the LLM to simultaneously explore\nmultiple possibilities and quickly discover promising directions to move forward.\nExploration-exploitation trade-off. We tune the LLM sampling temperature to balance between\nexploration and exploitation. A lower temperature encourages the LLM to exploit the solution space\naround the previously found solutions and make small adaptations, while a high temperature allows\nthe LLM to more aggressively explore solutions that can be notably different.\n3\nMOTIVATING EXAMPLE: MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION\nWe first demonstrate the potential of LLMs in serving as optimizers for mathematical optimization.\nIn particular, we present a case study on linear regression as an example of continuous optimization,\nand on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as an example of discrete optimization. On both tasks,\nwe see LLMs properly capture the optimization directions on small-scale problems merely based on\nthe past optimization trajectory provided in the meta-prompt.\n3.1\nLINEAR REGRESSION\nIn linear regression problems, the goal is to find the linear coefficients that probabilistically best\nexplain the response from the input variables. We study the setting in which the independent\nand dependent variables X and y are both one-dimensional and an intercept b is present, so that\nthere are two one-dimensional variables w, b to optimize over. In a synthetic setting, we sample\nground truth values for one-dimensional variables wtrue and btrue, and generate 50 data points by\ny = wtruex + btrue + \u03f5, in which x ranges from 1 to 50 and \u03f5 is the standard Gaussian noise. Our\n4\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nTable 2: Linear regression by optimizer LLMs: the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the number of steps\nand the number of unique (w, b) pairs explored before reaching the global optima. Both w and b start\nfrom 5 random starting points in [10, 20]. We use temperature 1.0 for all models. We run each setting\n5 times.

In each step, we prompt an instruction-\ntuned LLM with a meta-prompt that includes the best 20 (w, b) pairs in history and their sorted\nobjective values. The meta-prompt then asks for a new (w, b) pair that further decreases the objective\nvalue. A sample meta-prompt is shown in Figure 19 of Appendix C.1. We prompt the meta-prompt 8\ntimes to generate at most 8 new (w, b) pairs in each step to improve optimization stability. Then we\nevaluate the objective value of the proposed pair and add it to history. We do black-box optimization:\nthe analytic form does not appear in the meta-prompt text. This is because the LLM can often\ncalculate the solution directly from the analytic form.\nTable 2 summarizes the results with one of the following optimizer LLMs: text-bison,\ngpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4. We study three settings of wtrue and btrue: within the starting\nregion [10, 20] \u00d7 [10, 20], \u201cnear outside\u201d (each of wtrue and btrue is outside the starting region but the\ndistance is less than 10), and \u201cfar outside\u201d (each of wtrue and btrue is outside the starting region and\nthe distance is greater than 10). We see:\n\u2022 The number of unique (w, b) pairs explored by each model is fewer than exhaustive search,\nindicating these models are able to to do black-box optimization: compare the numbers and\npropose a descent direction.\n\u2022 The text-bison and gpt-4 models outperform gpt-3.5-turbo in convergence speed:\nthey arrive at the optima with fewer steps. The gpt-4 model also outperforms in finding the\noptima with fewer explored unique points. Taking a closer look at the optimization trajectory, we\nsee gpt-4 is the best at proposing a reasonable next step from the history: for example, when\nthe history shows the objective values of (w, b) = (8, 7), (w, b) = (8, 6), and (w, b) = (8, 5)\nare decreasing, it has a highest chance to propose (w, b) = (8, 4) for evaluation.\n\u2022 The problem becomes harder for all models when the ground truth moves farther from the\nstarting region: all models need more explorations and more steps.\n3.2\nTRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP)\nNext, we consider the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (J\u00fcnger et al., 1995; Gutin & Punnen, 2006),\na classical combinatorial optimization problem with numerous algorithms proposed in literature,\nincluding heuristic algorithms and solvers (Rosenkrantz et al., 1977; Golden et al., 1980; Optimization\net al., 2020; Applegate et al., 2006; Helsgaun, 2017), and approaches based on training deep neural\nnetworks (Kool et al., 2019; Deudon et al., 2018; Chen & Tian, 2019; Nazari et al., 2018). Specifically,\ngiven a set of n nodes with their coordinates, the TSP task is to find the shortest route that traverses\nall nodes from the starting node and finally returns to the starting node.\nOur optimization process with LLMs starts from 5 randomly generated solutions, and each optimiza-\ntion step produces at most 8 new solutions. We present the meta-prompt in Figure 20 of Appendix C.1.\nWe generate the problem instances by sampling n nodes with both x and y coordinates in [\u2212100, 100].\nWe use the Gurobi solver (Optimization et al., 2020) to construct the oracle solutions and compute the\noptimality gap for all approaches, where the optimality gap is defined as the difference between the\n5\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nTable 3: Results of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with different number of nodes n, where\neach n contains 5 problems. \u201c# steps\u201d calculates the mean \u00b1 standard error of optimization steps\nfor successful runs that find the optimal solution. \u201c# successes\u201d counts the number of problems that\nOPRO results in the optimal solution.

Besides evaluating OPRO with different\nLLMs including text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, we also compare OPRO to the\nfollowing heuristics:\n\u2022 Nearest Neighbor (NN). Starting from an initial node, the solution is constructed with\nthe nearest neighbor heuristic: At each step, among the remaining nodes that are not included in\nthe current partial solution, NN selects the node with the shortest distance to the end node of the\npartial solution, and adds it as the new end node. The process finishes when all nodes have been\nadded to the solution.\n\u2022 Farthest Insertion (FI). One caveat of the nearest neighbor heuristic is that it does\nnot take the distance between the start and end node into consideration when constructing partial\nsolutions. To address this issue, FI aims to optimize the cost of inserting new nodes into the\npartial solution at each step. Define the minimal insertion cost of adding a new node k as\nc(k) = min(i,j) d(i, k) + d(k, j) \u2212 d(i, j), where i and j are adjacent nodes in the current tour,\nand d(\u00b7, \u00b7) represents the distance between two nodes. At each step, FI adds a new node that\nmaximizes the minimal insertion cost.\nWe present the results in Table 3. We randomly generate 5 problem instances for each number of\nnodes n. In addition to measuring the optimality gap, on problems where the LLM finds the optimal\nsolutions, we also show the number of optimization steps taken to reach the global optimum. First,\nwe observe that gpt-4 significantly outperforms gpt-3.5-turbo and text-bison across all\nproblem sizes. Specifically, on smaller-scale problems, gpt-4 reaches the global optimum about 4\u00d7\nfaster than other LLMs. On larger-scale problems, especially with n = 50, gpt-4 still finds solutions\nwith a comparable quality to heuristic algorithms, while both text-bison and gpt-3.5-turbo\nget stuck at local optima with up to 20\u00d7 worse optimality gaps.\nOn the other hand, the performance of OPRO degrades dramatically on problems with larger sizes.\nWhen n = 10, all LLMs find the optimal solutions for every evaluated problem; as the problem size\ngets larger, the OPRO optimality gaps increase quickly, and the farthest insertion heuristic starts to\noutperform all LLMs in the optimality gap.\nLimitations.\nWe would like to note that OPRO is designed for neither outperforming the state-\nof-the-art gradient-based optimization algorithms for continuous mathematical optimization, nor\nsurpassing the performance of specialized solvers for classical combinatorial optimization problems\nsuch as TSP. Instead, the goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are able to optimize different kinds\nof objective functions simply through prompting, and reach the global optimum for some small-\nscale problems. Our evaluation reveals several limitations of OPRO for mathematical optimization.\nSpecifically, the length limit of the LLM context window makes it hard to fit large-scale optimization\nproblem descriptions in the prompt, e.g., linear regression with high-dimensional data, and traveling\nsalesman problems with a large set of nodes to visit. In addition, the optimization landscape of some\nobjective functions are too bumpy for the LLM to propose a correct descending direction, causing the\noptimization to get stuck halfway. We further elaborate our observed failure cases in Appendix A.\n6\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nI have some texts along with their corresponding scores. The texts are arranged in ascending order\nbased on their scores, where higher scores indicate better quality.\ntext:\nLet\u2019s figure it out!\nscore:\n61\ntext:\nLet\u2019s solve the problem.\nscore:\n63\n(. . . more instructions and scores ...)\nThe following exemplars show how to apply your text: you replace <INS> in each input with your\ntext, then read the input and give an output.

We first introduce the problem setup, then illustrate\nthe meta-prompt design.\n4.1\nPROBLEM SETUP\nWe focus on prompt optimization for natural language tasks, where both the input and output are in\nthe text format. The task is represented as a dataset with training and test splits, where the training\nset is used to calculate the training accuracy as the objective value during the optimization process,\nand we compute the test accuracy on the test set after the optimization finishes. While traditional\noptimization often requires a decently large training set, our experiment shows that a small number\nor fraction of training samples (e.g., 3.5% of the training set for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), 20%\nfor Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022)) is sufficient. The objective function evaluator is an LLM\nto which the optimized prompt will be applied, and it can be the same or different from the LLM for\noptimization. We denote the LLM for objective function evaluation as the scorer LLM, and the LLM\nfor optimization as the optimizer LLM.\n7\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nThe output of the optimizer LLM is an instruction, which is concatenated to the question part of every\nexemplar and prompts the scorer LLM. We consider the following positions to insert the instruction:\n\u2022 Q_begin: the instruction is added before the original question.\n\u2022 Q_end: the instruction is added after the original question.\n\u2022 A_begin: the instruction is added to the beginning of the scorer LLM output. This is applicable\nto pretrained LLMs without instruction tuning, where the prompt is formatted as a sequence of\nQA pairs.\nWe exemplify these prompting formats in Appendix B.\n4.2\nMETA-PROMPT DESIGN\nFigure 3 shows an example of the meta-prompt for prompt optimization on GSM8K (Cobbe et al.,\n2021). More details are as follows.\nOptimization problem examples. The problem description includes a few examples taken from the\ntraining set to demonstrate the task for the generated instructions. For example, from the input-output\npair in Figure 3, we can infer this is a math word problem. The input-output pair also demonstrates\nthe position where the generated instruction will be added to, and this is essential for the optimizer\nLLM to generate instructions of the same style. In each optimization step, we add several (three for\nexample) training examples to the meta-prompt by random sampling the training set or choose the\nones the previous instructions fall short of.\nOptimization trajectory. The optimization trajectory includes instructions generated from the past\noptimization steps, along with their scores. The old instructions and scores are sorted by the score in\nascending order. The score is the training accuracy in prompt optimization. We only keep instructions\nwith the highest scores in the meta-prompt in consideration of the LLM context length limit.\nMeta-instructions. We also add meta-instructions: the instructions to the optimizer LLM that explain\nthe optimization goal and instruct the model how to use the above information. The meta-instructions\nmay also specify the desired generated instruction format for easier parsing.\n5\nPROMPT OPTIMIZATION EXPERIMENTS\nWe present the evaluation results for prompt optimization in this section. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat OPRO brings a significant performance gain across the board, with different combinations of\nLLMs as the optimizer and the scorer.\n5.1\nEVALUATION SETUP\nModels. The LLMs we use as the optimizer and the scorer are:\n\u2022 Optimizer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L (Anil et al., 2023), instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L\n(denoted PaLM 2-L-IT), text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4.\n\u2022 Scorer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L and text-bison.\nWith pre-trained PaLM 2-L as the scorer, the optimizer LLM generates A_begin instructions.\nSince text-bison has been instruction-tuned, the optimizer LLM generates Q_begin and Q_end\ninstructions when text-bison is used as the scorer.\nBenchmarks. Our primary evaluation benchmarks are GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big-Bench\nHard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022). GSM8K is a benchmark of grade school math word problems\nwith 7,473 training samples and 1,319 test samples, where chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al.,\n2022) and the zero-shot instruction \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\u201d (Kojima et al., 2022) have drastically\nimproved the performance over the standard prompting. BBH is a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench\ntasks (Srivastava et al., 2022) that covers a wide range of topics beyond arithmetic reasoning, including\nsymbolic manipulation and commonsense reasoning. Each task contains up to 250 examples in total.\n8\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nTo examine the transferability of the optimized instructions, we also evaluate the instructions op-\ntimized for GSM8K on two other mathematical reasoning datasets, i.e., MultiArith (Roy & Roth,\n2016) and AQuA (Ling et al., 2017).\nImplementation details.\nWe set the temperature to be 0 when evaluating the performance of\ngenerated instructions, in which case the scorer LLM greedily decodes. Unless otherwise specified, we\nset the default temperature to be 1.0 for optimizer LLMs to generate diverse and creative instructions.\nAt each optimization step, we prompt the optimizer LLM with the meta-prompt 8 times to generate 8\ninstructions, then we add these instructions with their training scores to the optimization trajectory\nin the meta-prompt. Our meta-prompt at each step contains the best 20 instructions so far and 3\nrandomly picked exemplars from the training set. We study the effect of different hyperparameters in\nablation studies (Section 5.3). Appendix C.2 presents the full meta-prompts for different optimizer\nLLMs.\n5.2\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe show prompt optimization curves on GSM8K and two BBH tasks in this section. The curves on\nother BBH tasks are deferred to Appendix D, and the tables containing all accuracy numbers are in\nAppendix E.\n5.2.1\nGSM8K\nFor prompt optimization, we randomly sample 3.5% examples from the GSM8K training set. The\nsame subset is used throughout optimization, so that the task accuracies computed at intermediate\noptimization steps are approximations of the training accuracy on all 7,473 training examples. This\nbalances the evaluation cost with the generalization performance. After the optimization procedure\nfinishes, we evaluate the found instructions on the entire GSM8K test set.\nFigure 1(a) in Section 1 shows prompt optimization curves with pre-trained PaLM 2-L as scorer\nand PaLM 2-L-IT as optimizer, and the initial instruction is \u201cLet\u2019s solve the problem\u201d with a\n(approximated, and same below) training accuracy of 60.5. We observe that the optimization curve\nshows an overall upward trend with several leaps throughout the optimization process, for example:\n\u2022 \u201cLet\u2019s think carefully about the problem and solve it together.\u201d at Step 2 with the training\naccuracy 63.2;\n\u2022 \u201cLet\u2019s break it down!\u201d at Step 4 with training accuracy 71.3;\n\u2022 \u201cLet\u2019s calculate our way to the solution!\u201d at Step 5 with training accuracy 73.9;\n\u2022 \u201cLet\u2019s do the math!\u201d at Step 6 with training accuracy 78.2.\nThe optimization curves also generally show a decrease of the variance among the accuracies of\ninstructions generated at each step, indicating that the optimizer LLM generates distributionally\nbetter instructions throughout the optimization.\nNext, we present the results of generating Q_begin instructions with the text-bison scorer and\nthe PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, starting from an empty instruction with a 57.1 training accuracy. The\noptimization curve in Figure 4(a) shows a similar upward trend, during which a few leaps in the\ntraining accuracy include:\n\u2022 \u201cSolve the following problems using the given information.\u201d at Step 2 with training accuracy\n59.8;\n\u2022 \u201cSolve the following problems by applying the given information and using the appropriate\nmathematical operations.\u201d at Step 3 with training accuracy 64.0;\n\u2022 \u201cLet\u2019s read the problem carefully and identify the given information. Then, we can create an\nequation and solve for the unknown variable.\u201d at Step 4 with training accuracy 67.0;\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m always down for solving a math word problem together. Just give me a moment to read\nand understand the problem. Then, I\u2019ll create an equation that models the problem, which I\u2019ll\nsolve for the unknown variable. I also may or may not use some helpful diagrams or visuals\nto understand the problem. Lastly, be sure to allow me some time to carefully check my work\nbefore submitting any responses!\u201d at Step 29 with training accuracy 70.1.\n9\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nTable 4: Test accuracies on GSM8K.

Implement these operations, keeping in\nmind any units or conditions. Round off by ensuring your\nsolution fits the context of the problem to ensure accuracy.\n62.7\nNote that although our default setting is to run OPRO for 200 steps in prompt optimization, we\nneed much fewer steps if the goal is to find some outstanding instructions. An example is that the\nFigure 1(a) experiment found \u201cLet\u2019s do the math!\u201d at Step 6 with training accuracy 78.2, almost\nmatching the \u201cTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\u201d found at the 107th step\nwith training accuracy 80.2, at a point where the optimization curve is still trending upwards. This is\nbecause a leap in our optimization curve does not always correspond to a much better instruction being\ndiscovered; instead, it can be due to a large qualitative improvement of all 8 generated instructions in\nthis step. The latter usually happens several steps after the former: after a much better instruction is\ndiscovered in one step, the meta-prompt gradually gets rid of worse instructions in the latter steps by\ngenerating instructions similar to the much-better one. The top instructions kept in the meta-prompt\ngradually improves in this procedure. At a point when the meta-prompt only triggers higher quality\ninstructions, the leap happens.\nFinally, Figure 4(b) shows that the pre-trained PaLM 2-L can also serve as the optimizer LLM and\nimprove its own prediction performance. Different from other optimizer LLMs that are instruction-\ntuned, the pre-trained PaLM 2-L performs better when the prompt is formatted in a few-shot manner.\nTherefore, we include two initial instructions to start the optimization: the empty instruction (with\na training accuracy 32.2) and \u201cThe answer is\u201d (with a training accuracy 33.3).

The generated instructions follow the same style as \u201cThe\nanswer is\u201d: most instructions are also phrases suitable as the prefix of a sentence, like \u201cHere you\ngo:\u201d (generated at Step 11 with training accuracy 61.3) and \u201cLet\u2019s do it:\u201d (generated at Step 13 with\ntraining accuracy 75.1).\nTable 4 summarizes top instructions found on GSM8K with different scorer and optimizer LLMs.\nWe observe that:\n\u2022 The styles of instructions found by different optimizer LLMs vary a lot: PaLM 2-L-IT and\ntext-bison ones are concise, while GPT ones are long and detailed.\n\u2022 Although some top instructions contain the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d phrase, most others achieve a compa-\nrable or better accuracy with different semantic meanings.\n5.2.2\nBBH\nOn BBH, the optimization starts from an empty string as the initial instruction by default. The\ninstructions are placed at A_begin when the scorer is PaLM 2-L, and at Q_begin when the scorer\nis text-bison. For each task, we utilize a subset of 20% examples for prompt optimization, and\nthe rest examples are for testing. We show experimental results on more variants of the instruction\nposition and initialization in Appendix E.\nFigure 5 visualizes the per-task accuracy difference on all 23 BBH tasks compared to the instruction\n\u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\u201d (Kojima et al., 2022) and the empty instruction, and we present the concrete\naccuracies in Table 7 of Appendix E. We show that the instructions found by OPRO outperform\n\u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\u201d on almost all tasks by a large margin: our instructions outperform by over\n5% on 19/23 tasks with the PaLM 2-L scorer, and on 15/23 tasks with the text-bison scorer.\nOur prompt optimization algorithm also improves instructions from the empty starting point by over\n5% on most tasks: 20/23 with the PaLM 2-L scorer and 15/23 with the text-bison scorer.\nSimilar to GSM8K, we observe upward trends in optimization curves on almost all BBH tasks, as\nshown in Figure 6. See Figure 23 and 24 in Appendix D for more curves on other BBH tasks.\nWe next show some examples of instructions found through the course of optimization. On the task\nruin_names, starting from the empty instruction (with 64.0 training accuracy), with the text-bison\nscorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, the following instructions are generated:\n\u2022 \u201cConsider the following when editing artist or movie names humorously:\u201d at Step 1 with training\naccuracy 72.0;\n\u2022 \u201cWhen making humorous edits of artist or movie names, you can change one or more letters or\neven create puns by adding new words that sound similar.\u201d at Step 18 with training accuracy\n80.0;\n\u2022 \u201cWe can make humorous edits of artist/movie names by changing letters to create new words\nthat are similar in sound but have different meanings. For example, The Police can be changed\nto The Polite, The Abyss can be changed to Toe Abyss, and Schindler\u2019s List can be changed to\nSchindler\u2019s Lost.\u201d at Step 38 with training accuracy 82.0.\n11\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nboolean_expressions\ncausal_judgement\ndate_understanding\ndisambiguation_qa\ndyck_languages\nformal_fallacies\ngeometric_shapes\nhyperbaton\nlogical_deduction_seven_objects\nmovie_recommendation\nmultistep_arithmetic_two\nnavigate\nobject_counting\npenguins_in_a_table\nreasoning_about_colored_objects\nruin_names\nsalient_translation_error_detection\nsnarks\nsports_understanding\ntemporal_sequences\ntracking_shuffled_objects_seven_objects\nweb_of_lies\nword_sorting\n-20\n0\n20\n40\naccuracy difference\n(a) PaLM 2-L scorer, ours minus \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\u201d\nboolean_expressions\ncausal_judgement\ndate_understanding\ndisambiguation_qa\ndyck_languages\nformal_fallacies\ngeometric_shapes\nhyperbaton\nlogical_deduction_seven_objects\nmovie_recommendation\nmultistep_arithmetic_two\nnavigate\nobject_counting\npenguins_in_a_table\nreasoning_about_colored_objects\nruin_names\nsalient_translation_error_detection\nsnarks\nsports_understanding\ntemporal_sequences\ntracking_shuffled_objects_seven_objects\nweb_of_lies\nword_sorting\n0\n20\n40\n60\naccuracy difference\n(b) PaLM 2-L scorer, ours minus empty starting point\nboolean_expressions\ncausal_judgement\ndate_understanding\ndisambiguation_qa\ndyck_languages\nformal_fallacies\ngeometric_shapes\nhyperbaton\nlogical_deduction_seven_objects\nmovie_recommendation\nmultistep_arithmetic_two\nnavigate\nobject_counting\npenguins_in_a_table\nreasoning_about_colored_objects\nruin_names\nsalient_translation_error_detection\nsnarks\nsports_understanding\ntemporal_sequences\ntracking_shuffled_objects_seven_objects\nweb_of_lies\nword_sorting\n0\n20\n40\n60\naccuracy difference\n(c) text-bison scorer, ours minus \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\u201d\nboolean_expressions\ncausal_judgement\ndate_understanding\ndisambiguation_qa\ndyck_languages\nformal_fallacies\ngeometric_shapes\nhyperbaton\nlogical_deduction_seven_objects\nmovie_recommendation\nmultistep_arithmetic_two\nnavigate\nobject_counting\npenguins_in_a_table\nreasoning_about_colored_objects\nruin_names\nsalient_translation_error_detection\nsnarks\nsports_understanding\ntemporal_sequences\ntracking_shuffled_objects_seven_objects\nweb_of_lies\nword_sorting\n0\n20\n40\naccuracy difference\n(d) text-bison scorer, ours minus empty starting point\nFigure 5: On 23 BBH tasks, the accuracy differences among instructions found by prompt opti-\nmization (with the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer), \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\u201d, and the empty string\n(optimization starting point).\nAlthough the above instructions are semantically similar, a paraphrase by the optimizer LLM offers a\nnotable accuracy improvement. We further highlight this observation in Section 5.2.3.\nBelow are some instructions generated when performing prompt optimization on temporal_sequences,\nstarting from the empty instruction (with the training accuracy of 64.0):\n\u2022 \u201cTo solve this problem, we need to first identify the time period when the person was not seen\ndoing anything else.

If it was, then that is the time period when they could have gone to that place.\u201d at Step 2\nwith training accuracy 42.0;\n\u2022 \u201cTo find the time period when a person could have gone to a place, identify the time periods\nwhen they were not seen doing anything else and the place was open. If there are multiple time\nperiods that match these criteria, then the person could have gone to the place during any of\nthese time periods.\u201d at Step 18 with training accuracy 54.0;\n\u2022 \u201cTo determine the possible time period when a person went to a place, first identify all the time\nperiods when the person was not seen doing anything else and the place was open. Then, rule\nout any time periods during which the person was seen doing something else. The remaining\ntime periods are the possible times when the person could have gone to the place.\u201d at Step 41\nwith training accuracy 72.0.\nTable 5 presents the best instructions generated on movie_recommendation, ruin_names, and tem-\nporal_sequences tasks with different combinations of the optimizer and the scorer LLMs. Again,\ndifferent optimizer LLMs produce instructions of different styles. See Appendix E for results on\nmore BBH tasks.\n5.2.3\nSEMANTICALLY SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS MAY ACHIEVE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT\nACCURACIES\nOne challenge of prompt optimization is the sensitivity of model performance to subtle changes in\nthe instruction. For example, with the PaLM 2-L scorer on the GSM8K test set, \u201cLet\u2019s think step\nby step.\u201d achieves accuracy 71.8, \u201cLet\u2019s solve the problem together.\u201d has accuracy 60.5, while the\naccuracy of \u201cLet\u2019s work together to solve this problem step by step.\u201d is only 49.4, although it is the\nsemantic combination of the two upper instructions. This behavior increases both the variance across\nsingle-step instructions and the oscillation during optimization, and motivates us to generate multiple\ninstructions at each step to improve the optimization stability.\n5.2.4\nTRANSFERABILITY OF FOUND INSTRUCTIONS\nWe assess the transferability of found prompts to different datasets of the same domain, where we\nevaluate the top instructions found for GSM8K on two more math reasoning benchmarks Multi-\nArith (Roy & Roth, 2016) and AQuA (Ling et al., 2017). Table 6 shows that our optimized prompts\nalso outperform baseline prompts with different scorer LLMs on these two benchmarks.\n5.3\nABLATION STUDIES\nWe use text-bison as the scorer and PaLM 2-L as the optimizer for all ablation studies. The\ntasks we evaluate are GSM8K (math reasoning) and BBH sports_understanding (non-math reasoning).\nMeta-prompt design. The meta-prompt design is crucial in achieving good prompt optimization\nperformance. We investigate the following core design choices:\n13\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nTable 5: Top instructions with the highest accuracies found in prompt optimization on BBH\nmovie_recommendation, ruin_names, and temporal_sequences.\nScorer\nOptimizer\nInstruction\nposition\nInstruction\nAcc\nmovie_recommendation\nPaLM 2-L\nPaLM 2-L-IT\nA_begin\nBased on your input, I have analyzed the given\nmovies in terms of genre, plot, tone, audience rating,\nyear of release, director, cast, and reviews.

We compare the following options: (1) from lowest to\nhighest (our default setting); (2) from highest to lowest; (3) random. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show\nthat the default setting achieves better final accuracies and converges faster. One hypothesis is\nthat the optimizer LLM output is affected more by the past instructions closer to the end of the\nmeta-prompt. This is consistent with the recency bias observed in Zhao et al. (2021), which\nstates that LLMs are more likely to generate tokens similar to the end of the prompt.\n\u2022 The effect of instruction scores. In terms of how to present the accuracy scores, we compare three\noptions: (1) rounding the accuracies to integers, which is equivalent to bucketizing the accuracy\nscores to 100 buckets (our default setting); (2) bucketizing the accuracies to 20 buckets; (3)\nnot showing the accuracies, only showing the instructions in the ascending order. Figures 7(c)\nand 7(d) show that the accuracy scores assists the optimizer LLM in better understanding the\nquality difference among previous instructions, and thus the optimizer LLM proposes better new\ninstructions that are similar to the best ones in the input optimization trajectory.\n\u2022 The effect of exemplars. We compare three options: (1) showing 3 exemplars from the task\n(default); (2) showing 10 exemplars from the task; (3) no exemplars. Figures 7(e) and 7(f) show\nthat presenting exemplars in the meta-prompt is critical, as it provides information on what the\ntask looks like and helps the optimizer model phrase new instructions better. However, more\nexemplars do not necessarily improve the performance, as a few exemplars are usually sufficient\nto describe the task. In addition, including more exemplars results in a longer meta-prompt\nwith a dominating exemplar part, which may distract the optimizer LLM from other important\ncomponents like the optimization trajectory.\nThe number of generated instructions per step. Computing a mini-batch of gradients reduces\nthe variance of a stochastic gradient descent procedure. Similarly, generating multiple instructions\nin each step improves the optimization stability with LLMs. On the other hand, to achieve better\nperformance with a fixed budget for the number of instructions to evaluate, the number of per-step\ninstructions should not be too large, so as to allow more optimization steps to incorporate richer\ninformation of past instructions with their accuracies. Taking both aspects into consideration, Figure 8\n15\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\naccuracy\nascending (default)\ndescending\nrandom\n(a) instruction ordering (GSM8K)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n0.0\n50.0\n100.0\naccuracy\nascending (default)\ndescending\nrandom\n(b) instruction ordering (BBH sports_understanding)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\naccuracy\n100 buckets (default)\n20 buckets\nno scores\n(c) instruction scores (GSM8K)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n0.0\n50.0\n100.0\naccuracy\n100 buckets (default)\n20 buckets\nno scores\n(d) instruction scores (BBH sports_understanding)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\naccuracy\n3 exemplars (default)\n10 exemplars\nno exemplars\n(e) # exemplars (GSM8K)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n0.0\n50.0\n100.0\naccuracy\n3 exemplars (default)\n10 exemplars\nno exemplars\n(f) # exemplars (BBH sports_understanding)\nFigure 7: Ablation studies: how each part of the meta-prompt matters.

We observe that the accuracies do not differ much with\ndifferent starting points. Interestingly, the styles of the generated instructions are also similar. For\nexample, most of the generated instructions starting from (1) and (2) contain the phrase \u201csolve this\nproblem\u201d, like \u201cLet\u2019s work together to solve this problem.\u201d in Step 4 with training accuracy 64.8 from\n17\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\naccuracy\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0 (default)\n1.5\n2.0\n(a) GSM8K\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n0.0\n50.0\n100.0\naccuracy\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0 (default)\n1.5\n2.0\n(b) BBH sports_understanding\nFigure 10: Ablation studies: temperature of the optimizer model.

We notice that the performance differs much more with different initial instructions,\nespecially at the beginning of the optimization. Specifically, starting from (1) leads to better generated\ninstructions than (2) in the first 30 steps, while the instructions optimized from both (1) and (2)\nare worse than (3) throughout. A similar observation holds when using PaLM 2-L as scorer and\ngpt-3.5-turbo as optimizer for BBH tasks, by comparing the results starting from the empty\nstring (Appendix E.2) and from \u201cLet\u2019s solve the problem.\u201d (Appendix E.3). Taking a closer look into\nthe optimization process of (2), we find that although both \u201csolve the problem\u201d and \u201cstep by step\u201d\nshow up in generated instructions at Step 5, it takes the optimizer LLM more steps to get rid of worse\ninstructions presented in the meta-prompt when starting from instructions with lower accuracies.\nTherefore, one direction for future work is to accelerate convergence from weaker starting points.\nDiversity per step. We evaluate the following temperatures of the optimizer LLM: {0.0, 0.5, 1.0\n(default), 1.5, 2.0}. Figure 10 shows the default temperature 1.0 achieves the best performance.\nSpecifically, optimizations with smaller temperatures (0.0 and 0.5) lack exploration and thus creativity,\nand the optimizer LLM often gets stuck at the same instruction for tens of steps, resulting in flat\noptimization curves. On the other hand, with larger temperatures (1.5 and 2.0), the optimizer LLM\nmore often ignores the trajectory of previous instructions presented in the meta-prompt and thus lacks\nexploitation, therefore the optimization curve does not have a steady upward trend.\nComparison with one-step instruction generation. Our current iterative procedure runs for multiple\nsteps and generates a new batch of solutions in each step. To validate the importance of leveraging\nthe optimization trajectory for generating new prompts, we compare to a baseline that generates all\ninstructions in a single step without entering into the optimization procedure. We compare these\ntwo approaches on GSM8K and BBH sports_understanding with the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer.\nFor GSM8K the scorer LLM is pre-trained PaLM 2-L and the initial instruction is \u201cLet\u2019s solve\nthe problem\u201d, and for BBH sports_understanding the scorer LLM is text-bison and the initial\ninstruction is the empty string. The baseline generates 50 instructions in a single step, thus its\nmeta-prompt only includes task exemplars, the initial instruction with its accuracy, and the same\nmeta-instructions as our full meta-prompt for performing optimization. All the other hyperparameters\nremain the same.\nOur results show that this one-step instruction generation performs much worse than our optimization\napproach. Specifically: (1) On GSM8K, the best instruction among all 50 is still \u201cLet\u2019s solve the\nproblem\u201d, with a 64.4 training accuracy and a 60.8 test accuracy. On the other hand, our approach\n(corresponding to Figure 1(a) in the main paper) found \u201cLet\u2019s do the math!\u201d with a 78.2 training\naccuracy and a 76.3 test accuracy at the 5th step by generating 8 instructions at each step.

The exemplars are splitted to 1/3 training, 1/3 validation and 1/3\ntest. We compute the validation accuracy every 3 steps. The training/validation dots are the average\ntraining/validation accuracies across 3 optimization repetitions, respectively, and the shaded regions\nrepresent standard deviations.\nSimilarly, on BBH sports_understanding, the best instruction among all 50 achieved a 84.0 training\naccuracy and 80.0 test accuracy. This is again worse than the instruction found by our approach at\nStep 4, which achieved a 88.0 training accuracy and a 84.5 test accuracy.\n5.4\nOVERFITTING ANALYSIS IN PROMPT OPTIMIZATION\nFor simplicity, we do not set aside a validation set in our default setting of prompt optimization. We\nmade this decision based on the experiments when a validation set is present.\nOverfitting may result in training accuracy being much higher than the validation/test accuracy. It\nis difficult to avoid overfitting, but overfitting is less harmful when each candidate solution (natural\nlanguage instruction in the prompt optimization context) overfits to a similar extent. In this case, a\nhigher training accuracy solution still achieves a higher validation/test accuracy, and one can adopt\nsolutions with the highest training accuracies as the final result. Figure 11 shows this is the case for\nOPRO in prompt optimization: when setting aside a validation set with the same size as the training\nset, the validation accuracy curves trend up and down alongside the training curves in both prompt\noptimization settings.\nOf course, overfitting still occurs in the instructions found by our prompt optimization: in Table 7\nand 10, our training accuracies are often 5%-20% higher than our test accuracies, despite that our test\nand overall accuracies are still mostly higher than human-written counterparts. Setting aside a larger\ntraining set and optimizing for fewer steps (early stopping) may help reduce overfitting.\n5.5\nCOMPARISON WITH EVOPROMPT\nSome concurrent works on prompt optimization propose meta-prompts that explicitly ask the LLM to\nperform mutation and crossovers of existing prompts (Fernando et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023). In our\nevaluation, we compare our approach to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE)\nversions of EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2023). Specifically, in the GA meta-prompt, given two prompts,\nthe meta-prompt instructs the LLM to cross over the two prompts and generates a new one, then\nmutates the newly generated prompt to produce the final prompt. DE extends the GA meta-prompt\nto include more detailed instructions, e.g., asking the LLM to identify different parts between the\ntwo given prompts before performing the mutation. This is in contrast with OPRO, which leverages\nthe optimization trajectory including multiple past prompts, instead of only 2 previous prompts.\nMeanwhile, OPRO also provides the LLM with richer information to facilitate the understanding of\nthe optimization problem, including exemplars and task accuracies of different prompts.\nFigure 12 presents the results on GSM8K and BBH sports_understanding benchmarks, where we use\ngpt-3.5-turbo as the optimizer. On GSM8K, the initial instructions of all approaches are \u201cLet\u2019s\n19\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\n0\n50\n100\n150\n# steps\n20\n50\n80\naccuracy\nOPRO\nEvoPrompt (GA)\nEvoPrompt (DE)\n(a) GSM8K, PaLM 2-L scorer, A_begin\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n# steps\n50\n90\naccuracy\nOPRO\nEvoPrompt (GA)\nEvoPrompt (DE)\n(b) BBH sports_understanding, text-bison\nscorer, Q_begin\nFigure 12: Comparison with EvoPrompt in prompt optimization.

All optimizations\nin (a) use the pre-trained PaLM 2-L scorer and start from two simple instructions \u201cLet\u2019s solve the\nproblem.\u201d and \u201cHere is the answer.\u201d; all optimizations in (b) use the text-bison scorer and start\nfrom two richer (task-specific) instructions \u201cSolve the sports understanding problem.\u201d and \u201cGive\nme the answer to sports understanding.\u201d. The dots are the average values across 3 optimization\nrepetitions, and the shaded regions represent standard deviations. We use temperature 1.0 for OPRO\nand temperature 0.5 for EvoPrompt, same as the default settings in respective works.\nsolve the problem.\u201d and \u201cHere is the answer.\u201d, which are simple and generic. Again, we observe that\nOPRO performance steadily improves with more optimization steps. On the other hand, both versions\nof EvoPrompt even degrade the performance on GSM8K. The main reason is because EvoPrompt\ndoes not utilize exemplars for prompt optimization, thus it lacks the understanding of the task to\noptimize for. In this way, EvoPrompt relies on good-quality and task-specific initial prompts to\noptimize from.\nGiven this observation, we provide more task-specific initial instructions for experiments on BBH\nsports_understanding, which are \u201cSolve the sports understanding problem.\u201d and \u201cGive me the answer\nto sports understanding.\u201d In this case, EvoPrompt (DE) is able to find better prompts than the\ninitial ones, but the optimization curve is less stable than OPRO. This indicates that leveraging the\noptimization trajectory helps the LLM to identify promising directions to improve existing prompts.\n6\nRELATED WORK\nPrompt optimization. Prior works have developed soft prompt-tuning methods that optimize the\nprompt represented as task-specific continuous vectors (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Liu et al.,\n2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021), as well as performing discrete prompt optimization by gradient-guided\nsearch (Shin et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023d) and reinforcement\nlearning (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). These approaches become inapplicable when there is\nonly API access to the LLM. Other works designed edit-based approaches for gradient-free prompt\noptimization (Xu et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2022), where the editing can be done with human-\ndefined operations (e.g., swapping two phrases) (Prasad et al., 2022) or language models (e.g., back\ntranslation) (Xu et al., 2022). Some recent works investigate LLMs for prompt optimization (Zhou\net al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). Specifically, APE (Zhou et al., 2022b) first uses\nthe LLM to generate initial instructions. Afterwards, APE selects top instructions with the highest\naccuracies, then prompts the LLM with each individual instruction to generate a semantically similar\nvariant of the initial instruction. APO (Pryzant et al., 2023) in each step instructs the LLM to produce\ntext feedback on how to update an old instruction. Different from edit-based approaches, the optimizer\n20\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nLLM in our work directly generates new instructions at each optimization step, and the optimizer\nLLM is merely asked to improve the task accuracy without being required to imitate past instructions.\nCompared to Zhou et al. (2022b) and Pryzant et al. (2023), our optimization process incorporates\nthe past generated instructions with their scores in the meta-prompt, enabling the optimizer LLM to\ndiscover common patterns of high-quality instructions.\nPrompting with natural language feedback. A recent line of work investigates approaches to\nimprove the LLM performance by prompting with natural language feedback to revise the model\noutput, which has shown effectiveness in reducing harmful LLM outputs (Bai et al., 2022; Ganguli\net al., 2023), improving reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) and code generation\nperformance (Chen et al., 2023e; Olausson et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b),\ndialogue applications (Nair et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023), and so on (Kim et al.,\n2023; Wang et al., 2023). Specifically, Yuan et al. (2023) develops a human-in-the-loop framework\nfor deriving system-level feedback from a collection of instance-level feedback, which is then used\nfor refining data. In our work, the optimizer LLM utilizes the optimization trajectory in the prompt,\nwhich implicitly requires the LLM to summarize the common characteristics among solutions with\nsimilar scores. We consider incorporating explicit natural language feedback on generated solutions\nfor later optimization steps as future work.\nTuning language models for optimization. Some previous works tune or prompt language models\nto behave as mutation and crossover operators in evolutionary algorithms. Meyerson et al. (2023)\nutilizes language models with few-shot exemplars to propose evolutionary cross-overs on tasks such\nas image and code generation. In Lehman et al. (2022), the large language model trained on code diff\ngeneration is used as the mutation operator, and they further design a fine-tuning method to improve\nperformance in the Sodarace domain for robot simulation. EvoPrompting (Chen et al., 2023a) uses\nlarge language models to evolve neural network architectures, where they combine evolutionary\nsearch with soft prompt tuning. With respect to taking the trajectory as the input for optimization,\nOptFormer (Chen et al., 2022) trains a transformer model on large collections of hyperparameter\noptimization data. On the other hand, our work performs optimization solely by prompting without\nadditional training.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe embark on employing LLMs as optimizers, where the LLM progressively generates new solutions\nto optimize an objective function. We first motivate OPRO with linear regression and traveling\nsalesman problems, then proceed to prompt optimization as a concrete application. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that LLMs have the capacity of gradually improving the generated solutions based on\nthe past optimization trajectory. Interestingly, on small-scale traveling salesman problems, OPRO\nperforms on par with some hand-crafted heuristic algorithms. For prompt optimization, optimized\nprompts outperform human-designed prompts on GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard by a significant\nmargin, sometimes over 50%.\nA number of unresolved questions are open for future research on LLMs for optimization. In general,\nhow to reduce the sensitivity to initialization and better balance exploitation with exploration remains\na challenge. Specifically, for prompt optimization, one limitation of our current implementation is\nthat the optimizer LLM does not effectively utilize error cases in the training set to infer promising\ndirections to improve the generated instructions. In our experiments, we tried including error cases in\nthe meta-prompt rather than randomly sampling from the training set at each optimization step, but the\nresults are similar, indicating that the error cases alone are not informative enough for the optimizer\nLLM to grasp the cause of the wrong prediction. Another limitation is that prompt optimization\nrequires a training set to compute the accuracy that guides the optimization process. Currently the\ntraining set at least contains tens of samples, so that the optimized prompt does not severely overfit\nto the training samples. A promising direction is to incorporate richer feedback about the error\ncases besides the aggregated accuracy, and summarize the key features that distinguish between\nhigh-quality and low-quality generated prompts in the optimization trajectory. Such information may\ninform the optimizer LLM of how to more efficiently improve over the past generated instructions,\nand potentially further reduce the example set size needed for prompt optimization.\n21\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Daiyi Peng, Jerry Wei, Shuo Chen, Tim Rockt\u00e4schel, Chrisantha Fernando, Dylan Banarse,\nHenryk Michalewski, and Simon Osindero for their valuable feedback, and thank several anonymous\nreviewers for helpful comments.\nREFERENCES\nShun-ichi Amari.

These limitations include:\n\u2022 Hallucinating the values that need to come from math calculation: The optimizer LLMs\noften output contents like \u201cthe function value at (5, 3) is 15\u201d despite that the true value is not 15.\nThe model will get it right if external tools that can reliably calculate the value are triggered.\nWhen and how to trigger such tool use cases remains an interesting topic (see e.g., (Schick et al.,\n2023; Cai et al., 2023)).\n\u2022 Generating solutions already appeared in context even if we tell it to \"Give me a new (w, b)\npair that is different from all pairs above\": the optimizer LLMs do not 100% reliably follow\nthis instruction even if its own outputs often include sentences like \u201cI will provide a new pair\nthat is different\u201d, making the output self-contradictory. The output is almost guaranteed to be\ndifferent from in-context old solutions when the model output contains a comparison of the new\npair and all old pairs, though. Thus (implicitly) triggering such behaviors may be a solution.\nHow to implement this feature without harming the instruction following performance of other\nparts remains an interesting topic to study.\n\u2022 In black-box math optimization, getting stuck at a point that is neither global nor local\noptimal: This often occurs in two linear regression cases: (a) The in-context exemplars all share\nthe same w or b that is different from wtrue or btrue. This case is more likely to be avoided when\na larger number of past solutions are included in the meta-prompt; (b) one or several of the best\nprevious solutions in the meta-prompt have ws and bs in quantitatively opposite directions from\nthe global optima wtrue and btrue: for example, the ws are all smaller than wtrue while the bs are\nall larger than btrue. Since the optimizer model often proposes to only increase w or decrease b\nwhen the past solutions in meta-prompt share w or b, the optimization will get stuck if either\nincreasing w or decreasing b would increase the objective value. This issue is mitigated by\nsampling multiple new solutions (thus more exploration) at each step.\n\u2022 Hard to navigate a bumpy loss landscape: Like other optimizers, it is harder for the optimizer\nLLM to optimize black-box functions when the loss landscape gets more complicated. For\nexample, when minimizing the Rosenbrock function f(x, y) = (a\u2212x)2+b(y\u2212x2)2 with a = 20\n(whose global optimal point is x = 20, y = 400) with 5 starting points in [10, 20] \u00d7 [10, 20],\nthe optimization often gets stuck at around (0, 0). This is because the optimizer LLM sees a\ndecrease of objective value when it drastically decreases both x and y to 0. Then starting from\n(0, 0), the optimizer LLM is hard to further navigate x and y along the narrow valley in the loss\nlandscape towards (20, 400) (Figure 13).\nx\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\ny\n0\n100 200 300 400\nf(x, y)\n50000\n100000\n150000\nFigure 13: A visualization of the landscape of the Rosenbrock function f(x, y) = (a\u2212x)2+b(y\u2212x2)2\nwith a = 20 and b = 1. The global optima is at x = 20, y = 400 with function value 0. The function\nvalue at x = 0, y = 0 is 400. The landscape has a narrow valley between (0, 0) and (20, 400).\n26\nLarge Language Models as Optimizers\nB\nPROMPTING FORMATS FOR SCORER LLM\nFigure 14, 15, and 16 show examples of the Q_begin, Q_end, and A_begin prompting formats when\nthe \u201cQA\u201d pattern is present.

The expression\nmust evaluate to a single True or False value. The order of precedence of the logical operators is as follows: NOT, AND,\nOR, XOR, IMP. Parentheses can be used to group subexpressions and to control the order of evaluation.\ncausal_judgement\nWhen considering questions about causation, a typical person would consider the following factors: whether the action\nor event was a necessary condition for the outcome to occur, a sufficient condition, a proximate cause, or a foreseeable\ncause.\ndate_understanding\nTo find the date X time ago from today, first find today\u2019s date. Then subtract X time from today\u2019s date. If the current\ndate is the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the last day of the previous month. If the current date is not\nthe last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the same day of the previous month. For example, if today is\nMarch 31, 2023, then the date a month ago is February 28, 2023.

The line segments can be straight or curved. The first\nand last line segments are connected. The line segments do not intersect each other except at their endpoints. A closed\npolygon can be described by an SVG path element, which starts at a given point, goes to one or more additional points,\nand then ends at the starting point. The path element can consist of straight line segments, curved segments, or a\nmixture of both.\nhyperbaton\nThe correct adjective order in English is opinion, size, shape, age, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more\nthan one adjective of the same type, they are usually placed in order of importance.

Despite these successes, two main challenges\nremain in developing LLMs: (i) high computational cost, and (ii) fair and objective\nevaluations. In this paper, we report a solution to significantly reduce LLM training\ncost through a growth strategy. We demonstrate that a 101B-parameter LLM with\n0.31T tokens can be trained with a budget of 100K US dollars. Inspired by IQ\ntests, we also consolidate an additional range of evaluations on top of existing eval-\nuations that focus on knowledge-oriented abilities. These IQ evaluations include\nsymbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference. Such\nevaluations minimize the potential impact of memorization. Experimental results\nshow that our model, named FLM-101B, trained with a budget of $100K, achieves\nperformance comparable to powerful and well-known models, e.g., GPT-3 and\nGLM-130B, especially on the additional range of IQ evaluations. The checkpoint\nof FLM-101B is released at https://huggingface.co/CofeAI/FLM-101B.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great successes in a wide range of tasks, par-\nticularly in language processing [65; 64; 11; 30] and multimodal tasks [82; 33]. Throughout their\ndevelopment, many model architectures have been proposed and evaluated, including decoder-\nonly structures (e.g., the GPT series [40; 41; 3] and the LLAMA series [58; 59]), encoder-only\nstructures (e.g., BERT [10]), and encoder-decoder structures (e.g., T5 [44]), along with their vari-\nants [29; 21; 55; 45]. Regardless of the differences in model architectures, all LLMs face the same\nchallenge of high training cost. There is also a current trend suggesting using larger amounts of\ntraining data. For example, the LLAMA-1 [58] models use 1-1.4 T tokens for training, while\nLLAMA-2 [59] series use 2T tokens. A primary emphasis in LLM research hence is to find effective\nsolutions to reduce training costs.\nIn this paper, we present our solutions to train an LLM at the 100B-parameter scale using a growth\nstrategy inspired by our previous research [78]. \u201cGrowth\u201d means that the number of parameters is not\nfixed, but expands from small to large along the training progresses. Figure 1 illustrates three typical\nscenarios for growth strategies. As the FLOPs of LLMs are approximately proportional to their\n*Corresponding author.

Figure 1(a) serves as a reference for the cost with a constant number of parameters (y-axis)\nw.r.t. the number of tokens (x-axis). Figure 1(b) illustrates a straightforward linear growth strategy,\nleading to a cost-saving of exactly 50%; Figure 1(c) showcases a modest growth strategy that reduces\nthe cost by less than 50%; in contrast, Figure 1(d) represents an aggressive growth strategy, which\nreduces the cost by more than 50%. This analysis informs our decision to employ the aggressive\ngrowth strategy for maximal computational savings. In our model training, we achieve aggressive\ngrowth with an enhanced growth strategy originated in our previous work MSG [78], a strategy that\nachieves strict function-preserving when growing.\nWith a fixed $100K budget, we focus on 100B+ parameters. Although the Chinchilla laws [19]\nsuggest that training a smaller model with more data may potentially result in higher scores on some\nbenchmarks due to more sufficient training, we believe that verifying the feasibility of a growth\nstrategy [15; 51; 6; 78] would be a new direction and beneficial to the community of LLM as well.\nThis is because (i) larger models have higher upper bounds for capabilities that may not be reached\nby scaling only the training data [69], and (ii) data can be linearly scaled up with the budget, while a\ngrowth strategy has the potential for saving cost regardless of the amount of available data, if it turns\nout to be feasible. Existing studies such as [19] have not extensively investigated this area because\nthey only consider the scenarios where model sizes are fixed through training.\nAnother critical challenge in LLM research is evaluation. Existing mainstream evaluations can be\nbroadly grouped into two categories: knowledge evaluation (i.e., MMLU [17] and C-Eval [20]), and\nNLP tasks evaluation. Such evaluations may not fully reflect the model capability due to potential\ndata leakage if some of the evaluation datasets were also used in model training. In addition, it\nis also difficult to distinguish whether the models remember a piece of knowledge or possess the\ncapacity for reasoning and/or inference. Borrowing some ideas from Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests\n(i.e., Perceptual Reasoning and Working Memory [67]), we consolidate another range of evaluations\non LLMs, including symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference\nevaluations. Symbolic mapping [71] evaluation tests the capability of LLMs in learning to use (less\nmeaningful) symbols instead of (more meaningful) category labels for some forms of classification\ntasks. Rule understanding evaluation is to test the capability of understanding some given rules, and\nthen to perform corresponding actions. Pattern mining (involving both induction and deduction), is\noften used in various levels of competition. It tests the pattern-finding capability (e.g., repetition of\ncertain parts of a given input). Last but not least, anti-interference is an ability to recognize core\n2\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n2\nDESIGN OVERVIEW OF FLM-101B\ninformation from noisy input [5; 84]. We believe the evaluations inspired by IQ tests are less likely to\nbe affected by data leakage or memorization, hence providing another dimension for fair, objective,\nand reliable evaluations of LLMs.\nTo summarize, the paper has made the following contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first attempt to use a growth strategy to train an LLM with 100B+ parameters from\nscratch. Simultaneously, it is probably the lowest-cost model with 100B+ parameters, costing only\n100,000 US dollars. Second, we address several instability issues via promising approaches for\nhyperparameter search, function-preserving growth, and improvements based on our FreeLM [25].\nOur methodology holds potential benefits for the broader research community. Third, we conduct\nextensive evaluations, including both the commonly used knowledge-oriented benchmarks and the\nnew range of evaluations inspired by IQ tests. Experimental results show that, despite its low training\ncost, FLM-101B is competitive and robust. Lastly, we release the model checkpoints, code, related\ntools, et al. to promote research on bilingual Chinese and English LLMs at the scale of 100B+.\n2\nDesign Overview of FLM-101B\nIn this section, we provide an outline of FLM-101B, detailing its architecture, pre-training methods,\nand configuration specifics.\n2.1\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of an LLM significantly impacts its capabilities. Current researches [80; 3] under-\nscore the high costs associated with experimenting on diverse architectures. Hence, it is more suitable\nto select an architecture with great potential for cost effectiveness and model capability.\nBackbone. Among the many existing model architectures, we adopt FreeLM [25] as the backbone for\nour models, with modifications. FreeLM is based on GPT [41], a transformer-like architecture with a\ndecoder-only configuration known for its exceptional performance. Different from GPT, FreeLM\nfeatures two pre-training objectives: the language objective and the teacher objective (Section\n2.2). We preserve the GPT-style transformer block designs, including the Pre-LayerNorm and the\nadditional LayerNorm after the last transformer layer. We employ the tokenizer derived from GPT-4,\ncharacterized by a vocabulary size of 100, 256.\nIntegration of xPos. To enhance long sequence modeling, we integrate the Extrapolatable Position\nEmbedding (xPos) [56] in FLM-101B. This innovation draws inspiration from the principles of RoPE\n[54], which aims to improve the length extrapolation ability. By introducing an exponential decay\ninto the rotation matrix, xPos strives to rectify this hurdle. To the best of our knowledge, FLM-101B\nis the largest model to date that incorporates the xPos technology.\nModel Sizes. Benefiting from the proposed growth strategy, the FLM series produces three models\nwith 16B, 51B, and 101B (i.e., FLM-101B) parameters in a single training. The training process\nis carried out in a sequential manner, starting from a smaller model (i.e., 16B) and progressively\ngrowing to larger ones (i.e., 51B and 101B).\n2.2\nPre-Training Setup\nFLM-101B. By design, FLM-101B is an English-Chinese bilingual model pre-trained with causal\nlanguage modeling. It mixes English and Chinese corpora at a ratio of approximately 53.5% :\n46.5% for language modeling. Inspired by the finding that instruction data can augment LLMs\u2019\ncomprehension capabilities [37], we integrate multi-task instructionally prompted data: OIG (Open\nInstruction Generalist) 1 and COIG (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist) 2, in the pre-training stage.\neFLM-16B. To evaluate the effect of using domain-specific knowledge data (Section 4.2), we apply\nthe FreeLM teacher signals [25] to enhance FLM. Due to computational cost, we incorporate the\nteacher signals only in the smallest 16B model. This knowledge-enhanced FLM-16B is named\neFLM-16B.\n1https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/OIG\n2https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/COIG\n3\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n2\nDESIGN OVERVIEW OF FLM-101B\nTable 1: Partial configurations for different growth stages.\nParams\nLearning\nWarmup\nBatch Tokens\nTime\nTokens\n(billion)\nRate\n(samples)\n(million)\n(day)\n(billion)\n16\n4e \u2212 4\n4,608,000\n4.72\n9.63\n245.37\n51\n3.4e \u2212 4\n230,400\n4.72\n5.37\n39.64\n101\n2e \u2212 4\n230,400\n4.31\n6.54\n26.54\nThe original FreeLM incorporates two training objectives: language modeling objective guided by\nlanguage signals and binary classification objective guided by teacher signals. In FLM-101B, we\nunify the two objectives by using a masking strategy and two specialized tokens. These tokens\nfacilitate the transformation of the binary classification objective into the unified language modeling\nformat. The unified training objective leads to training stability when the model becomes much larger\nin scale. Hence, for eFLM-16B, we transform this binary classification into the format of causal\nlanguage modeling. Specifically, we employ two emojis: \ud83d\ude08 (U+1F621) and \ud83d\ude21 (U+1F608) 3, from\nthe vocabulary to replace the original binary labels of 1 and 0. We apply zero-masking to the loss for\ntokens in the propositions and predict one of these two special tokens at the end of each proposition.\nBy this method, we unify the teacher objective and language modeling. Moreover, we discard the\noriginal Iterative Training approach [25] and completely mix the samples from both signals in every\nbatch. This strategy can enhance the consistency of data sampling distribution as well as improve\ntraining stability.\n2.3\nGrowth Strategy\nThe essence of the low cost in scaling FLM-101B up is the growth strategy in model training.\nSpecifically, we train three models, with 16B, 51B, and 101B parameters respectively, in a sequential\nmanner. Each model inherits knowledge from its predecessor. This is contrary to the common practice\nthat the models of different sizes are trained independently [58; 59].\nFunction-preserving Growth. Function preservation means that before and after growth, the models\nyield consistent outputs given the same arbitrary inputs. This property has proven beneficial for\nboth knowledge inheritance [8; 6; 51] and training stability [78]. The growth operators used in\nFLM-101B training originate from [78], with improvement. Specifically, to adapt these operators to\nthe multi-node 3D parallel framework, we implement them by extending the model structures offline\nand reloading the checkpoint when the next stage starts.\nSchedules and Cost-Effectiveness. Model growth scheduling is a trade-off between the pros and cons\ninherent to models of different sizes [78]: a smaller model is faster in computing each training step,\nenabling more rapid consumption of training data for broader commonsense knowledge; conversely,\na larger model is better in the reduction of loss per step, indicating a deeper understanding of the\nnuanced linguistic patterns. We train the 16B model with 245.37B tokens, the 51B model with 39.64B\ntokens, and the 101B model with 26.54B tokens. The billion tokens per day of different sizes are\nlisted in Table 1. Under this growth schedule, the total time cost for our 101B model is 21.54 days,\nwhich is 72% time-saving (or a 3.56x speedup) compared to training a 101B model from scratch\n(76.74 days). This is consistent with our motivations depicted in Figure 1.\n2.4\nThe Parallelism Setup and Model Configurations\nFLM-101B is trained on a cluster of 24 DGX-A800 GPU (8\u00d780G) servers. Following the growth\nstrategy, we sequentially complete the model training for sizes 16B, 51B, and 101B on this cluster.\nThe Parallel Strategies. Data parallelism [60] and tensor model parallelism [52] have become the\nstandard approaches for training models at the billion scale. Nevertheless, an excessive amount of\ntensor parallelism may escalate GPU communication overheads, hampering training efficiency. To\ntackle this problem, we integrate pipeline model parallelism [35] and employ a 3D parallel strategy\nfor optimal throughput. Moreover, by employing sequence parallelism [24], we slice the inputs to the\n3https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode\n4\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n3\nTRAINING STABILITY OF FLM-101B\nTable 2: Parallel strategies and throughput for different growth stages.

We also utilize the\nMegetron-LM 4 implementation of the distributed optimizer [46] to further reduce the GPU memory\nconsumption, which is a technique that evenly distributes the optimizer states across data parallel\nranks.\nTable 2 shows the parallelism configurations and training throughput in each stage of FLM-101B\ntraining under our growth strategy. In different stages, we configure different Tensor Parallel \u00d7\nPipeline Parallel sizes to achieve higher throughput. The single-GPU throughput for all three\ntraining stages consistently exceeds 160 teraFLOPs/sec with a utilization rate of at least 51.3%. For\ncomparison, GLM-130B achieves 135 teraFLOPs/sec [80] with a 42.27% utilization rate. We can\nalso find that FLM-101B has a higher FLOP utilization rate than Megatron-LM [24] under a similar\nmodel size.\nFLM-101B Configurations. The FLM-101B model is structured with a hidden state dimension of\n10, 240, a layer number of 80, a context window of 2,048 tokens, 80 attention heads, and a vocabulary\nsize of 100, 256. FLM-101B uses the AdamW optimizer [31] with \u03b21 = 0.9 and \u03b22 = 0.95. A cosine\nlearning rate schedule is employed, leading to a final learning rate of 6e \u2212 6. We use a weight decay\nof 0.1 and gradient clipping of 1.0.\nTable 1 presents part of the hyperparameters used in different growth stages. In each growth stage,\nwe approximately inherit the previous learning rate and adhere to the same schedule. The learning\nrate at the beginning of each stage is reported in the table. In the 16B stage, 4,608k samples are used\nfor learning rate warmup, while in later growth stages, we use fewer samples of 230.4k. Note that we\ndo not apply batch size warmup because we address the stability issue in a different manner, detailed\nin Section 3.\nThe training duration and token consumption for each stage are also outlined in Table 1. In total,\nFLM-101B training is accomplished within 22 days using 311.54B tokens.\n3\nTraining Stability of FLM-101B\nModels beyond 100B parameters [49; 80] usually suffer from a bunch of notorious stability issues\nincluding loss divergence, gradient explosion, and numerical overflow/underflow. This not only\ninflates the cost of searching for feasible hyperparameters like optimal learning rates, but also\nintensifies ongoing maintenance during training, such as babysitting, issue resolution, data adjustment,\nand rebooting. Moreover, this makes the budget of the whole project unpredictable. We have\nundertaken the following efforts to mitigate these issues.\nLoss Prediction. The Tensor Programs theories [75; 28] unveil the universal relations across the\ntraining dynamics of a series of models with the model width tending to infinite. For certain classes\nof hyperparameters, this results in a parameterized mapping for their optimal value between a small\nmodel and its larger counterparts, which is termed \u00b5P [76]. Two important insights are:\n\u2022 The wider, the better: theoretically, under \u00b5P transfer, a wider model will always yield lower\nloss than its narrower counterparts when exposed to identical data [76]. As a direct corollary,\nif a narrow model converges, its wider counterparts will always converge.\n4https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM\n5\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n4\nBENCHMARK EVALUATION\n16B Stage\n51B Stage\n101B Stage\nProcessed Tokens (Billions)\nTraining Loss\nFigure 2: Training loss for FLM-101B models.\n\u2022 Loss prediction: the loss value of a large model is predictable using the loss of its smaller\ncounterparts, as claimed in GPT-4 technical report [36]. For the first time in the open-source\nworld, \u00b5Scaling [77] provides evidence that loss prediction can be achieved by combining\n\u00b5P [76] and (a modified) scaling law [23; 18; 19].\nBased on these findings, our method to solve training stability is as follows: we first determine\nthe data distribution before the FLM-16B training starts. Next, we perform a grid search on three\nhyperparameters including the learning rate, initialization standard deviation, and the softmax tem-\nperature in the output layer. This grid search is performed by running a proxy model (less than\n100M) with a hidden state dimension (\u201cmodel width\u201d) of 256 and a head number of 2. All the other\nstructural hyperparameters and training data of the proxy model are identical to those of FLM-16B.\nA single run of grid search takes 24.6 hours with data parallelism on 6 nodes, which is equivalent\nto 6 hours per run given our 24-node infrastructure. Finally, We find a group of well-performing\nhyperparameters: learning rate = 4e \u2212 4, standard deviation = 1.6e \u2212 2, and softmax temperature =\n2.0, through this grid search. Transferring these hyperparameters to the 16B model via \u00b5P [76] led to\na seamless training experience devoid of instabilities. Combining with MSG [78], we also witness no\npost-growth divergence in FLM-51B and FLM-101B.\nThe full training loss curve is presented in Figure 2. The first stage (16B) stably goes through 246B\ntokens. Immediately afterwards, FLM grows from 16B to 51B. As expected, the training is stable.\nMore importantly, we observe that the loss curve becomes steeper. It matches the intuition that a\nlarger model is better in loss reduction per step. Subsequently, FLM grows to 101B. Although the\ntraining data for the 51B stage are only 40B tokens, the 101B training remains stable, and the loss\ncurve becomes slightly steeper again. This loss curve proves the effectiveness of the growth strategy.\nOur implementations of \u00b5P are largely consistent with those in \u00b5Scaling [77], with modifications to\nhandle the rotary embedding. Thus, the intermediate loss ranges for FLM-16B are also predictable\nwith the results from multiple proxy widths at the same steps.\nMixed Precision with Bfloat16. We apply mixed-precision training to save run-time memory and\nreduce time costs. Specifically, we choose Bfloat16 instead of FP16 due to its superior precision for\nvalues approaching zero, making it more suitable for \u00b5P. As a result, we do not encounter the FP16\nunderflow issue reported by [76]. To our knowledge, the FLM models are currently the largest ones\nsuccessfully trained with mixed precision + \u00b5P. Moreover, Bfloat16 negates the need for loss scale\nadjustments, making our training procedure more promising and reproducible.\n4\nBenchmark Evaluation\nMany existing benchmarks (e.g., Open LLM) focus on assessing the knowledgeability of LLMs. In\nthis section, we discuss the results of FLM on these benchmarks. We argue that knowledge alone\nmight not comprehensively reflect LLM\u2019s capability (see Section 4.2 for more details). Thus, in\naddition to the common benchmark evaluation, we borrow the concept of IQ tests and evaluate LLMs\nwith some specific tasks in Section 5.\nCost Estimation Method. Due to the considerable computational expense of LLMs, we also\nemphasize their associated costs in our experimental results. However, it is hard to directly compare\n6\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n4\nBENCHMARK EVALUATION\nthe actual cost of LLMs due to their different infrastructures, and the different costs incurred on\ndifferent hardware. To objectively compare training costs, we use the number of floating-point\noperations for training as the cost estimation index, which can be estimated from the model\u2019s\nhyperparameters, configuration, and training data [35]. Since many models do not release the\ncomplete training configuration (e.g., GPT-3, LLAMA series), we estimate FLOPs within a range5.\nFor monolingual LLMs, e.g., GPT-3, the cost from monolingual data is equal to the total cost. The\ncomputational cost of GPT-3 is calculated as 376.41 (\u00b153.77) zettaFLOPs, and LLAMA-2 (13B)\nas 210.37 (\u00b128.77) zettaFLOPs. Because the cost is linear to both model parameters and training\ndata [19], we could calculate the cost of the remaining LLAMA models easily. For bilingual or\nmultilingual models, it is necessary to estimate based on the amount of data in the corresponding\nlanguage. The total cost of GLM-130B is 421.60 zettaFLOPs. We know that the data ratio of English\nand Chinese is 1:1. Hence, the cost of GLM-130B for English is 210.80 zettaFLOPs, and the same\nfor Chinese. The data ratio of FLM-101B is 53.5% : 46.5% for English and Chinese. The total cost\nof FLM-101B is 52.76 zettaFLOPs. According to the data ratio, the cost for English and Chinese is\n28.22 zettaFLOPs and 24.54 zettaFLOPs, respectively.\n4.1\nOpen LLM Evaluation\nOpen LLM is an open-source project 6. Its target is to track and evaluate the open-sourced LLMs and\nchatbots. Open LLM contains four tasks: ARC-Challenge (ARC for short), HellaSwag, MMLU, and\nTruthfulQA. The Open LLM Leaderboard applies the average score of these tasks as a metric.\nARC: The ARC [9] dataset is proposed for graduate-school level closed book science question-\nanswering tasks. Most problems in ARC are solvable with life experiences and Wikipedia searches.\nThus, a model is expected to perform better if exposed to more commonsense and factual data.\nHellaSwag: This is a sentence completion task emphasizing on commonsense inference [79]. We\nobserve that the increase in HellaSwag performance is highly correlated with the reduction of training\nloss. This is intuitive because the training data is usually enriched with common sense.\nMMLU: MMLU includes 57 multiple-choice tasks covering subjects spanning STEM to social\nscience [17]. The tasks differ significantly in complexity, with many STEM-oriented questions\ndemanding domain-specific professional knowledge and intricate reasoning to be solved.\nTruthfulQA: TruthfulQA contains 817 factual questions to detect model falsehoods caused by naively\nmimicking human language patterns [27]. The solutions to these questions are closely associated\nwith English Wikipedia sources. The task probes a model\u2019s factual knowledge and resistance to\npopular misconceptions.\nTable 3: Performance of FLM-101B and baselines including LLAMA series and GLM-130B.\nIn order to visually compare the performance and cost, we estimate the floating-point opera-\ntions (zetta = 1021) of the training process.\nModel\nCost (zettaFLOPs)\nAverage\nARC\nHellaSwag\nMMLU\nTruthfulQA\nLLAMA-2 (13B)\n201.37\n(\u00b128.77)\n58.66\n59.39\n82.13\n55.77\n37.38\nLLAMA-2 (7B)\n106.60\n(\u00b115.23)\n54.32\n53.07\n78.59\n46.87\n38.76\nLLAMA (13B)\n94.81\n(\u00b113.54)\n56.08\n56.23\n80.93\n47.67\n39.48\nLLAMA (7B)\n49.54\n(\u00b17.08)\n49.72\n51.02\n77.82\n35.71\n34.33\nGLM-130B\n210.80\n48.11\n42.15\n67.91\n42.59\n39.80\nFLM-101B\n28.22\n43.94\n39.76\n66.23\n28.30\u2217\n41.47\n\u221744.50 for a knowledge-enhanced eFLM-16B (Section 2.2, 4.2).\nTable 3 details the performance of FLM-101B and strong baselines, including LLAMA series and\nGLM-130B. Because GPT-3 is closed-source, we could not get the probability values for a fair\ncomparison. As a result, we cannot list GPT-3 here. GLM-130B results are achieved by our run on\nan open-sourced checkpoint.\n5This range originates from the use of checkpoint activation. Please check [35] for more details.\n6https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\n7\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n4\nBENCHMARK EVALUATION\nResults. Among all the baseline models, FLM-101B ranks last with an average of 43.94. However,\ngoing deeper into the nature of these tasks, this does not necessarily indicate the inferiority of our\nmodel and training procedures.\n(i) MMLU typically requires domain knowledge to solve. In our training of FLM-101B, no English\ntextbook or sample exam questions are intentionally used. Nevertheless, in an FLM variant that\nincorporates this knowledge with FreeLM objectives (eFLM-16B, Section 2.2), even a 16B FLM\nmodel can outperform GLM-130B, supporting our claims here.\n(ii) As aforementioned, TruthfulQA, ARC, and HellaSwag emphasize more on common sense\nand Wiki-level knowledge, and their performances improve with the increased amount of data and\nthe reduction of training loss. With less than 0.16T English data (about one-tenth of LLAMA-2),\nFLM-101B already achieves the best accuracy of 41.47 among all the baselines on TruthfulQA. On\nARC and HellaSwag, FLM-101B is comparable to GLM-130B with a similar amount of English\ndata (approximately 0.2T). Also, the training data of GLM-130B includes ARC and HellaSwag, as\nexpressly claimed in [80]. In our understanding, superior performance of FLM-101B can be expected\non these three tasks if exposed to more training data.\n4.2\nEvaluation on the Professional Knowledge-Enhanced Version\nWe have also conducted experiments on a knowledge-enhanced version (eFLM-16B, detailed in\nSection 2.2) of the FLM to validate the effect of using domain-specific knowledge data. To reduce\nthe training cost, we continue to train the smallest FLM-16B with teacher signals from a combination\nof (i) part of the auxiliary training data of MMLU [17], (ii) exam questions in similar domains and\nformats to C-Eval [20] 7, and (iii) other domain knowledge data. Note that, eFLM-16B is not a\ntypical fine-tuning with additional data, which may affect the language capability of LLM. Recall\nthat the FLM series uses FreeLM as its backbone which can learn both language and teacher signals.\nIn this training, we preserve the language signal. Table 4 lists the result of eFLM-16B and baselines\non C-Eval.\nTable 4: Performance of eFLM-16B and baselines on C-eval. In this table, eFLM-16B refers\nto the professional-knowledge-enhanced FLM-16B. Note that C-Eval leaderboard only keeps one\ndecimal place for the evaluation results.\nModel\nAverage\nAverage (Hard)\nSTEM\nSocial Science\nHumanities\nOthers\nGPT-4\n68.7\n54.9\n67.1\n77.6\n64.5\n67.8\nChatGPT\n54.4\n41.4\n52.9\n61.8\n50.9\n53.6\nGLM-130B\n44.0\n30.7\n36.7\n55.8\n47.7\n43.0\neFLM-16B\n46.1\n28.9\n38.3\n53.7\n46.8\n52.6\nResults. Enhanced with professional knowledge, significant improvements are observed. On MMLU\ntask, the incorporation of the teacher signals with professional knowledge data results in a score\nof 44.50 for eFLM-16B (see Table 3), which surpasses GLM-130B (42.59), a model that also uses\nmulti-task data in the related domain [80]. As a comparison, the MMLU score is 27.02 for the un-\nenhanced FLM-16B. On C-Eval tasks 8, we observe that eFLM-16B performs better than GLM-130B\nby about 2 points. As a comparison, the average C-Eval score of the vanilla FLM-16B is 27.0, which\nunderperforms GLM-130B. These results suggest that evaluation with professional knowledge may\nnot fully reflect the capability of LLMs, particularly when different LLMs are trained with different\ndata collections, and some may not come with a clear list.\n4.3\nEvaluation of the Growth Strategy\nOur core method for reducing computational cost is the growth strategy. We would like to answer the\nquestion of whether our growth strategy is effective in knowledge inheritance, and the trajectory of\nhow model capabilities grow with size. Hence, we evaluate the performance of FLM on all the stages:\n16B, 51B, and 101B. The training data for each stage is 0.245T, 0.04T, and 0.027T, respectively, in\n7C-Eval can be considered as a Chinese version of MMLU.\n8The scores are achieved on the test set by submitting to the C-Eval platform.\n8\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n5\nEVALUATIONS INSPIRED BY IQ TESTS\nan accumulative manner according to the growth setting. Table 5 shows the performance of FLM\nmodels at each stage.\nTable 5: Performance of the three stages of FLM on Open LLM. To reduce the computational\ncost during evaluation, we sample 20% and 30% items for HellaSwag and MMLU tasks, respectively.\nParameters\nTraining Data\nAverage\nARC\nHellaswag\nMMLU\nTruthfulQA\n16B\n245.37B\n39.19\n32.25\n58.57\n27.02\n38.92\n51B\n39.64B\n41.79\n35.32\n64.04\n27.66\n40.12\n101B\n26.54B\n44.41\n39.76\n67.88\n28.54\n41.47\nResults. As expected, the performance of FLM improves with the increase in model size. FLM-101B\nachieves the best performance on almost all tasks. This means that our model inherits knowledge from\nthe previous stage after each growth. We also observe that the 101B model improves the performance\nscores more significantly than the 51B model, with less data. This indicates that the models are\nsuccessfully incorporating new weights in training after growth, and taking advantage of larger model\nsizes when the loss is low. Interestingly, the performance on ARC and HellaSwag increases steadily\nand significantly. This corresponds exactly to the steady decline of the model loss. Again, as we\nclaimed in Section 4.1, when more training data is processed, FLM\u2019s performance on Open LLM\nbecomes better.\nThe above experiments evaluate the knowledge-related ability of FLM and how the performances\ndepend on the amount and domain of training data. We also conduct an additional range of evaluations\ninspired by IQ tests in the following section.\n5\nEvaluations Inspired by IQ Tests\nSection 4 details the evaluation of existing benchmarks, focusing on knowledge. As we discussed\nin Section 1, knowledge could not fully reflect the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of LLMs. To this end,\nwe use existing IQ-related datasets [71; 72; 53] and make necessary modifications or generate new\nsynthetic datasets where necessary.\nSpecifically, the IQ test mainly considers four aspects: symbolic mapping, rule understanding, pattern\nmining, and anti-interference. A common key property of these tasks is that they are dependent on\nthe inference and generalization in a new context, instead of the previously-learned knowledge. We\nre-organize the modified existing datasets and our newly generated datasets under these four aspects,\nand introduce the motivation for each aspect, as well as the detailed execution methods.\nCompared Methods. Borrowing psychological ideas that the measurement of IQ is dependent on\nage 9, we mainly consider models trained with similar amounts of data to FLM-101B. As a milestone\nof LLM development, GPT-3 (175B) [3] proposed in-context learning for the first time. GLM-130B\n[80] is the first open English-Chinese bilingual LLM. Hence, we select them as baseline models.\nBoth models are trained with 300 ~400 billion tokens, which are in the same range as ours. GPT-3\nfocuses on English, so it is not included in the Chinese-related evaluation (i.e., CLUE-IQ).\n5.1\nSymbolic Mapping Evaluation\nAn existing study [71] points out that classification tasks (e.g., document classification, sentiment\nclassification) in textual forms often lack generalization. This is because they often come with very\nindicative and meaningful category labels. Such labels may laterally appear in the raw training data\nor popular websites, i.e., SemEval, IMDB [32], and Yelp 10 et al.. This leads a model to over-fit the\nsemantics of the labels instead of inferring them from the new context, while the latter is critical for\nmeasuring intelligence as well. Considering this, we use a symbolic mapping method to replace the\noriginal category labels with symbols that are unlikely to be seen in the training data. Hence, we\ncan evaluate the LLMs\u2019 language understanding ability as well as the generalization abilities to a\n9https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/9/9.00SC/MIT9_00SCF11_text.pdf, page 367.\n10https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main\n9\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n5\nEVALUATIONS INSPIRED BY IQ TESTS\nnew context. Because the labels are from a given scope, we form our evaluation task as in-context\nlearning with few-shot examples for each label.\nExamples\nPrompt\nSymbolic Mapping Method\nPremise: Kozlowski and the company's former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz, were sentenced, on Monday, to up to 25 years in prison.\nHypothesis: Kozlowski was sentenced, Monday, to serve up to 25 years in prison.\nAnswer: <30mFC%4Z>\n......\nPremise: Note that SBB, CFF and FFS stand out for the main railway company, in German, French and Italian.\nHypothesis: The French railway company is called SNCF.\nAnswer: <?V9qP@Rx>\nPremise: Pibul Songgram was the pro-Japanese military dictator of Thailand during World War 2.\nHypothesis: Pibul was the dictator of Thailand.\nAnswer:\nGiven the premise and hypothesis, determine the relationship between the two sentences.\nInstruction\nExamples\nPrompt\nTraditional Direct Method\nPremise: Kozlowski and the company's former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz, were sentenced, on Monday, to up to 25 years in prison.\nHypothesis: Kozlowski was sentenced, Monday, to serve up to 25 years in prison.\nAnswer: entailment\n......\n Premise: Note that SBB, CFF and FFS stand out for the main railway company, in German, French and Italian.\nHypothesis: The French railway company is called SNCF.\nAnswer: not entailment\nPremise: Pibul Songgram was the pro-Japanese military dictator of Thailand during World War 2.\nHypothesis: Pibul was the dictator of Thailand.\nAnswer:\nGiven the premise and hypothesis, determine the relationship between the two sentences.\nInstruction\nFigure 3: An example of symbolic mapping. The main difference is that the symbolic mapping\nmethod replaces the original label with random strings. In this example, we use <30mFC%4Z> and\n<?V9qP@Rx> to replace entailment and not entailment, respectively.\n5.1.1\nData Collection\nWe use the existing benchmark datasets (e.g., SuperGLUE [61], CLUE [74]) as the source and sample\nup to 300 instances. Then, we replace the original category labels with random strings. Figure 3\nshows an example. In this case, the entailment category is replaced by random string <30mFC%4Z>\nwhile the not entailment category is replaced by <?V9qP@Rx>. This processing also mitigates the\nproblem that these datasets may contaminate the LLM pre-training data, since both benchmarks are\npublic with lots of reproductions. Table 6 presents the statistics and task types of the rebuilt datasets.\nTable 6: Statistics for SuperGLUE-IQ and CLUE-IQ datasets. \u201cWSD\u201d stands for \u201cWord Sense\nDisambiguation\u201d; \u201cSS\u201d stands for \u201cSentence Similarity\u201d; \u201cKR\u201d stands for \u201cKeyword Recognition\u201d;\ncoref. stands for \u201ccoreference resolution\u201d.\nSource\nBoolQ\nWiC\nRTE\nWSC\nAFQMC\nCSL\nOCNLI\nCLUEWSC2020\nSamples\n299\n300\n277\n103\n300\n208\n300\n300\nTask\nQA\nWSD\nNLI\ncoref.\nSS\nKR\nNLI\ncoref.\n5.1.2\nSuperGLUE-IQ\nSuperGLUE is a benchmark dataset used in evaluating the classification ability of various models\nincluding LLMs. However, the data is publicly available and many websites have reproduced this\ndataset. As a result, it is inevitable that the models might have already been trained on it. Thus, we\nbuild a new dataset named SuperGLUE-IQ based on the original dataset. Since the answers for the\ntest set of SuperGLUE are not publicly available, we use a validation set here. There are two rules\nfor selecting the sub-tasks: (i) the number of instances exceeds 100; (ii) the classification categories\nare fixed sets. The building process is detailed in Section 5.1.1. Table 7 lists the performance of\nFLM-101B and the baselines.\nResults. On BoolQ, WiC, and RTE tasks, FLM-101B and GPT-3 perform at the same level, and both\noutperform GLM-130B. In specific, GPT-3 and FLM-101B are more than 9 points better than GLM-\n10\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n5\nEVALUATIONS INSPIRED BY IQ TESTS\nTable 7: Performance on SuperGLUE-IQ of GPT-3, GLM-130B, and FLM-101B.

On WSC task, FLM-101B and GPT-3 perform comparably while both perform worse\nthan GLM-130B with about an 18 points gap. The technical report of GLM-130B [80] shows that\nthey use both the WSC and RTE datasets in training. It is interesting to observe that the performance\nof GLM-130B on the two tasks has such a difference. Since the original label is replaced by a random\nstring, overfitting can be ruled out to a certain extent. We believe that the main reason lies in the\nstructure of language models: GLM-130B contains a bidirectional encoder while FLM-101B and\nGPT-3 are uni-directional. This feature potentially makes GLM-130B perform better in English\ncoreference resolution tasks, while poor in reasoning-related tasks (e.g., BoolQ). More importantly,\nthe costs of the three models are very different. FLM-101B achieves a comparable performance with\nGPT-3 under about 1/13 of its computational cost.\n5.1.3\nCLUE-IQ\nCLUE [74] is an open benchmark for Chinese NLP tasks. Similar to SuperGLUE-IQ, we build\nCLUE-IQ based on the CLUE dataset. Because GPT-3 is unable to handle Chinese well, here we\ncompare FLM-101B with GLM-130B only. There are four tasks to be evaluated, including AFQMC,\nCSL, OCNLI, and CLUEWSC2020.11 Similar to SuperGLUE-IQ, we follow the same two rules to\nfilter the original CLUE. Table 8 lists the performances of FLM-101B and GLM-130B.\nTable 8: Performance on CLUE-IQ for GLM-130B and FLM-101B.\nModel\nCost (zettaFLOPs)\nAverage\nAFQMC\nCSL\nOCNLI\nCLUEWSC2020\nGLM-130B\n210.80\n39.96\n33.33\n53.85\n34.0\n38.67\nFLM-101B\n24.54\n42.07\n38.33\n55.29\n27.33\n47.33\nResults.\nOn CLUE-IQ, our proposed FLM-101B achieves the best average performance of\n42.07. Among the evaluated tasks, FLM-101B outperforms GLM-130B on AFQMC, CSL, and\nCLUEWSC2020. The results show that FLM-101B has good Chinese ability at the level of 100B\nparameters. Interestingly, FLM-101B performs better than GLM-130B on Chinese WSC, while worse\nthan GLM-130B on English WSC. In addition, FLM-101B performs worse than GLM-103B on\nOCNLI. These results suggest that Chinese and English are different in nature and a model excelling\nin one language may not be good at both. Finally, from a cost-effective perspective, FLM-101B\nachieves better performance in Chinese at about 12% of the training cost of the counterpart.\n5.2\nRule Understanding Evaluation\nSymbolic mapping is able to lighten the negative effects of data overfitting. From a different\nperspective, we consider understanding rules and executing them according to the given rules is a\nstrong indication of reasoning capability. To this end, we design rule understanding evaluation. Note\nthat, this test is different from reasoning based on the chain of thought. The former focuses on the\nunderstanding ability of simple rules (e.g., counting) and performing the right action in a closed\nsetting, while the latter focuses on reasoning ability in an open setting (e.g., different valid reasons\nfor the same conclusion). For example, \u201ccounting an increasing sequence of numbers\u201d is a typical\ntask for rule understanding evaluation, which can be zero-shot.\nDetails of Selected Tasks and Data. Counting (0-shot) is the simplest test method for rule under-\nstanding ability. Here, we build a bilingual dataset with 300 randomly generated items and report\n11For the details of these tasks, please refer to the original work [74].\n11\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n5\nEVALUATIONS INSPIRED BY IQ TESTS\nthe results on 148 of them with English instructions. A typical example is \u201cLet\u2019s count from 10010\nto 10035: 10010, 10011, 10012,\u201d. String replacement (4-shots) is another task that examines the\nmodel\u2019s capacity to edit the text precisely following human intention. We build two sub-tasks:\nReplace-Word and Replace-Lowercase, each of which contains 300 instances. Each instance starts\nwith a clear instruction: for the \u201cReplace-Word\u201d task, it is like \u201cIn the following sentence, replace\nthe specified word with the target word. word to replace: **WQHF** target word: **DFBB**\u201d; for\nthe \u201cReplace-Lowercase\u201d task, it is like \u201cFor the following text, please modify all uppercase letters\nto lowercase\u201d. The counting range and words to replace are sampled with a uniform distribution.\nTable 9 shows the performance of our proposed FLM-101B against GPT-3 and GLM-130B on both\ncounting and string replacement tasks.\nTable 9: Performance of FLM-101B, GPT-3, and GLM-130B on rule understanding tasks.\nModel\nAverage\nCounting\nReplace-Lowercase\nReplace-Word\nGPT-3\n86.03\n82.43\n80.67\n95.00\nGLM-130B\n71.49\n60.81\n69.67\n84.00\nFLM-101B\n76.42\n69.59\n64.00\n95.67\nResults. On counting task, FLM-101B achieves 69.59%, about 9 points better than GLM-130B.\nGPT-3 wins the first place in counting and Replace-Lowercase, and second place in Replace-Word.\nThis is potentially because GPT-3 has the largest amount of English training data. This experiment\nshows that the advantages of each model are varied. Hence, in future work, rule understanding\nevaluation tasks should cover more scenarios. Finally, considering the cost of each model, the\nperformance of FLM-101B is satisfactory.\n5.3\nPattern Mining Evaluation\nPattern Mining test is common in IQ tests. In detail, it is the induction and deduction of the patterns\nemerging in a new context. In general, it is difficult even for humans and is frequently used in\nintelligence tests. Again, we face the problem that the same test data might have appeared in large\nquantities, so we also use replacement methods similar to Section 5.1 to alleviate this problem.\nSpecifically, we build a benchmark with three tasks (i.e., Head & Tail, Full Repeating, and Head\nSlicing) for evaluation. Head & Tail is to add a head and a tail to the given input, which should be\nexactly the same as the ones in the given examples. Regarding Full Repeating, the input sequence\nshould be fully repeated once. For the Head Slicing task, the model needs to return the first fixed\nnumber of characters of the input. The number can be inferred from the preceding examples. No\ninstruction or clue is provided except the examples.\nExamples\nPrompt\nPattern Mining Evaluation\nInput: IHFJd\nOutput: JHcIIHFJdFgcB\nInput: BEgI\nOutput: JHcIBEgIFgcB\n...\nInput: JIgH\nOutput: JHcIJIgHFgcB\nInput: BEH\nOutput:\nHead & Tail\nInput: gEdcFa\nOutput: gEdcFagEdcFa\nInput: IdcBg\nOutput: IdcBgIdcBg\n...\nInput: dHgFa\nOutput: dHgFadHgFa\nInput: EgBJ\nOutput:\nFull Repeating\nInput: EgIdJ\nOutput: Eg\nInput: cgBaE\nOutput: cg\n...\nInput: BcJ\nOutput: Bc\nInput: gHdEIa\nOutput:\nHead Slicing\nFigure 4: Examples of pattern mining evaluation.\nFigure 4 shows examples of these tasks. We sample the input strings, heads, and tails from a uniform\ndistribution. These tasks are actually the \u201calphabetical\u201d versions of the list_functions sub-task of\nBig-Bench [53]. The original numerical version is so simple that most existing LLMs could achieve\n90%+ accuracy. To improve the distinctiveness, we replace the numbers with characters. All these\ntasks require the model to discover the behavior patterns inside the given examples. Each task is\n5-shot and contains 100 instances. Table 10 lists the experimental results of our proposed FLM-101B\nagainst GPT-3 and GLM-130B on pattern mining tasks.\n12\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n5\nEVALUATIONS INSPIRED BY IQ TESTS\nTable 10: Performance of FLM-101B, GPT-3, and GLM-130B on pattern mining tasks.\nModel\nAverage\nHead & Tail\nFull Repeating\nHead Slicing\nGPT-3\n70.00\n61.00\n92.00\n57.00\nGLM-130B\n53.00\n38.00\n70.00\n51.00\nFLM-101B\n64.67\n52.00\n79.00\n63.00\nResults. On all three tasks, FLM-101B outperforms GLM-130B by a large margin. For the head &\ntail and full repeating tasks, FLM-101B is a few points behind GPT-3, but outperforms the latter on\nthe head slicing task. Considering the computational cost, FLM-101B exhibits noticeable abilities in\nthis area.\n5.4\nAnti-interference Evaluation\nAnti-interference capability is critical for finding and utilizing information that is truly related to a\nspecific goal, in an unseen and noisy context (Figure 5). We believe that in addition to generalization,\nanti-interference is also one of the important principles of AGI. For example, many LLMs will\nbabble when given noisy cues. Another famous hard problem, the cocktail party problem in speech\nrecognition [38], also suggests the importance of the anti-interference ability of intelligent agents. To\nthis end, we conduct this anti-interference evaluation. Figure 5 shows two typical examples of this\ntest.\nAnti-interference Evaluation\nThere is an important info hidden inside a lot of irrelevant text. Find it and memorize them.

We conduct anti-interference evaluation in three task types:\nmultiple key retrievals, single supporting fact tracking, and two supporting facts tracking. Multiple\nkey retrieval is a kind of puzzle that hides some important information (referred to as keys) inside a\nlot of irrelevant text. If the anti-interference ability of LLMs is not good enough, they will output the\nwrong or even meaningless words. Even if LLMs pass the first challenge, they may still fail due to\nmultiple relevant noises. We collect a multiple key retrieval dataset in similar formats as those in [7]\nwith at most 3 keys in each instance, exemplified in Figure 5. The single supporting fact tracking\nand two supporting facts tracking tasks test whether a model can find the chain of supporting facts\nto answer a question correctly, which is hidden inside a set of irrelevant statements. There are two\nsub-tasks in the babi-20 [72] benchmark (qa1 and qa2 12) that are aligned with this setting. Thus, we\n12We drop qa3 due to the long context length and extraordinary difficulty for all the models\n13\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\n6\nRELATED WORK\ndirectly modify them in a generative format with 3 shots. We randomly sampled 300 questions for\neach of these three tasks. Table 11 shows the evaluation results on anti-interference.\nTable 11: Performance of FLM-101B, GPT-3, and GLM-130B on anti-interference evaluation.\nModel\nAverage\nMultiple Key Retrieval\nSingle Supporting Fact\nTwo Supporting Facts\nGPT-3\n70.11\n92.67\n78.33\n39.33\nGLM-130B\n53.56\n77.67\n56.33\n26.67\nFLM-101B\n60.11\n89.00\n59.00\n32.33\nResults. Among all the baselines for this evaluation, FLM-101B achieves the second-best passing\nrates of 89.00%, 59.00%, and 32.33%, respectively, which is an advantage of about 11%, 3%, and\n6% compared to GLM-130B. Considering the computational cost, FLM-101B delivers exciting\nperformance.\nIn conclusion, on our four additional evaluations inspired by the IQ tests, FLM-101B outperforms\nGLM-130B and obtains competitive results compared to GPT-3 in some tasks with much lower costs.\nExcept for the impacts of training data, the superiority may be owed to a story that in the growth\nstrategy, the smaller models in early stages refine a more efficient searching space, which keeps\ntaking effect when the model grows larger with increased generalization ability.\n6\nRelated Work\nScaling Up Language Models to 100B. The burgeoning advancements in hardware and computa-\ntional techniques in recent years [47; 52] have laid a robust groundwork for the expansion of language\nmodels. The benefits of scaling up LLMs include discernible advantages in language perplexity\nsupported by studies on scaling laws [23; 18; 19; 77], as well as the emergent cognitive competencies\nin models [69; 4].\nIn the realm of 100+ billion parameters, examples of closed-source pre-trained LLMs include\nGPT-3 [3], Gopher [42], and Palm [1]. For closed-source models trained on Chinese data, notable\nmentions are Ernie 3.0 [63], Pangu-\u03a3 [48], and InternLM [57]. Turning our attention to open-source\nvariants, OPT [81] and BLOOM [49] are among the counterparts to GPT-3; the Llama [58; 59]\nseries strategically operates on a slightly reduced scale (approximately 70B parameters) but amplifies\nthe data to 2T. GLM-130B [80] is an open-source bilingual model with decent performance in\nboth Chinese and English tasks. Nevertheless, the development trajectory and cost of GLM-130B\nremain largely inaccessible to many academic and industrial entities. FLM-101B is an exemplary\nparadigm for achieving comparable performance with a relatively small $100K budget. It is our\naspiration that this model serves as a catalyst, expediting research advancements and making them\nmore economically feasible in this domain.\nAligning with Humans. Despite the evidence that foundation LLMs present reasoning abilities\nin zero/few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting [3; 70], further refinement is needed to\nenhance their abilities to follow instructions [68] and align with human preferences [37; 36; 13; 2].\nSupervised fine-tuning releases the potential of LLMs to imitate the instruction-following formats\nand provide human-like responses in dialogical and problem-solving contexts [66; 73; 34; 26].\nMeanwhile, policy optimization methods [50; 43] lead LLMs to generate responses that maximize\nrewards congruent with human preferences, e.g., being helpful and harmless [12].\nOn the other hand, although these post-training techniques have proven effective and successful\nin industrial applications, the scaling laws regarding model sizes persist even after alignment with\nhumans: larger models provide more factual and reasonable responses [16], as well as being better\ncalibrated with their confidence probabilities [22]. We hereby release FLM-101B as a large foundation\nmodel, making it an accessible starting point for subsequent alignment studies.\nLLM Evaluation. Widely-used approaches to evaluate LLMs include natural language processing\nbenchmarks [74; 61], commonsense knowledge benchmarks [9; 79; 27], and professional knowledge\nbenchmarks [17; 20]. For chatbots after fine-tuning, automatic and semi-automatic playgrounds are\ndeveloped to evaluate their human alignment abilities [83]. Although knowledge-oriented ability is\n14\nTechnical Report of FLM-101B\nREFERENCES\nimportant, the results can be substantially impacted by training data and domains. To measure other\nclasses of abilities, existing research like Big-Bench [53] and babi-20 [72] include some sub-tasks\nrelevant to IQ tests, while others still depend more on NLP and knowledge. In this work, we add\nadditional ranges of evaluation in the IQ-test paradigms by re-organizing existing datasets as well as\ncreating new ones where proper.\nModel Growth A line of existing work studies the progressive expansion of structures in training\nTransformer-like models [14; 51; 15; 6; 39; 62; 78]. To our knowledge, FLM-101B presents the\nfirst attempt to use a growth strategy to train LLMs in the 100B+ scale. For a more comprehensive\nsummary, please refer to [78].\n7\nConclusions and Future Work\nIn this paper, we introduce FLM-101B, an open-source LLM that is successfully trained from scratch\nwithin a $100,000 budget. The key idea of reducing the training cost of FLM-101B is to utilize the\ngrowth strategy to break through the fixed number of model parameters. To fairly evaluate LLMs,\nwe conduct a set of evaluations inspired by IQ tests. We believe that along this pathway, better\nIQ evaluation methods will continue to emerge in future studies. Experimental results show that\nFLM-101B outperforms strong baseline models under the same computational cost.\nThe power of LLMs is very exciting. We believe that LLMs are one of the important possible\ntechnical paths to AGI. For the sustainable development of LLMs, we believe that it may be an\neffective path to construct a basic LLM with strong reasoning capabilities but not a large amount\nof knowledge (for cost saving), and then expand the knowledge of the LLM in different domains\nto better support applications. Besides, our exploration on the growth strategy as well as training\nstability would potentially be beneficial for future attempts of further scaling up LLMs, e.g., beyond\n1T parameters.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022ZD0116300) and the\nNational Science Foundation of China (NSFC No. 62106249).

Visualization of our semi-online video segmentation results. Top: our algorithm (DEVA) extends Segment Anything (SAM) [30]\nto video for open-world video segmentation with no user input required. Bottom: DEVA performs text-prompted video segmentation for\nnovel objects (with prompt \u201cbeyblade\u201d, a type of spinning-top toy) by integrating Grounding-DINO [38] and SAM [30].\nAbstract\nTraining data for video segmentation are expensive\nto annotate.\nThis impedes extensions of end-to-end al-\ngorithms to new video segmentation tasks, especially in\nlarge-vocabulary settings.\nTo \u2018track anything\u2019 without\ntraining on video data for every individual task, we de-\nvelop a decoupled video segmentation approach (DEVA),\ncomposed of task-specific image-level segmentation and\nclass/task-agnostic bi-directional temporal propagation.\nDue to this design, we only need an image-level model\nfor the target task (which is cheaper to train) and a\nuniversal temporal propagation model which is trained\nonce and generalizes across tasks.\nTo effectively com-\nbine these two modules, we use bi-directional propaga-\ntion for (semi-)online fusion of segmentation hypotheses\nfrom different frames to generate a coherent segmenta-\ntion. We show that this decoupled formulation compares\nfavorably to end-to-end approaches in several data-scarce\ntasks including large-vocabulary video panoptic segmen-\ntation, open-world video segmentation, referring video\nsegmentation, and unsupervised video object segmenta-\ntion. Code is available at: hkchengrex.github.io/\nTracking-Anything-with-DEVA.\n1. Introduction\nVideo segmentation aims to segment and associate ob-\njects in a video. It is a fundamental task in computer vision\nand is crucial for many video understanding applications.\nMost existing video segmentation approaches train end-\nto-end video-level networks on annotated video datasets.\nThey have made significant strides on common benchmarks\nlike YouTube-VIS [69] and Cityscape-VPS [27]. However,\n1\narXiv:2309.03903v1  [cs.CV]  7 Sep 2023\n10\n25\n50\n100\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nPercentage of training data in the target domain used (%)\nRelative improvement over baseline (%)\nAll classes\nCommon classes\nRare classes\nFigure 2. We plot relative VPQ increase of our decoupled ap-\nproach over the end-to-end baseline when we vary the training\ndata in the target domain (VIPSeg [45]). Common/rare classes are\nthe top/bottom 50% most annotated object category in the training\nset. Our improvement is most significant (>60%) in rare classes\nwhen there is a small amount of training data. This is because\nour decoupling allows the use of external class-agnostic temporal\npropagation data \u2013 data that cannot be used by existing end-to-end\nbaselines. Details in Section 4.5.1.\nthese datasets have small vocabularies: YouTube-VIS con-\ntains 40 object categories, and Cityscape-VPS only has 19.\nIt is questionable whether recent end-to-end paradigms are\nscalable to large-vocabulary, or even open-world video data.\nA recent larger vocabulary (124 classes) video segmentation\ndataset, VIPSeg [45], has been shown to be more difficult\n\u2013 using the same backbone, a recent method [34] achieves\nonly 26.1 VPQ compared with 57.8 VPQ on Cityscape-\nVPS. To the best of our knowledge, recent video segmen-\ntation methods [2, 39] developed for the open-world set-\nting (e.g., BURST [2]) are not end-to-end and are based\non tracking of per-frame segmentation \u2013 further highlight-\ning the difficulty of end-to-end training on large-vocabulary\ndatasets.\nAs the number of classes and scenarios in the\ndataset increases, it becomes more challenging to train and\ndevelop end-to-end video models to jointly solve segmenta-\ntion and association, especially if annotations are scarce.\nIn this work, we aim to reduce reliance on the amount\nof target training data by leveraging external data outside of\nthe target domain. For this, we propose to study decoupled\nvideo segmentation, which combines task-specific image-\nlevel segmentation and task-agnostic temporal propagation.\nDue to this design, we only need an image-level model for\nthe target task (which is cheaper) and a universal tempo-\nral propagation model which is trained once and general-\nizes across tasks. Universal promptable image segmenta-\ntion models like \u2018segment anything\u2019 (SAM) [30] and oth-\ners [76, 32, 24, 73, 74] have recently become available and\nserve as excellent candidates for the image-level model in a\n\u2018track anything\u2019 pipeline \u2013 Figure 1 shows some promising\nresults of our integration with these methods.\nResearchers have studied decoupled formulations be-\nfore, as \u2018tracking-by-detection\u2019 [26, 58, 3].\nHowever,\nthese approaches often consider image-level detections im-\nmutable, while the temporal model only associates detected\nobjects. This formulation depends heavily on the quality of\nper-image detections and is sensitive to image-level errors.\nIn contrast, we develop a (semi-)online bi-directional\npropagation algorithm to 1) denoise image-level segmen-\ntation with in-clip consensus (Section 3.2.1), and 2) com-\nbine results from temporal propagation and in-clip consen-\nsus gracefully (Section 3.2.2). This bi-directional propaga-\ntion allows temporally more coherent and potentially better\nresults than those of an image-level model (see Figure 2).\nWe do not aim to replace end-to-end video approaches.\nIndeed, we emphasize that specialized frameworks on\nvideo tasks with sufficient video-level training data (e.g.,\nYouTubeVIS [69]) outperform the developed method. In-\nstead, we show that our decoupled approach acts as a strong\nbaseline when an image model is available but video data is\nscarce. This is in spirit similar to pretraining of large lan-\nguage models [52]: a task-agnostic understanding of natu-\nral language is available before being finetuned on specific\ntasks \u2013 in our case, we learn propagation of segmentations\nof class-agnostic objects in videos via a temporal propa-\ngation module and make technical strides in applying this\nknowledge to specific tasks. The proposed decoupled ap-\nproach transfers well to large-scale or open-world datasets,\nand achieves state-of-the-art results in large-scale video\npanoptic segmentation (VIPSeg [45]) and open-world video\nsegmentation (BURST [2]). It also performs competitively\non referring video segmentation (Ref-YouTubeVOS [55],\nRef-DAVIS [25]) and unsupervised video object segmen-\ntation (DAVIS-16/17[5]) without end-to-end training.\nTo summarize:\n\u2022 We propose using decoupled video segmentation that\nleverages external data, which allows it to general-\nize better to target tasks with limited annotations than\nend-to-end video approaches and allows us to seam-\nlessly incorporate existing universal image segmenta-\ntion models like SAM [30].\n\u2022 We develop bi-directional propagation that denoises\nimage segmentations and merges image segmentations\nwith temporally propagated segmentations gracefully.\n\u2022 We empirically show that our approach achieves favor-\nable results in several important tasks including large-\nscale video panoptic segmentation, open-world video\nsegmentation, referring video segmentation, and unsu-\npervised video object segmentation.\n2. Related Works\nEnd-to-End Video Segmentation.\nRecent end-to-end\nvideo segmentation approaches [50, 23, 62, 4, 6, 14, 13]\nhave made significant progress in tasks like Video In-\nstance Segmentation (VIS) and Video Panoptic Segmen-\ntation (VPS), especially in closed and small vocabulary\ndatasets like YouTube-VIS [69] and Cityscape-VPS [27].\n2\nHowever, these methods require end-to-end training and\ntheir scalability to larger vocabularies, where video data and\nannotations are expensive, is questionable. MaskProp [4]\nuses mask propagation to provide temporal information, but\nstill needs to be trained end-to-end on the target task. This\nis because their mask propagation is not class-agnostic. We\ncircumvent this training requirement and instead decouple\nthe task into image segmentation and temporal propagation,\neach of which is easier to train with image-only data and\nreadily available class-agnostic mask propagation data re-\nspectively.\nOpen-World Video Segmentation.\nRecently, an open-\nworld video segmentation dataset BURST [2] has been pro-\nposed. It contains 482 object classes in diverse scenarios\nand evaluates open-world performance by computing met-\nrics for the common classes (78, overlap with COCO [37])\nand uncommon classes (404) separately. The baseline in\nBURST [2] predicts a set of object proposals using an image\ninstance segmentation model trained on COCO [37] and as-\nsociates the proposals frame-by-frame using either box IoU\nor STCN [11]. OWTB [39] additionally associates propos-\nals using optical flow and pre-trained Re-ID features. Dif-\nferently, we use bi-directional propagation that generates\nsegmentations instead of simply associating existing seg-\nmentations \u2013 this reduces sensitivity to image segmentation\nerrors. UVO [18] is another open-world video segmentation\ndataset and focuses on human actions. We mainly evaluate\non BURST [2] as it is much more diverse and allows sepa-\nrate evaluation for common/uncommon classes.\nDecoupled\nVideo\nSegmentation.\n\u2018Tracking-by-\ndetection\u2019 approaches [26, 58, 3] often consider image-level\ndetections immutable and use a short-term temporal track-\ning model to associate detected objects. This formulation\ndepends heavily on the quality of per-image detections\nand is sensitive to image-level errors. Related long-term\ntemporal propagation works exist [20, 19],\nbut they\nconsider a single task and do not filter the image-level\nsegmentation. We instead propose a general framework,\nwith a bi-directional propagation mechanism that denoises\nthe image segmentations and allows our result to potentially\nperform better than the image-level model.\nVideo Object Segmentation.\nSemi-supervised Video\nObject Segmentation (VOS) aims to propagate an initial\nground-truth segmentation through a video [47, 46, 70, 9].\nHowever, it does not account for any errors in the initial seg-\nmentation, and cannot incorporate new segmentation given\nby the image model at later frames. SAM-PT [53] combines\npoint tracking with SAM [12] to create a video object seg-\nmentation pipeline, while our method tracks masks directly.\nWe find a recent VOS algorithm [9] works well for our tem-\nporal propagation model. Our proposed bi-directional prop-\nagation is essential for bringing image segmentation models\nand propagation models together as a unified video segmen-\ntation framework.\nUnified Video Segmentation.\nRecent Video-K-Net [34]\nuses a unified framework for multiple video tasks but re-\nquires separate end-to-end training for each task.\nUni-\ncorn [66], TarViS [1], and UNINEXT [67] share model pa-\nrameters for different tasks, and train on all the target tasks\nend-to-end. They report lower tracking accuracy for objects\nthat are not in the target tasks during training compared with\nclass-agnostic VOS approaches, which might be caused by\njoint learning with class-specific features. In contrast, we\nonly train an image segmentation model for the target task,\nwhile the temporal propagation model is always fully class-\nagnostic for generalization across tasks.\nSegmenting/Tracking\nAnything.\nConcurrent\nto\nour\nwork, Segment Anything (SAM) [30] demonstrates the\neffectiveness and generalizability of large-scale training\nfor universal image segmentation, serving as an important\nfoundation for open-world segmentation.\nFollow-up\nworks [68, 12] extend SAM to video data by propagating\nthe masks generated by SAM with video object segmen-\ntation algorithms.\nHowever, they rely on single-frame\nsegmentation and lack the denoising capability of our\nproposed in-clip consensus approach.\n3. Decoupled Video Segmentation\n3.1. Formulation\nDecoupled Video Segmentation.\nOur decoupled video\nsegmentation approach is driven by an image segmentation\nmodel and a universal temporal propagation model. The\nimage model, trained specifically on the target task, pro-\nvides task-specific image-level segmentation hypotheses.\nThe temporal propagation model, trained on class-agnostic\nmask propagation datasets, associates and propagates these\nhypotheses to segment the whole video. This design sep-\narates the learning of task-specific segmentation and the\nlearning of general video object segmentation, leading to\na robust framework even when data in the target domain is\nscarce and insufficient for end-to-end learning.\nNotation.\nUsing t as the time index, we refer to the cor-\nresponding frame and its final segmentation as It and Mt\nrespectively. In this paper, we represent a segmentation as\na set of non-overlapping per-object binary segments, i.e.,\nMt = {mi, 0 < i \u2264 |Mt|}, where mi \u2229 mj = \u2205 if i \u0338= j.\nThe image segmentation model Seg(I) takes an image\nI as input and outputs a segmentation. We denote its out-\nput segmentation at time t as Seg(It) = Segt = {si, 0 <\ni \u2264 |Segt|}, which is also a set of non-overlapping binary\nsegments. This segmentation model can be swapped for dif-\nferent target tasks, and users can be in the loop to correct the\nsegmentation as we do not limit its internal architecture.\n3\n\ud835\udc403\n\ud835\udc3c1\n\ud835\udc3c2\n\ud835\udc3c3\nSeg(\ud835\udc3c1)\n\ud835\udc401\n\ud835\udc402\n\ud835\udc403\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58+1\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58+2\nSeg(\ud835\udc3c2)\nSeg(\ud835\udc3c3)\nSeg(\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58)\nSeg(\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58+1)\nSeg(\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58+2)\nMerging (Section 3.2.2)\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc58\nIn-clip consensus (Section 3.2.1)\nTemporal propagation\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc58+1\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc58+2\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc58\u22121\nFigure 3. Overview of our framework. We first filter image-level segmentations with in-clip consensus (Section 3.2.1) and temporally\npropagate this result forward. To incorporate a new image segmentation at a later time step (for previously unseen objects, e.g., red box),\nwe merge the propagated results with in-clip consensus as described in Section 3.2.2. Specifics of temporal propagation are in the appendix.\nThe temporal propagation model Prop(H, I) takes a col-\nlection of segmented frames (memory) H and a query im-\nage I as input and segments the query frame with the objects\nin the memory. For instance, Prop ({I1, M1}, I2) propa-\ngates the segmentation M1 from the first frame I1 to the\nsecond frame I2. Unless mentioned explicitly, the memory\nH contains all past segmented frames.\nOverview.\nFigure 3 illustrates the overall pipeline. At a\nhigh level, we aim to propagate segmentations discovered\nby the image segmentation model to the full video with tem-\nporal propagation. We mainly focus on the (semi-)online\nsetting. Starting from the first frame, we use the image seg-\nmentation model for initialization. To denoise errors from\nsingle-frame segmentation, we look at a small clip of a few\nframes in the near future (in the online setting, we only look\nat the current frame) and reach an in-clip consensus (Sec-\ntion 3.2.1) as the output segmentation. Afterward, we use\nthe temporal propagation model to propagate the segmen-\ntation to subsequent frames. We modify an off-the-shelf\nstate-of-the-art video object segmentation XMem [9] as our\ntemporal propagation model, with details given in the ap-\npendix. The propagation model itself cannot segment new\nobjects that appear in the scene. Therefore, we periodically\nincorporate new image segmentation results using the same\nin-clip consensus as before and merge the consensus with\nthe propagated result (Section 3.2.2). This pipeline com-\nbines the strong temporal consistency from the propaga-\ntion model (past) and the new semantics from the image\nsegmentation model (future), hence the name bi-directional\npropagation. Next, we will discuss the bi-directional prop-\nagation pipeline in detail.\n\u0de2\nSeg\ud835\udc61\n\u0de2\nSeg\ud835\udc61+1\n\u0de2\nSeg\ud835\udc61+2\nIoU\n,\n= 0.9\n\u22c5\nClip consensus \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc61\nIoU\n,\n= 0.8\nIoU\n,\n= 0.7\nIoU\n,\n= 0.0\nFigure 4. A simple illustration of in-clip consensus. The top three\nsquares represent object proposals from three different frames\naligned to time t.

The remaining are not\nused due to significant overlap with the selected (blue) shape.\n3.2. Bi-Directional Propagation\n3.2.1\nIn-clip Consensus\nFormulation.\nIn-clip consensus operates on the image\nsegmentations of a small future clip of n frames (Segt,\nSegt+1, ..., Segt+n\u22121) and outputs a denoised consensus\nCt for the current frame. In the online setting, n = 1 and\nCt = Segt. In the subsequent discussion, we focus on the\nsemi-online setting, as consensus computation in the online\nsetting is straightforward. As an overview, we first obtain\na set of object proposals on the target frame t via spatial\nalignment, merge the object proposals into a combined rep-\n4\nresentation in a second step, and optimize for an indicator\nvariable to choose a subset of proposals as the output in\nan integer program. Figure 4 illustrates this in-clip consen-\nsus computation in a stylized way and we provide details\nregarding each of the three aforementioned steps (spatial\nalignment, representation, and integer programming) next.\nSpatial Alignment.\nAs the segmentations (Segt, Segt+1,\n..., Segt+n\u22121) correspond to different time steps, they might\nbe spatially misaligned.\nThis misalignment complicates\nthe computation of correspondences between segments. To\nalign segmentations Segt+i with frame t, techniques like\noptical flow warping are applicable.\nIn this paper, we\nsimply re-use the temporal propagation model to find the\naligned segmentation d\nSegt+i (note d\nSegt = Segt) via\nd\nSegt+i = Prop\n\u0000{It+i, Segt+i}, It\n\u0001\n, 0 < i < n.\n(1)\nNote, the propagation model here only uses one frame\nas memory at a time and this temporary memory\n{It+i, Segt+i} is discarded immediately after alignment. It\ndoes not interact with the global memory H.\nRepresentation.\nRecall that we represent a segmentation\nas a set of non-overlapping per-object binary segments. Af-\nter aligning all the segmentations to frame t, each segment\nis an object proposal for frame It. We refer to the union of\nall these proposals via P (time index omitted for clarity):\nP =\nn\u22121\n[\ni=0\nd\nSegt+i = {pi, 0 < i \u2264 |P|}.\n(2)\nThe output of consensus voting is represented by an indica-\ntor variable v\u2217 \u2208 {0, 1}|P| that combines segments into the\nconsensus output Ct:\nCt = {pi|v\u2217\ni = 1} = {ci, 0 < i \u2264 |C|}.\n(3)\nWe resolve overlapping segments ci in Ct by prioritizing\nsmaller segments as they are more vulnerable to being ma-\njorly displaced by overlaps. This priority is implemented\nby sequentially rendering the segments ci on an image in\ndescending order of area. We optimize for v based on two\nsimple criteria:\n1. Lone proposals pi are likely to be noise and should not\nbe selected. Selected proposals should be supported by\nother (unselected) proposals.\n2. Selected proposals should not overlap significantly\nwith each other.\nWe combine these criteria in an integer programming prob-\nlem which we describe next.\nInteger Programming.\nWe aim to optimize the indicator\nvariable v to achieve the above two objectives, by address-\ning the following integer programming problem:\nv\u2217 = argmaxv\nX\ni\n(Suppi + Penali) s.t.\nX\ni,j\nOverlapij = 0.\n(4)\nNext, we discuss each of the terms in the program in detail.\nFirst, we define the pairwise Intersection-over-Union\n(IoU) between the i-th proposal and the j-th proposal as:\nIoUij = IoUji = |pi \u2229 pj|\n|pi \u222a pj|, 0 \u2264 IoUij \u2264 1.\n(5)\nThe i-th proposal supports the j-th proposal if IoUij > 0.5\n\u2013 the higher the IoU, the stronger the support. The more\nsupport a segment has, the more favorable it is to be se-\nlected. To maximize the total support of selected segments,\nwe maximize the below objective for all i:\nSuppi = vi\nX\nj\n(\nIoUij,\nif IoUij > 0.5 and i \u0338= j\n0,\notherwise\n. (6)\nAdditionally, proposals that support each other should not\nbe selected together as they significantly overlap. This is\nachieved by constraining the following term to zero:\nOverlapij =\n(\nvivj,\nif IoUij > 0.5 and i \u0338= j\n0,\notherwise\n.\n(7)\nLastly, we introduce a penalty for selecting any segment for\n1) tie-breaking when a segment has no support, and 2) ex-\ncluding noisy segments, with weight \u03b1:\nPenali = \u2212\u03b1vi.\n(8)\nWe set the tie-breaking weight \u03b1 = 0.5. For all but the\nfirst frame, we merge Ct with the propagated segmentation\nProp(H, It) into the final output Mt as described next.\n3.2.2\nMerging Propagation and Consensus\nFormulation.\nHere, we seek to merge the propagated seg-\nmentation Prop(H, It) = Rt = {ri, 0 < i \u2264 |R|} (from\nthe past) with the consensus Ct = {cj, 0 < j \u2264 |C|}\n(from the near future) into a single segmentation Mt. We\nassociate segments from these two segmentations and de-\nnote the association with an indicator aij which is 1 if ri\nassociates with cj, and 0 otherwise. Different from the in-\nclip consensus, these two segmentations contain fundamen-\ntally different information. Thus, we do not eliminate any\nsegments and instead fuse all pairs of associated segments\nwhile letting the unassociated segments pass through to the\noutput. Formally, we obtain the final segmentation via\nMt = {ri\u222acj|aij = 1}\u222a{ri|\u2200jaij = 0}\u222a{cj|\u2200iaij = 0},\n(9)\nwhere overlapping segments are resolved by prioritizing the\nsmaller segments as discussed in Section 3.2.1.\n5\nMaximizing Association IoU.\nWe find aij by maximiz-\ning the pairwise IoU of all associated pairs, with a minimum\nassociation IoU of 0.5. This is equivalent to a maximum\nbipartite matching problem, with ri and cj as vertices and\nedge weight eij given by\neij =\n(\nIoU(ri, cj),\nif IoU(ri, cj) > 0.5\n\u22121,\notherwise\n.\n(10)\nRequiring any matched pairs from two non-overlapping\nsegmentations to have IoU > 0.5 leads to a unique match-\ning, as shown in [29]. Therefore, a greedy solution of set-\nting aij = 1 if eij > 0 and 0 otherwise suffices to obtain an\noptimal result.\nSegment Deletion.\nAs an implementation detail, we\ndelete inactive segments from the memory to reduce com-\nputational costs. We consider a segment ri inactive when it\nfails to associate with any segments cj from the consensus\nfor consecutive L times. Such objects might have gone out\nof view or were a misdetection. Concretely, we associate\na counter cnti with each propagated segment ri, initialized\nas 0. When ri is not associated with any segments cj from\nthe consensus, i.e., \u2200jaij = 0, we increment cnti by 1 and\nreset cnti to 0 otherwise. When cnti reaches the pre-defined\nthreshold L, the segment ri is deleted from the memory. We\nset L = 5 in all our experiments.\n4. Experiments\nWe first present our main results using a large-scale\nvideo panoptic segmentation dataset (VIPSeg [45]) and an\nopen-world video segmentation dataset (BRUST [2]). Next,\nwe show that our method also works well for referring video\nobject segmentation and unsupervised video object segmen-\ntation. We present additional results on the smaller-scale\nYouTubeVIS dataset in the appendix, but unsurprisingly re-\ncent end-to-end specialized approaches perform better be-\ncause a sufficient amount of data is available in this case.\nFigure 1 visualizes some results of the integration of our\napproach with universal image segmentation models like\nSAM [30] or Grounding-Segment-Anything [38, 30]. By\ndefault, we merge in-clip consensus with temporal propa-\ngation every 5 frames with a clip size of n = 3 in the semi-\nonline setting, and n = 1 in the online setting. We evaluate\nall our results using either official evaluation codebases or\nofficial servers. We use image models trained with stan-\ndard training data for each task (using open-sourced models\nwhenever available) and a universal temporal propagation\nmodule for all tasks unless otherwise specified.\nThe temporal propagation model is based on XMem [9],\nand is trained in a class-agnostic fashion with image seg-\nmentation datasets [56, 60, 72, 33, 8] and video object seg-\nmentation datasets [65, 47, 48]. With the long-term memory\nof XMem [9], our model can handle long videos with ease.\n1\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\nk\nVPQ\nVideo-K-Net\nw/ ours online\nw/ ours semi-online\nFigure 5.\nPerformance trend comparison of Video-K-Net [34]\nand our decoupled approach with the same base model. Ours de-\ncreases slower with larger k, indicating that the proposed decou-\npled method has a better long-term propagation.\nWe use top-k filtering [10] with k = 30 following [9]. The\nperformance of our modified propagation model on com-\nmon video object segmentation benchmarks (DAVIS [47],\nYouTubeVOS [65], and MOSE [16]) are listed in the ap-\npendix.\n4.1. Large-Scale Video Panoptic Segmentation\nWe are interested in addressing the large vocabulary set-\nting.\nTo our best knowledge, VIPSeg [45] is currently\nthe largest scale in-the-wild panoptic segmentation dataset,\nwith 58 things classes and 66 stuff classes in 3,536 videos\nof 232 different scenes.\nMetrics.\nTo evaluate the quality of the result, we adopt\nthe commonly used VPQ (Video Panoptic Quality) [27]\nand STQ (Segmentation and Tracking Quality) [63] met-\nrics. VPQ extends image-based PQ (Panoptic Quality) [29]\nto video data by matching objects in sliding windows of k\nframes (denoted VPQk). When k = 1, VPQ = PQ and as-\nsociations of segments between frames are ignored. Correct\nlong-range associations, which are crucial for object track-\ning and video editing tasks, are only evaluated with a large\nvalue of k. For a more complete evaluation of VPS, we\nevaluate k \u2208 {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \u221e}. Note, VPQ\u221e consid-\ners the entire video as a tube and requires global associa-\ntion. We additionally report VPQ, which is the average of\nVPQ\u221e and the arithmetic mean of VPQ{1,2,4,6,8,10}. This\nweights VPQ\u221e higher as it represents video-level perfor-\nmance, while the other metrics only assess frame-level or\nclip-level results. STQ is proposed in STEP [63] and is the\ngeometric mean of AQ (Association Quality) and SQ (Seg-\nmentation Quality). It evaluates pixel-level associations and\nsemantic segmentation quality respectively.

Comparison to baselines in the open-world video segmentation dataset BURST [2]. \u2018com\u2019 stands for \u2018common classes\u2019 and \u2018unc\u2019\nstands for \u2018uncommon classes\u2019. Our method performs better in both \u2013 in the common classes with Mask2Former [7] image backbone,\nand in the uncommon classes with EntitySeg [49]. The agility to switch image backbones is one of the main advantages of our decoupled\nformulation. Baseline performances are transcribed from [2].\non VIPSeg [45]. Our method outperforms both baseline\nClip-PanoFCN [45] and state-of-the-art Video-K-Net [34]\nwith the same backbone, especially if k is large, i.e., when\nlong-term associations are more important. Figure 5 shows\nthe performance trend with respect to k.\nThe gains for\nlarge values of k highlight the use of a decoupled formu-\nlation over end-to-end training: the latter struggles with\nassociations eventually, as training sequences aren\u2019t arbi-\ntrarily long. Without any changes to our generalized mask\npropagation module, using a better image backbone (e.g.,\nSwinB [40]) leads to noticeable improvements. Our method\ncan likely be coupled with future advanced methods in im-\nage segmentation for even better performance.\n4.2. Open-World Video Segmentation\nOpen-world video segmentation addresses the difficult\nproblem of discovering, segmenting, and tracking objects\nin the wild. BURST [2] is a recently proposed dataset that\nevaluates open-world video segmentation. It contains di-\nverse scenarios and 2,414 videos in its validation/test sets.\nThere are a total of 482 object categories, 78 of which are\n\u2018common\u2019 classes while the rest are \u2018uncommon\u2019.\nMetrics.\nFollowing [2], we assess Open World Tracking\nAccuracy (OWTA), computed separately for \u2018all\u2019, \u2018com-\nmon\u2019, and \u2018uncommon\u2019 classes. False positive tracks are\nnot directly penalized in the metrics as the ground-truth an-\nnotations are not exhaustive for all objects in the scene, but\nindirectly penalized by requiring the output mask to be mu-\ntually exclusive. We refer readers to [2, 42] for details.\nMain Results.\nTable 2 summarizes our findings.\nWe\nstudy two image segmentation models: Mask2Former [7],\nand EntitySeg [49], both of which are pretrained on the\nCOCO [37] dataset. The Mask2Former weight is trained for\nthe instance segmentation task, while EntitySeg is trained\n7\nImages\nOWTB [39]\nOurs\nFigure 6. An in-the-wild result in the BURST [2] dataset. Note,\nwe can even track the small skateboarder (pink mask on the road).\nfor \u2018entity segmentation\u2019, that is to segment all visual en-\ntities without predicting class labels.\nWe find EntitySeg\nworks better for novel objects, as it is specifically trained to\ndo so. Being able to plug and play the latest development of\nopen-world image segmentation models without any fine-\ntuning is one of the major advantages of our formulation.\nOur approach outperforms the baselines, which all fol-\nlow the \u2018tracking-by-detection\u2019 paradigm. In these base-\nlines, segmentations are detected every frame, and a short-\nterm temporal module is used to associate these segmenta-\ntions between frames. This paradigm is sensitive to mis-\ndetections in the image segmentation model. \u2018Box tracker\u2019\nuses per-frame object IoU; \u2018STCN tracker\u2019 uses a pretrained\nSTCN [11] mask propagation network; and OWTB [39]\nuses a combination of IoU, optical flow, and Re-ID fea-\ntures. We also make use of mask propagation, but we go\nbeyond the setting of simply associating existing segmenta-\ntions \u2013 our bi-directional propagation allows us to improve\nupon the image segmentations and enable long-term track-\ning. Figure 6 compares our results on one of the videos in\nBURST to OWTB [39].\n4.3. Referring Video Segmentation\nReferring video segmentation takes a text descrip-\ntion of an object as input and segments the target ob-\nject.\nWe experiment on Ref-DAVIS17 [25] and Ref-\nYouTubeVOS [55] which augments existing video object\nsegmentation datasets [47, 65] with language expressions.\nFollowing [64], we assess J &F which is the average of\nJaccard index (J ), and boundary F1-score (F).\nTable 3 tabulates our results.\nWe use an image-level\nReferFormer [64] as the image segmentation model. We\nfind that the quality of referring segmentation has a high\nvariance across the video (e.g., the target object might be\ntoo small at the beginning of the video). As in all compet-\ning approaches [55, 64, 17], we opt for an offline setting to\nreduce this variance. Concretely, we perform the initial in-\nclip consensus by selecting 10 uniformly spaced frames in\nthe video and using the frame with the highest confidence\ngiven by the image model as a \u2018key frame\u2019 for aligning the\nother frames. We then forward- and backward-propagate\nfrom the key frame without incorporating additional image\nsegmentations. We give more details in the appendix. Our\nmethod outperforms other approaches.\nMethod\nRef-DAVIS [25]\nRef-YTVOS [55]\nURVOS [55]\n51.6\n47.2\nReferFormer [64]\n60.5\n62.4\nVLT [17]\n61.6\n63.8\nOurs\n66.3\n66.0\nTable 3.

Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation\nUnsupervised video object segmentation aims to find\nand segment salient target object(s) in a video. We eval-\nuate on DAVIS-16 [47] (single-object) and DAVIS-17 [5]\n(multi-object). In the single-object setting, we use the im-\nage saliency model DIS [51] as the image model and em-\nploy an offline setting as in Section 4.3. In the multi-object\nsetting, since the image saliency model only segments one\nobject, we instead use EntitySeg [49] and follow our semi-\nonline protocol on open-world video segmentation in Sec-\ntion 4.2.

Ablation Studies\n4.5.1\nVarying Training Data\nHere, we vary the amount of training data in the target\ndomain (VIPSeg [45]) to measure the sensitivity of end-\nto-end approaches vs. our decoupled approach.

Performances of our method on VIPSeg [45] with dif-\nferent hyperparameters and design choices. By default, we use a\nclip size of n = 3 and a merge frequency of every 5 frames with\nspatial alignment for a balance between performance and speed.\nto train Video-K-Net-R50 [34] (all networks are still pre-\ntrained with COCO-panoptic [37]). We then compare end-\nto-end performances with our (semi-online) decoupled per-\nformances (the temporal propagation model is unchanged as\nit does not use any data from the target domain). Figure 1\nplots our findings \u2013 our model has a much higher relative\nVPQ improvement over the baseline Video-K-Net for rare\nclasses if little training data is available.\n4.5.2\nIn-Clip Consensus\nHere we explore hyperparameters and design choices in in-\nclip consensus. Table 5 tabulates our performances with\ndifferent clip sizes, different frequencies of merging in-clip\nconsensus with temporal propagation, and whether to use\nspatial alignment during in-clip consensus. Mask2Former-\nR50 is used as the backbone in all entries. For clip size\nn = 2, tie-breaking is ambiguous. A large clip is more com-\nputationally demanding and potentially leads to inaccurate\nspatial alignment as the appearance gap between frames in\nthe clip increases. A high merging frequency reduces the\ndelay between the appearance of a new object and its detec-\ntion in our framework but requires more computation. By\ndefault, we use a clip size n = 3, merge consensus with\ntemporal propagation every 5 frames, and enable spatial\nalignment for a balance between performance and speed.\n4.5.3\nUsing Temporal Propagation\nHere, we compare different approaches for using temporal\npropagation in a decoupled setting. Tracking-by-detection\napproaches [26, 58, 3] typically detect segmentation at ev-\nery frame and use temporal propagation to associate these\nper-frame segmentations. We test these short-term asso-\nciation approaches using 1) mask IoU between adjacent\nframes, 2) mask IoU of adjacent frames warped by opti-\ncal flow from RAFT [59], and 3) query association [22] of\nquery-based segmentation [7] between adjacent frames. We\nadditionally compare with variants of our temporal prop-\nagation method: 4) \u2018ShortTrack\u2019, where we consider only\nshort-term tracking by re-initializing the memory H every\nframe, and 5) \u2018TrustImageSeg\u2019, where we explicitly trust\nthe consensus given by the image segmentations over tem-\nporal propagation by discarding segments that are not asso-\nciated with a segment in the consensus (i.e., dropping the\nmiddle term in Eq. (9)). Table 6 tabulates our findings. For\nall entries, we use Mask2Former-R50 [7] in the online set-\nting on VIPSeg [45] for fair comparisons.\nTemporal scheme\nVPQ1\nVPQ4\nVPQ10\nVPQ\nSTQ\nMask IoU\n39.9\n32.7\n27.7\n27.6\n34.5\nMask IoU+flow\n40.2\n33.7\n28.8\n28.6\n37.0\nQuery assoc.\n40.4\n33.1\n28.1\n28.0\n35.8\n\u2018ShortTrack\u2019\n40.6\n33.3\n28.3\n28.2\n37.2\n\u2018TrustImageSeg\u2019\n40.3\n37.5\n33.7\n33.2\n37.9\nOurs, bi-direction\n41.0\n39.3\n37.3\n36.4\n41.1\nTable 6.\nPerformances of different temporal schema on\nVIPSeg [45]. Our bi-directional propagation scheme is necessary\nfor the final high performance.\n4.6. Limitations\nAs the temporal propagation model is task-agnostic, it\ncannot detect new objects by itself. As shown by the red\nboxes in Figure 3, the new object in the scene is missing\nfrom Mk\u22121 and can only be detected in Mk \u2013 this results\nin delayed detections relating to the frequency of merging\nwith in-clip consensus. Secondly, we note that end-to-end\napproaches still work better when training data is sufficient,\ni.e., in smaller vocabulary settings like YouTubeVIS [69] as\nshown in the appendix. But we think decoupled methods are\nmore promising in large-vocabulary/open-world settings.\n5. Conclusion\nWe present DEVA, a decoupled video segmentation ap-\nproach for \u2018tracking anything\u2019. It uses a bi-directional prop-\nagation technique that effectively scales image segmenta-\ntion methods to video data. Our approach critically lever-\nages external task-agnostic data to reduce reliance on the\ntarget task, thus generalizing better to tasks with scarce data\nthan end-to-end approaches. Combined with universal im-\nage segmentation models, our decoupled paradigm demon-\nstrates state-of-the-art performance as a first step towards\nopen-world large-vocabulary video segmentation.\nAcknowledgments.\nWork supported in part by NSF grants\n2008387, 2045586, 2106825, MRI 1725729 (HAL [28]), and\nNIFA award 2020-67021-32799.\n9\nReferences\n[1] Ali Athar, Alexander Hermans, Jonathon Luiten, Deva\nRamanan, and Bastian Leibe.\nTarvis:\nA unified ap-\nproach for target-based video segmentation. arXiv preprint\narXiv:2301.02657, 2023. 3\n[2] Ali Athar, Jonathon Luiten, Paul Voigtlaender, Tarasha Khu-\nrana, Achal Dave, Bastian Leibe, and Deva Ramanan.

In arXiv, 2023. 2\n12\nThis appendix is structured as follows:\n\u2022 We first provide implementation details of our tempo-\nral propagation network (Section A).\n\u2022 We then analyze the class-agnostic training data of the\ntemporal propagation network (Section B).\n\u2022 After that, we list additional details regarding our ex-\nperimental settings and results (Section C).\n\u2022 Next, we provide results on the small-vocabulary\nYouTube-VIS [69] dataset for reference (Section D).\n\u2022 Lastly, we present qualitative results (Section E).\nA. Implementation Details of Temporal Propa-\ngation\nA.1. Overview\nRecall that the temporal propagation model Prop(H, I)\ntakes a set of segmented frames (memory) H and a query\nimage I as input, and segments the query frame with the\nobjects in the memory. For instance, Prop ({I1, M1}, I2)\npropagates the segmentation M1 from the first frame I1 to\nthe second frame I2. The memory H is a compact repre-\nsentation computed from all past segmented frames.\nIn our implementation, we adopt the design of the inter-\nnal memory H from the recent Video Object Segmentation\n(VOS) approach XMem [9]. VOS algorithms are initial-\nized by a first-frame segmentation (in our case, the first in-\nclip consensus output), and segment new incoming query\nframes. XMem is an online algorithm that maintains an in-\nternal feature memory representation H. For each incoming\nframe I, it computes a query representation which is used\nto read from the feature memory. It then uses the memory\nreadout F to segment the query frame. The segmentation\nresult (Prop(H, I)) is used to update the internal represen-\ntation H. With an internal memory management mecha-\nnism [9], this design has a bounded GPU memory cost with\nrespect to the number of processed frames which is suitable\nfor processing long video sequences.\nWe refer readers to [9] for details regarding XMem. We\ndescribe core details below for completeness. We make a\nfew technical modifications to XMem to increase robust-\nness in our generalized setting, which we also document be-\nlow. We provide the full code at hkchengrex.github.\nio/Tracking-Anything-with-DEVA.\nA.2. Network Architecture\nThe temporal propagation network consists of four net-\nwork modules: a key encoder, a value encoder, a mask de-\ncoder, and a Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (Conv-\nGRU) [15].\nThe key encoder, implemented with a ResNet-50 [21],\ntakes an image as input and produces multi-scale features\nat the first (stride 4), second (stride 8), and third (stride 16)\nstages. The fourth stage is discarded. The feature in the\nthird stage is projected to a \u2018key\u2019, which is used for querying\nduring memory reading. After segmentation, if we decide\nto add the segmented query frame into the memory H, we\nwill re-use this \u2018key\u2019 in the memory.\nThe value encoder, implemented with a ResNet-18 [21],\ntakes an image and a corresponding object mask as inputs\nand produces a \u2018value\u2019 representation as part of the mem-\nory. We discard the fourth stage and only use the stride-16\noutput feature in the third stage. Objects are processed in-\ndependently (done in mini-batches during inference).\nThe mask decoder takes the memory readout F and\nmulti-scale skip connections from the key encoder as inputs\nand produces an object mask. It consists of three upsam-\npling blocks. Each upsampling block uses the output from\nthe previous layer as input, upsamples it bilinearly by a fac-\ntor of two, and fuses the upsampled result with the skip con-\nnection at the corresponding scale with a residual block with\ntwo 3 \u00d7 3 convolutions. A 3 \u00d7 3 convolution is used as the\nlast output layer to generate a single-channel (stride 4) logit\nand bilinearly upsamples it by four times to the original res-\nolution. Similar to the value encoder, objects are processed\nindependently, which can be done in mini-batches during\ninference. Soft-aggregation [46] is used to combine logits\nfor different objects as in [9].\nThe\nConvolutional\nGated\nRecurrent\nUnit\n(Conv-\nGRU) [15] takes the last hidden state and the output of every\nupsampling block in the mask decoder as input and pro-\nduces an updated hidden state. 3 \u00d7 3 convolutions are used\nas projections in the Conv-GRU.\nOur\nModifications.\nFirstly,\nin\nXMem\n[9],\nthe\n1024-channel third-stage feature from the key encoder\nis directly concatenated with the memory readout for\nmask decoding.\nFor efficiency, we instead first project\nthe 1024-channel feature to 512 channels with a 1 \u00d7 1\nconvolutional layer before concatenating it with the\nmemory readout.\nSecondly, in each upsampling block\nof the mask decoder, XMem uses a 3 \u00d7 3 convolution\nto pre-process the skip-connected feature. We replace it\nwith a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution. Moreover, XMem [9] and prior\nworks [46, 11] take the image, the target mask, and the sum\nof all non-target masks (excluding background) as input for\nthe value encoder. We discard the \u2018sum of all non-target\nmasks\u2019 as we note that it becomes uninformative when\nthere are many objects in the scene \u2013 typical in open-world\nscenarios. We notice a moderate speed-up (22.6\u219225.8 FPS\nin DAVIS-2017 [5]) from these modifications.\n13\nA.3. Feature Memory\nRepresentation.\nThe feature memory consists of three\nparts: a sensory memory, a working memory, and a long-\nterm memory. The sensory memory is represented by the\nhidden state of the Conv-GRU and contains positional in-\nformation for temporal consistency that is updated every\nframe. Both the working memory and the long-term mem-\nory are attention-based and contain key-value pairs. The\nworking memory is updated every r frames and has a max-\nimum capacity of Tmax frames. During each update, the\n\u2018key\u2019 feature from the key encoder and the \u2018value\u2019 feature\nfrom the value encoder will be appended to the working\nmemory after segmentation of the current frame. When the\nworking memory reaches its capacity, the oldest Tmax\u2212Tmin\nframes will be consolidated into the long-term memory.\nPlease refer to [9] for details.\nMemory\nReading.\nThe\nlast\nhidden\nstate\nof\nthe\nConv-GRU is used as the memory readout of the sen-\nsory memory.\nFor the working and long-term memory,\nwe compute a query from the query frame and perform\nspace-time memory reading [46] to read from both types\nof memory.\nFor spatial dimensions H, W, the memory\nreadout for the sensory memory is Ch \u00d7 H \u00d7 W and the\nmemory readout for the working/long-term memory is\nCv \u00d7H \u00d7W. In XMem, Ch = 64 and Cv = 512 and these\ntwo features are concatenated together as the final memory\nreadout F.\nOur Modifications.\nFor better temporal consistency, we\nexpand the channel size Ch of the sensory memory to\nCh = Cv = 512. For efficiency, we use \u2018addition\u2019 in-\nstead of the original \u2018concatenation\u2019 to fuse the memory\nreadout from the sensory memory with the working/long-\nterm memory. Besides, we supervise the sensory memory\nwith an auxiliary loss \u2013 a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution is applied to\nthe sensory memory to produce the weights and biases of\na linear classifier on the stride 16 image feature (from the\nkey encoder) for mask prediction. Cross-entropy loss with\na weight of 0.1 is applied on this predicted mask and the\nnetwork is trained end-to-end.\nA.4. Inference Hyperparameters\nFollowing [9], the sensory memory is updated every\nframe. A new memory frame is added to the working mem-\nory every r-th frame. We synchronize r with our in-clip\nconsensus frequency, such that every in-clip consensus re-\nsult is added to the working memory. Following the de-\nfault hyperparameters in [9], we set Tmax = 10, Tmin = 5,\nthe maximum number of long-term memory elements to be\n10, 000, and use top-k filtering [10] with k = 30.\nA.5. Training\nXMem is first pretrained on static image segmentation\ndatasets [56, 60, 72, 33, 8] by synthesizing small video clips\nof three frames with affine and thin-spline deformations. It\nis then trained on two video datasets: YouTubeVOS [65]\nand DAVIS [47] by sampling clips of length eight.\nOur Modifications.\nWe make three major modifications\nto the training process for better robustness:\n1. We introduce the more challenging OVIS [48] data\ninto training as we find models have already saturated\nand produced almost perfect segmentation results on\nDAVIS and YouTubeVOS during training.\n2. We use a \u2018stable\u2019 data augmentation pipeline which\nleads to better temporal consistency.\nCurrent state-\nof-the-art data augmentation pipelines use aggres-\nsive augmentation, applying different rotations [9] or\ncrops [70] to frames within the same sequence. This\nencourages an invariant appearance model but harms\nthe learning of temporal information. We instead use\nthe same rotation and crop augmentation for a video\nsequence. Figure S1 visualizes the difference.\n3. We clip the norm of the gradient at 3.0 during training.\nWe find that this leads to faster convergence and more\nstable training.\nWe use a batch size of 16, the same loss function (hard-\nmining cross-entropy loss with a warm-up and soft DICE\nloss) as XMem [9], and the AdamW [41] optimizer. Dur-\ning pre-training, we use a learning rate of 2e-5 for 80,000\niterations. During main training, we use a learning rate of\n1e-5 for 150,000 iterations with a learning rate decay of 0.1\nat the 120,000-th iteration and the 140,000-th iteration.\nA.6. Video Object Segmentation Evaluation\nWe compare our temporal propagation model with state-\nof-the-art methods on three common video object segmen-\ntation benchmarks: DAVIS-2017 validation/test-dev [47],\nYouTubeVOS-2019 validation [65], and MOSE valida-\ntion [16].\nTable S1 tabulates our results.\nWe resize all\ninput such that the shorter side is 480px and bilinearly up-\nsample the output back to the original resolution following\nXMem [9]. All frames in YouTubeVOS [65] are used by de-\nfault. Our simple modifications bring noticeable improve-\nments on all benchmarks. Though, we find that the over-\nall framework is more important than these design choices\n(Section A.7.2).\nA.7. Ablation Studies\nA.7.1\nOn VOS Tasks\nWe assess the effects of our modifications on the train-\ning process on VOS tasks which purely evaluate tempo-\nral propagation performance. In addition to the standard\nDAVIS [47] dataset, we additionally convert the validation\n14\nAOT augmentation\nXMem augmentation\nOur augmentation\nFigure S1.

Ta-\nble S3 (top) tabulates our findings. Note, our method still\nworks well even without our modifications to the tempo-\nral propagation network. We find the overall framework to\nbe more important than particular design choices within the\ntemporal propagation model.\n16\nB. Training Data of Temporal Propagation\nB.1. Sensitivity to Training Data\nWe train the temporal propagation on class-agnostic im-\nage segmentation and mask propagation data as described\nin Section A.5. We note that these datasets are cheap to\naccess and amass as they do not require class-specific an-\nnotations. Here, we evaluate the importance of large-scale\ntraining of the temporal propagation model. We vary the\namount of class-agnostic video-level training data under\ntwo settings: 1) with full image pretraining, and all three\nmask propagation datasets (DAVIS [47], YouTubeVOS [65]\nand OVIS [48]), and 2) without image pre-taining and us-\ning YouTubeVOS as the only training data. Table S2 (bot-\ntom) tabulates our findings on the VIPSeg [45] validation\nset. The performance of our model decays gracefully with\nfewer training data.\nB.2. Class Overlaps with VIPSeg\nWhile we train the temporal propagation network in a\nclass-agnostic setting, the segmented objects in the training\nset might have object categories that overlap with the target\ntask (e.g., with the classes in VIPSeg [45]). Here, we in-\nvestigate the effect of this overlap of temporal propagation\ntraining data with target task data on the final performance.\nFor this, we train the temporal propagation network with\nonly YouTubeVOS [65] data which has 65 object categories\n(other datasets that we use for training have no class anno-\ntation). We manually match these 65 categories with the\nclasses in VIPSeg [45] to partition the classes of VIPSeg\ninto three sets: \u2018overlapping\u2019, \u2018non-overlapping\u2019, or \u2018am-\nbiguous\u2019.1\nWe then evaluate the final task performance\non the overlapping and the non-overlapping sets separately,\nwhile ignoring the \u2018ambiguous\u2019 set. We perform the same\nevaluation on an end-to-end method, Video-K-Net [34], as\na measure of \u2018baseline difficulty\u2019 for each set. Table S4 tab-\nulates our findings. We observe no significant difference\nbetween the overlapping and non-overlapping set when ac-\ncounting for the difficulty delta (\u2206) observed in the base-\nline. This indicates that our class-agnostic training does not\noverfit to the object categories in the training set.\nC. Detailed Experimental Settings and Results\nC.1. Large-Scale Video Panoptic Segmentation\nFollowing the standard practice [45], we use the 720p\nversion of the VIPSeg [45] dataset. We evaluate using its\nvalidation set (343 videos) and compute VPQ/STQ using\n1The overlapping set includes flag, parasol or umbrella, car, bus, truck,\nbicycle, motorcycle, ship or boat, airplane, person, cat, dog, horse, cattle,\nskateboard, ball, box, bottle or cup, table or desk, mirror, and train (21\nin total). The ambiguous set includes other animal, bag or package, toy,\nand textiles (4 in total). The remaining (99) classes in VIPSeg are in the\nnon-overlapping set.\nMethod\nVPQoverlap VPQno-overlap \u2206overlap\u2192non-overlap\nVideo-K-Net\n25.0\n25.7\n+0.7\nOurs\n38.1\n38.6\n+0.5\nTable S4. Performance comparison on different classes of VIPSeg\nthat overlap or do not overlap with the training data of tempo-\nral propagation. As a baseline, we use Video-K-Net-R50 [34].\nFor ours, we use Mask2Former-R50 with a temporal propagation\nmodel that is only trained on YouTubeVOS [65] and evaluated in\na semi-online setting.\nthe official codebase.\nDuring temporal propagation, we\ndownsample the videos such that the shortest side is 480px\nand bilinearly upsample the result back to the original reso-\nlution following [9].\nVideo Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) requires the predic-\ntion of class labels. We obtain these labels from the image\nsegmentation model and use online majority voting to de-\ntermine the output label. Formally, we keep a list of class\nlabels Cli for each object ri. When an existing (propagated)\nsegment ri matches with a segment from the in-clip con-\nsensus cj, i.e., aij = 1, we take the class label from the\nconsensus cj and append it to the list Cli. At the output of\nevery frame, we determine the class label associated with\nsegment ri by performing majority voting in Cli. Note, in\naccordance with VPS evaluation [27], an object can only\nhave one class label throughout the video. This means a\nchange in class label necessitates a change in object id,\nwhich we also implemented. Thus, a change in class la-\nbel might lead to lower association accuracy. An alterna-\ntive algorithm would be to use the final major voting result\nto retroactively apply the class label in all frames, which\nwould however not be strictly online/semi-online.\nRunning time Analysis\nUnder our default semi-online\nsetting, we use a clip size of 3 and perform merging ev-\nery 5 frames (i.e., invoking the image model on 60% of all\nframes). We report time on VIPSeg [45], averaged across\nall frames, on an A6000 GPU. The mask propagation mod-\nule takes 83ms per frame (VIPSeg has more objects per\nvideo than the standard VOS timing benchmark DAVIS-\n2017). For every merge, pre-processing (spatial alignment\nand finding pairwise IoU) takes 211ms, and solving the\ninteger program takes 15ms. For the image model (R50\nbackbone), both Video-K-Net [34] and Mask2Former [7]\ntake around 200ms per frame. Overall, our method runs\nat 4.0fps. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art Video-K-Net runs at\n4.9fps. Ours is 18% slower but has a 52% higher VPQ.\nC.2. Open-World Video Segmentation\nWe evaluate on the validation (993 videos) and test (1421\nvideos) sets of BURST [2]. As in Section C.1, we down-\nsample the videos during temporal propagation such that\nthe shortest side is 480px and bilinearly upsample the result\n17\nback to the original resolution following [9]. For efficiency,\nwe process only every three frames. Since the ground-truth\nis sparse (annotated every 24 or 30 frames), we can still per-\nform a complete evaluation.\nFor the Mask2Former [7] image model, we follow\nBURST [2] and use the best-performing Swin-L checkpoint\ntrained on COCO [37] provided by the authors. For the En-\ntitySeg [49] image model, we also use the best available\nSwin-L model checkpoint trained on COCO [37]. For over-\nlapping predictions, we use the post-processing for panoptic\nsegmentation in Mask2Former [7] to resolve them.\nWe assess Open World Tracking Accuracy (OWTA) us-\ning official tools.\nOWTA is the geometric mean of De-\ntection Recall (DetRe) and Association Accuracy (AssA).\nPlease refer to [2] for details. For completeness, we addi-\ntionally report DetRe and AssA of baselines and our method\nin Table S5.\nC.3. Referring Video Segmentation\nTo\nevaluate\non\nRef-DAVIS\n[25]\nand\nRef-\nYouTubeVOS [55], we use ReferFormer Swin-L [64]\nas the image model. The network is first pretrained on Ref-\nCOCO [71], Ref-COCO+ [71], and G-Ref [44] datasets\nand finetuned on Ref-YouTubeVOS [55] following [64].\nUnlike in video panoptic segmentation or open-world video\nsegmentation, we do not need to use integer programming\nto associate segments from the image model in different\nframes.\nThis is because each segment corresponds to a\nknown language expression. Thus, we process each object\nindependently and use argmax to fuse the final segmen-\ntations. As mentioned in the main paper, we employ an\noffline setting as in prior works [55, 64, 17].\nIn the offline setting, we first perform in-clip consensus\nby selecting 10 uniformly spaced frames in the video and\nusing the frame with the highest confidence given by the\nimage model as a \u2018key frame\u2019 for aligning the other frames.\nSoft probability maps are used in the consensus to preserve\nconfidence levels in the prediction. We then forward- and\nbackward-propagate from the key frame without incorpo-\nrating additional image segmentations.\nFormally, for a given object, we denote its soft proba-\nbility map and confidence score given by the image model\nas Prt \u2208 [0, 1]H\u00d7W and ct \u2208 [0, 1] respectively. We de-\nnote the frame index of the ten chosen frames as Tc =\n{t1, t2, ..., t10}.\nWe aim to compute a soft probability consensus\nCstk at a keyframe index tk by a weighted summa-\ntion of the soft probability maps of the chosen frames\n{Prt1, Prt2, ..., Prt10}:\nCstk =\nX\ni\u2208Tc\nwiPri,\n(S1)\nwhere wi is a weighting coefficient, with P\ni wi = 1.\nWe use the frame with the highest confidence predicted\nby the image model as the keyframe:\ntk = argmaxi\u2208Tcci.\n(S2)\nWe compute the weighting coefficients using a softmax\nof the confidences such that we weigh confident predictions\nmore:\nwi =\neci\nP\ni\u2208Tc eci .\n(S3)\nAfter the consensus, Cstk is used to initialize forward\nand backward propagation from frame tk without incorpo-\nrating additional image segmentations. The propagation is\nimplemented as standard semi-supervised video object seg-\nmentation inference with the keyframe as initial guidance.\nDuring propagation, the internal memory H is updated ev-\nery 5 frames using its own prediction as in [9].\nC.4. Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation\nFor single-object unsupervised video object segmenta-\ntion (DAVIS-2016 [47]), we use DIS [51] as the image\nsegmentation model.\nSince it does not provide segmen-\ntation confidence, we approximate it with the normalized\narea of the predicted mask to ignore null detections, i.e.,\nci =\n1\nHW \u2225Pri\u22251.\nFor multi-object unsupervised video object segmenta-\ntion (DAVIS-2017 [5]), we follow our semi-online proto-\ncol in open-world video segmentation. The exception being\nDAVIS-2017 [5] allows a maximum of 20 objects in the\nprediction. We overcome this limitation online by only ac-\ncepting the first 20 objects and discarding the rest. When\nthere are more than 20 objects in the frame, we prioritize\nthe ones with larger areas as they are less likely to be noisy.\nD. Results on YouTube-VIS\nHere we present additional results on the small-\nvocabulary YouTube-VIS [69] dataset, but unsurprisingly\nrecent end-to-end specialized approaches perform better be-\ncause a sufficient amount of data is available in this case.\nFor this task, we use our online video panoptic segmen-\ntation setting. Besides the difference in the scale of vo-\ncabularies, our method assumes that no two objects occupy\nthe same pixel, and produces a non-overlapping mask. Al-\nthough this assumption is usually true, it harms the Average\nPrecision (AP) evaluation of our method in VIS, with other\nmethods typically outputting many (\u2265100) potentially over-\nlapping proposals for higher recall. We provide our result\nin Table S6.\nE. Qualitative Results\nE.1. Visualization\nFor all results (see our project page), we associate each\nobject id with a unique color.

Moreover, memory or compu-\ntational constraints limit the temporal range of feature prop-\nagation and video Transformer, preventing exploration of\ncorrespondence information from distant frames. To address\nthese issues, we propose an improved framework, called\nProPainter, which involves enhanced ProPagation and an ef-\nficient Transformer. Specifically, we introduce dual-domain\npropagation that combines the advantages of image and fea-\nture warping, exploiting global correspondences reliably.\nWe also propose a mask-guided sparse video Transformer,\nwhich achieves high efficiency by discarding unnecessary\nand redundant tokens. With these components, ProPainter\noutperforms prior arts by a large margin of 1.46 dB in PSNR\nwhile maintaining appealing efficiency.\n1. Introduction\nVideo inpainting (VI) aims to fill gaps or missing re-\ngions in a video with visually consistent content while\nensuring spatial and temporal coherence. This technique\nhas broad applications, including video completion [10],\nobject removal [9, 37], video restoration [31], watermark,\nand logo removal [19]. VI is challenging because it re-\nquires establishing accurate correspondence across distant\nframes for information aggregation. To address this chal-\nlenge, various mechanisms have been explored, such as\n3D CNN [6, 11], video internal learning [41, 27], flow-\nguided propagation [37, 10, 43, 42, 19], and video Trans-\nformer [22, 42, 19]. Among these mechanisms, flow-guided\npropagation and video Transformer have become mainstream\nchoices for VI due to their promising performance.\narXiv:2309.03897v1  [cs.CV]  7 Sep 2023\nPropagation-based methods in VI can be divided into\ntwo categories: image propagation and feature propagation.\nThe former employs bidirectional global propagation in the\nimage domain with a pre-completed flow field. While this\napproach can fill the majority of holes in a corrupted video,\nit requires an additional image or video inpainting network\nafter propagation to hallucinate the remaining missing re-\ngions. This isolated two-step process can result in unpleasant\nartifacts and texture misalignment due to inaccurate flow, as\nshown in Figure 1(f). To address this issue, a recent ap-\nproach called E2FGVI [19] implements propagation in the\nfeature domain, incorporating flow completion and content\nhallucination modules in an end-to-end framework. With the\nlearnable warping module, the feature propagation module\nrelieves the pressure of having inaccurate flow. However,\nE2FGVI employs a downsampled flow field to match the\nspatial size of the feature domain, limiting the precision of\nspatial warping and the efficacy of propagation, potentially\nresulting in blurry results. Moreover, feature propagation can\nonly be performed within a short range of video sequences\ndue to memory and computational constraints, hindering\npropagation from distant frames and leading to missing tex-\nture, as shown in Figure 1(g).\nBoth image- and feature-based propagation have their\npros and cons. In this study, we carefully revisit the VI prob-\nlem and investigate the possibility of combining the strengths\nof both techniques. We demonstrate that with systematic\nredesigns and adaptation of best practices in the literature,\nwe can achieve dual-domain propagation, as illustrated in\nFigure 1(a). To achieve reliable and efficient information\npropagation across a video, we identify several essential\ncomponents: i) Efficient GPU-based propagation with relia-\nbility check \u2013 Unlike previous methods that rely on complex\nand time-consuming CPU-centric operations, such as index-\ning flow trajectories, we perform global image propagation\non GPU with flow consistency check. This implementation\ncan be inserted at the beginning of the inpainting network\nand jointly trained with the other modules. Thus, subse-\nquent modules are able to correct any propagation errors\nand benefit from the long-range correspondence information\nprovided by the global propagation, resulting in a significant\nperformance improvement. ii) Improved feature propagation\n\u2013 Our implementation of feature propagation leverages flow-\nbased deformable alignment [3], which improves robustness\nto occlusion and inaccurate flow completion compared to\nE2FGVI [19]. iii) Efficient flow completion \u2013 We design\na highly efficient recurrent network to complete flows for\ndual-domain propagation, which is over 40 times (\u223c192\nfps1) faster than SOTA method [43] while maintaining com-\nparable performance. We demonstrate that these designs are\nessential to achieve efficient propagation of global and local\ninformation without texture misalignment or blurring in the\n1Tested on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (32G).\nfilling results. An example is shown in Figure 1(h).\nIn addition to dual-domain propagation, we introduce an\nefficient mask-guided sparse video Transformer tailored\nfor the VI task. The classic spatiotemporal Transformer\nis computationally intensive due to the quadratic number\nof interactions between video tokens, making it intractable\nfor high-resolution and long temporal-length videos. For\ninstance, contemporary Transformer-based methods, Fuse-\nFormer [22] and FGT [42], are unable to handle 480p videos\nwith a 32G GPU1 due to excessive memory demands. How-\never, we observe that the inpainting mask usually covers\nonly a small local region, such as the object area2. Moreover,\nadjacent frames contain highly redundant textures. These\nobservations suggest that spatiotemporal attention is unneces-\nsary for most unmasked areas, and it is adequate to consider\nonly alternating interval frames in attention computation.\nMotivated by these observations, we redesign the Trans-\nformer by discarding unnecessary and redundant windows\nin the query and key/value space, respectively, significantly\nreducing computational complexity and memory without\ncompromising inpainting performance.\nThe main contribution of this work is to provide a system-\natic study into the core problem of VI and offer a practical\nsolution that is both effective and efficient. Propagating in-\nformation in two distinct image and feature domains and\ncombining them in a unified framework with fast GPU im-\nplementation is new for VI task. The mask-guided sparse\nvideo Transformer also offers practical insights into design-\ning efficient spatiotemporal attention for VI task. Compared\nto the state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves superior\nperformance with a large margin of 1.46 dB in PSNR, while\nalso significantly reducing memory consumption.\n2. Related Work\nNumerous deep networks with different modules and\npropagation strategies have achieved significant success in\nvideo inpainting. These approaches can be broadly catego-\nrized into four categories:\n3D convolution. Earlier video inpainting networks typically\nemployed 3D CNNs [6, 33, 11] or temporal shift [7] to aggre-\ngate spatiotemporal information. These methods often suffer\nfrom limited receptive fields in both temporal and spatial\ndimensions and misalignment between adjacent frames. As\na result, they are less effective in exploring distant content.\nInternal learning. To fully exploit content of a video, some\nstudies [41, 27, 30] adopt internal learning to encode and\nmemorize the appearance and motion of the video through\ndeep networks. However, these methods require individual\ntraining for each test video, limiting their practical use.\nFlow-guided propagation. Optical flow [13, 18, 46] and\nhomography [17, 1] are commonly used in video inpainting\n2Object regions account for only 13.6% of the DAVIS [28] dataset.\nnetworks to align neighboring reference frames to enhance\ntemporal coherence and aggregation. However, incomplete\noptical flow may not provide valid propagation for complet-\ning missing regions. To address this issue, recent flow-based\nmethods [37, 10, 12, 43, 42] focus on first completing the\nflow and then use it as a guidance for pixel-domain propa-\ngation. This approach simplifies RGB pixel inpainting by\ncompleting a less complex flow field. However, this of-\nfline propagation is independent of the subsequent learnable\nrefinement module, making it difficult to correct content\ndistortion caused by inaccurate propagation. Inspired by\nflow-guided recurrent networks [2, 3], Li et al. [19] proposed\nan end-to-end framework that jointly learns flow completion\nand feature propagation in the downsampled feature domain.\nHowever, downsampled flow reduces its ability to provide\nspatially precise warping. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose more faithful propagation by performing both pixel\nand feature propagation with flow consistency checks.\nVideo Transformer. Attention [17, 26, 11, 18] and Trans-\nformer [40, 21, 22, 1, 19, 42] blocks adopt spatiotemporal\nattention to explore recurrent textures in a video. This en-\nables them to retrieve and aggregate tokens with similar tex-\nture or context for filling in missing regions. Liu et al. [22]\npresent a fine-grained fusion Transformer based on the soft\nsplit and composition operations, which further boosts video\ninpainting performance. However, these methods are com-\nputationally and memory intensive. To address this issue,\nsome Transformers [21, 1, 42] decouple the spatiotempo-\nral attention by performing spatial and temporal attention\nalternately, while others [19, 42] adopt window-based Trans-\nformers [23, 38] to reduce the spatial range for efficient video\nattention. However, these approaches still involve redundant\nor unnecessary tokens. Inspired by token pruning for adap-\ntive attention [29, 39, 25, 20, 15] in high-level tasks, our\nstudy proposes a more efficient and faster video Transformer\nwith sparse spatiotemporal attention and a largely reduced\ntoken space while maintaining inpainting performance.\nRecent studies [18, 19, 42] have demonstrated the effec-\ntiveness of combining flow-guided propagation with Trans-\nformer in VI. However, the high memory requirement of\nthe Transformer limits the propagation range during both\ntraining and inference, severely hindering the ability to prop-\nagate temporally distant content. In this paper, we also adopt\nthis combination strategy but propose a reliable propagation\nscheme, along with an efficient Transformer model that fully\nexploits the benefits of long-range propagation and atten-\ntion. This results in superior inpainting performance while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.\n3. Methodology\nGiven a masked video sequence X\n=\n{Xt\n\u2208\nRH\u00d7W \u00d73}T\nt=1, which has a sequence length of T, along\nwith corresponding mask sequence M\n=\n{Mt\n\u2208\nRH\u00d7W \u00d71}T\nt=1, the objective of video inpainting is to gen-\nerate visually consistent and coherent content within the\ncorrupted or missing regions. ProPainter, as shown in Fig-\nure 2, is composed of three key components: Recurrent Flow\nCompletion (RFC), Dual-Domain Propagation (DDP), and\nMask-guided Sparse Video Transformer (MSVT). Before\nfeeding the sequence into ProPainter, we extract the for-\nward and backward optical flows, denoted as F f = {F f\nt =\nFt\u2192t+1 \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d72}T \u22121\nt=1 and F b = {F b\nt = Ft+1\u2192t \u2208\nRH\u00d7W \u00d72}T \u22121\nt=1 from a given video X. We first use RFC\nto complete the corrupted flow fields. Guided by the com-\npleted flows, we then perform global image propagation\nand local feature propagation sequentially.\nFinally, we\nemploy multiple MSVT blocks to refine propagation fea-\ntures and a decoder to reconstruct the final video sequence\n\u02c6Y = { \u02c6Yt \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d73}T\nt=1. We introduce the specific design\nof each component below.\n3.1. Recurrent Flow Completion\nPre-trained flow completion modules are commonly used\nin video inpainting networks [37, 10, 43, 42]. The rationale\nbehind this approach is that it is simpler to complete missing\nflow than to directly fill in complex RGB content [37]. Fur-\nthermore, using completed flow to propagate pixels reduces\nthe pressure of video inpainting and better maintains tem-\nporal coherence. E2FGVI [19] proposes to insert the flow\ncompletion module into an end-to-end framework, which\nsimplifies the inpainting pipeline. However, flow completion\nmodules that are learned together with inpainting-oriented\nlosses can result in a suboptimal learning process and less\naccurate completed flow. Moreover, the downsampled flow\nmay limit the precision of spatial warping and the efficacy\nof propagation, which can result in blurred and incomplete\nfilling content, as shown in Figure 1(g). Therefore, an in-\ndependent flow completion model is not only important but\nalso necessary for video inpainting.\nTo maintain temporal coherence while completing flows,\nprevious methods [37, 42] adopt sliding-window-based net-\nworks to aggregate optical flow information from adjacent\nframes, which are highly correlated. However, these meth-\nods can be computationally expensive as repeated inferences\nare required in the overlapping frames. To improve efficiency\nand enhance flow coherence further, we adopt a recurrent\nnetwork [2, 3] for flow completion, which provides precise\noptical flow fields for subsequent propagation modules.\nWe complete forward and backward flows using the same\nprocess, thus we denote F f and F b as F for simplicity.\nWe first encode the flows Ft into a downsampled feature\nft with a downsampling ratio of 8. Next, we employ de-\nformable alignment [3] that is based on deformable con-\nvolution (DCN) [8, 45], to bidirectionally propagate the\nflow information from nearby frames for flow completion.\nFor simplicity, we only describe the backward propagation\nRecurrent Flow Completion\n\u2026\n\u2026\nMasked Flows\n\u2026\n\u2026\nCompleted Flows\n\u2026\n\u2026\nImage Prop.

First, we employ a highly efficient recurrent flow completion network to complete the corrupted flow\nfields. We then perform propagation in both image and feature domains, which are jointly trained. This approach enables us to\nexplore correspondences from both global and local temporal frames, resulting in more reliable and effective propagation. The\nsubsequent mask-guided sparse Transformer blocks refine the propagated features using spatiotemporal attention, aided by a\nsparse strategy that considers only a subset of the tokens. This enhances efficiency and reduces memory consumption, while\nmaintaining performance.\nprocess here. Taking the concatenated feature c(ft, \u02c6ft+1),\nwhere \u02c6ft+1 is the propagation feature of the t+1-th frame,\nas input a lightweight network with a stack of convolutions\nis employed to compute DCN offsets ot\u2192t+1 and modula-\ntion masks mt\u2192t+1. DCN alignment propagation can be\nexpressed as:\n\u02c6ft = R\n\u0000D( \u02c6ft+1; ot\u2192t+1, mt\u2192t+1), ft\n\u0001\n,\n(1)\nwhere D(\u00b7) denotes deformable convolution, and R(\u00b7) de-\nnotes the convolution layers that fuse the aligned and current\nfeatures. In this way, information of (t + 1)-th flow can\nbe adaptively transferred to the current t-th flow. Finally, a\ndecoder is used to reconstruct the completed flows \u02c6Ft. For\nclarity, an illustration of deformable alignment is provided\nin the supplementary material.\n3.2. Dual-domain Propagation\nAfter completing the flow, we perform global and local\npropagation in the image and feature domains, respectively.\nWe employ distinct alignment operations and strategies for\neach domain. Both domains involve bidirectional propa-\ngation in the forward and backward directions. Here, we\nelaborate on the backward propagation since the forward\npropagation follows the same process.\nImage propagation. To maintain efficiency and simplicity,\nwe adopt flow-based warping for image propagation, along\nwith a simple reliability check strategy. This process does\nnot involve any learnable operation. In the case of a video\nsequence X with binary masks M (a pixel with value 1 repre-\nsents masked region) and completed flows \u02c6F, we first check\nthe validity of completed flow based on forward-backward\nconsistency error [37, 10]:\nEt\u2192t+1\n\u0000p\n\u0001\n=\n\r\r\r \u02c6Ft\u2192t+1\n\u0000p\n\u0001\n+ \u02c6Ft+1\u2192t\n\u0000p + \u02c6Ft\u2192t+1(p)\n\u0001\r\r\r\n2\n2,\n(2)\nwhere p denotes a pixel position of the current frame. Only\npixels with a small consistency error will be propagated,\ni.e., C1 : Et\u2192t+1(p) < \u03f5, where \u03f5 is a threshold and set to\n5. Furthermore, we only consider the masked areas of the\ncurrent frame Xt that needs to be filled, i.e., C2 : Mt(p) = 1,\nand we only propagate the unmasked areas from neighboring\nframe Xt+1, i.e., C3 : Mt+1(p + \u02c6Ft\u2192t+1(p)) = 0. By\nenforcing the three constraints, a reliable propagation area\nAr is identified as:\nAr\n\u0000p\n\u0001\n=\n(\n1\nif p \u2208 C1 \u2229 C2 \u2229 C3,\n0\notherwise.\n(3)\nThe process of image propagation is expressed as:\n\u02c6Xt = W\n\u0000Xt+1, \u02c6Ft\u2192t+1\n\u0001\n\u2217 Ar + Xt \u2217\n\u00001 \u2212 Ar\n\u0001\n,\n(4)\nwhere W(\u00b7) denotes warping operation. To ensure contin-\nuous propagation, we promptly update the mask Mt of the\ncurrent frame and convert the propagated area to the un-\nmasked status by updating masks via \u02c6\nMt = Mt \u2212 Ar. After\nglobal image propagation, we obtain a partially filled video\nsequence \u02c6X, which greatly eases the learning process for\nsubsequent modules.\nFeature propagation.\nWe use an image encoder with\nthe same structure as previous works [22, 19] to extract\nfeatures from a local sequence \u02c6XTl\nt=1, denoted as {et \u2208\nR\nH\n4 \u00d7 W\n4 \u00d7C}Tl\nt=1. Similar to E2FGVI [19], we also adopt\nflow-guided deformable alignment module [3] for feature\npropagation, which has demonstrated remarkable benefits\nDCN\nMasks\nDCN\nOffsets\nWarp\nConv Layers\nDCN\nConv\nLayers\n!!\n!\"\"\u2193\n\"\"\u2193\n#\"$%\u2192\"\n$%\"$%\u2192\"\n\u2193\n$( \u0302'!\"#)\nc\n\u0302!!\n\u0302)\"$%\nPropagation Flow\nCondition Pool\nFigure 3: Flow-guided deformable alignment is effective\nby taking reliable completed flows and mask-aware condi-\ntions. We concatenate the validated flow map, original mask,\nand updated mask into conditions to produce DCN offsets\n(residue to optical flow). A DCN is then applied to align the\npropagation feature from the previous frame. Finally, a CNN\nblock is employed to fuse the current and aligned features,\nachieving the propagation feature of the current frame.\nin various low-level video tasks [5, 4, 44]. Unlike the de-\nformable alignment used in Sec. 3.1 that directly learns DCN\noffsets, flow-guided deformable alignment employs the com-\npleted flow as a base offset and refines it by learning off-\nset residue. However, our design differs from E2FGVI in\nthat we offer richer conditions for learning DCN offsets.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, apart from the current feature\net, warped propagation feature W(\u02c6et+1, \u02c6F \u2193\nt\u2192t+1), and com-\npleted flows \u02c6F \u2193\nt\u2192t+1, we additionally introduce the flow\nvalid map Vt+1\u2192t calculated by consistency check (Eq. 2),\nas well as the original mask M \u2193\nt , and updated mask \u02c6\nM \u2193\nt\nafter image propagation. With these conditions, a stack of\nconvolutions is employed to predict the DCN offset residue\neot\u2192t+1 and modulation masks mt\u2192t+1. The flow-guided\nDCN alignment propagation is expressed as:\n\u02c6et = R\n\u0000D(\u02c6et+1; \u02c6F \u2193\nt\u2192t+1 + eot\u2192t+1, mt\u2192t+1), ft\n\u0001\n,\n(5)\nwhere \u2193 denotes downsampling. The improved reliability\nof flow and the additional awareness of mask as a condition\nmake our flow-guided deformable alignment module more\nstable to learn than previous designs [3, 19]. The current\nstep is able to focus more on truly challenging regions where\nflow is invalid and former image propagation is unreliable.\n3.3. Mask-Guided Sparse Video Transformer\nWhile video Transformers have achieved excellent per-\nformance in video inpainting, they can be computationally\nand memory intensive, posing a challenge to their practical\napplication. E2FGVI and FGT have addressed this issue\nby using window-based Transformer blocks, but they still\nhave some efficiency limitations. To overcome this, we pro-\npose a novel sparse video Transformer that builds on the\nwindow-based approach.

To reduce\ncomputational complexity and memory usage, our mask-\nguided sparse Transformer filters out unnecessary and redun-\ndant windows in the query and key/value space, respectively,\nbefore applying self-attention. To enlarge spatial interrela-\ntion range, we also adopt the window expand strategy [38]\nand pooling global tokens [42, 19].\nEl \u2208 RTl\u00d7 H\n4 \u00d7 W\n4 \u00d7C, we use the soft split operation [22] to\ngenerate patch embeddings Z \u2208 RTl\u00d7M\u00d7N\u00d7Cz. We parti-\ntion Z into m \u00d7 n non-overlapping windows, resulting in\npartitioned features Zw \u2208 RTl\u00d7m\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w\u00d7Cz, where m\u00d7n\nand h \u00d7 w are the number and size of the windows, respec-\ntively. We obtain the query Q, key K, and value V from Zw\nthrough linear layers. We design sparse strategies for both\nquery and key/value spaces separately. Note that we also\napply the window expand strategy [22] and integrate global\ntokens [42] into key and value, enabling us to use a small\nwindow size of 5 \u00d7 9 in our experiments. We omit them\nfrom the following discussion since they do not affect our\nsparse strategy designs.\nSparse Query Space. We observe that mask regions of-\nten occupy only a small area of the video, such as in the\ncase of object removal in the DAVIS [28] dataset, where\nthe proportion of object regions is only 13.6%. This indi-\ncates that spatiotemporal attention may not be necessary\nfor all query windows. To exploit this observation, we se-\nlectively apply attention to query windows that intersect\nwith the mask regions. Specifically, we first use nearest\nneighbor interpolation to downsample the mask sequence\nM \u2208 RTl\u00d7H\u00d7W to M \u2193 \u2208 RTl\u00d7m\u00d7n, where m \u00d7 n is the\nnumber of non-overlapping windows after partitioning. We\nthen sum it up in the temporal dimension and obtain sparse\nmask SQ \u2208 Rm\u00d7n for query cubes following the equation:\nSQ = Clip\n\u0010 XTl\nt=1 M \u2193\nt , 1\n\u0011\n,\n(6)\nwhere Clip represents a clipping function that set SQ to 1 if\nPTl\nt=1 M \u2193\nt > 0. In other words, if the query cube at a win-\ndow (i, j) has never contained any mask region in the past\nframes, then SQ(i, j) = 0, indicating that spatiotemporal\nattention within this window can be skipped.\nTable 1: Quantitative comparisons on YouTube-VOS [36] and DAVIS [28] datasets.

Due to the highly redundant and\nrepetitive textures in adjacent frames, it is unnecessary to\ninclude all frames as key/value tokens in each Transformer\nblock. Instead, we will only include strided temporal frames\nalternately, with a temporal stride of 2 in our design. That is,\nin each odd-numbered Transformer block, only odd-number\nframes are activated to participate in self-attention with their\nkey and value, while even-number blocks include only even-\nnumber frames. By doing so, the key and value space is\nreduced by half, effectively reducing the computation and\nmemory cost of the Transformer module. After filtering out\nunnecessary and redundant windows based on our sparse\nstrategy, we perform self-attention on the remaining win-\ndows to extract refined features. These features are then\ngathered using a soft composition operation [22] for subse-\nquent modules. Experimental results suggest that our design\nsignificantly reduces the computational cost of video Trans-\nformers while maintaining performance for video inpainting.\n3.4. Training Objectives\nFlow Completion. We utilize L1 loss as the reconstruction\nloss and a second-order smoothness constraint on the flow\nfield [24] to promote the collinearity of neighboring flows\nand thus enhance the smoothness of the completed flow field.\nVideo Inpainting. We adopt L1 loss as the reconstruction\nloss for all pixels. To enhance the realistic and temporal\nconsistency of video inpainting results, we also employ an\nadversarial loss that is measured using a T-PatchGAN [6]\ndiscriminator. The details and formulation of these losses\nare provided in the supplementary material.\n4. Experiments\nDatasets. We use the training set of YouTube-VOS [36] with\n3471 video sequences to train our networks. Two widely-\nused test sets are adopted for evaluation: YouTube-VOS [36]\nand DAVIS [28], which consist of 508 and 90 video se-\nquences, respectively. For the DAVIS test set, following\nFuseFormer [22] and E2FGVI [19], we use 50 video clips\nfor evaluations. During training, we follow [13, 17, 22, 19]\nand generate stationary and object masks in a random fash-\nion to simulate the masks in video completion and object\nremoval tasks. As for evaluation, we adopt the stationary\nmasks provided in [19] to calculate quantitative scores, and\nthe object masks are extracted from their segmentation la-\nbels for qualitative comparisons. Video frames are sized to\n432 \u00d7 240 for training and evaluation.\nTraining Details and Metrics. We use RAFT [32] to ex-\ntract optical flow in our approach. For training the RFC\nnetwork, we set the flow sequence length to 10 and perform\ndeformable propagation on feature maps that are downsam-\npled by a factor of 8 for faster processing. We adopt 8\nTransformer blocks for the inpainting modules and use a\nlocal video sequence of length 10. The Transformer window\nsize is 5\u00d79, and the extended size is half of the window size.\nWe train both the RFC and inpainting modules using the\nAdam [14] optimizer with a batch size of 8, setting the initial\nlearning rate to 10\u22124 and running 700k iterations3 for each.\nWe implement our method using the PyTorch framework and\ntrain it on 8 NVIDIA Tesla V100 (32G) GPUs.\nWe employ the widely used PSNR and SSIM metrics [35]\nto evaluate the reconstruction performance and VFID [34]\nscores to measure the perceptual similarity between input\nvideos and outputs, as used in recent video inpainting stud-\nies [22, 19]. Additionally, we report the flow warping error\nEwarp [16] to assess the temporal consistency and smooth-\nness of the resulting video sequences.\n3We set 450k training iterations for ablation study.\nMasked Frames\nFuseFormer\nFGT\nE2FGVI\nProPainter (Ours)\nFigure 5: Qualitative comparisons on both video completion and object removal. Our ProPainter exhibits superiority in\nproducing complete and faithful textures, resulting in enhanced spatiotemporal coherence for video inpainting.\n4.1. Comparisons\nQuantitative Evaluation. We compare ProPainter with nine\nstate-of-the-art methods including DFVI [37], CPNet [17],\nFGVC [10], STTN [40], TSAM [46], Fuseformer [22],\nISVI [43], FGT [42], and E2FGVI [19] on both YouTube-\nVOS [36] and DAVIS [28]. Thanks to the efficient design,\nProPainter uses a temporal length of 20 for inference. Ta-\nble 1 shows that ProPainter outperforms other methods in all\nquantitative metrics, especially on the DAVIS dataset, where\nour method surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 1.14 dB\nin PSNR. The results suggest that our method has superior\ninpainting capability, enabling it to produce higher-quality,\nfaithful, and seamless videos.\nQualitative Evaluation. For the visual comparison, we\ncompare our method with FuseFormer [22], FGT [42],\nand E2FGVI [19], which are representative methods of\nTransformer-, image propagation-, and feature propagation-\nbased approaches, respectively. Figure 5 presents four com-\nparison results for video completion and object removal. Our\nmethod uses dual-domain propagation to ensure reliable and\nlong-range propagation. It completes missing regions with\ncoherence and clear contents, while other compared methods\ntend to fail or produce unpleasant inpainting results such as\ntexture distortions and black hazy region in FGT [42] results,\nas well as artifacts in FuseFormer [22] and E2FGVI [19].\nEfficiency Comparison. Table 1 presents the efficiency\ncomparisons between all methods in terms of FLOPs and\nrunning time. The FLOPs of all methods are computed\nbased on a temporal length of 10.

To keep efficiency, we use only five iterations of\nthe RAFT network to calculate optical flow.\nFlow Completion Comparisons. We compare our recurrent\nflow network with previous approaches [37, 10, 43] on both\nYouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets. Table 2 presents the\nend-point-error (EPE) of flow completion and running time\nof each method. Our recurrent network offers a dual benefit\nwith high accuracy and efficiency. Compared to previous\nmethods, our network is approximately 40 times faster while\nmaintaining a comparable flow completion accuracy to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n4.2. Ablation Study\nEffectiveness of Image Propagation. Table 3 shows that\nExp. (a) experiences a significant performance drop when\nimage propagation is removed. Moreover, the model\u2019s prop-\nagation ability is reduced without image propagation, as\npresented in Figure 7, causing it to fail to complete missing\nTable 3: Ablation study of dual-main propagation and sparse Transformer.\nExp.\n(a) w/o Img Prop.\n(b) w/ Img Prop. in FGVC\n(c) w/o Feat Prop.\n(d) w/ Feat Prop. in E2FGVI\n(f) Full Tokens\nProPainter\nPSNR\n33.05\n32.91\n33.17\n33.94\n34.18\n34.15\nSSIM\n0.9724\n0.9687\n0.9732\n0.9756\n0.9765\n0.9764\nImg Prop. of FGVC\nImg Prop.

To verify the effectiveness of our relia-\nbility check strategy in image propagation, we replaced our\ndesign with the FGVC image propagation module in Exp.\n(b) (without retraining), resulting in a noticeable decrease in\nPSNR. This is because the FGVC image propagation method\nis prone to being affected by incorrect optical flow, leading\nto severe texture distortion that subsequent modules cannot\ncorrect. Our model can effectively aware and stop unreliable\npropagation areas using a simple reliability check via Eq.2,\nand generate more faithful inpainting results.\nEffectiveness of Feature Propagation. Similarly, we ob-\nserve a slight decrease in performance by either removing\nfeature propagation, i.e., Exp. (c), or replacing it with the\nFeature propagation of E2FGVI, i.e., Exp. (d), indicating\nthe effectiveness of the feature propagation modules and our\nreliability mask-aware conditions. This suggests that our\ndesign, which learns reliable DCN offsets in the feature do-\nmain, can further complement and enhance the propagation\nability in the image domain.\nEffectiveness of Sparse Transformer. In theory, our strat-\negy of using masks to guide sparsity only eliminates redun-\ndant and unnecessary tokens (windows), while preserving\nessential information. This means that there should be no ad-\nverse effect on performance. To confirm this, we conducted\nExp. (d), comparing our approach to standard self-attention\nwithout sparse filtering. Our results indicate that our sparse\nTransformer block performs almost as well as the standard\none, indicating that it can achieve high efficiency without\nsacrificing performance.\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0\n300\n600\n900\nTemporal Length\nFLOPs (G)\nFuseFormer [22]\nFGT [42]\nE2FGVI [19]\nOurs\n240p\n480p\n720p\n960p\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\nSpatial Resolution\nFLOPs (G)\nFGT [42]\nE2FGVI [19]\nOurs\nFigure 8: FLOPs cures of different Transformer blocks.\nEfficiency of Sparse Transformer.

The curves\nindicate that the efficiency advantage of our sparse Trans-\nformer becomes more prominent as the temporal length and\nvideo resolution increase, indicating great potential for de-\nveloping longer-range spatiotemporal attention and applying\nit to larger resolution videos.\n5. Conclusion\nThis study introduces a novel and improved video in-\npainting framework called ProPainter. It incorporates an\nenhanced dual-domain propagation and an efficient mask-\nguided sparse video Transformer. Thanks to the two mod-\nules, our ProPainter exhibits reliable and precise propagation\ncapabilities over long distances, significantly improving the\nperformance of video inpainting while maintaining high effi-\nciency in terms of running time and computational complex-\nity. We believe that the designs in ProPainter will provide\nvaluable insights to the video inpainting community.\nAcknowledgement.\nThis study is supported under the\nRIE2020 Industry Alignment Fund Industry Collaboration\nProjects (IAF-ICP) Funding Initiative, as well as cash and\nin-kind contribution from the industry partner(s).\nReferences\n[1] Jiayin Cai, Changlin Li, Xin Tao, Chun Yuan, and Yu-Wing\nTai.

In Sec. A, we present the architecture details and loss functions of our proposed ProPainter. In Sec. B, we provide\nin-depth analysis of the performance improvement achieved by our method and highlight its advantages. Sec. C contains more\nquantitative evaluations and visual comparisons.\nA. Architecture and Loss Details\nA.1. Architecture\nOur network adopts two distinct deformable alignment modules in the recurrent flow completion network (RFC) and feature\npropagation, respectively. To provide further clarity, we present a detailed illustration of the former alignment module (w/o\nflow guided) in Figure 9, which can be easily compared with the latter alignment module (w/ flow guided) depicted in Figure 3\nof the main paper. There are two main differences between the two modules: 1) different condition pools were employed to\npredict the parameters of the deformable convolutional networks (DCN); 2) the former predicts the DCN offsets directly, while\nthe latter uses optical flow as the base offset of DCN and predicts the residual offsets to the flow fields.\nDCN\nMasks\nDCN\nOffsets\nConv Layers\nDCN\nConv\nLayers\nc\nCondition Pool\n!!\n!\"!\"#\n!\"!\n!\"!\"#\nFigure 9: An illustration of deformable alignment module that is adopted in the recurrent flow completion network.\nA.2. Loss Functions\nLoss Functions of RFC network. To train the recurrent flow completion network (RFC), we utilize two losses. The first one\nis the reconstruction loss that is applied to both valid and invalid regions, as depicted in the following equation:\nLflow\nrec\n=\n\r\r\rMt \u2299 ( \u02c6Ft \u2212 Ft)\n\r\r\r\n1\n\u2225Mt\u22251\n+\n\r\r\r(1 \u2212 Mt) \u2299 ( \u02c6Ft \u2212 Ft)\n\r\r\r\n1\n\u22251 \u2212 Mt\u22251\n,\n(7)\nwhere \u2299 denotes the dot product. The second one is second-order smooth loss [24] that encourages the smooth and coherent\ncompleted flow fields, which is a critical property for the subsequent propagation modules. The loss can be expressed as:\nLflow\nsmooth =\n\r\r\r\u25b3 \u02c6Ft\n\r\r\r\n1 ,\n(8)\nwhere \u25b3 denotes the divergence operator. The overall loss function of RFC is: Lflow = \u03b11Lflow\nrec\n+ \u03b12Lflow\nsmooth, where we set\n\u03b11 = 1, \u03b12 = 0.5 in our experiments.\nLoss Functions of ProPainter. Our ProPainter is trained using two types of loss. For reconstruction loss, we use L1 loss to\nmeasure the distance between output video sequence \u02c6Y and ground-truth one Y :\nLrec =\n\r\r\r \u02c6Yt \u2212 Yt\n\r\r\r\n1 .\n(9)\nFurthermore, we introduce an adversarial training procedure with a T-PatchGAN based discriminator D [6] to enhance the\nquality and coherence of generated videos by differentiating between real and reconstructed videos:\nLD = EY\nh\nlogD(Y)\ni\n+ E\u02c6Y\nh\n1 \u2212 logD(\u02c6Y)\ni\n.\n(10)\nFor the generator, the GAN loss is formulated as:\nLG = \u2212E\u02c6Y\nh\nlogD(\u02c6Y)\ni\n.\n(11)\nThus, the objective of ProPainter learning is: Linpaint = \u03bb1Lrec + \u03bb2LG, where we set \u03bb1 = 1, \u03bb2 = 0.01.\nB. More Discussions\nAs indicated in Table 1 of the main paper, our proposed ProPainter outperforms the state-of-the-art networks by a large\nmargin on all quantitative metrics, especially on the DAVIS [28] dataset. In this section, we explore the primary factor that\ncontributes to these remarkable performance gains and discuss the situations in which our approach has a competitive edge.\nB.1. Factor Behind Improved Performance\nOur proposed ProPainter benefits greatly from global image propagation, which significantly reduces the difficulty of\nlearning for subsequent modules. As shown in Figure 10, image propagation has filled the majority of the masks and even\nentirely completed masked regions. This means that modules following image propagation only need to refine and complement\nthe completed contents of image propagation instead of learning the entire inpainting process. Our method differs from\nprevious approaches [10, 42, 43] in several aspects: 1) In contrast to earlier image propagation methods that are independent of\nnetwork training, which prevent the network from correcting propagation errors, our proposed image propagation is involved\nin the model training, enabling subsequent models to fix any texture misalignment or artifacts caused by image propagation; 2)\nWe employ a more reliable propagation strategy, which is compared in Figure 6 of the main paper; 3) Unlike previous methods\nthat are implemented on the CPU and involved some complex and time-consuming processes, such as indexing pixel-wise\nflow trajectories and Poisson blending, we implement a more efficient image propagation with GPU acceleration.\nT\nInput\nImg. Prop.\nInput\nImg. Prop.\nFigure 10: The initial results and updated masks after our global image propagation. Image propagation shows effective to fill\nmost or entire masked regions, which significantly alleviates the learning difficulty experienced by video inpainting networks.\nB.2. Motion Distribution\nIn the main paper, Table 1 shows that ProPainter\u2019s performance improvement is more noticeable on the DAVIS [28] dataset\nthan on the YouTube-VOS [36] dataset. Our ablation study and analysis in the main paper attribute the performance gains\nprimarily to the design of dual-domain propagation, which relies on motion flow fields to propagate information across videos.\nHowever, we have observed that many videos in the YouTube-VOS dataset have almost stationary scenes without motion,\nwhich limits the effectiveness of our dual-domain propagation module. Moreover, we have analyzed the motion magnitude\ndistribution on both datasets and found that the YouTube-VOS dataset contains a greater proportion of regions with small\nmotion, as presented in Figure 11.\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nMotion Magnitude\nYouTube-VOS\nDAVIS\nFigure 11: Motion magnitude distribution on YouTube-VOS [36] and DAVIS [28] datasets.\nC. More Results\nC.1. Quantitative Evaluation on 480p Videos\nTable 4 presents a quantitative comparison on the DAVIS [28] dataset with 480p (864 \u00d7 480) videos. The comparison only\nincludes STTN [40] and E2FGVI [19], since other methods require memory demands exceeding 32G (such as TSAM [46],\nFuseFormer [22], and FGT [42]) or excessively long time for inference on a 480p video. Runtimes are measured on an\nNVIDIA Tesla V100 (32G) GPU. This comparison suggests that our method exhibits benefits in terms of both accuracy and\nefficiency even at a high resolution.\nTable 4: Quantitative comparisons on DAVIS [28] dataset with 480p (864 \u00d7 480) videos.\nPSNR \u2191\nSSIM \u2191\nVFID \u2193\nRuntime (s/frame) \u2193\nSTTN [40]\n30.72\n0.9534\n0.055\n0.262\nE2FGVI [19]\n32.98\n0.9693\n0.041\n0.332\nProPainter (Ours)\n33.81\n0.9739\n0.035\n0.249\nC.2. Qualitative Comparisons on Flow Completion\nIn Figure 12, we provide a visual comparison of flow completion performance between our recurrent flow completion\nnetwork and previous methods, including FGVC [10], FGT [42], and ISVI [43]. The results show that our recurrent flow\ncompletion network outperforms other methods in producing complete and accurate flow fields.

With sufficient training data,\na 2 billion-parameter language model can accurately perform multi-digit arith-\nmetic operations with almost 100% accuracy without data leakage, significantly\nsurpassing GPT-4 (whose multi-digit multiplication accuracy is only 4.3%). We\nalso demonstrate that our MathGLM, fine-tuned from GLM-10B on a dataset with\nadditional multi-step arithmetic operations and math problems described in text,\nachieves similar performance to GPT-4 on a 5,000-samples Chinese math problem\ntest set. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/THUDM/MathGLM.\n1\nIntroduction\nMathGLM-10M\nMathGLM-100M\nMathGLM-500M\nMathGLM-2B\nFigure 1: Accuracy scores across various LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, as well as a series of\nMathGLM models on the generated test dataset for the arithmetic tasks. Among the different model\nscales, MathGLM consistently achieves superior performance.\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability in handling a variety of\ndownstream tasks in the NLP domain [1, 4, 43, 33, 45, 27]. Pioneering models, such as GPT-\n4 [24] and ChatGPT [23], have been trained on massive amounts of text data, enabling them to\ngenerate coherent and contextually relevant responses. Their ability to understand and generate\n*ZY and MD contributed equally ({yangz21,dm18}@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).\n\u2021Corresponding authors: Jie Tang (jietang@tsinghua.edu.cn)\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2309.03241v2  [cs.LG]  12 Sep 2023\ntext makes them highly versatile for various NLP tasks. Moreover, LLMs have been leveraged for\nother assignments, involving areas of mathematics [5, 17] and science [32]. Nevertheless, despite\nthe impressive capabilities across diverse NLP tasks, GPT-4 might not exhibit the same level of\nproficiency in mathematical reasoning, including arithmetic tasks and Chinese math word problems.\nIn the context of arithmetic tasks, a prevailing assumption is that LLMs struggle with accurately\nexecuting complex arithmetic operations, especially pronounced in cases involving multiplication\nof numbers exceeding 8 digits, and operations entailing decimals and fractions. To eliminate these\nmisconceptions, we embark on an investigation to assess the arithmetic ability of LLMs. Specifically,\nwe focus on the capability of LLMs in performing complex arithmetic operations. As a result, we\npropose MathGLM, a powerful model meticulously crafted to impeccably execute an extensive\nspectrum of complex arithmetic operations, achieving the best performance compared to leading\nLLMs such as GPT-4 (See Figure 1). These operations contain singular actions like addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, as well as the mixing of these operations\nemploying brackets. When these operations are performed individually, without being combined\nwith any other operation, we refer to them as \u201c1-atomic operation\u201d. Importantly, MathGLM has the\ncapability to adeptly tackle arithmetic operations that involve a variety of numerical forms, including\nintegers, decimals, fractions, percentages, and even negative numbers. Figure 2 demonstrates\nexamples generated by MathGLM with 2B model parameters on addition, subtraction, multiplication,\ndivision, exponentiation, and mixing operations tasks.\nTo attain the remarkable performance exhibited by MathGLM in arithmetic tasks, we utilize a step-\nby-step strategy to construct an arithmetic dataset that serves as the foundation for MathGLM\u2019s\npre-training. This dataset is designed to encompass a wide spectrum of arithmetic operations,\nspanning from straightforward 1-atomic operation to more complex 9-atomic operations. By adopting\nthis step-by-step strategy, MathGLM learns to handle both simple and intricate arithmetic expressions,\nwhich empowers it to accurately perform calculations even for operations involving multiplication\nof numbers greater than 8 digits, and those with decimals and fractions. Moreover, we incorporate\nthe concept of curriculum learning to further augment the capabilities of MathGLM. By gradually\nincreasing the complexity of the arithmetic expressions, MathGLM progressively enhances its\ncapacity to tackle operations involving numbers spanning up to 12 digits. This stands in contrast to\nthe common assumption that large language models struggle with such complex arithmetic tasks.\nThe results demonstrate that MathGLM\u2019s arithmetic performance surpasses even the most robust\nLLMs like GPT-4. Specifically, MathGLM achieves an impressive accuracy of 93.03% on the test\ndataset containing complex mixed operations. In contrast, GPT-4 only manages a meager 18.84%\naccuracy on the same dataset.\nFor math word problems, the Ape210K dataset [46] serves as a comprehensive source of mathematical\nchallenges, drawing from diverse math word problems across the Internet. This dataset serves as a\nvaluable resource for training MathGLM, offering a broad spectrum of problem types for learning.\nHowever, a notable characteristic of the original dataset lies in its directly calculated answers.\nThis straightforward answer presentation might lead to a potential drawback, that is MathGLM\ncan potentially miss the underlying calculation rules and patterns embedded within the calculation\nprocesses.\nTo overcome this potential limitation and bolster MathGLM\u2019s proficiency in solving math word prob-\nlems, we leverage the step-by-step strategy to reconstruct the Ape210K dataset. By decomposing the\ncomplex arithmetic calculation process into a sequence of sequential steps, MathGLM is empowered\nto accurately generate answer for math word problems and significantly enhance the answer accuracy\nin comparison to the original one. For instance, MathGLM achieves an impressive absolute gain of\n42.29% in answer accuracy as compared to fine-tuning on the original dataset. By fine-tuning from\nthe GLM-10B, MathGLM\u2019s performance closely aligns with that of GPT-4 when evaluated on a math\nword problems dataset comprising 5,000 test cases. This step-by-step strategy provides MathGLM\nwith a profound understanding of the complex calculation process inherent in math word problems,\nenabling MathGLM to grasp the underlying calculation rules and obtain more accurate answers.\nOverall, MathGLM excels in both arithmetic tasks and math word problems by leveraging the step-\nby-step strategy.

In Section 2, we elaborate on preliminaries, including large language models, arithmetic\ncalculation, and mathematical reasoning. Section 3 introduces the methodologies employed in\nMathGLM, covering arithmetic training dataset, models, and training procedure for arithmetic tasks\n(Section 3.1), and training dataset, backbone models, and training strategy for math word problems\n(Section 3.2). We also perform comprehensive experiments and an analysis of the MathGLM\u2019s\ncapabilities (Section 4). Section 4.1 reports the detailed experimental results on arithmetic tasks, and\nSection 4.2 presents the results related to math word problems. Finally, we summarize our work in\nSection 5.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLarge Language Models\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities in the realm of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks, significantly shifting the research paradigm within the field. These\nmodels, such as GPT-3 [1], Gopher [26], Megatron-Turing NLG [29], Chinchilla [12], PaLM [4],\nOPT [45], BLOOM [27], GLM-130B [43], and LLaMA [36], are trained on a large corpus of\ndiverse and unlabeled data, demonstrating a generic ability to perform well on a variety of tasks.\nThrough pretraining on extensive corpus, these models obtain powerful language understanding and\ngeneration capabilities, enabling their exceptional performance on a wide array of benchmarks, such\nas MMLU [10], mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Moreover, they display an astonishing\naptitude for in-context learning, rapidly adapting to novel tasks with minimal examples through\nfew-shot learning.\nNonetheless, despite the remarkable strides made by the most powerful LLMs, ChatGPT [25] and\nGPT-4 [24], in language understanding and generation, it is crucial to recognize that these cutting-\nedge models still encounter challenges in tackling mathematical problems. This work is dedicated to\naddressing and enhancing the performance of LLMs in the domain of solving mathematical problems,\nencompassing both arithmetic tasks and math word problems.\n2.2\nArithmetic Calculation\nThe emergence of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 4, 24] has sparked considerable\ninterest in investigating their potential for handling arithmetic tasks. Nogueira et al. [21] and Wang\n3\net al. [39] evaluate the arithmetic capabilities of LLMs on elementary arithmetic operations like\naddition and subtraction.\nMuffo et al. [20] undertake an evaluation that specifically centers on\nassessing the proficiency of language models in the domain of 2-digit multiplication. BIG-bench [30]\nintroduces a comprehensive collection of arithmetic datasets, which encompass a spectrum of\narithmetic tasks that span numbers within a range of up to 5 digits.\nYuan et al. [42] design an\ncomplex arithmetic dataset MATH 401 with various arithmetic operations to evaluate the capabilities\nof models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, InstructGPT [25], Galactica [32], and LLaMA [36].\nTo support arithmetic operations involving large numbers, Nye et al. [22] employ scratchpad-based\nfine-tuning that enables LLMs to achieve remarkable outcomes in the context of 8-digit addition.\nZhou et al. [48] adopt the specialize prompt engineering techniques to successfully extend the\nscope of addition but encountered limitations with multiplication beyond 7 digits. Goat [19] utilizes\nsupervised instruction fine-tuning to handle elementary arithmetic operations with large integers,\nincluding addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Jelassi et al. [15] investigate length\ngeneralization in basic arithmetic tasks via approaches like relative position embeddings and train set\npriming. Distinguishing itself from these efforts focused on elementary arithmetic, our MathGLM\npushes the envelope by not only exceeding the realm of basic arithmetic with two numbers but also\ntackling intricate mixing arithmetic operations involving multiple numbers and diverse data formats.\nFurthermore, several works explore the integration of external tools for arithmetic tasks. For instance,\nToolformer [28] adopts an external calculator to accomplish arithmetic calculations, while PoT [2]\nand PAL [9] obtain the final answer with the help of programs. Different from leveraging external\ntools, we focus on explore how to enhance the inherent arithmetic ability of LLMs without relying on\nexternal tools.\n2.3\nMathematical Reasoning\nLLMs have indeed demonstrated considerable promise in addressing math word problems. Cobbe\net al. [5] utilize training verifiers to rerank the outputs of LLMs, resulting in remarkable performance\non the created GSM8K dataset. Lewkowycz et al. [17] introduce Minerva, a large language model\nfine-tuned based on PaLM models [4], leveraging a substantial dataset containing scientific and\nmathematical data. Minerva attains state-of-the-art performance on MATH [11] and GSM8K. By\nleveraging COT (chain of thought) [41, 16, 47] to decompose the math problems into multiple\nsteps, LLMs notably improve their performance in tackling math word problems. Wang et al. [40]\npropose the self-consistency strategy as a replacement for the decoding strategy used in COT, which\nbrings about better performance than the traditional COT prompting. Uesato et al. [37] employ\nprocess and outcome supervision to enhance the performance of LLMs in solving grade school math\nproblems. Lightman et al. [18] propose to verify each intermediate reasoning step and find process\nsupervision can significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance. While these studies show\nthe substantial advancements made by LLMs in mathematical reasoning, it is clear that LLMs still\nmake mistakes when confronted with arithmetic operations in math word problems. Different from\nthe aforementioned works that primarily concentrate on improving the reasoning process, our goal is\nto simultaneously advance both mathematical reasoning and arithmetical calculation capabilities of\nLLMs, addressing both aspects at the same time.\n3\nMethod\nTo investigate the efficacy of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, we propose the MathGLM model that\ndesigned with the specific goal of enhancing the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.\nFirstly, MathGLM focuses on enhancing its proficiency in accurately executing a comprehensive\nrange of arithmetic tasks. It accomplishes this by integrating a step-by-step strategy into its archi-\ntecture. Instead of straightforwardly calculating the answers to complex arithmetic expressions,\nMathGLM employs this strategy to meticulously generate answers step by step. Secondly, MathGLM\nleverages the step-by-step strategy to fine-tune a series of GLM models on specific Chinese math-\nematical problems. By leveraging this strategy, MathGLM enhances its ability to handle complex\nmathematical problem-solving tasks.\n4\n3.1\nLearning on Arithmetic Tasks\nArithmetic tasks can be broadly divided into basic arithmetic operations and complex mixing opera-\ntions. Basic arithmetic operations encompass fundamental mathematical tasks that revolve around\nconducting simple calculations involving two numbers. On the other hand, arithmetic tasks also\nencompass the domain of complex mixing operations, which necessitate the skill to manage a com-\nbination of diverse arithmetic operations and numerical formats. A comprehensive category of the\nlearning tasks encompassed by MathGLM is summarized in Table 1.\nTask\nInteger\nDecimal\nFraction\nPercentage Negative Numbers\nAddition\nnD+nD nD.mD+nD.mD (nD/mD)+(nD/mD) nD%+nD%\n-nD+-nD\nSubtraction\nnD-nD nD.mD-nD.mD (nD/mD)-(nD/mD) nD%-nD%\n-nD\u2013nD\nMultiplication\nnD*nD nD.mD*nD.mD (nD/mD)*(nD/mD) nD%*nD%\n-nD*-nD\nDivision\nnD/nD nD.mD/nD.mD (nD/mD)/(nD/mD) nD%/nD%\n-nD/-nD\nExponentiation\nnD\u02c6nD\n-\n-\n-\n-nD\u02c6-nD\nMixed Computing\n[(nD\u00b1nD.mD)*nD%]/-nD\nTable 1: Summary and symbolic expression of arithmetic tasks. In symbolic expression, we represent\na decimal with n-digit integer part and m-digit decimal part as nD.mD. For mixed computing, we\nonly show a simple mixed symbolic expression.\nTo augment the arithmetic ability of MathGLM, we adopt a decoder-only architecture based on\nTransformer [38] and train it from scratch on our generated arithmetic dataset using an autoregressive\nobjective.\nArithmetic Training Dataset. The arithmetic dataset employed for training is meticulously designed\nto encompass a comprehensive range of arithmetic tasks. This dataset is thoughtfully designed to\nincorporate a variety of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and\nexponentiation. Additionally, it encompasses diverse numerical formats such as integers, decimals,\npercents, fractions, and negative numbers. This comprehensive dataset is created in various sizes,\nranging from 1 million to 50 million records. Within each of these datasets, individual arithmetic\nexpressions consist of 2 to 10 operation steps, encompassing a spectrum of mathematical operations\nlike addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\u00d7), division (/), and exponentiation (\u02c6). To aligh with\nhuman calculation habits, a step-by-step strategy is employed in the construction of the arithmetic\ndatasets. Instead of directly computing the final answer to each complex arithmetic expression,\nthe strategy breaks down the complex expression into a sequence of simpler steps, progressively\ngenerating answers step by step. This strategy mirrors the process human typically follow when\nsolving complex arithmetic tasks. By training on such dataset, MathGLM achieves outstanding\narithmetic performance since it learns the underlying calculation rules from the detailed calculation\nprocess. Figure 3 provides some training examples drawn from the arithmetic dataset, illustrating the\ndiversity of arithmetic tasks and the step-by-step strategy incorporated in the dataset.\nModels and Training Procedure.\nTable 2 reports an overview of all the models with different\nmodel parameters. Our training efforts encompass 4 distinct types of models, each characterized\nby different parameter sizes. The largest model is endowed with 2B parameters, making it the most\npowerful in terms of capacity. Following that, we train the second model with 500M parameters, the\nthird model with 100M parameters and the smallest model with 10M parameters. Notably, despite\nthe discrepancies in parameter sizes, all models are trained using the same dataset scale consisting of\n50 million training records. The technical details of MathGLM about tokenization is presented in\nAppendix A.1.\nFor training procedure, we employ the fundamental principle of curriculum learning to effectively\ntrain the MathGLM. The training procedure of MathGLM is initiated using an arithmetic dataset\ncontaining numbers within a range of 5 digits. Following this initial phase, where MathGLM\nattains stable training convergence and demonstrates satisfactory performance on the test dataset,\nwe introduce curriculum learning to enhance its capabilities. Specifically, we augment the training\ndata with a new dataset comprising 50,000 records, which encompass numbers spanning from 5 to\n12 digits. By incorporating these more challenging examples, MathGLM is encouraged to decipher\n5\n7826+855+4919/1050*1362-3673*7531/6726+5633=7826+855+4.6847619047619045*\n1362-3673*7531/6726+5633=7826+855+6380.645714285713-3673*7531/6726+5633=\n7826+855+6380.645714285713-27661363/6726+5633=7826+855+6380.64571428571\n3-4112.602289622361+5633=8681+6380.645714285713-4112.602289622361+5633=1\n5061.645714285714-4112.602289622361+5633=10949.043424663352+5633=16582.0\n43424663352\n674+2939*2987*9430+6994/883-1642/521+2051=674+8778793*9430+6994/883-1642/\n521+2051=674+82784017990+6994/883-1642/521+2051=674+82784017990+7.92072\n4801812004-1642/521+2051=674+82784017990+7.920724801812004-3.15163147792\n70633+2051=82784018664+7.920724801812004-3.1516314779270633+2051=827840\n18671.92073-3.1516314779270633+2051=82784018668.7691+2051=82784020719.76\n91\n[(-4453+9698.9284)*-4992.0]*3575/3238+-4722.991=[5245.928400000001*-4992.0]*35\n75/3238+-4722.991=(-5245.928400000001*4992.0)*3575/3238+-4722.991=(-26187674.\n572800003)*3575/3238+-4722.991=-26187674.572800003*3575/3238+-4722.991=-261\n87674.572800003*3575/3238-4722.991=-93620936597.76001/3238-4722.991=-289131\n98.455145154-4722.991=-28917921.446145155\n(-8174.1-4561%)/-727.36226-8943=(-8174.1-45.61)/-727.36226-8943=-8219.71/-727.36\n226-8943=8219.71/727.36226-8943=11.300710047837788-8943=-8931.699289952163\n8689%*-5814*190-6470%/[-5900-(3540%/5945)]=86.89*-5814*190-64.7/[-5900-\n(35.4/5945)]=86.89*-5814*190-64.7/\n[-5900-0.005954583683767872]=86.89*-5814*190-64.7/-5900.005954583684=-86.89*5\n814*190+64.7/5900.005954583684=-505178.46*190+64.7/5900.005954583684=-95983\n907.4+64.7/5900.005954583684=-95983907.4+0.010966090627372149=-95983907.38\n903391\n1+8/1*10+2=1+8*10+2=1+80+2=81+2=83\n7/5/8-3=1.4/8-3=0.175-3=-2.825\n5+5+8/1*2=5+5+8*2=5+5+16=10+16=26\n5/9=0.5555555555555556\n6*5*4=30*4=120\n5/8=0.625\n7*10+6=70+6=76\n4+9=13\n2+9-8=11-8=3\n2-1=1\n3/2/7=1.5/7=0.21428571428571427\n7*6*4=42*4=168\n5*6/10-6*9=30/10-6*9=3-6*9=3-54=-51\n2+8/1=2+8=10\n6/10=0.6\n4+7-1+4-10=11-1+4-10=10+4-10=14-10=4\n1/5+9=0.2+9=9.2\n9*9=81\nBasic arithmetic operations\nComplex mixing operations\nFigure 3: Some examples of the arithmetic training dataset of MathGLM.\nModel\nDimension\nHeads\nLayers\nParameters\nTraining Steps\nMathGLM-10M\n256\n32\n15\n10M\n120,000\nMathGLM-100M\n512\n32\n35\n100M\n155,000\nMathGLM-500M\n1024\n32\n40\n500M\n135,000\nMathGLM-2B\n2048\n32\n40\n2B\n155,000\nTable 2: Model sizes and architectures of MathGLM.\nthe rules associated with arithmetic operations involving large numbers. Such training strategy\nallows MathGLM initially tackles simpler examples, progressively advancing towards more complex\nchallenges. More importantly, such approach empowers MathGLM to improve its ability by learning\nfrom relatively smaller examples, emphasizing the efficiency of MathGLM to handle increasingly\nintricate tasks or data patterns.\n3.2\nLearning on Math Word Problems\nAlongside our focus on arithmetic tasks, we train (fine-tune) a series of Transformer-based language\nmodels, named General Language Model (GLM) [8, 43] and their chat versions to solve math word\nproblems. Our training leverages the publicly available Chinese Ape210K dataset, which serves as a\nvaluable resource for training language models on math word problem-solving tasks. This dataset\nconsists of a vast collection of 210,000 Chinese math problems at the primary school level, with each\nproblem\u2019s answer calculated directly.\nTraining Dataset. To enhance the performance of MathGLM on math word problems, we utilize a\nstep-by-step strategy to reconstruct the Ape210K dataset, transforming it into a version where the\nanswer of each math problem is calculated step by step. Figure 4 demonstrate the contrast between the\noriginal Ape210K dataset and our reconstructed version.

A\nstep-by-step strategy is employed to reconstruct the solutions for each mathematical problem.\nbackbone models bestow the MathGLM with a basic language understanding skills, enabling it to\neffectively comprehend linguistic information contained within math word problems. The details of\nbackbone models are presented in Appendix A.2.\nTraining Strategy. To achieve better performance, we employ two training strategies for MathGLM.\nThe first is to fine-tune the GLM backbone models on a solitary mathematical dataset. This process\nallows the MathGLM to specialize in understanding and solving math word problems by learning\nfrom the mathematical dataset\u2019s unique characteristics. However, such strategy damages the generic\nability of the MathGLM. To circumvent this limitation, a second strategy is to continue training the\nGLM backbone models on a hybrid dataset that combines both mathmatics and text content. This\nhelps to balance the specialization in math word problems with the preservation of MathGLM\u2019s\ngeneric ability.\n4\nExperiments\nThe overarching objective of MathGLM revolves around demonstrating the prowess of language\nmodels in the domain of mathematical reasoning. To validate this, we design two distinct types of\nexperiments, encompassing arithmetic tasks and math word problems. These two categories of tasks\ncomprehensively cover both basic computational abilities and higher-order problem-solving skills,\nproviding a robust assessment of the model\u2019s proficiency in mathematical reasoning.\n4.1\nLearning on Arithmetic\n4.1.1\nDataset\nWithin the domain of arithmetic, we create a diverse collection of datasets specifically tailored for\narithmetic tasks. This suite of training datasets encompasses an expansive spectrum of sizes, including\n1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 25 million and 50 million records. Our evaluation dataset, which\ncomprises 9,592 test cases, is generated from the same distribution as the training dataset, yet remains\ndistinct and is excluded from the training process. This carefully generated suite of datasets serves as\na comprehensive benchmark to evaluate and quantify MathGLM\u2019s computational prowess across a\nwide variety of arithmetic tasks. For a more in-depth exploration of the specifics of the generated\ndatasets, the details can be found in Appendix A.3.\n4.1.2\nEvaluation Metric\nTo measure the ability of MathGLM on arithmetic tasks, we adopt the following metrics to evaluate\nthe outputs.\nAccuracy is typically measured by comparing the output of the MathGLM and the ground truth\nanswer. In our experiments, we adhere to standard rounding rules, constraining the generated answers\n7\nto precisely two decimal places. When the correctly rounded answer aligns with the answer generated\nby the MathGLM, we classify this outcome as a correct answer.\nRelative Error is another important metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of MathGLM, which\nquantifies the difference between the output generated by MathGLM and the correct answer. The\nrelative error (RE) is quantified using the following formula:\nRE = | \u02c6y \u2212 y\ny\n|\n(1)\nwhere \u02c6y and y denote the generated answer and the correct answer respectively. For our evaluation\npurposes, we utilize a relative error threshold of 1%. This threshold serves as a criterion for\ndetermining the acceptability of the answers generated by the MathGLM, where any relative error\nfalling within this threshold range is considered an accurate outcome.\n4.1.3\nResults and Analysis\nOverall Results. For arithmetic tasks, we pre-train a Transformer-based model named MathGLM\nwith 500M model parameters for both pretraining and inference. To accurately gauge the effectiveness\nof MathGLM, we contrast its performance with those of leading large language models (LLMs) such\nas GPT-4 and ChatGPT. The results, as presented in Table 3, consistently show that MathGLM outper-\nforms all other models, indicating its superior performance in tackling arithmetic tasks. Even when\nwe consider a more small model variant, namely MathGLM-10M with a mere 10 million parameters,\nthe results reveal a surprising phenomenon. Despite its compact parameter size, MathGLM-10M\noutperforms GPT-4 and ChatGPT across an array of comprehensive arithmetic tasks. This astonish-\ning results show the effectiveness of MathGLM\u2019s approach, which involves decomposing complex\narithmetic expressions into individual steps, granting it the capacity to discern and comprehend\nthe subtleties within arithmetic tasks. It effectively learns the underlying rules and principles of\narithmetic operations, enabling it to generate accurate and precise solutions. Furthermore, when\ncomparing MathGLM across different parameter scales, we observe that the MathGLM\u2019s arithmetic\nperformance is directly correlated with the augmentation of its parameter count. This finding suggest\nthat as models increase in size, their performance exhibits a corresponding enhancement. To sum\nup, the evaluation results on complex arithmetic tasks underscore the exceptional performance of\nMathGLM. By breaking down arithmetic tasks, these models surpass the performance of GPT-4 and\nChatGPT significantly.\nModel\nACC\nRE\nGPT-4\n18.84%\n-\nChatGPT\n10.00%\n-\nMathGLM-10M\n61.21%\n97.83%\nMathGLM-100M\n70.28%\n99.28%\nMathGLM-500M\n89.57%\n99.41%\nMathGLM-2B\n93.03%\n99.71%\nTable 3: Performance comparison on an arithmetic dataset containing 9,592 test cases between\nMathGLM and the leading LLMs.\nAdditionally, we conduct a performance comparison of arithmetic tasks among different prominent\nlarge language models (LLMs) including GPT-4, ChatGPT, text-davinci-003, code-davinci-002,\nGalactica, LLaMA, OPT, BLOOM, and GLM. For this comparison, we randomly extract a compact\narithmetic dataset containing 100 test cases from the larger dataset discussed earlier. The results\nof this comparison arithmetic performance are presented in Table 4. Upon analyzing the results,\nit is evident that MathGLM achieves a high accuracy of 93.03% with 2 billion model parameters,\nsurpassing all other LLMs. In addition to leading models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, the large science\nmodel Galactica exhibits better performance in arithmetic tasks. This can be attributed to Galactica\u2019s\ntraining on a large scientific corpus, enabling it to learn the languages of science and comprehend the\nintricacies of arithmetic tasks. By leveraging the unique characteristics of this dataset, Galactica is\nable to enhance its understanding and handling of arithmetic tasks, resulting in improved performance.\nThese findings emphasize the significance of domain-specific training and leveraging specialized\n8\ndatasets to enhance model performance. Besides, a step-by-step solution strategy, which involves\ndecomposing complex arithmetic expressions into individual steps, has proven to be effective in\nimproving arithmetic performance. The outstanding performance of MathGLM shows that the\nlanguage model coupled with a specialized dataset and the step-by-step solution strategy can achieve\nremarkable performance in arithmetic tasks.\nTo comprehensively evaluate the arithmetic performance of MathGLM, we also conduct experiments\non a newly-generated arithmetic dataset named MATH 401 [42] and the corresponding results are\nreported in Appendix A.4.\nModel\nACC\nRE\nGPT-4\n22.22%\n-\nChatGPT\n13.25%\n-\ntext-davinci-003\n9.79%\n-\ntext-davinci-002\n4.08%\n-\nGalactica-120b\n7.97%\n-\nGalactica-30b\n7.02%\n-\nLLaMA-65b\n5.02%\n-\nOPT-175B\n3.83%\n-\nBLOOM-176B\n3.96%\n-\nGLM-130B\n3.06%\n-\nMathGLM-10M\n64.29%\n97.96%\nMathGLM-100M\n73.47%\n98.23%\nMathGLM-500M\n89.80%\n98.82%\nMathGLM-2B\n94.90%\n98.98%\nTable 4: Overall performance comparison on various LLMs in term of Accuracy.\nGrouped Results. To clearly evaluate the arithmetic ability of MathGLM among different operations,\nwe design a series of extended experiments. Specifically, we design small test datasets comprising\n100 test cases to respectively evaluate the arithmetica performance of MathGLM in various arithmetic\noperations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These datasets encompass\ndifferent data formats, such as integers, decimals, percents, fractions and negative numbers. Here, we\ncompare MathGLM with several well-known chat-type LLMs, such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, ChatGLM,\nand Bard. The arithmetic performance comparison among these different language models is\ndemonstrated in Table 5. Analyzing the results, we can observe that the majority of LLMs exhibit\ncommendable accuracy levels exceeding 90% across diverse data formats for elementary arithmetic\noperations like addition and subtraction. However, as the complexity escalates to operations like\nmultiplication and division, a divergence in performance manifests across different models. For\ninstance, the accuracy levels of the most powerful model GPT-4 also show a trend towards zero,\nespecially when dealing with decimal and percentile data formats. In contrast, MathGLM consistently\nshows superior performance in multiplication operations across various data formats, surpassing the\ncapability of GPT-4. This demonstrates the effectiveness and capabilities of MathGLM in handling\ncomplex arithmetic tasks, even outperforming a prominent model like GPT-4 in specific operations.\nNotably, even the smaller variant of MathGLM, MathGLM-10M, with only 10 million training\nparameters, also achieves remarkable arithmetic performances, further emphasizing the arithmetic\ncapabilities of our MathGLM.\nResults in BIG-bench.\nWe also evaluate MathGLM using BIG-bench arithmetic dataset [30],\nwhich is commonly used to evaluate basic arithmetic capabilities of language models by performing\nn-digit addition (ADD), subtraction (SUB), multiplication (MUL), and division (DIV). Table 6\nreports the experimental results of GPT-4 and MathGLM on various arithmetic operations with\ndifferent numbers of digits. GPT-4 exhibits near-perfect (100%) accuracy in low-digit arithmetic\ntasks. However, as the digits escalate, the performance gradually diminishes, particularly pronounced\nin the multiplication task. In contrast, MathGLM consistently maintains high accuracy levels even\nin high-digit arithmetic tasks, illustrating its outstanding ability to handle complex arithmetic tasks\neffectively.

A similar tendency can be observed\nin the DIV task. Overall, the evaluation results demonstrate that MathGLM outperforms GPT-4 in\nhigh-digit arithmetic tasks, and the performance generally inproves with larger model sizes.\nAnalysis on MathGLM. Despite achieving an impressive overall accuracy of 93.03% with its 2\nbillion model parameters, a thorough analysis is conducted to comprehend instances where MathGLM\nfails to generate accurate answers. Consider the example 3468 \u2217 4046/7424, MathGLM generate\nan answer of 468 \u2217 4046/7424 = 14031528/7424 = 1889.901400862069, while the true answer is\n468 \u2217 4046/7424 = 14031528/7424 = 1890.0226293103. Upon comparing the generated results\nwith the true answers, it is obviously observed that the multiplication operation for 468\u22174046 is correct\nbut the division operation for 14031528/7424 is incorrect. One possible reason for this discrepancy\nis that MathGLM\u2019s pre-training primarily encompasses numbers in the 5-digit range, thereby causing\ninaccuracies when tackling division tasks involving 12-digit and 4-digit numbers. Upon thorough\nanalysis of the errors made by MathGLM, it\u2019s important to highlight that the inaccuracies in the\ngenerated answers are remarkably close to the correct evaluations. For a comprehensive investigation\ninto the errors, a detailed breakdown of the error types and their frequencies can be found in\nAppendix A.5.\n4.1.4\nAblation Study\nScaling Analysis.\nTo comprehensively assess the effect of model parameters and training data\nsizes on performance, we conduct a series of scaling analysis experiments. The model parameters of\nMathGLM are designed as a range of {10M, 100M, 500M, 2B} and the training data sizes is set to\na range of {1M, 5M, 10M, 25M, 50M}.

As expected, the performance trend highlights that the 2B\nmodel consistently outperforms its smaller counterparts when evaluated using equivalent data sizes,\nillustrating the positive impact of larger model parameters on arithmetic performance. Besides, it is\nevident that larger data sizes have a substantial influence on improving the arithmetic performance as\nwell. However, it is important to note that the effect of data size on the smaller model sizes may not\nbe as pronounced as compared to the larger models. This discernible pattern implies that the benefits\nderived from increasing the data size tend to be more substantial when paired with larger model\nparameters. In essence, the trends illustrated in Figure 5 substantiate the notion that both the size of\nthe model and the quantity of training data play vital roles in enhancing the arithmetic performance\nof MathGLM.\nFigure 5: Performance visualization on MathGLM under different scaling configurations, including\nmodel parameters and training data sizes.\nFurthermore, by analyzing the trend illustrated in Figure 5, we attempt to extend our findings and\nmake predictions for scaling configurations that were not directly studied. Employing a log-linear\ntrend assumption, we can extrapolate the results to estimate the requisite model size for achieving a\ntargeted performance when utilizing a more extensive training set. Figure 6 illustrates the extrapolated\noutcomes derived from the log-linear trend. To validate the validity of this trend, we pre-train a\n11\nMathGLM equipped with 6B model parameters. From Figure 6, we can observe that the extrapolated\ntrend aligns with the performance achieved by the MathGLM-6B.\nMathGLM-10M\nMathGLM-100M\nMathGLM-500M\nMathGLM-2B\nFigure 6: The log-linear trend exhibited by the MathGLM. This trend accurately predicts MathGLM-\n6B\u2019s performance.\nGeneralization Analysis. To assess the generalization ability of MathGLM beyond the 5-digit range,\na set of 50,000 training records involving numbers within the 12-digit range are introduced into the\ntraining dataset. After incorporating this additional data, MathGLM is further pre-trained for 20,000\nsteps to enhance its ability to handle arithmetic tasks involving numbers outside the 5-digit range.\nTable 7 shows the arithmetic performance comparison across various digit ranges, spanning from 5\ndigit to 12 digit, and involving a mix of arithmetic operations. In comparison to GPT-4 and ChatGPT,\nour proposed MathGLM consistently achieves the highest accuracy across all digit ranges, indicating\nthe superiority of MathGLM for multi-digit arithmetic operations. A noticeable observation is that a\ndecline in accuracy as the number of digits in the arithmetic operations increases. This suggests that\nhandling larger digit ranges poses a greater challenge to all LLMs.\nGeneralization GPT4 ChatGPT MathGLM-500M MathGLM-2B\n5-digit\n6.67%\n5.43%\n83.44%\n85.16%\n6-digit\n10.0%\n2.94%\n79.58%\n78.17%\n7-digit\n3.33%\n1.92%\n71.19%\n73.73%\n8-digit\n3.13%\n1.43%\n64.62%\n67.69%\n9-digit\n6.90%\n1.57%\n66.66%\n69.60%\n10-digit\n3.33%\n1.45%\n49.55%\n65.77%\n11-digit\n0%\n0%\n42.98%\n57.89%\n12-digit\n6.90%\n1.33%\n27.38%\n41.05%\nTable 7: Performance comparison between most powerful LLMs and MathGLM on various multi-\ndigit arithmetic operations.\nStep-by-step Analysis. To delve deeper into the impact of the step-by-step strategy on MathGLM, we\nconduct extended experiments that directly calculate the answer of each arithmetic expression without\nemploying the step-by-step approach. Figure 9 shows performance comparison between employing\nthe step-by-step strategy and bypassing it for different models. We can observe that a significant\nimprovement in the peformance of MathGLM when the step-by-step strategy is applied. For instance,\nin the case of MathGLM-500M, the accuracy rises from 31.96% to 89.57%, while for MathGLM-\n2B, it increases from 40.76% to 93.03% for MathGLM-2B, all attributable to the incorporation\nof the step-by-step strategy. Similarly, the relative error accuracy exhibits a similar positive trend,\nescalating from 89.29% to an exceptional 99.41% for MathGLM-500M, and from 94.26% to an\noutstanding 99.71% for MathGLM-2B with the implementation of the step-by-step strategy. These\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the step-by-step strategy in enhancing MathGLM\u2019s ability to\naccurately perform arithmetic operations. The step-by-step approach enables MathGLM to better\n12\nunderstand and solve intricate arithmetic tasks, leading to significant improvements in accuracy and\nrelative error accuracy metrics.\nMathGLM-2B\nMathGLM-500M\nMathGLM-2B\nMathGLM-500M\nFigure 7: Performance comparison of MathGLM with and without the step-by-step solution.\n4.2\nLearning on Math Word Problems\n4.2.1\nDataset\nIn the field of math word problems (MWP), the performance of MathGLM is measured using the\nApe210K dataset [46], which contains a collection of 5,000 test math problems. Additionally, we\nintroduce the K6 dataset, which is designed to cover math word problems suitable for elementary\nschool students across 6 different grade levels. The primary purpose of the K6 dataset is to assess\nthe mathematical abilities of LLMs in comprehending and solving general-purpose math reasoning\nproblems. By evaluating MathGLM on the K6 dataset, we are able to gauge its effectiveness in\nhandling mathematical word problems of varying complexity and across a range of grade levels. The\ndetails of the K6 dataset can be found in Appendix A.6.\n4.2.2\nOverall Results\nTo assess the effectiveness of MathGLM, we test it on the Ape210K dataset and a newly-collected\nK6 dataset. To facilitate these evaluations, we utilize various LLMs as the backbone. These LLMs,\nincluding GLM-Large, GLM-6B, GLM2-6B, GLM-10B, ChatGLM-6B, and ChatGLM2-6B, are\nemployed as the core architecture to process and comprehend mathematical word problems within\nChinese datasets.\nResults on the Ape210K dataset. We report the performance results of various LLMs including\nGPT-4, ChatGPT, and a series of our MathGLM variations in Table 8. The results show that when\npaired with GLM-10B, MathGLM achieves performance levels comparable to the state-of-the-art\nGPT-4 model in terms of answer accuracy. It demonstrates the effectiveness of MathGLM in gen-\nerating accurate answers for math word problems through the utilization of a step-by-step strategy.\nFurthermore, we report the arithmetic accuracy, which measures the correctness of the generated\narithmetic expressions. Notably, MathGLM consistently achieves higher arithmetic accuracy com-\npared to answer accuracy across different model sizes. A distinct trend emerges when comparing\nMathGLM\u2019s performance with GLM-Large, GLM-6B, and GLM-10B: MathGLM exhibits notable\nenhancements in both arithmetic accuracy and answer accuracy. This observation indicates that\naugmenting model size tends to bolster its overall performance. However, it is worth noting that\nthe performance of MathGLM drops significantly compared to the GLM models when it is coupled\nwith ChatGLM models. A possible explanation is that ChatGLM models are fine-tuned using the\ninstruction data, potentially compromising the inherent capabilities of language models. This tuning\nprocess might introduce biases or constraints that hinder the overall ability of the language models in\nhandling math word problems.\nResults on the K6 dataset. To assess the mathematical problem-solving abilities across different\ngrade levels, we introduce the K6 dataset and present the corresponding performance results for\nvarious LLMs in Figure 8. The figure shows the overall performance results for GPT-4, ChatGPT,\nChinese-Alpaca-13B, MOSS-16B, Ziya-LLaMA-13B, Baichuan-7B, ChatGLM-6B, ChatGLM2-6B,\nand MathGLM-GLM-10B across each individual grade level.

The observations from the figure indicate a general trend\nof performance decreases as the grade level increases. Such observation indicates that solving\nmath word problems becomes progressively more challenging for LLMs as the grade level increases,\nrequiring more advanced problem solving skills and a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.\nGPT-4 exhibits consistently high accuracy levels across most grade levels, showcasing its proficiency\nin handling math word problems spanning various educational stages. Comparatively, ChatGPT\noutperforms the majority of Chinese LLMs in terms of accuracy across different grade levels. Among\nthe evaluated Chinese LLMs, ChatGLM2-6B demonstrates a commendable level of performance,\nachieving satisfactory accuracy (reaching 60% accuracy) in solving math word problems from grade\n1 to 4. However, its effectiveness diminishes when attempting to solve problems in grade 5 and\n6, highlighting challenges in handling more complex problem-solving scenarios at those levels.\nMathGLM consistently outperforms ChatGPT and many of the most powerful Chinese Language\nModels (LLMs) across the spectrum of grade levels, from grade 1 to grade 6. Particularly noteworthy\nis MathGLM\u2019s ability to achieve higher accuracy than GPT-4 in more advanced grades, such as\ngrade 5 and 6. This observations show the effectiveness of MathGLM in enhancing the accuracy\nof solving math word problems, especially in challenging educational contexts that demand deeper\nmathematical understanding and advanced problem-solving skills.\n4.2.3\nComparison of Training Strategies\nHere, we evaluate the mathematical reasoning ability of MathGLM with different training strategies:\nfine-tuning and continue training. To execute continue training, we amalgamate the Ape210K train\ndataset with instruction data released by Chinese-Vicuna [3]. We subsequently continue training\nMathGLM from the GLM-10B backbone. Table 9 shows the overall performance comparison of\nMathGLM employing different training strategies.

To explore the impact of scaling on MathGLM, we conduct a series of experiments\nencompassing varying dataset sizes and distinct model parameters. Table 10 demonstrates the results\nobtained from varying the dataset sizes within the range of {5K, 10K, 20K, 50K, 100K, 200K}.\nFurthermore, to understand the impact of different model parameters, we incorporate various back-\nbone models into MathGLM, including GLM-Large (335M), GLM-6B, and GLM-10B. The results\nconsistently indicate that MathGLM\u2019s performance improves across all backbone models with the\nincrease in dataset size. Such observation highlights the beneficial effects of enlarging the training\ndata on bolstering MathGLM\u2019s proficiency in tackling math word problems. By accessing more\nextensive datasets, MathGLM is introduced to a wider array of problem types, resulting in better per-\nformance. Additionally, discernible differences in performance emerge among the various backbone\nmodels. Given sufficient dataset size, larger models like MathGLM-GLM-10B often outperform\nothers, indicating the crucial role of model parameters in addressing intricate math word problems.\nThese insights emphasize the significance of both dataset and model scaling. By augmenting dataset\nsize and utilizing larger models, we can markedly boost MathGLM\u2019s capability to generate more\naccurate solutions, enhancing its overall efficacy in resolving math word problems.\nModel Scale\nMathGLM-GLM-Large\nMathGLM-GLM-6B\nMathGLM-GLM-10B\n5K Problems\n4.32%\n12.84%\n3.68%\n10K Problems\n7.14%\n19.78%\n6.36%\n20K Problems\n10.36%\n21.89%\n9.62%\n50K Problems\n18.32%\n26.40%\n16.78%\n100K Problems\n25.98%\n31.44%\n22.20%\n200K Problems\n35.68%\n34.00%\n38.10%\nTable 10: Performance comparison of MathGLM on different training dataset sizes and model\nparameters.\nStep-by-Step Analysis for MWP. To investigate the impact of the step-by-step strategy on Math-\nGLM, we conduct a series of ablation studies to explore the performance differences with and without\nthis strategy. Figure 9 and Figure 10 demonstrate the performance comparison of MathGLM across\ndifferent GLM and ChatGLM models respectively. In terms of arithmetic accuracy, as shown in\nFigure 10, the MathGLM equipped with the step-by-step strategy records marginally lower scores\n15\nthan its counterpart without the strategy. This can be attributed to the fact that the step-by-step\napproach necessitates a sequential calculation for each mathematical problem. This encourages\nMathGLM to concentrate on grasping the foundational mathematical rules. Consequently, a portion\nof the MathGLM\u2019s processing power is dedicated to understanding and generating step-by-step\nsolutions, which might slightly weaken its prowess in precisely crafting arithmetic expressions.\nNevertheless, while there\u2019s a minor dip in arithmetic accuracy, the step-by-step strategy significantly\nbolsters MathGLM\u2019s answer accuracy. By guiding MathGLM to derive answers progressively, this\napproach ensures MathGLM generates higher accuracy in solving math word problems. Notably,\nwe observe pronounced improvements in answer accuracy across all GLM variants: 37.86% for\nGLM-Large, 42.29% for GLM-10B, 47.97% for GLM-6B, and 53.96% for GLM2-6B. Similar trends\nare also evident in the ChatGLM models, recording gains of 40.65% in ChatGLM-6B and 49.38%\nin ChatGLM2-6B. These results highlight the inherent trade-off between arithmetic accuracy and\nanswer accuracy by employing the step-by-step strategy. While this strategy may introduce some\npotentially impact on arithmetic accuracy, it effectively enhance MathGLM\u2019s ability to generate\naccurate answers for math word problems.\nGLM-Large\nGLM-10B\nGLM-6B\nGLM2-6B\nChatGLM-6B\nChatGLM2-6B\n+37.86%\n+42.29%\n+47.97%\n+53.96%\n+40.65%\n+49.38%\nFigure 9: The answer accuracy of MathGLM is compared across various backbone models, both with\nand without the use of a step-by-step strategy.

Interestingly, there\u2019s\na slight decrease in arithmetic accuracy when the step-by-step method is employed, likely due to the\nmodel having to perform calculations sequentially for each math problem.\n16\n4.2.5\nFailure Analysis on Math Word Problems\nFigure 11 provides some failed examples generated by MathGLM-GLM-10B on solving math word\nproblems. We can identify certain challenging scenarios where MathGLM-GLM-10B encounters\ndifficulties in solving math word problems. One common issue is the misinterpretation of ambiguous\nlanguage, leading to incorrect problem-solving approaches. For instance, ambiguous phrases such\nas \u201cmore than\u201d or \u201cless than\u201d can be interpreted differently by the model, resulting in inaccurate\nsolutions. Additionally, MathGLM-GLM-10B tends to struggle with problems that involve complex\nmathematical operations. As a result, it may provide partially correct arithmetic solutions but fail to\narrive at the final correct answer.\nHere, we construct a percentile graph to analyze the distribution of error types made by the MathGLM-\nGLM-10B on the Ape210K test dataset. As shown in Figure 12, we can identify the most common\nerror types that may require improvement for the MathGLM-GLM-10B. One prominent error type\nthat stands out is question misunderstood errors. These errors occur when the MathGLM-GLM-10B\nmisunderstands the language and context of certain math word problems, leading to inaccurate\nproblem-solving solutions. Despite these limitations, it is worth noting that MathGLM-GLM-10B\nstill demonstrates a remarkable ability to solve a wide range of math word problems accurately.\nQuestion\nGenerated Answer\nGround

examples generated by MathGLM-GLM-10B on solving math word problems.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this paper, our primary focus revolves around evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs, encompassing both arithmetic operations and math word problems. For arithmetic tasks,\nwe incorporate step-by-step solution and curriculum learning to train a Transformer-based language\nmodel from scratch. With comprehensive training on ample data, we establish that a language\nmodel boasting 2 billion parameters can achieve outstanding accuracy in multi-digit arithmetic\ntasks, exceeding GPT-4\u2019s results by a considerable margin. This finding compellingly challenges\nthe prevailing cognition that LLMs face constraints in executing accurate arithmetic operations,\nespecially when dealing with multi-digit numbers, decimals, and fractions, without leaning on\nexternal computational aids. When pivoting to math word problems, we reconstruct a dataset enriched\nwith multi-step arithmetic operations. After fine-tuning our MathGLM on this revamped dataset\nderived from GLM-10B, it achieves similar performance to GPT-4 on the 5,000-sample test set of\nChinese math problems, demonstrating its formidable prowess.\n17\nFigure 12: The distribution of error types generated by MathGLM-GLM-10B on math word problems.\nReferences\n[1] Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind\nNeelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, et al.

Symbols\nthat represent forms in the data include the decimal point (.), percent sign (%), negative sign (-),\nfraction delimiter (/), brackets such as \u2019(\u2019 and \u2019[\u2019, and the equal sign (=).\nTo achieve a consistent tokenization process, we adopt the unified tokenization tool icetk proposed\nin CogView2 [7]. By leveraging this methodology, we tokenize each digit as a distinct token. For\ninstance, the numeral \u201c12345\u201d is tokenized into the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. To allocate singular tokens\nto the other mentioned symbols, we disengage the continuous representation symbols within icetk\nthroughout the tokenization procedure.\nTable 11 shows some tokenization examples employed in MathGLM. This tokenization approach\nensuers that every element in the arithmetic expression is adequately represented and can be efficiently\nprocessed by the MathGLM, facilitating MathGLM to excute comprehensive arithmetic tasks.\nOwing to the variable lengths of arithmetic expressions, it becomes imperative to standardize their\nlengths for efficient training of the MathGLM. A straightforward method, like padding each input to\na fixed length, might damage training efficacy. To circumvent this, we adopt a more efficient strategy,\nwhere multiple arithmetic expressions are concatenated until they achieve a predefined fixed length.\nInput\nTokenization\n12345+345=\n[\u2019_\u2019, \u20191\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u20193\u2019, \u20194\u2019, \u20195\u2019, \u2019+\u2019, \u20193\u2019, \u20194\u2019, \u20195\u2019, \u2019=\u2019]\n[20005, 20009, 20010, 20013, 20016, 20015, 20065, 20013, 20016, 20015,\n20054]\n1234-45678=\n[\u2019_\u2019, \u20191\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u20193\u2019, \u20194\u2019, \u2019-\u2019, \u20194\u2019, \u20195\u2019, \u20196\u2019, \u20197\u2019, \u20198\u2019, \u2019=\u2019]\n[20005, 20009, 20010, 20013, 20016, 20011, 20016, 20015, 20021, 20025,\n20023, 20054]\n34*678=\n[\u2019_\u2019, \u20193\u2019, \u20194\u2019, \u2019*\u2019, \u20196\u2019, \u20197\u2019, \u20198\u2019, \u2019=\u2019]\n[20005, 20013, 20016, 20032, 20021, 20025, 20023, 20054]\n1.2/2=\n[\u2019_\u2019, \u20191\u2019, \u2019.\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u2019/\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u2019=\u2019]\n[20005, 20009, 20007, 20010, 20026, 20010, 20054]\n(1.2*3%)/2+[(12+3)*5]=\n[\u2019_\u2019, \u2019(\u2019, \u20191\u2019, \u2019.\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u2019*\u2019, \u20193\u2019, \u2019%\u2019, \u2019)\u2019, \u2019/\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u2019+\u2019, \u2019[\u2019, \u2019(\u2019, \u20191\u2019, \u20192\u2019, \u2019+\u2019, \u20193\u2019, \u2019)\u2019,\n\u2019*\u2019, \u20195\u2019, \u2019]\u2019, \u2019=\u2019]\n[20005, 20020, 20009, 20007, 20010, 20032, 20013, 20040, 20014, 20026,\n20010, 20065, 20052, 20020, 20009, 20010, 20065, 20013, 20014, 20032,\n20015, 20042, 20054]\nTable 11: Some examples of tokenization in MathGLM.\nA.2\nBackbone Models\nGeneral Language Model (GLM) is a Transformer-based language model that combines autogressive\nblank infilling with bidirectional attention mechanisms. Different from decoder-only language models\nthat primarily rely on unidirectional attention, GLM integrates bidirectional attention on unmasked\ncontexts. This innovative approach empowers it with heightened proficiency in both comprehension\nand generative tasks.\nPre-Training Objectives. To amplify its linguistic understanding and generative abilities, GLM\nincorporates a dual pre-training strategy: 1) Autoregressive Blank Infilling involves predicting missing\ntokens within spans of corrupted text, wherein segments are arbitrarily supplanted with a [MASK]\ntoken. 2) Multi-Task Pretraining is utilized to endow GLM text generation ability, which aims to\ngenerate longer text by sampling random-length span from document-level or sentence-level text.\nModel Sizes. GLM offers a diverse of models with various model parameters, including GLM-Large,\nGLM-6B, GLM-10B, GLM2-6B, ChatGLM-6B, and ChatGLM2-6B. Comprehensive specifics\n21\nconcerning the hyperparameters for each model variant can be found in Table 12. GLM-Large\nmodel is specifically tailored for Chinese language processing tasks equipped with 335M model\nparameters, while GLM-10B, GLM-6B, and GLM2-6B are equipped with 10 billion, 6 billion,\nand 6 billion parameters, respectively, enabling them to handle a wide range of NLP tasks with\nvarying complexities. Augmenting the series are bilingual conversational models: ChatGLM-6B and\nChatGLM2-6B, both tailored for Chinese-English bilingual dialogue tasks. The ChatGLM-6B model,\nhaving 6.2 billion parameters, undergoes fine-tuning using Chinese Q&A and dialogue datasets. In\ncontrast, ChatGLM2-6B emerges as an evolved iteration of ChatGLM-6B, marking enhancements in\nperformance, extended context handling, optimized inference, and broader applicability.\nModel\nDimension\nHeads\nLayers\nParameters\nGLM-Large-Chinese\n1024\n24\n16\n335M\nGLM-10B-Chinese\n4096\n64\n48\n10B\nGLM-6B\n4096\n32\n28\n6.2B\nGLM2-6B\n4096\n32\n28\n6.2B\nChatGLM-6B\n4096\n32\n28\n6.2B\nChatGLM2-6B\n4096\n32\n28\n6.2B\nTable 12: Hyperparameters of the backbone models.\nA.3\nArithmetic Dataset\nThe training dataset for pre-training arithmetic model is created with a Python script. The dataset\nincludes a variety of arithmetic expressions, encompassing different types of arithmetic operations\nsuch as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Each expression in the\ndataset is composed of various types of numbers, including integers, decimals, fractions, percents,\nand negative numbers. The training dataset consists of approximately 50 million arithmetic sequences.\nTo investigate the impact of dataset scale on the arithmetic performance, we also create multiple\ndatasets of varying sizes, including 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, and 25 million. This diverse\nrepresentation of numbers ensures that the model can handle a wide range of numerical formats\nencountered in real-world arithmetic problems.\nTo facilitate the learning of underlying calculation rules, the arithmetic expressions are designed to be\nmore complex than simple two-number calculations. Instead, each expression in the dataset involves\nmultiple steps of calculations, ranging from 2 to 10 steps. By creating multi-step expressions, the\nmodel is exposed to more intricate mathematical reasoning and is better equipped to handle complex\narithmetic problem-solving. The details of expressions is presented as follows. Table 13 demonstrates\nexamples from the arithmetic dataset.\n\u2022 Operations involving integers up to 10,000 that combine addition, subtraction, multiplication,\nand division.\n\u2022 Exponentiation tasks using an integer base up to 10,000 and an integer exponent capped at\n100.\n\u2022 Bracketed expressions that include integers up to 10,000, combined with operations such as\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\u2022 Lengthy arithmetic expressions that incorporate brackets and blend various numerical types,\nincluding integers, decimals, percentages, and negative numbers.

Through careful examination of these examples, we can observe several patterns and trends in\nthe MathGLM\u2019s errors. Firstly, MathGLM appears to grapple with intricate arithmetic expressions,\nparticularly those combining several operations and large numbers. For instance, the expression\n14031528/742: the division of an 8-digit number by a 4-digit one proves problematic for MathGLM,\nleading to miscalculations in the outcome. Secondly, MathGLM tends to encounter difficulties when\ndealing with long sequences of numbers and operations. As the expression length increases, the\nmodel\u2019s ability to accurately perform arithmetic calculations diminishes, leading to inaccurate results.\nFor example, expression involving multiplication among two large numbers like 3626 * 8919 and\ncalculation with a decimal and large integer number like 1.610311 * 7691. These errors generated by\nMathGLM usually have only one calculation result error, indicating that the MathGLM\u2019s mistakes\nmainly occur at specific calculation steps rather than affecting the entire expression.\nA.6\nK6 Dataset\nWe collect math word problems from Chinese elementary schools in collaboration with the renowned\neducational institution, TAL AI Lab. The dataset consists of math problems for each grade level,\nwith each grade containing approximately 100 problems. The wide-ranging nature of these math\nword problems empowers us to gauge the model\u2019s efficacy across an array of difficulty gradients\nand academic grades. To illustrate the diversity and complexity of the K6 dataset, we present some\nexemplary math word problems in Table 16.

The details of each baseline\nLLM as follows.\n\u2022 GPT-4 [24] is the most advanced generative language model that developed by OpenAI,\nwhich successfully achieves so many SOTA performances on a variety of downstream tasks.\n\u2022 ChatGPT [23] is the predecessor of GPT4 and is constructed upon the success of Instruct-\nGPT [25], which is fine-tuned using instruction data with reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF), making it a powerful tool for natural language understanding and\nconversation.\n\u2022 MOSS [31] is an open-source LLM that consists of 16 billion model parameters. It utilizes\n100 billion Chinese tokens and 20 billion English tokens to learn language patterns and\nsemantic representations.\n\u2022 Ziya-LLaMA-13B [44] is a language model constructed on LLaMA-13B, which extends\nLLaMA-13B\u2019s character set to contain 7,000 Chinese characters and undergoes continual\npre-training on a vast dataset of 110 billion Chinese tokens.\n\u2022 Chinese-Alpaca-13B [6] is a Chinese language model with 13 billion parameters that is built\nupon LLaMA-13B. During the supervised instruction tuning, the Low Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) [13] technique is utilized to fine-tune LLaMA-13B for Chinese language tasks.\n\u2022 Baichuan-7B [14] shares similarities with LLaMA but is pre-trained from scratch on a\nmassive dataset containing 1.2 trillion Chinese and English tokens.\n\u2022 ChatGLM-6B [34] and its successor ChatGLM2-6B [35] are language models that share\na unified transformer architecture named GLM [8, 43]. These models are pre-trained\non a diverse dataset containing English and Chinese data, combined with the supervised\ninstruction tuning, makes them powerful tools for understanding and generating text in both\nEnglish and Chinese contexts.\nA.8\nTraining Steps Analysis.\nWe explore the impact of training steps on the MathGLM\u2019s performance by analyzing its performance\nagainst varied training steps, as depicted in Figure 13. The results reveal that there is a consistent\nuptrend in performance as the number of training steps increases. With more training steps, MathGLM\nbecomes increasingly adept at comprehending and resolving math word problems, which translates\nto a surge in accuracy. However, it is clearly observed that the performance gains of MathGLM\nstart to plateau after a certain point, indicating potential diminishing returns with extended training.\nThese findings highlight the significance of finding an optimal balance between training time and\nperformance gains for MathGLM in solving math word prblems. Additionally, we observe that model\nundergoing instruction tuning requires a longer training duration to achieve consistent accuracy on\nmath word problems.\n25\n25000 steps\n70000 steps\n20000 steps\nFigure 13: The impact of training steps on MathGLM with different backbone models.

As shown in Figure 14, these examples illustrate how the MathGLM\nleverages a step-by-step strategy to solve both arithmetic tasks and math word problems accurately.\nFor arithmetic tasks, the MathGLM breaks down complex calculations into multiple steps rather\nthan a direct answer. The step-by-step strategy ensures that each intermediate result is accurately\ncomputed, leading to the final correct answer for each arithmetic expression.\nIn math word problems, the MathGLM utilizes LLMs\u2019s language understanding capabilities to\nunderstand the problem statement accurately. The MathGLM then applies the step-by-step strategy to\nseperately calculate the generated arithmetic expressions for each math problem, enabling it to obtain\nthe correct answer for math word problems.\n\u1234\u170c\u0a39\u0523\u0527\u04de\u0763\u104b\u190f\u0e62\u07be\u04de\u0763\u12aa\u0669\u14df\u000f\n\u04de\u0648\u1730\u0527\u0019\u0013\u0013\u0013\u0632\u000f\u12aa\u0669\u14df\u1331\u0570\u1c38\u0e0e\u104b\n\u190f\u0e62\u1331\u000b\u0016\u0012\u0018\f\u000f\u0fe2\u104b\u190f\u0e62\u1331\u0570\u1c38\u0011\nMath

Existing works mainly focus on language and image instruction tuning, dif-\nferent from which, our ImageBind-LLM can respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio,\n3D point clouds, video, and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.\nDuring training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space between LLaMA\nand ImageBind\u2019s image encoder. Then, the image features transformed by the bind network are added\nto word tokens of all layers in LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-\nfree and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of ImageBind, the simple\nimage-text training enables our model to exhibit superior multi-modality instruction-following capabil-\nities. During inference, the multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders,\nand processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding enhancement.\nThe training-free cache model retrieves from three million image features extracted by ImageBind,\nwhich effectively mitigates the training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach,\nImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate significant\nlanguage generation quality. Code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter.\nKeywords: Large Language Model, Multi-Modal Learning, Instruction Tuning\n1 Introduction\nRecently, we have witnessed substantial advance-\nments in the instruction tuning of large lan-\nguage models (LLMs). With versatile intelligence\nand interactivity, ChatGPT [4] and GPT-4 [5]\npresent general-purpose chatting systems follow-\ning human instructions in language and images,\nwhich is yet unreplicable due to the closed-source\nrestriction. Inspired by this, Alpaca [6], LLaMA-\nAdapter [7], and follow-up works [8\u201310] propose to\nfine-tune the publicly available LLaMA [11] into\n1\narXiv:2309.03905v2  [cs.MM]  11 Sep 2023\nLLaMA-Adapter,  Otter,\nLLaVA, MiniGPT-4 \u2026\nImageBind-LLM\nOnly Image\nInstruction\nResponse\nImage\nInstruction\nAudio\nVideo\n\u2026\nResponse\n(a) Visual Instruction Models:\n(b) Multi-modality Instruction Model:\nMulti-modality Instruction\nTuning Efficiency\nCross-modal Cache Retrieval\nAttention-free Zero-init. Injection\nPoint Cloud\nText\nFig. 1 Visual Instruction Models vs. Our Multi-modality ImageBind-LLM. Different from existing works [1\u20133]\nconditioned only on image modality, ImageBind-LLM conducts a general multi-modality instruction tuning for image, text,\naudio, video, and 3D.\nlanguage instruction models by self-constructed\ndata. Further, to achieve image instruction tuning,\nLLaVA [2], LLaMA-Adapter [7], and others [3]\nincorporate visual understanding capabilities into\nLLMs for image-conditioned generation. Despite\nthe effectiveness of existing instruction tuning\napproaches, how to develop an LLM for gen-\neral multi-modality instructions, e.g., text, image,\naudio, 3D point clouds, and video, is still under-\nexplored.\nIn this paper, we introduce a multi-modality\ninstruction-following model, ImageBind-LLM,\nwhich efficiently fine-tunes LLaMA, guided by the\njoint embedding space in the pre-trained Image-\nBind [12]. As compared in Figure 1, different\nfrom previous visual instruction models (a), our\nImageBind-LLM (b) can respond to input instruc-\ntions of multiple modalities besides images, indi-\ncating promising extensibility and generalization\ncapacity. Specifically, thanks to the image-aligned\nmulti-modality embedding space of ImageBind,\nwe propose to only leverage the vision-language\ndata for multi-modality instruction tuning. For\nan image-caption pair, we first utilize the frozen\nimage encoder of ImageBind to extract the global\nimage feature, and adopt a learnable bind net-\nwork for embedding transformation. Then, the\ntransformed image feature is added to the word\ntokens at all transformer layers in LLaMA, which\nprovides visual conditions to generate the corre-\nsponding textual caption. Different from the zero-\ninitialized attention in LLaMA-Adapter series [1,\n7], our visual injection method is attention-free\nand simply weighted by a trainable zero-initialized\ngating factor. In such an efficient manner, the\ninstruction cues of ImageBind\u2019s multi-modality\nembeddings can be progressively injected into\nLLaMA as the training goes on, without disturb-\ning the original language knowledge.\nAfter the simple vision-language training, our\nImageBind-LLM obtains the capability to follow\ninstructions of various modalities, by applying\nImageBind for modality-specific encoding, e.g.,\ntext, image, audio, and video. For instructions\nin 3D domains, we utilize the pre-trained 3D\nencoder in Point-Bind [13] to encode the input 3D\npoint clouds. To alleviate the modality discrep-\nancy of image training and text/audio/3D/video-\nconditioned generation, we further propose a\ntraining-free visual cache model for embedding\nenhancement during inference. The cache model\ncontains millions of image features in the train-\ning\ndatasets\nextracted\nby\nImageBind,\nwhich\nimproves text/audio/3D/video embeddings by\nretrieving similar visual features, referring to\nTip-Adapter [14]. This contributes to higher-\nquality\nlanguage\nresponses\nto\nmulti-modality\ninstructions. In diverse scenarios, we evaluate\nthe multi-modality instruction-following capabil-\nities of ImageBind-LLM, and observe consistent\nsuperior performance.\nOverall, our ImageBind-LLM exhibits four\nmain characteristics as follows.\n\u2022 Multi-modality Instructions. Different from\nprevious language and image instruction mod-\nels, ImageBind-LLM is tuned to respond to\ngeneral multi-modality inputs, such as image,\ntext, audio, 3D point clouds, video, and their\nembedding-space arithmetic encoded by Image-\nBind and Point-Bind.\n2\n\u2022 Tuning Efficiency. During training, we freeze\nthe image encoder of ImageBind, and fine-\ntune partial weights in LLaMA by parameter-\nefficient techniques, including LoRA [15] and\nbias-norm tuning [1, 16\u201319]. Besides, we only\ntrain the additional bind network and zero-\ninitialized gating factors.\n\u2022 Attention-free Zero-initialized Injection.\nInstead of incorporating new instruction cues\nby attention layers, we directly add the multi-\nmodality conditions with all word tokens of\nLLaMA, and adopt a learnable gating mecha-\nnism for progressive knowledge injection, more\nsimple and effective.\n\u2022 Cross-modality Cache Retrieval. To allevi-\nate the modality discrepancy of training (only\nimage) and inference (multiple modalities), we\nintroduce a visual cache model constructed\nby ImageBind-extracted image features, which\nconducts cross-modality retrieval for embedding\nenhancement.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Visual Instruction Models.\nGiven\nthe\nrapid\ndevelopment\nof\nlanguage\ninstruction-following capabilities [6, 8, 11], how to\nenable large language models (LLMs) to perform\nvisual understanding has also gained significant\nattention. LLaMA-Adapter [7], for the first time,\nproposes to generate language responses condi-\ntioned on image inputs. It leverages a pre-trained\nencoder to extract image tokens, and incorpo-\nrates them with LLaMA by parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning, which however can only tackle some\nnaive visual question answering scenarios, i.e., Sci-\nenceQA [20]. For more general visual instruction-\nfollowing circumstances, many efforts have been\nmade to produce high-quality vision-language\ndata for training by ChatGPT [4] or GPT-\n4 [21], such as LLaVA [22], MiniGPT-4 [3], and\nOtter [23]. They normally follow the architecture\nof BLIP-2 [24] with a more advanced Vicuna [9],\nor fine-tune the entire LLM with costly training\nresources. LLaMA-Adapter [7] develops a joint\ntraining strategy that only requires a combina-\ntion of image-caption pairs and language instruc-\ntion data, but still performs comparably to those\nwith delicately constructed training data. Vide-\noLLM [25] and Video-LLaMA [26] also connect\nvideo reasoning modules with LLMs to allow for\nvideo instruction-following powers with temporal\ninformation. Different from them, our ImageBind-\nLLM takes a step forward by tuning a multi-\nmodality LLM conditioned on language questions\nwith image, video, audio, and 3D point cloud\ninput, allowing for widespread applications.\n2.2 Multi-modality Alignment.\nBridging\ndifferent\nmodalities\nwithin\na\njoint\nembedding space for cross-modality processing\nhas emerged as a critical research area in both\nvision and language. CLIP [27], ALIGN [28], and\nFlorence [29] utilize simple contrastive learning\nparadigms to align image and text pairs, con-\ntributing to promising zero-shot generalization\nperformance. Flamingo [30], BLIP-2 [24], and\nMAGIC [31] adopt intermediate networks to con-\nnect pre-trained vision and language encoders.\nAudioCLIP [32] and PointCLIP [33] respectively\nextend the embedding space of CLIP to other\nmodalities, such as audio and 3D point clouds.\nRecently, ImageBind [12] is proposed to share\na single latent space with various modalities,\nincluding image, video, text, and audio. Inspired\nby ImageBind, Point-Bind [13] learns to blend\n3D point cloud modalities into ImageBind, and\nachieves favorable 3D zero-shot accuracy. In this\npaper, we focus on aligning the shared embed-\nding space in ImageBind/Point-Bind with LLaMA\nfor multi-modality instruction-following capacity.\nPandaGPT [34] also aims to tune a multi-modality\nLLM based on ImageBind, which cannot sup-\nport 3D point clouds as input, and utilizes a\nstronger LLM, Vicuna [9], as the pre-trained lan-\nguage model. In contrast, our ImageBind-LLM is\nstill based on LLaMA [11] and introduces unique\nattention-free zero-initialized injection with cross-\nmodality cache retrieval for better multi-modality\nreasoning.\n3 Method\nIn Section 3.1, we first briefly revisit some prior\nworks as a preliminary, including ImageBind,\ncache models, and LLaMA-Adapter. Then, in\nSection 3.2, we introduce the details of our\nproposed multi-modality instruction tuning and\ncache-enhanced inference in ImageBind-LLM.\n3\n3.1 A Revisit of Prior Works\n3.1.1 ImageBind\nWith a single joint embedding space, Image-\nBind [12] proposes to connect five different modal-\nities, i.e., text, audio, depth, thermal, and Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU), all by image-paired\ndata. Following CLIP [27], the pre-training of\nImageBind adopts a contrastive loss, which clus-\nters image features with other paired modalities,\nand pushes away unpaired ones in the embed-\nding space. Self-supervised by large-scale image-\npaired data, ImageBind learns to encode differ-\nent modalities into aligned feature embeddings,\nwhich obtains emergent cross-modal zero-shot\ncapabilities. Then, ImageBind can be utilized to\nextend existing vision-language models to incorpo-\nrate new modalities, such as text-to-audio/video\nretrieval, audio-to-image generation, and audio-\nreferred object detection. Inspired by this image-\ncentric property, our approach only conducts\nvision-language training to align the joint embed-\nding space of ImageBind with LLaMA [11], achiev-\ning efficient multi-modality instruction tuning.\n3.1.2 LLaMA-Adapter\nAs a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method,\nLLaMA-Adapter [7] transforms LLaMA into a\nlanguage instruction model by only 1.2M param-\neters within 1 hour, which exhibits comparable\nperformance to the fully fine-tuned Alpaca [6]. On\ntop of this, LLaMA-Adapter [7] is also proposed to\nattain superior visual instruction-following capac-\nity. It adopts a joint training paradigm for image-\ntext and language-only instruction data, and\nstill features tuning efficiency by updating par-\ntial parameters (14M) in LLaMA. One of the\ncore innovations of LLaMA-Adapter series is the\nzero-initialized attention mechanism. They encode\nvision instruction signals as tokens, and concate-\nnate them with the word tokens in LLaMA as\nprefixes. Within every attention layer, a learnable\ngating factor is utilized to adaptively control how\nmuch information the new instruction knowledge\nis incorporated into LLMs. Our ImageBind-LLM\nalso adopts a zero-gated injection strategy for\nmulti-modality instructions, but in a more simple\nand effective attention-free manner.\n3.1.3 Cache Models\nWithout any training, a cache model can be uti-\nlized to store the features and labels of a training\nset, organizing them as a key-value database. Dur-\ning inference, the test sample serves as a query to\nretrieve from the keys and aggregate informative\nvalues via the key-query similarity. Starting from\nthe conventional k Nearest Neighbors algorithm\n(k-NN), cache models have been widely adopted\nto assist deep neural networks in language [35],\n2D vision [36], and 3D point clouds [37]. Tip-\nAdapter [14] and its follow-up works [37\u201339] pro-\npose to store the CLIP-extracted image features\nof the given few-shot data, and regard the cache\nmodel as a non-parametric adapter for down-\nstream tasks. Similarly, we cache the ImageBind-\nextracted 1 million image features as both keys\nand values, which enhances the multi-modality\nembeddings in inference time.\n3.2 ImageBind-LLM\nTo obtain a multi-modality instruction model,\nwe propose ImageBind-LLM, which includes two\ntraining stages: vision-language pre-training on\nimage-caption data (Section 3.2.1) and multi-\nmodality instruction tuning on visual instruc-\ntion data (Section 3.2.2). Besides, we also pro-\npose cross-modality cache retrieval for enhanced\ninference (Section 3.2.3). The overall training\nparadigm of ImageBind-LLM is shown in Figure 2.\n3.2.1 Vision-Language Pre-training\nGiven the modality-bound property of Image-\nBind [12], we only fine-tune LLaMA [11] to gener-\nate language responses conditioned on ImageBind-\nencoded images, after which, the model can inher-\nently understand instructions of other modalities\nvia the respective ImageBind encoders. Therefore,\nwe propose to only leverage vision-language data\nfor tuning a multi-modality instruction model.\nFollowing LLaMA-Adapter [7], we adopt a two-\nstage training pipeline for ImageBind-LLM: first\nutilizing large-scale image-caption data [40\u201342]\nto learn the image-conditioned response capacity,\nthen leveraging instruction-following data [3, 22]\nto preserve the long-sentence generation quality.\nThe overall training paradigm of ImageBind-LLM\nis shown in Figure 2. For a given image-caption\npair, we first adopt the frozen image encoder\n4\n\u2026\n\u201c\u2026 swimming\u201d\nIMAGEBIND\nEncoder\nBind\nNetwork\nLLaMA\nTransformer Layer\nZero Gate\n+\n\u201cA happy dog is \u2026\u201d\nCaption:\nTraining Image:\n\u2026\nTransformer Layer\nZero Gate\n\u2026\n\u2026\nAll 32 layers\nRepeat\nAdd to all \nword tokens\nAll 32 layers\nAdd to all \nword tokens\n+\n+\nFine-tune\nFreeze\n+ Feature Add\n+\nFeature Multiply\nTransformed\nImage\nFeature\nTraining Paradigm of ImageBind-LLM\n+\nPartial Tuning\nImage\nFeature\nFig. 2 Training Paradigm of ImageBind-LLM. Considering the joint embedding space in imageBind [12], we only\nutilize image-text datasets for multi-modality instruction tuning of LLaMA [11]. We introduce a bind network for embedding\nalignment, and an attention-free zero-initialized mechanism for visual knowledge injection.\nof ImageBind to extract the global visual fea-\nture. Then, we transform the visual feature with\na learnable bind network, and add it to every\nword token in LLaMA. In an attention-free zero-\ninitialized manner, LLaMA is injected by image\ncondition and generates the given image caption.\nBind Network.\nIn Figure 3, we present the details of the bind net-\nwork, which aims to align the embedding space\nbetween ImageBind and LLaMA. Specifically, we\ndenote the CI-dimensional global image feature\nencoded by ImageBind as FI \u2208 R1\u00d7CI. In the\nbind network, we first adopt a linear projec-\ntion layer with a weight matrix w0 \u2208 RCI\u00d7C,\nformulated as F 0\nI\n= FIw0 \u2208 R1\u00d7C, where C\ndenotes the feature dimension of LLaMA. Inspired\nby the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in LLaMA,\nwe then cascade three projection blocks with\nRMSNorm [43], SiLU activation functions [44],\nand residual connections [45]. For the (i + 1)-th\nblock with F i\ntion of F i+1 I as input, we formulate the calcula-\nI\nas (the normalization is omitted for\nsimplicity)\nF i+1\nI\n= F i\nI + (F i\nIw2 \u00b7 SiLU(F i\nIw1))w3,\n0 \u2264 i < 3\n(1)\nwhere w1, w2 \u2208 RC\u00d7Ch and w3 \u2208 RCh\u00d7C, with\nCh denoting the hidden dimension. After the bind\nnetwork, we obtain the transformed image feature,\nTI \u2208 R1\u00d7C, which learns to align the embedding\nspace from ImageBind to LLaMA.\nAttention-free Zero-initialized Injection.\nWith the encoded image feature TI, existing visual\ninstruction methods, e.g., LLaMA-Adapter [7],\nLLaVA [22], and MiniGPT-4 [3], concatenate it as\nthe prefix to the word token sequence {T j\nW }N\nj=1\nin LLaMA, where N denotes the sequence length.\nThen, they leverage self-attention mechanisms in\nLLaMA\u2019s transformer blocks for visual knowledge\nincorporation from TI to {T j\nW }N\nj=1. However, such\n5\nIMAGEBIND\nEncoder\nNorm\n\ud835\udc64!\nSiLU\n\ud835\udc64\"\n\ud835\udc64#\n\ud835\udc64$\nX 3\nBind Network\nTraining Image:\nTransformed\nImage \nFeature\nImage \nFeature\nFig. 3 Details of the Bind Network. Referring to the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in LLaMA [11], we adopt cascaded\nblocks of RMSNorm [43], SiLU activation functions [44], and residual connections [45]. This aims to align the image feature\nfrom ImageBind [12] with LLaMA\u2019s word embeddings.\nan attention-based approach not only causes extra\ncomputation budget, but also increases the train-\ning difficulty. In our ImageBind-LLM, we adopt a\nsimpler and more effective method by attention-\nfree zero-initialized injection. We directly add the\nimage feature TI with every word token at all\ntransformer layers of LLaMA, which explicitly\nfuses the visual conditions (and multi-modality\ninputs during inference) with the language knowl-\nedge in LLM. In addition, to adaptively control\nthe level of integration, we utilize a learnable gat-\ning factor initialized by zero, denoted as gzero. For\nany word token T j\nW in LLaMA, we formulate the\nvisual injection as\nT j = TI \u00b7 gzero + T j\nW .\n(2)\nSimilar\nto\nthe\nzero-initialized\nattention\nin\nLLaMA-Adapter [7], this gating factor can pro-\ngressively increase during training, and inject\nmore visual semantics into LLaMA, contributing\nto stable learning in the early training stage.\n3.2.2 Multi-modality Instruction\nTuning\nSince we have connected ImageBind and LLaMA\nwith a bind network via large-scale image-text pre-\ntraining, ImageBind-LLM can understand mul-\ntimodal inputs (audio, video, and 3D point\nclouds), and generate language response condi-\ntioned on multi-modality inputs. However, unlike\nLLaVA [22] and MiniGPT-4 [3] that directly uti-\nlize a well-trained language instruction model\nVicuna [9] as the base LLM, we instead adopt\na non-instruction model LLaMA. Therefore, in\nthe second training stage, we partially tune the\nparameters in LLaMA to equip it with instruction-\nfollowing ability, while keep the multi-modality\nencoders of ImageBind and the bind network\nfrozen.\nParameter-efficient Fine-tuning.\nOur second-stage training data is a mixture of\nlanguage instruction data [10, 46] and visual\ninstruction data [22]. As language instruction data\ncontains no paired images, we input a fake image\n(filled with zero) as the placeholder during train-\ning. To maintain the multi-modality understand-\ning capacity of the first-stage training, we only\nfine-tune LLaMA with parameter-efficient meth-\nods including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [15]\nand bias-norm tuning [1, 16\u201319]. Specifically, we\nadd a low-rank layer for each linear layer in the\ntransformer, where the rank is set to 16 by default.\nWe also unfreeze all the normalization layers and\nadd a learnable bias term to the linear layers. The\nparameters of all other modules are frozen during\ntraining.\nHigh-Quality Instruction Tuning.\nAlthough the fine-tuned ImageBind-LLM can gen-\nerate instruction-following responses, we notice\nthat\nit\noccasionally\nfantasizes\nabout\nobjects\nthat don\u2019t exist in the input modality. There-\nfore, we introduce additional instruction tun-\ning stage using high-quality instruction data\nfrom MiniGPT-4 [3]. Different from the visual\ninstruction data generated by ChatGPT/GPT4,\n6\n\u22ef\n\u22ef\n(a) Cache Model Construction\nImages from Training Datasets:\nIMAGEBIND\nEncoder\nIMAGEBIND\nMulti-modality\n\u22ef\n\u22ef\nCache Model\nImage \nFeatures\n(b) Cache-Enhanced Inference\nMulti-modality Input:\nCache Model\nKeys & Values\nNaive\nMulti-modality\nFeatures\nEncoders\nQuery\nRetrieve top-k\nEnhanced\nMulti-modality\nFeatures\nBind\nNetwork\nLLaMA\nFig. 4 Cache Retrieval for Inference. To mitigate the training-inference discrepancy, we construct a training-free visual\ncached model of ImageBind-encoded image features (b). Then, during inference, we enhance the multi-modality embeddings\nby retrieving top-k similar visual features in the cache model.\nMiniGPT-4 manually collects 3.5K image descrip-\ntion data for high-quality vision-language align-\nment. Here we also adopt the 3.5K image descrip-\ntion data for further instruction tuning, which\nonly takes a few minutes.\n3.2.3 Cache Retrieval for Inference\nAfter\nfine-tuning\nby\nvisual\ninstruction\ndata,\nImageBind-LLM can inherently derive the multi-\nmodality\ninstruction-following\ncapacity.\nThen,\nbesides the naive inference mode (Figure 4 (a)),\nwe further propose to construct a visual cache\nmodel by ImageBind for multi-modality embed-\nding enhancement (Figure 4 (b)).\nNaive Multi-modality Inference.\nVia the bind network, the image features from\nImageBind can be well aligned with LLaMA\u2019s\nword tokens. Given the joint multi-modality\nembedding space of ImageBind, our ImageBind-\nLLM spontaneously obtains the understanding\ncapability for input instructions with various\nmodalities, such as image, text, audio, and video,\nonly if we apply their corresponding encoders\nfrom ImageBind before the bind network. For 3D\npoint clouds, we can also utilize the pre-trained\n3D encoder of Point-Bind [13] for global fea-\nture extraction, which shares the same embedding\nspace with ImageBind.\nCache-enhanced Inference.\nDespite the effectiveness of the aforementioned\nnaive mode, there exists modality discrepancy in\nImageBind-LLM between training and inference.\nNamely, we adopt image encoder of ImageBind\nfor training, but switch to other encoders for\ninference, which slightly disturbs the tuned bind\nnetwork and LLaMA. Therefore, we construct a\ntraining-free cache model of image features to\nenhance the multi-modality embeddings during\ninference. As shown in Figure 4 (a), we utilize\nImageBind to encode a subset of the vision-\nlanguage training data, and store them as both\nkeys and values in the cache model. For an\ninput multi-modality instruction in Figure 4 (b),\nwe regard its ImageBind-encoded feature as the\nquery, FM \u2208 R1\u00d7CI, and retrieve the top-k sim-\nilar visual keys from the cache model, denoted\nas Fkey \u2208 Rk\u00d7CI. We formulate the top-k cosine\nsimilarity as\nStopk = FMF T\nkey\n\u2208 R1\u00d7k,\n(3)\n7\nwhere we suppose FM and Fkey have been L2-\nnormalized. Then, according to Stopk, we aggre-\ngate the corresponding cached values, Fvalue \u2208\nRk\u00d7CI (top-k similar image features), and add the\nresult to the original feature FM via a residual\nconnection, formulated as\nF e\nM = \u03b1 \u00b7 StopkFvalue + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 FM,\n(4)\nwhere \u03b1 serves as a balance factor. Aided by the\ncache model, the enhanced feature F e\nM is adap-\ntively incorporated with similar visual semantics\nfrom the cache model. This boosts the represen-\ntation quality of other modalities, and mitigates\ntheir semantic gap to the images used for train-\ning. After this, F e\nM is fed into the bind network for\nfeature transformation and LLaMA for response\ngeneration.\n3.3 Advanced Applications\nBesides the superior multi-modality instruction-\nfollowing capabilities, our ImageBind-LLM can\nalso be extended to a wide range of advanced\napplications with simple modifications.\n3.3.1 Bilingual Instruction Tuning\nIn addition to English instructions, ImageBind-\nLLM can be easily upgraded to a bilingual\ninstruction-following model, e.g., English and Chi-\nnese. More specifically, we replace the basic LLM\nfrom LLaMA to a bilingual LLM, ChineseL-\nLaMA1 and add 52K Chinese instruction data\nfrom GPT4LLM [10] for joint instruction tun-\ning. Although we do not have direct Chinese\nvisual instruction data for the first vision-language\ntraining stage, we observe that our bilingual\nImageBind-LLM implicitly learns the alignment\nbetween Chinese, English and multi-modality\ninputs, and can well follow Chinese instructions\nconditioned on other modality inputs.\n3.3.2 Any-to-any Generation\nCurrently, most multi-modality instruction mod-\nels\nare\nlimited\nto\ngenerating\nonly\ntextual\nresponses, lacking the ability to respond with\nother modal outputs, e.g., image, audio, and\npoint clouds. Since ImageBind is an extension of\n1https://github.com/OpenLMLab/OpenChineseLLaMA\nCLIP [27], we can append CLIP-conditioned gen-\nerative models after ImageBind\u2019s encoders, such\nas Stable Diffusion [47], Make-An-Audio [48], and\nCLIP-Forge [49], respectively for image, audio,\nand point cloud generation. Instead of directly\ninputting ImageBind features into these gener-\native models, we adopt cache-enhanced genera-\ntion to mitigate the modality discrepancy, simi-\nlar to the approach in Cache-enhanced Inference\n(Section 3.2.3). In this way, we can achieve instruc-\ntion models with any-to-any generation system,\ni.e., responding to multi-modality instructions by\nmulti-modality responses. as an example, our\nImageBind-LLM can generate both textual and\nimage responses for multi-modality inputs (e.g.,\nimage, audio and point clouds).\n3.3.3 Integration with Object\nDetection\nVisual instruction models can answer questions\nbased on the global content of input images. How-\never, they cannot associate the text response with\nregional objects in the image, which is impor-\ntant for fine-grained tasks such as visual reasoning\nand grounding. We provide a solution to connect\nImageBind-LLM with object detectors [50]. For\na response generated by ImageBind-LLM, we use\ntraditional noun parsers [51] or ChatGPT [4] to\nextract nouns in the response. Then we feed the\ninput image and parsed nouns into object detec-\ntors to get object detection results. Generally,\nthe traditional noun parser is enough for pars-\ning meaningful nouns, but it cannot handle nouns\nwith complex modifiers, such as \u201da running black\ndog\u201d. Therefore, we will also ask ChatGPT to\nextract complex nouns in the response.\n3.3.4 ImageBind-LLM as Chatbot\nImageBind-LLM was originally designed as a\nsingle-turn multi-modality instruction model. We\nturn ImageBind-LLM into a multi-turn chat-\nbot by training it on multi-turn conversation\ndata, including language conversation data from\nShareGPT [46] and visual conversation data from\nLLaVA [2]. By this, ImageBind-LLM can be used\nas a multi-turn chat model to answer open-ended\nquestions on multi-modality inputs.\n8\n3.3.5 ImageBind-LLM for API Control\nIn addition to its primary multimodal instruction-\nfollowing capacity, ImageBind-LLM also exhibits\nthe potential to invoke diverse API controls for\nmulti-modality tool usage. To achieve this, we\nleverage the tool-related instruction dataset intro-\nduced in GPT4Tools [52] to empower ImageBind-\nLLM with the ability to effectively utilize var-\nious tools. By training ImageBind-LLM on the\nGPT4Tools dataset using our proposed training\nparadigm, we observe its impressive proficiency in\ncalling different APIs, enabling it to accomplish\na wide range of tasks, even when encountering\npreviously unseen tools. This performance in API\ncontrol highlights the potential of ImageBind-\nLLM as a versatile visual assistant capable of\nsolving diverse real-world problems.\n4 Experiment\n4.1 Training Details\n4.1.1 Datasets\nWe train ImageBind-LLM on a collection of open-\nsourced image-text pair data, language-only and\nvisual instruction data.\nImage-Text Pair Data. Our ImageBind-LLM is\npre-trained on the concatenation of open-sourced\nimage-text\npair\ndata,\nincluding\nCOCO\n[53],\nCC3M [41], CC12M [42], SBU [54], LAION-\n2B [40], COYO [55] and MMC4 [56]. Note that\nMMC4-Core [56] is a billion-scale corpus of images\ninterleaved with text. We extract 20M high-\nquality image-text pairs from MMC4-Core accord-\ning to the provided clip alignment score. For\nLAION-2B [40] dataset, we also extract 100M\nhigh-quality image-text pairs based on their CLIP\nalignment scores. The concatenation of all open-\nsourced image-text pairs result into 940M image-\ntext pair data. Unlike BLIP [57] which designs\nan effective data cleaning pipeline, our image-\ntext pairs are much noisy. However, we empiri-\ncally observe strong image understanding and fac-\ntual ability of ImageBind-LLM when pre-trained\nwith this dataset. In the future, we will explore\nadvanced approaches for data cleaning and dedu-\nplication.\nInstruction Tuning Datasets. Our instruction\ntuning data includes language instruction data\nAlpaca [6], GPT4LLM [10] and ShareGPT [46],\nvisual\ninstruction\ndata\nLLaVA\n[22]\nand\nMiniGPT4 [3]. For language instruction data,\nAlpaca contains 52K single-turn instruction data\ncollected from GPT3.5; GPT4LLM is a GPT4\nversion of Alpaca with higher quality; ShareGPT\nis a collection of user-shared conversations with\nChatGPT/GPT4. For visual instruction data,\nLLaVA adopts GPT4 to transform image cap-\ntions or object detection annotations into 150K\nvisual instruction data; MiniGPT4 curates a\nhigh-quality\nimage\ndescription\ndataset\nwith\n3.5K examples. Note that we will convert multi-\nround conversation data into single turn data for\ninstruction tuning.\n4.1.2 Implementation Details\nFor cache-enhanced inference, we use the FAISS\nlibrary [58] to build our retrieval system, and\nthe Autofaiss library2 to find the optimal hyper-\nparameters for the index. By default, all images\nfrom CC3M [41] is used to build the cache model.\nWe pre-train the model on 32 A100 GPUs for 3\nepochs. The total batch size and learning rate is\nset to 1024 and 4e-4, respectively. We fine-tune the\nmodel on 8 A100 GPUs for 4 epochs The warmup\nepoch, total batch size, learning rate is set to 1,\n32 and 1.25e-4.\n4.2 Quantitative Evaluation on\nTraditional Tasks\nIn this section, we conducted quantitative eval-\nuations of ImageBind-LLM on 27 datasets using\na zero-shot approach. Our quantitative evalu-\nation encompassed five specific tasks: Optical\nCharacter\nRecognition\n(OCR),\nKey\nInforma-\ntion Extraction (KIE), Image Captioning, Visual\nQuestion Answering (VQA), and Knowledge-\nGrounded Image Description (KGID). Notably, all\nthese tasks are evaluated following a VQA-style\napproach.

These datasets encompass a\ndiverse collection of images containing textual\ninformation, enabling a comprehensive compar-\nison between models. The evaluation of model\nperformance was based on top-1 accuracy, using\nthe prompt \u201dWhat is written in the image?\u201d\nKIE Tasks. We evaluate ImageBind-LLM on\n2 KIE benchmarks, including SROIE [72] and\nFUNSD citefunsd. These benchmarks encompass\na diverse range of document types, including\nreceipts and forms, which necessitate the extrac-\ntion of specific information. The evaluation of\nmodels involved using entity-level F1 scores.\nTo further enhance the evaluation process, we\nemployed prompts tailored to the specific infor-\nmation that the model was required to extract.\nFor instance, in the case of the SROIE bench-\nmark, prompts such as \u201dWhat is the name of the\n10\nTable 3 Perception Performance Comparison on MME [59] benchmark.

We employ 9 benchmarks in the\nVQA task, namely DocVQA [73], TextVQA [74],\nSTVQA [75], OCR-VQA [76], OKVQA [77],\nGQA [78], IconQA [79], Visual Spatial Reason-\ning (VSR) [80], and Visual Dialog (Visdial) [81].\nThese benchmarks encompass a diverse collection\nof question-image pairs that cover a wide range\nof topics. The task requires models not only to\ncomprehend the visual content but also to under-\nstand and reason about the questions presented.\nFor specific evaluation purposes, we utilize the\nMean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric for Visdial\nand top-1 accuracy for the remaining datasets.\nThese metrics provide valuable insights into the\nmodel\u2019s proficiency in accurately answering ques-\ntions across the various VQA benchmarks.\nKGID tasks. The KGID task aims to assess the\nmodel\u2019s ability to produce descriptive and precise\nimage captions by incorporating external knowl-\nedge. To evaluate performance in this task, we\nutilize the ScienceQA [20] and VizWiz [82] bench-\nmarks, which include images accompanied by tex-\ntual descriptions and knowledge-based informa-\ntion. It is worth mentioning that, for ScienceQA,\nwe specifically consider only those samples that\ncontain images.\n4.2.2 Analysis\nTable 1 and Table 2 clearly demonstrate the\nexceptional zero-shot performance of ImageBind-\nLLM across all evaluated tasks. When it comes to\nOCR, Image Captioning, and KGID, ImageBind-\nLLM achieved competitive performance compared\nwith other VLMs and outperformed PandaGPT,\nthus showcasing the effectiveness of ImageBind-\nLLM\u2019s modality alignment strategy. Furthermore,\nImageBind-LLM also delivered an impressive per-\nformance on KIE and VQA datasets.\nFurther\ninvestigating\nthe\nreason\nbehind\nImageBind-LLM\u2019s relatively better performance\n11\nthan PandaGPT, we delve into the implementa-\ntion details of ImageBind-LLM and PandaGPT.\nFirstly, we observe a significant disparity in\nImageBind-LLM and PandaGPT\u2019s utilization of\nthe ImageBind extracted feature. PandaGPT\nemploys a single linear projection layer for pro-\ncessing the ImageBind extracted feature, whereas\nImageBind-LLM employs a bind network, which\npotentially facilitates better alignment between\nlanguage\nand\nmodalities\nthrough\nImageBind.\nAnother distinction lies in their choice of LLM\nmodel, with PandaGPT utilizing Vicuna and\nImageBind-LLM\nemploying\nLLaMA.\nNotably,\nVicuna, being tuned based on LLaMA and pos-\nsessing a higher Elo rating as indicated in [9],\npotentially enhances PandaGPT\u2019s language com-\nprehension and response generation capabilities.\nThen\nfor\nwhy both ImageBind-LLM\nand\nPandaGPT have a poor OCR ability compared\nto other VLMs, we discovered that both of them\nemploy only one token for the modality feature,\nwhile the other VLMs utilize at least ten tokens for\ncapturing visual information. This disparity may\nallow other VLM models to better comprehend\nthe visual information depicted in the images.\nThese results not only highlight the remarkable\nzero-shot performance of ImageBind-LLM in vari-\nous vision and language tasks but also underscore\nits ability to comprehend and generate accu-\nrate responses in diverse scenarios. Moreover, the\nmodel\u2019s adeptness in multi-modality understand-\ning further demonstrates its potential as a robust\nand versatile solution for real-world applications.\n4.3 Quantitative Evaluation on\nMME Benchmark\n4.3.1 Experimental Settings\nIn contrast to traditional multi-modality tasks,\nwe also evaluate our ImageBind-LLM on a newly\nproposed benchmark, MME [59], which is spe-\ncially deigned for the recent VLMs. MME bench-\nmark systematically measures two multi-modality\ncapabilities of existing methods: perception and\ncognition. The former with 10 subtasks refers\nto recognizing specific objects in images, while\nthe latter with 4 subtasks is more challenging\nfor deducing complex answers from visual infor-\nmation. For each test image, MME adopts an\ninstruction of a question and a description \u201cPlease\nanswer yes or no\u201d, which prompts LLMs to answer\n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Such a concise instruction-answer\nevaluation allows for fair comparison of LLMs\nwithout the impact of prompt engineering.\n4.3.2 Analysis\nIn Table 3 and 4, we respectively show the\nperformance comparison of different VLMs on\nMME\u2019s perception and cognition tasks, including\nMiniGPT-4 [3], Otter [23], LLaMA-Adapter [7],\nLLaVA [22], and PanadaGPT [34]. As shown,\nMiniGPT-4 can achieve the best scores since it\nis trained upon a pre-trained BLIP-2 [24]. Otter\nand PandaGPT are developed based on Open-\nFlamingo [83] and Vicuna [9], which endow them\nwith well-initialized language processing abili-\nties. Instead, similar to LLaMA-Adapter, our\nImageBind-LLM is fine-tuned on the original\nLLaMA model, and still performs competitively\nto others. Especially on \u2018Existence\u2019 and \u2018Art-\nwork\u2019, ImageBind-LLM outperforms the second-\nbest methods by +8.33 and +1.00 scores, respec-\ntively. Overall, our approach is more expert at\nthe \u2018Perception\u2019 tasks, ranking the third place\nand surpassing another multi-modality model,\nPandaGPT, by +133.18 score. As analyzed above\nin Section 3.2, we believe our performance can\nbe further improved if using more multi-modality\ntokens fed into LLMs.\n4.4 Qualitative Analysis\nIn this section, we will give qualitative examples\nand analysis to help understand how ImageBind-\nLLM works, and where its multi-modal instruction\ncapabilities come from.\n4.4.1 Multi-modality Understanding\nMulti-modality\nto\nText\nAlignment. The\nvision-language\npre-training\nstage\nis\nessential\nfor incorporating multi-modal information into\nLLMs. In Fig. 5, we give some multi-modality cap-\ntioning results using the pre-trained ImageBind-\nLLM. As we can see, ImageBind-LLM can gener-\nate modality-dependent outputs for image, audio,\nvideo and point cloud. Since ImageBind-LLM is\npre-trained with image-text pairs, it can give\na short and accurate description of the image.\nThanks to the binding property of ImageBind,\n12\nTitanic\nAbandoned Castle\nSleeping Fox\nThe City of the Future\n(birds chirping)\nBirds\n(dog barking)\nDog\nYoga in the Sun - 2018\nAirplane\nFig. 5 Multi-modal Captioning Results with ImageBind-LLM. The training data is a collection of image-text pairs.\nWe only train the parameters of the bind network during this stage.\nImageBind-LLM are able to connect other modal-\nities with LLMs without any retraining. Although\nthe pre-trained ImageBind-LLM cannot generate\nlong and detailed description about the input,\nwe believe that the basic ability acquired at this\nstage is very important for subsequent instruction\ntuning.\nMulti-modality Instruction Tuning. By fine-\ntuning ImageBind-LLM on the mixture of lan-\nguage instruction data and visual instruction data,\nwe equip ImageBind-LLM with both language and\nvisual instruction-following abilities. More impor-\ntantly, we can enter free-form instructions for\nmodals other than images. Taking Fig. 6 as an\nexample, ImageBind-LLM can not only answer\nquestions about images, but also follow instruc-\ntions of other modalities. We can ask the model\nto write a poem based on an audio (4th item in\nFig. 6), introduce the content of a movie (5th item\nin Fig. 6) and even describe a 3D object (7-8th\nitem in Fig. 6).\n4.4.2 Mixture of Modalities\nSince ImageBind-LLM unifies different modalities\nin one feature space, we can mix different modal-\nities as the final input. In detail, we first employ\nmodality encoders to extract modality tokens. We\nthen mix the modality tokens by a set of coeffi-\ncients. Finally, mixed tokens are fed into LLMs\nfor multi-modality reasoning and understanding.\nFor example, mixing images and audios allows the\nmodel to better understand the current scene (1-\n2th item in Fig. 12); The combination of image\nand point cloud enrich the content of the pic-\nture (3-th item in Fig. 7); Using video frames\nand corresponding audio as input facilitates video\nunderstanding.\n4.5 Advanced Applications\nBilingual\nImageBind-LLM.\nBy\njoint\nfine-\ntuning the model on both English and Chinese\ninstruction data, we turn ImageBind-LLM into a\nbilingual model. As shown in Fig. 8, ImageBind-\nLLM can generate accurate Chinese response for\na Chinese instruction. However, since our Chi-\nnese visual instruction capacity is emerged in a\nzero-shot manner, it usually fails to generate long\nand detailed Chinese responses. We believe that\nthrough a stronger bilingual LLM and collect-\ning Chinese visual instruction data, its Chinese\ninstruction capacity can be improved in the future.\nIntegration\nwith\nStable\nDiffusion.\nWith\nLLMs, we realize any-to-language decoding. Simi-\nlarly, we employ Stable Diffusion for any-to image\ndecoding. As shown in Fig. 8, ImageBind-LLM\ngenerates both language and image responses for\na give input (e.g., image, audio and point cloud).\nCompared with language response, the generated\nimage carries more details about the input. For\nexample, an image generated from a car horn can\nclearly depict the scene and its main elements.\n13\nInstruction: Tell me about this game.\nAnswer: The game is called \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\" which is a popular action-adventure \ngame developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and the Wii U console.

The pot is placed on a table, and the close-up \nview of the plant and pot showcases the details of the plant and the pot's design.\nFig. 6 Multi-modal Instruction Examples with ImageBind-LLM.\n14\nInstruction: Guess the girl's mood based on the background music and explain the reason.\nAnswer: The girl in the image appears to be in a contemplative or melancholic mood, as the background \nmusic is a sad piano melody. This choice of music suggests that the scene is intended to evoke a sense of \nintrospection, solitude, or longing. The combination of the girl's attire, the lone tree, and the melancholic \nmusic creates a mood of introspection and contemplation. The use of such music can help to enhance the \nemotional impact of the scene and provide a deeper understanding of the character's thoughts and feelings.\nImage+Audio\nInstruction: Describe the scene based on the input picture and audio.\nAnswer: The scene depicted in the image is a busy city street filled with traffic. There are numerous cars, \ntrucks, and buses driving down the street, creating a bustling atmosphere. The street is crowded with vehicles, \nand the traffic appears to be moving slowly.

The car is moving along the road, \npossibly enjoying the scenic beauty of the forest. \nVideo+Audio\nInstruction: What is the man doing in this video? What do people think of him based on the audio?\nAnswer: The man is standing at a podium, giving a speech or presentation. People in the audience are \nlistening to him attentively, and they are clapping and showing their appreciation for his words.\nFig. 7 Mixture of Modalities with ImageBind-LLM.\nIntegration\nwith\nModality\nExperts.\nImageBind-LLM\nis\na\ngeneral\nmulti-modality\nLLM, but it still lacks fine-grained domain-specific\nknowledge. Therefore, integrating with domain\nexperts is a feasible way to improve ImageBind-\nLLM\u2019s multi-modality understanding capacity.\nIn Fig. 9, we use the output of an speech-to-text\nexpert as context to enhance ImageBind-LLM\u2019s\naudio understanding capacity. We also show that\nclass labels extracted by a video object detector\ncan help the model catch details of a video clip.\nImageBind-LLM\nwith\nObject\nDetection\nCascade. By cascading ImageBind-LLM with\nobject detectors, we can associate text response\nwith objects in the image, which helps improve\nthe reliability of multi-modal LLMs. As shown\nin Fig. 10, we can evaluate the reliability of\nImageBind-LLM through detection results. At the\nsame time, ImageBind-LLM makes object detec-\ntors also has the ability to reasoning.\nImageBind-LLM\nas\nChatbot.\nLeverag-\ning multi-turn conversation data for training,\nImageBind-LLM\nshowcases\nimpressive\nvisual\nunderstanding abilities and multimodal conversa-\ntion skills. As shown in Fig. 11, ImageBind-LLM\nexcels\nin\nthese\ncapabilities.\nFurthermore,\nit\nexhibits the capacity to comprehend and rea-\nson with multimodal content in response to\nuser queries, making it a viable candidate for a\nmulti-modality chatbot.\nImageBind-LLM\nfor\nAPI\ncontrol.\nBy\nincorporating tool-usage knowledge into LLMs,\nImageBind-LLM can effectively learn to invoke\nAPI controls, enabling it to tackle various visual\ntasks. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the finetuned\nImageBind-LLM demonstrates its proficiency in\naccomplishing diverse visual tasks, including but\nnot limited to object detection and image editing,\nby effectively employing different APIs. These\nresults highlight the potential of the proposed\n15\nInstruction: What is the name of the place?

There\nmaybe two possible reasons: (1) ImageBind-LLM\nonly injects one global visual token into LLMs,\nwhich is much smaller than other models (10\nfor LLaMA-Adapter, 32 for MiniGPT4 and 256\nfor LLaVA). Therefore, LLM cannot get enough\nvisual information in the self-Attention layers.

For example, the visual instruction data\nfrom LLaVA is all generated by vision experts\nand GPT4, lacking human checks and corrections.\nTherefore, we will build a human-verified high-\nquality dataset in the future. Secondly, modality\nmixup is fragile when the two modalities repre-\nsent different concepts. Fig. 13 gives an example of\nmixing a \u201dsky\u201d image and a \u201ddog barking\u201d audio.\nWe can see that ImageBind-LLM is sensitive to\nthe modality mixing ratio.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this work, we propose to tune LLMs into\nmulti-modality instruction models with the help\nof ImageBind, named ImageBind-LLM. In con-\ntrast to prior language instruction models and\nimage instruction models, ImageBind-LLM uni-\nfies image, audio, 3D point clouds and video into\none multi-modality LLM. We achieves this by sim-\nply aligning ImageBind\u2019s visual encoder with an\nLLM via a learnable bind network. Thanks to the\nbinding property of ImageBind, we can directly\nfeed multi-modality inputs into ImageBind-LLM\nfor inference without any training. We also pro-\npose a training-free image cache model to mit-\nigate the modality discrepancy between train-\ning and inference. We evaluate ImageBind-LLM\nacross 27 traditional vision-language datasets\nand a new multimodal LLM benchmark MME,\nwhere ImageBind-LLM achieves comparable per-\nformance with recent mutlimodal LLMs. We also\ngive extensive qualitative analysis to demonstrate\nImageInd-LLM\u2019s\nmulti-modality\nunderstanding\ncapacity. In the future, we plan to enhance\nImageBind-LLM by increasing the number of\nmulti-modality tokens. Besides, integrating more\nmodalities into ImageBind-LLM is also a promis-\ning approach to enhance its multimodal capacity.\nReferences\n[1] Gao, P., Han, J., Zhang, R., Lin, Z., Geng,\nS., Zhou, A., Zhang, W., Lu, P., He, C., Yue,\nX., Li, H., Qiao, Y.: LLaMA-Adapter V2:\nParameter-Efficient Visual Instruction Model\n(2023)\n[2] Liu,\nH.,\nLi,\nC.,\nWu,\nQ.,\nLee,\nY.J.:\nVisual instruction tuning. arXiv preprint\narXiv:2304.08485 (2023)\n[3] Zhu, D., Chen, J., Shen, X., Li, X., Elhoseiny,\nM.: Minigpt-4: Enhancing vision-language\nunderstanding with advanced large language\nmodels.\narXiv\npreprint\narXiv:2304.10592\n(2023)\n[4] ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com (2023)\n[5] OpenAI:\nGpt-4\ntechnical\nreport.\nArXiv\nabs/2303.08774 (2023)\n[6] Taori, R., Gulrajani, I., Zhang, T., Dubois,\nY., Li, X., Guestrin, C., Liang, P., Hashimoto,\n17\nIntroduce me this painting.\nThe painting is a famous work of art titled \"Starry Night\" by Vincent van Gogh.

We\npropose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs\nthat does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-\ntuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences\nin logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary\nspace, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to\nbe localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting\nLayers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the gen-\neration of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple\nchoices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance\nof LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by 12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its\npotential in making LLMs reliably generate truthful facts.1\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in numerous natural language processing\n(NLP) applications (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2022; 2023). However, despite the continued increase in\nperformance and the emergence of new capabilities from scaling LLMs (Wei et al., 2022a), their tendency to\n\u201challucinate\u201d, i.e., generate content that deviates from real-world facts observed during pretraining (Ji et al.,\n2023), remains a persistent challenge. This represents a major bottleneck in their deployment especially for\nhigh-stakes applications (e.g., clinical/legal settings) where reliable generation of trustworthy text is crucial.\nWhile the exact reasons for LMs\u2019 hallucinations are not fully understood, a possible reason is due to the\nmaximum likelihood language modeling objective which minimize the forward KL divergence between\nthe data and model distributions. This objective potentially results in a model with mass-seeking behavior\nwhich causes the LM to assign non-zero probability to sentences that are not fully consistent with knowledge\nembedded in the training data. Empirically, an LM trained with the next-word prediction objective on finite\ndata has been shown to result in a model that uses linguistic knowledge to recognize the superficial patterns,\ninstead of recognizing and generating the real-world facts extracted from the training corpus (Ji et al., 2023).\nFrom a model interpretability perspective, transformer LMs have been loosely shown to encode \u201clower-\nlevel\u201d information (e.g., part-of-speech tags) in the earlier layers, and more \u201csemantic\u201d information in the\nlater layers (Tenney et al., 2019). More recently, Dai et al. (2022) find that \u201cknowledge neurons\u201d are dis-\ntributed in the topmost layers of the pretrained BERT model. Meng et al. (2022) show that factual knowledge\n1The source code is available at https://github.com/voidism/DoLa.\n\u22c6Work mainly done during an internship at Microsoft.\n1\narXiv:2309.03883v2  [cs.CL]  11 Mar 2024\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n\u2026\n\u2026\nLLaMA-7B\n8th layer\n16th layer\n24th layer\nearly\nexit  \nearly\nexit  \nWhere is the capital of \nWashington State?\nDecoding by \nContrasting Layers\nSeattle\nOlympia\nVancouver\nSpokane\n\u2026\n32nd layer\n\u2026\nearly\nexit  \nOlympia\nSeattle\nOlympia\nVancouver\nSpokane\nContrast!\nFigure 1: Illustration of an LLM progressively incorporates factual information along layers. While the\nnext-word probabilities of \u201cSeattle\u201d remain similar throughout different layers, the probabilities of the cor-\nrect answer \u201cOlympia\u201d gradually increase from lower to higher layers. DoLa uses this fact to decode by\ncontrasting the difference between layers to sharpen an LLM\u2019s probability towards factually correct outputs.\ncan even be edited by manipulating a specific set of feedforward layers within an autoregressive LM. We\npropose to exploit this modular encoding of knowledge to amplify the factual knowledge in an LM through\na contrastive decoding approach, where the output next-word probability is obtained from the difference\nin logits between a higher layer versus a lower layer. By emphasizing the knowledge of higher layers and\ndownplaying that of lower layers, we can potentially make LMs more factual and thus reduce hallucinations.\nAn illustration of this idea for a simple example is shown in Figure 1. While \u201cSeattle\u201d maintains high prob-\nability throughout all the layers\u2014presumably because it is a syntactically plausible answer\u2014the probability\nof the true answer \u201cOlympia\u201d increases after the higher layers inject more factual knowledge. Contrasting\nthe differences between the different layers can thus reveal the true answer in this case. Based on this con-\ncept, we propose a new decoding method, Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), for better surfacing\nfactual knowledge embedded in an LLM without retrieving external knowledge or additional fine-tuning.\nExperiments on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) and FACTOR Muhlgay et al. (2023) demonstrate that DoLa\nis able to increase the truthfulness of the models of the LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). Further\nexperiments on chain-of-thought reasoning for StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al.,\n2021) also show that it can facilitate more factual reasoning. Finally, experiments using GPT-4 for open-\nended chatbot evaluation (Chiang et al., 2023) show that when compared with the original decoding method,\nDoLa can generate informative and significantly more factual responses that lead to better ratings from GPT-\n4. From an efficiency perspective, we find that DoLa causes only a small additional latency in the decoding\nprocess, suggesting it as a practical and useful decoding strategy for improving the truthfulness of LLMs.\n2\nMETHOD\nRecent language models consist of an embedding layer, N stacked transformer layers, and an affine layer\n\u03d5(\u00b7) for predicting the next-word distribtution. Given a sequence of tokens {x1, x2, . . . , xt\u22121}, the embed-\nding layer first embeds the tokens into a sequence of vectors H0 = {h(0)\n1 , . . . , h(0)\nt\u22121}.

Using qj(xt)\nto represent qj(xt | x<t) for notational brevity, we then compute the probability of the next token by,\n\u02c6p(xt | x<t) = softmax\n\u0000F\n\u0000qN(xt), qM(xt)\n\u0001\u0001\nxt,\nwhere\nM = arg max\nj\u2208J\nd\n\u0000qN(\u00b7), qj(\u00b7)\n\u0001\n.\nHere, layer M is named premature layer, while the final layer, i.e., layer N, is named mature layer. The\noperator F(\u00b7, \u00b7), to be elaborated further in Section 2.3, is used to contrast between the output distributions\nfrom the premature layer and the mature layer by computing the log-domain difference between two distri-\nbutions. The premature layer is dynamically selected in each decoding step using a distributional distance\nmeasure d(\u00b7, \u00b7) (we use Jensen-Shannon Divergence) between the mature layer and all the candidate layers\nin J . We discuss d(\u00b7, \u00b7) in more detail in Section 2.2. The motivation for selecting the layer with the highest\ndistance d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is to ensure that the model would significantly change its output after that selected layer, and\nthus have a higher chance to include more factual knowledge that does not exist in the early layers before it.\n2.1\nFACTUAL KNOWLEDGE EVOLVES ACROSS LAYERS\nWe conduct preliminary analysis with 32-layer LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) to motivate our approach.\nWe compute the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the early exiting output distributions qj(\u00b7 | x<t)\nand the final layer output distribution qN(\u00b7 | x<t), to show how the early exiting outputs are different from\nthe final layer outputs. Figure 2 shows the JSDs when decoding the answer for the input question, from\nwhich we can observe two patterns. Pattern #1 happens when predicting important name entities or dates,\nsuch as Wole Soyinka and 1986 in Figure 2, which require factual knowledge. We observe the calculated\nJSD would be still extremely high in the higher layers. This pattern indicates that the model is still changing\nits predictions in the last few layers, and potentially injecting more factual knowledge into the predictions.\nPattern #2 happens when predicting function words, such as was, the, to, in, and the tokens copied from the\ninput question, such as first Nigerian, Nobel Prize. When predicting these \u201ceasy\u201d tokens, we can observe that\nthe JSD becomes very small from middle layers. This finding indicates that the model has already decided\nwhat token to generate in middle layers, and keeps the output distributions almost unchanged in the higher\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n\u2026\n\u2026\nLLaMA-7B\n16th layer\n24th layer\n32nd layer\nearly\nexit  \nearly\nexit  \nWhere was the author of the \nTheory of Relativity from?\nDoLa\nOutputs\n<s>\nAlbert\nEinstein\nwas\n\u2026\n8th layer\n\u2026\nearly\nexit  \nfrom\nAlbert\nEinstein\nwas\nfrom\nGermany\nContrast!\nContrast!\nContrast!\nContrast!\nContrast!\nFigure 3: The illustration of how dynamic premature layer selection works.\nlayers. This finding is also consistent with the assumptions in early exiting LMs (Schuster et al., 2022). A\npreliminary analysis that can quantitatively support this observation is also shown in Appendix A.\nQualitatively, when the next-word prediction requires factual knowledge, LLaMA seems to to change the\npredictions in the higher layers. Contrasting the layers before/after a sudden change may therefore amplify\nthe knowledge emerging from the higher layers and make the model rely more on its factual internal knowl-\nedge. Moreover, this evolution of information seems to vary token by token. Our method requires accurately\nselecting the premature layer that contains plausible but less factual information, which may not always stay\nin the same early layer. Thus, we propose dynamic premature later selection as illustrated in Figure 3.\n2.2\nDYNAMIC PREMATURE LAYER SELECTION\nTo magnify the effectiveness of contrastive decoding, the optimal premature layer should ideally be the layer\nmost different from the final-layer outputs. To allow for dynamic premature layer selection at each time step,\nwe adopt the following measure of distance between the next-word distributions obtained from two layers,\nd\n\u0000qN(\u00b7 | x<t), qj(\u00b7 | x<t)\n\u0001\n= JSD\n\u0000qN(\u00b7 | x<t)||qj(\u00b7 | x<t)\n\u0001\n,\nwhere JSD(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The premature layer, i.e., the M-th layer (0 \u2264 M < N),\nis then selected as the layer with the maximum divergence among the subset of early layers,\nM = arg max\nj\u2208J JSD\n\u0000qN(\u00b7 | x<t)||qj(\u00b7 | x<t)\n\u0001\n,\nwhere J is a set of candidate layers for premature layer selection. For LLaMA models with various number\nof layers, we divide the layers into 2 to 4 buckets of J based on their total layers, in order to focus on\ncontrasting from a certain range of layers. The best bucket for each task is chosen using a validation set, as\ndetailed in Section 3.1. This dynamic layer selection strategy enables the the selection of suitable premature\nlayers based on token difficulty, thereby making better use of the knowledge learned by different layers.\nBesides the dynamic layer selection strategy, a very simple method that can also be considered is to select\nthe premature layer by running brute-force experiments on all the possible early layers with a validation\nset, and pick the layer with the best validation performance. We refer to this simple method as DoLa-static.\nHowever, DoLa-static has the drawbacks of 1) requiring more hyperparameter search runs in layers and the\nfact that 2) best layers are sensitive to data distribution, thus requiring in-distribution validation sets. Our\nproposed dynamic layer selection strategy also mitigates the drawbacks of DoLa-static by shrinking the layer\nsearch space and making the method more robust without heavily relying on in-distribution validation sets.\nWe empirically investigate the effectiveness of this dynamic strategy over DoLa-static in Section 4.1.\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n2.3\nCONTRASTING THE PREDICTIONS\nGiven the premature and mature layers obtained from Section 2.2, we aim to amplify mature layer outputs\nwhile downplaying premature layer outputs. Following the Contrastive Decoding approach from Li et al.\n(2022), we subtract the log probabilities of the premature layer outputs from those of the mature layer. We\nthen use this resulting distribution as the next-word prediction, as illustrated in Figure 1,\n\u02c6p(xt | x<t) = softmax\n\u0000F\n\u0000qN(xt), qM(xt)\n\u0001\u0001\nxt,\nwhere\nF\n\u0000qN(xt), qM(xt)\n\u0001\n=\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nlog qN(xt)\nqM(xt),\nif xt \u2208 Vhead (xt|x<t) ,\n\u2212\u221e,\notherwise.\nSimilar to Li et al. (2022), the subset Vhead (xt|x<t) \u2208 X is defined as whether or not the token has high\nenough output probabilities from the mature layer,\nVhead (xt|x<t) =\nn\nxt \u2208 X : qN(xt) \u2265 \u03b1 max\nw\nqN(w)\no\n.\nIf the predicted probability of a token is too small in the mature layer, it is not likely to be a reasonable\nprediction, so we set the token probability to zero to minimize false positive and false negative cases. In\nthe context of DoLa, the false positive means an implausible token with an extremely low score may be\nrewarded with a high score after contrast, due to the unstable low probability range on these implausible\ntokens from different layers. The false negative means when the model is very confident about an easy\ndecision, the output probability of a high-score token does not change much in different layers and results in\nlow scores after contrast, so we need to force the model still select from these high-score tokens in this case.\nThis strategy is referred as an adaptive plausibility constraint (APC) proposed in Li et al. (2022).\nRepetition Penalty. The motivation of DoLa is to downplay lower-layer linguistic knowledge and amplify\nreal-world factual knowledge. However, this may result in the model generating grammatically incorrect\nparagraphs. Empirically, we do not observe such an issue, but we found that the resulting DoLa distribution\nto sometimes have a higher tendency to repeat previously generated sentences (Xu et al., 2022), especially\nduring generation of long sequences of chain-of-thought reasoning. Here we include a simple repetition\npenalty introduced in Keskar et al. (2019) with \u03b8 = 1.2 during decoding. The empirical analysis of the\nrepetition penalty is shown in Appendix K.\n3\nEXPERIMENTS\n3.1\nSETUP\nDatasets. We consider multiple choices and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple choices, we use\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) and FACTOR (News/Wiki) (Muhlgay et al., 2023) to assess LMs\u2019 factuality in\nshort-answer/long-paragraph settings, respectively. For open-ended generation, we use TruthfulQA (rated\nby fine-tuned GPT-3) (Lin et al., 2022) and tasks involving chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022b) reasoning:\nStrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) and GSM8K Cobbe et al. (2021). Finally, we test Vicuna QA (Chiang et al.,\n2023) which uses GPT-4 to evaluate instruction-following abilities as chatbot assistants.\nModels and Baselines. We examine four sizes of LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023) (7B, 13B, 33B,\n65B) and compare them with three baselines: 1) original decoding (greedy decoding or sampling depending\non the tasks), 2) Contrastive Decoding (CD) (Li et al., 2022), where LLaMA-7B serves as the amateur model\nand LLaMA-13B/33B/65B act as expert models, and 3) Inference Time Intervention (ITI). ITI uses LLaMA-\n7B and a linear classifier trained on TruthfulQA. Our experiment focuses on contrasting layer differences in\nDoLa and model differences in CD, without additional techniques, such as limiting the context window for\nthe premature layer or the amateur model, to make our setting clean. We set adaptive plausibility constraint\n(\u03b1) to 0.1 and repetition penalty (\u03b8) to 1.2 as per prior studies(Li et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019).\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nModel\nTruthfulQA (MC)\nFACTOR\nTruthfulQA (Open-Ended Generation)\nCoT\nMC1\nMC2\nMC3\nNews\nWiki\n%Truth \u2191\n%Info \u2191\n%T\u2217I \u2191\n%Reject \u2193\nStrQA\nGSM8K\nLLaMa-7B\n25.6\n40.6\n19.2\n58.3\n58.6\n30.4\n96.3\n26.9\n2.9\n60.1\n10.8\n+ ITI (Li et al., 2023)\n25.9\n-\n-\n-\n-\n49.1\n-\n43.5\n-\n-\n-\n+ DoLa\n32.2\n63.8\n32.1\n62.0\n62.2\n42.1\n98.3\n40.8\n0.6\n64.1\n10.5\nLLaMa-13B\n28.3\n43.3\n20.8\n61.1\n62.6\n38.8\n93.6\n32.4\n6.7\n66.6\n16.7\n+ CD (Li et al., 2022)\n24.4\n41.0\n19.0\n62.3\n64.4\n55.3\n80.2\n44.4\n20.3\n60.3\n9.1\n+ DoLa\n28.9\n64.9\n34.8\n62.5\n66.2\n48.8\n94.9\n44.6\n2.1\n67.6\n18.0\nLLaMa-33B\n31.7\n49.5\n24.2\n63.8\n69.5\n62.5\n69.0\n31.7\n38.1\n69.9\n33.8\n+ CD (Li et al., 2022)\n33.0\n51.8\n25.7\n63.3\n71.3\n81.5\n45.0\n36.7\n62.7\n66.7\n28.4\n+ DoLa\n30.5\n62.3\n34.0\n65.4\n70.3\n56.4\n92.4\n49.1\n8.2\n72.1\n35.5\nLLaMa-65B\n30.8\n46.9\n22.7\n63.6\n72.2\n50.2\n84.5\n34.8\n19.1\n70.5\n51.2\n+ CD (Li et al., 2022)\n29.3\n47.0\n21.5\n64.6\n71.3\n75.0\n57.9\n43.4\n44.6\n70.5\n44.0\n+ DoLa\n31.1\n64.6\n34.3\n66.2\n72.4\n54.3\n94.7\n49.2\n4.8\n72.9\n54.0\nTable 1: Experimental results on 1) multiple choices dataset: TruthfulQA and FACTOR and 2) open-ended\ngeneration tasks: TruthfulQA and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks, including StrategyQA (StrQA)\nand GSM8K. %T\u2217I stands for %Truth\u2217Info in TruthfulQA.\nCandidate Layers. In dynamic premature layer selection, we partition transformer layers into buckets and\nselect one bucket as candidate layers (J ). For 32-layer LLaMA-7B, we use two buckets: [0, 16), [16, 32);\nfor 40-layer LLaMA-13B, they are [0, 20), [20, 40); for 60-layer LLaMA-33B, three buckets: [0, 20), [20,\n40), [40, 60); and for 80-layer LLaMA-65B, four buckets: [0, 20), [20, 40), [40, 60), [60, 80), where the\n0th layer is the word embedding. This design limits the hyperparameter search space to only 2-4 validation\nruns. For efficiency, only even-indexed layers (0th, 2nd, etc.) are considered as candidates. We use either\ntwo-fold validation (TruthfulQA-MC, FACTOR) or a validation set (GSM8K, StrategyQA) to select the best\nbucket. For Vicuna QA, which lacks a validation set, we use GSM8K\u2019s best bucket.\n3.2\nMULTIPLE CHOICES\nShort-Answer Factuality. We test TruthfulQA with the default QA prompt from Lin et al. (2022) and Li\net al. (2023). For \u03b1 in APC, we replace \u2212\u221e with \u22121000 to avoid ruining LM likelihood scores, which also\napplies to FACTOR. The repetition penalty is unnecessary for likelihood score calculation. We use two-fold\nvalidation to identify the best bucket of candidate layers based on MC3 score. Results in Table 1 show sig-\nnificant performance improvement for LLaMA models in four sizes, outperforming ITI/CD and confirming\nthe effectiveness of DoLa. The only exception is LLaMA-33B on MC1, a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d metric that is\nmore sensitive to fluctuations. In contrast, MC2/MC3 are relatively more stable metrics as they consider all\ntrue/false answers together and average them for calculating the scores. The higher layers are consistently\nchosen in two-fold validation\u20147B: [16, 32); 13B: [20, 40); 33B: [40, 60); 65B: [60, 80). Implementation\ndetails and extra results of contrasting with the 0-th layer / all layers are shown in Appendix C.\nLong-Paragraph Factuality. In FACTOR, each example has a long paragraph and four completions, with\none being correct. The News and Wiki subsets are used as the two folds for two-fold validation. Table 1\nshows DoLa outperforms baselines by 2-4%, and is more effective than CD, except for 13B on Wiki. The\nchosen candidate layers are consistently lower parts for FACTOR: [0, 16) for 7B and [0, 20) for 13/33/65B.\nThis differs from TruthfulQA, which selects higher layers. We believe this is due to TruthfulQA having\nshort, fact-critical choices, while FACTOR has long sentence choices. As noted in Section 2.1, contrasting\nwith higher layers works better for key facts, while contrasting with the lower layers can better take care of\nall the tokens if they include many non-fact tokens that do not require to be contrasted with higher layers.\n3.3\nOPEN-ENDED TEXT GENERATION\nShort-Answer Factuality. In open-ended settings, TruthfulQA is rated by fine-tuned GPT-3 on truthful and\ninformative scores. A 100% truthful score can be easily achievable by answering \u201cI have no comment\u201d, but\nresults in a 0% informative score. We use the default QA prompt as in Lin et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2023),\nwith higher candidate layers for decoding, following the two-fold validation results of Section 3.2.

Left: Total scores. Right:\nWin/tie/loss times of LLaMA+DoLA compared against LLaMA.\nshows DoLa consistently enhances truthful scores, keeps informative scores above 90%, and has a ratio of\n\u201cI have no comment\u201d (%Reject) under 10%. It improves the overall (%Truth\u2217Info) scores by 12-17% across\nfour models, reaching the performance level of ITI, which relies on supervised training with labels.\nCD boosts truthfulness but often refuses to answer, generating \u201dI have no comment,\u201d \u2013 over 60% of the\ntime for the LLaMA-33B model \u2013 thus lowering its %Truth\u2217Info score. We suspect this is because CD\nuses LLaMA-7B for contrast, and a big difference is that 33B is better at instruction-following than 7B,\nexplaining why CD frequently answers \u201dI have no comment,\u201d as this response is indicated in the instruction\nprompt. Our method consistently outperforms CD in final %Truth\u2217Info scores.\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning. We evaluated our decoding strategy on StrategyQA and GSM8K, tasks\nrequiring not just factuality but also Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b) ability in order\nto achieve good performance. We randomly sample a 10% GSM8K training subset as validation set for both\nof the tasks. The best layer buckets, [0, 16) for 7B and [0, 20) for 13B/33B/65B, aligned with FACTOR\nresults, suggesting that contrasting with lower layers is effective for reasoning tasks.\n\u2022 StrategyQA requires multi-hop CoT reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b). In Table 1, DoLa boosts accuracy by\n1-4% for four models, while CD mostly worsens it, implying that contrasting a large LM with the 7B LM,\nwhich has a certain level of reasoning ability, can impair reasoning ability of large LMs. In contrast, DoLa\nenhances performance by contrasting within lower layers that lack reasoning ability.\n\u2022 GSM8K is a math word problem benchmark requiring both factual knowledge and arithmetic reasoning.\nTable 1 shows a 2% accuracy improvement for most LLaMA sizes, except 7B. This suggests that even\nwhen requiring arithmetic reasoning, contrasting layers by DoLa is still helpful. In Appendix B we show\nan additional study on improving CD using smaller amateur models, which is still falling behind DoLa.\nInstruction Following. Vicuna QA (Chiang et al., 2023) uses GPT-4 to evaluate the abilities of open-ended\nchatbots to follow instructions. Following the validation results from GSM8K/FACTOR, we used the lower\nlayers as candidate layers for decoding with all models. Pairwise comparisons rated by GPT-4 are in Figure 4,\nshowing DoLa notably outperforms the baseline, especially in the 13B and 33B models, indicating DoLa is\neffective even in open-ended chatbot scenarios. Examples of qualitative studies are shown in Appendix M.\n4\nANALYSIS\n4.1\nPREMATURE LAYER SELECTION STRATEGY\nWe introduce a variant of DoLa, DoLa-static, which selects a constant layer for contrasting throughout the\ndecoding process. We show some of the results of GSM8K validation sets in Figure 5, and FACTOR in\nFigure 6 in Appendix H, by enumerating the DoLa-static results from all the layers.\nIn Figure 5 (left), DoLa-static performs better by contrasting lower layers. Some \u201coptimal\u201d layers, like\nthe 10th layer, even outperform DoLa. However, these optimal layers are sensitive across datasets, making\nDoLa-static less versatile without a task-specific validation set, which may not always be available in real-\nworld applications. For example, when randomly sample another 10% GSM8K subset (Figure 5, right),\nDoLa-static shows varying optimal layers across these two 10% GSM8K subsets. The 10th layer is optimal\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nPremature Layer\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\nAccuracy\n Baseline\n DoLa [0,16)\n DoLa [16,32)\n DoLa [0,32)\n7B\nDoLa-static\nBaseline\nDoLa [0,16)\nDoLa [16,32)\nDoLa [0,32)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nPremature Layer\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\nAccuracy\n Baseline\n DoLa [0,16)\n DoLa [16,32)\n DoLa [0,32)\n7B\nDoLa-static\nBaseline\nDoLa [0,16)\nDoLa [16,32)\nDoLa [0,32)\nFigure 5: LLaMA-7B on GSM8K validation sets with DoLa/DoLa-static using different premature layers.\nLeft: subset#1. Right: subset #2.\nin subset #1, while the 2nd layer is optimal in subset #2. Using subset #1\u2019s optimal layer for subset #2\ndecreases its performance, highlighting DoLa-static\u2019s sensitivity to fixed layer choice. In contrast, DoLa\nwith contrasting lower layers maintains high scores in both subsets, almost matching the best performing\nDoLa-static layers, highlighting the robustness of DoLa. Additionally, DoLa simplifies hyperparameter\nsearch space: it needs only 2-4 bucket tests, almost 10x fewer than the 16-40 tests needed in DoLa-static.\nWe include another analysis on the optimality of our dynamic layer selection strategy in Appendix J. Specifi-\ncally, we include a random layer selection baseline, showing that the random selection strategy is even worse\nthan the original performance, demonstrating it is essential to apply our JSD-based layer selection strategy.\n4.2\nLATENCY & THROUGHPUT\nThe greedy decoding latency in Ta-\nble 2 shows DoLa increases the\ndecoding time by factors of 1.01\nto 1.08, suggesting DoLa can be\nwidely applied with negligible cost.\nThe memory analysis/inference de-\ntails are shown in Appendix E/F.\nLatency (ms/token)\nThroughput (token/s)\nBaseline\nDoLa\nBaseline\nDoLa\n7B\n45.4 (\u00d71.00)\n48.0 (\u00d71.06)\n22.03 (\u00d71.00)\n20.83 (\u00d70.95)\n13B\n77.3 (\u00d71.00)\n83.1 (\u00d71.08)\n12.94 (\u00d71.00)\n12.03 (\u00d70.93)\n33B\n146.7 (\u00d71.00)\n156.7 (\u00d71.07)\n6.82 (\u00d71.00)\n6.38 (\u00d70.94)\n65B\n321.6 (\u00d71.00)\n324.9 (\u00d71.01)\n3.11 (\u00d71.00)\n3.08 (\u00d70.99)\nTable 2: Decoding latency (ms/token) and throughput (token/s).\n4.3\nQUALITATIVE STUDY\nIn Table 3, we show TruthfulQA examples generated deterministically via greedy decoding from LLaMA-\n33B, with truth/info scores by fine-tuned GPT-3. In Q1, the baseline produces the plausible but incorrect\ndate \u201cJuly 4, 1776,\u201d while DoLa outputs the correct \u201cAugust 2, 1776.\u201d In Q2, the baseline offers the false\nconcept of \u201cwait 24 hours,\u201d countered by DoLa\u2019 truthful response, showing that DoLa can avoid generating\nfalse information. Q3 is a counterexample, where the baseline states \u201cI have no comment\u201d to get 1.0/0.0\nin truth/info scores, while DoLa provides detailed but incorrect information, obtaining 0.0/1.0 in truth/info\nscores. More examples of TruthfulQA and long responses of Vicuna QA are in Appendix L and M.\nBesides qualitative study, we also evaluate the text generation quality of DoLa by leveraging GPT-4, and the\nresults are shown in Appendix D. We also try to apply DoLa to a non-LLaMA model, MPT-7B (MosaicML,\n2023), and show that DoLa can still improve the performance for the LLMs beyond LLaMA in Appendix G.\n5\nRELATED WORK\nHallucinations in LLMs. Hallucinations in LLMs refer to generated content not based on training data\nor facts, caused by various factors like imperfect learning and decoding (Ji et al., 2023). Ways to mitigate\nthem include reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022). Recent strategies involve\ninference-time self-consistency checks (Manakul et al., 2023), multi-agent debating (Du et al., 2023; Liang\net al., 2023), and inference-time intervention using human labels (Li et al., 2023).\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nQuestion\nQ1: On what date was the Declaration\nof Independence officially signed?\nQ2: How long should you wait before fil-\ning a missing person report?\nQ3: What are the effects of red shoes?\nLLaMA\nThe Declaration of Independence was\nofficially signed on July 4, 1776.\nYou should wait 24 hours before filing a\nmissing person report.\nI have no comment.\nScore\nTruthful: 0.0 , Informative: 1.0\nTruthful: 0.0, Informative: 1.0\nTruthful: 1.0, Informative: 0.0\nLLaMA\n+DoLa\nIt was officially signed on August 2,\n1776.\nA person can be reported as a missing\nperson to the police immediately, as the\npolice have procedures to locate the per-\nson in the quickest, most effective way.\nRed shoes make it more difficult to hide,\nsince they can be easily noticed.\nScore\nTruthful: 1.0, Informative: 1.0\nTruthful: 1.0, Informative: 1.0\nTruthful: 0.0, Informative: 1.0\nTable 3: Qualitative study using LLaMA-33B baseline vs LLaMA-33B+DoLa on TruthfulQA.\nNLP Pipeline in Transformer. A study by Tenney et al. (2019) notes BERT mimics classical NLP pipeline:\nearly layers manage syntax while later ones handle semantics. This behavior varies based on training ob-\njectives (Fayyaz et al., 2021) and tasks (Niu et al., 2022). Recent studies highlight the role of middle and\ntopmost layers (Meng et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2022) and specific heads (Li et al., 2023) in factual predictions.\nContrastive Decoding. Contrastive Decoding (CD) (Li et al., 2022) contrasts strong expert LMs with weak\namateur LMs to improve fluency and coherence without discussing factuality. CD selects amateur LMs to be\nsmaller LMs, and it is crucial to select suitable sizes for amateur LMs. DoLa dynamically selects appropriate\nearly layers based on token complexity, avoiding the need for training and using smaller LMs in CD. For\nefficiency, DoLa requires just a forward pass with early exiting from the same model itself. O\u2019Brien & Lewis\n(2023) is a concurrent work that extends CD to be evaluated on reasoning tasks.\nFollowing the concept of CD, Shi et al. (2023) introduced context-aware decoding (CAD) to better focus\nLMs on contexts for improving summarization and knowledge conflict tasks. A concurrent work, Autocon-\ntrastive Decoding (ACD) (Gera et al., 2023), partially resembles DoLa-static but focuses on small LMs like\nGPT2 in 335M/125M, as ACD requires fine-tuning prediction heads for early layers. Unlike DoLa targeting\nfactuality, ACD aims to enhance diversity and coherence in small LMs. Interestingly, while the authors\nreveal ACD increases hallucinations in its limitation section, DoLa instead reduces them. We attribute the\ndiscrepency to model sizes, as our experiments in Appendix N suggest contrasting layers in a small GPT2\ncannot improve factuality. Large LLMs storing distinct knowledge across layers is key for DoLa to work.\n6\nCONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS\nIn this paper, we introduce Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), a novel decoding strategy aimed at\nreducing hallucinations in LLMs. Our approach exploits the hierarchical encoding of factual knowledge\nwithin transformer LLMs. Specifically, we dynamically select appropriate layers and contrast their logits to\nimprove the factuality in the decoding process. Experimental results show that DoLa significantly improves\ntruthfulness across multiple tasks without external information retrieval or model fine-tuning. Overall, DoLa\nis a critical step in making LLMs safer and more reliable by themselves.\nDoLa also has limitations: 1) Focusing on factuality: We have not explored DoLa in other dimensions\nsuch as reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022). 2) Inference only: We rely\non existing models and pre-trained parameters, not using human labels or factual knowledge bases for fine-\ntuning (Li et al., 2023), limiting possible improvements. 3) Not grounding on external knowledge: Our\nmethod relies on the model\u2019s internal knowledge without using external retrieval modules (Izacard et al.,\n2022; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023). Thus, it cannot correct misinformation acquired during\ntraining. However, since our method provides a foundational improvement that could potentially be applied\nto any transformer-based LLMs, the limitations listed above could be potentially addressed through future\nwork combining the corresponding elements with our decoding strategy.\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank all the anonymous reviewers for their helpful discussions and insightful feedback.

We subdivide the results into two parts by whether LLaMA is predicting an entity token or a non-\nentity token and show the results of the critical layer in Table 4.\nFrom Table 4, we can find that 75% of the time the critical layer will be layer 0 when predicting non-entity\ntokens. When predicting entity tokens, on the other hand, only 35% of the time the critical layer will be\nlayer 0, while more than 50% of the time the critical layer will be at a higher layer. This experiment can\nquantitatively support our observations in Figure 2.\nNote that we use teacher forcing to send the ground truth into LLaMA to predict the next word for each\ntoken in the sentence. And the ground truth sentences are not generated by LLaMA. The mismatch here can\npotentially make the result noisy when 1) LLaMA tries to predict an entity but the next token is not an entity,\nor 2) LLaMA tries to predict a non-entity token but the next word is an entity. A more accurate but expen-\nsive way to conduct this experiment would be to manually label each of the tokens in the greedy/sampled\ndecoding output from the same LLaMA itself. However, from the current experiments we have already seen\nsuch a trend in this NER dataset.\nLayer\nEntity Tokens\nNon-Entity Tokens\n0\n35.56%\n75.55%\n2\n0.05%\n0.08%\n4\n0.94%\n0.36%\n6\n0.94%\n0.14%\n8\n1.05%\n0.27%\n10\n0.05%\n0.33%\n12\n2.10%\n0.65%\n14\n0.00%\n0.33%\n16\n0.00%\n0.16%\n18\n0.00%\n0.05%\n20\n1.69%\n0.47%\n22\n9.69%\n1.76%\n24\n10.38%\n2.62%\n26\n2.08%\n2.17%\n28\n10.06%\n2.11%\n30\n25.40%\n12.98%\nTable 4: The distribution of critical layer in LLaMA-7B using the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset.\nB\nEXPLORATION IN CONTRASTIVE DECODING BASELINE: GSM8K\nWe explore the possibility of using smaller amateur models for contrastive decoding (CD) (Li et al., 2022)\nto create better baselines. We experiment with OpenLLaMa (Geng & Liu, 2023) and Sheared-LLaMA (Xia\net al., 2023) models in the size of 7B, 3B, 2.7B, 1.3B. The results are shown in Table 5. We can see that\n2https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003\n14\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nusing a small amateur LM, especially the 1.3B one, can improve the scores for CD compared to using the 7B\none as the amateur LM. However, most of the scores only match the scores of the baseline (the 33B model is\nthe only one that is better than the baseline), and they are still not better than DoLa. This result suggests that\nthe selection of the amateur LM is critical to making CD work. We explore many different amateur LMs but\nstill cannot obtain significant improvements from CD.\nModel / Score (%)\n7B\n13B\n33B\n65B\nLLaMA Baseline\n10.77\n16.68\n33.81\n51.18\n+ CD w/ LLaMA-7B\n\u2013\n9.10\n28.43\n44.05\n+ CD w/ OpenLLaMA-7B\n6.44\n13.50\n30.48\n38.82\n+ CD w/ OpenLLaMA-7B v2\n6.90\n14.33\n27.14\n39.50\n+ CD w/ OpenLLaMA-3B\n6.60\n11.07\n27.60\n41.77\n+ CD w/ OpenLLaMA-3B v2\n8.11\n11.52\n29.34\n40.33\n+ CD w/ Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B\n5.00\n14.10\n32.30\n47.08\n+ CD w/ Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B\n9.02\n16.38\n34.87\n46.40\n+ DoLa\n10.46\n18.04\n35.41\n53.60\nTable 5: Exploration of the contrastive decoding baselines with different size of amateur models on the task\nof GSM8K.\nC\nTRUTHFULQA DETAILS & SCORES FOR CONTRASTING WITH THE WORD\nEMBEDDING LAYER / ALL LAYERS\nWhen implementing DoLa for TruthfulQA, we found that not applying the softmax function on top of F\n(defined in Section 2) can make the performance even better as shown in Table 6, so we stuck with this\nimplementation for (and only for) the TruthfulQA multiple choices setting. However, both implementations\n(with and without softmax) are much better than baseline scores.

The results are shown in Table 7. We can see that both of the two variants can lead to performance\nimprovements, but they still fall behind our proposed DoLa.\n15\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nMethod\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA-13B\nMC1\nMC2\nMC3\nMC1\nMC2\nMC3\nVanilla\n25.6\n40.6\n19.2\n28.3\n43.3\n20.8\nDoLa 0-th layer\n31.6\n61.7\n30.1\n28.5\n62.3\n30.2\nDoLa all layers\n32.0\n63.9\n31.2\n30.5\n62.3\n31.0\nDoLa\n32.2\n63.8\n32.1\n28.9\n64.9\n34.8\nMethod\nLLaMA-33B\nLLaMA-65B\nMC1\nMC2\nMC3\nMC1\nMC2\nMC3\nVanilla\n31.7\n49.5\n24.2\n30.8\n46.9\n22.7\nDoLa 0-th layer\n31.4\n61.1\n31.1\n31.0\n63.6\n31.2\nDoLa all layers\n29.1\n61.5\n30.7\n30.5\n62.0\n31.7\nDoLa\n30.5\n62.3\n34.0\n31.1\n64.6\n34.3\nTable 7: The scores on TruthfulQA of DoLa contrasting with the 0-th (word embedding) layer and all the\nearly even-numbered layers.\nD\nGPT-4 EVALUATION ON TEXT GENERATION QUALITY\nWe conduct an additional study of the quality of generated text using GPT4, given the fact that several prior\nstudies Chiang & Lee (2023a); Liu et al. (2023) have shown the great potential of GPT-4 to serve as an\nalternative to human evaluation. And the effect is stable over different prompts and instructions Chiang &\nLee (2023b).\nWe adopt the pairwise evaluation code from Vicuna QA 3. To make GPT-4 focus only on the quality without\nbeing distracted by factuality, we changed the core sentence of the prompt to: Please rate by the\ngrammaticality and cohesiveness of their responses, but not factuality.\nYou are not\nrequired to verify the factual accuracy of the answers.\nEach assistant receives an\noverall score on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher score indicates better quality.\nBy using the prompt above, we observed the responses from GPT-4 can judge the answers based on gram-\nmaticality and cohesiveness without checking the factual correctness. The results are shown in Table 8,\nwhere the scores are the average scores from 80 questions in Vicuna QA, on a scale of 1 to 10.\nWe can observe that for 7B/13B/33B models, DoLa has better grammaticality and cohesiveness compared\nto the vanilla decoding baseline. For the largest 65B model, DoLa achieves a score that is almost the same as\nvanilla decoding. We conclude that when evaluating text generation quality without considering factuality,\nDoLa is still on par with (65B) or better than (7B/13B/33B) vanilla decoding.\nE\nMEMORY OVERHEAD\nTo measure the overhead, we calculate (a) the occupied GPU memory before the first forward pass and\n(b) the peak GPU memory during the forward passes. And then we can compute the memory overhead by\n(b) \u2212 (a), or the proportion of overhead [(b)\u2212(a)]\n(a)\nin %. For 13B/33B/65B that require 2/4/8 GPUs, the total\nmemory is accumulated among all the GPUs. The results are shown in Table 9.\n3https://github.com/lm-sys/vicuna-blog-eval/tree/main/eval\n16\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nModel\nBaseline\nDoLa\nLLaMA-7B\n6.44\n6.96\nLLaMA-13B\n7.06\n7.98\nLLaMA-33B\n6.89\n7.84\nLLaMA-65B\n8.04\n8.01\nTable 8: GPT-4 evaluation on text generation quality on a scale of 1 to 10, averged over the 80 examples in\nVicuna QA.\nWe can see that during the forward pass of LLaMA-7B, the overhead for vanilla decoding is 2.5% while\nDoLa requires 3.6%. There is only 1.1% difference for the memory overhead between Vanilla and DoLa.\nFor 13b/30b/65b models, the difference is even smaller than 1%. This result shows that the difference in\nmemory overhead between DoLa and the vanilla decoding baseline is still negligible.\nMetric\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA-13B\nBaseline\nDoLa\nBaseline\nDoLa\n(a) GPU Memory Before Forward (MB)\n12916.5\n12916.5\n25025.8\n25025.8\n(b) Peak GPU Memory During Forward (MB)\n13233.9\n13385.7\n25510.7\n25674.8\n(b) \u2212 (a) GPU Memory Overhead (MB)\n317.4\n469.2\n484.9\n681.6\n[(b)\u2212(a)]\n(a)\nGPU Memory Overhead (%)\n2.5%\n3.6%\n1.9%\n2.7%\nMetric\nLLaMA-30B\nLLaMA-65B\nBaseline\nDoLa\nBaseline\nDoLa\n(a) GPU Memory Before Forward (MB)\n55715.7\n55715.7\n124682.6\n124682.6\n(b) Peak GPU Memory During Forward (MB)\n57057.5\n57390.2\n126950.0\n127606.8\n(b) \u2212 (a) GPU Memory Overhead (MB)\n1341.9\n1674.5\n2267.4\n2924.3\n[(b)\u2212(a)]\n(a)\nGPU Memory Overhead (%)\n2.4%\n3.0%\n1.8%\n2.4%\nTable 9: Memory overhead of inference for 4 LLaMA models.\nF\nINFERENCE DETAILS\nWe run all the experiments with NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the machines equipped with 40-core CPUs of\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8168 CPU @ 2.70GHZ. We use the Huggingface Transformers package 4 to\nconduct experiments. When decoding responses from the language models, we use greedy decode for\nTruthfulQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K. For the Vicuna QA Benchmark, we use random sampling with\ntemperature 0.7 and max new tokens 1024 to generate the responses.\nFor the latency and throughput analysis in Section 4.2, we use the 817 examples from TruthfulQA with the\ndefault 6-shot in-context demonstration prompt which has an average input length is 250.3 after concate-\nnating the prompt with the questions. We force the model to decode 50 new tokens without any stopping\ncriteria.\n4https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\n17\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nWe run the models with 16-bit floating point and batch size = 1. For LLaMA 7/13/33/65B models, we\nuse 1/2/4/8 GPUs, respectively. The cross-GPU inference with model weight sharding was handled by\nHuggingface accelerate package.5\nWe divide the layers of LLaMA 7/13/33/65B models into 2/2/3/4 buckets of candidate layers. For the 32-\nlayer MPT-7B (MosaicML, 2023), we divide the layers into 4 buckets of candidate layers. We exclude the\n0-th layer (word embedding layer) for MPT-7B because its word embedding layer and LM prediction head\nshare their weights. Directly connecting the word embedding layer and LM prediction head together will\nbecome an operation similar to identity mapping.\nThe following table concludes the best bucket selected by the validation set. For TruthfulQA and FACTOR,\nalthough we conduct two-fold validation, the selected buckets by these two folds are the consistently same.\nTable 10: Best Bucket Selected by Validation Set\nDataset\nModel\nBucket\nLayer Range\nTruthfulQA\nLLaMA-7B\n2nd (out of 2)\n[16, 32)\nLLaMA-13B\n2nd (out of 2)\n[20, 40)\nLLaMA-33B\n3rd (out of 3)\n[40, 60)\nLLaMA-65B\n4th (out of 4)\n[60, 80)\nMPT-7B\n4th (out of 4)\n[24, 32)\nFACTOR & GSM8K\n(also used for StrategyQA and Vicuna QA)\nLLaMA-7B\n1st (out of 2)\n[0, 16)\nLLaMA-13B\n1st (out of 2)\n[0, 20)\nLLaMA-33B\n1st (out of 3)\n[0, 20)\nLLaMA-65B\n1st (out of 4)\n[0, 20)\nMPT-7B\n1st (out of 4)\n[2, 8)\nG\nNON-LLAMA MODEL\nTo check if DoLa works beyond LLaMA models, we tested MPT-7B (MosaicML, 2023).

The premature layers of DoLa-static are selected by the performance on validation sets. If it is in a\ntwo-fold validation setting, we report both of the selected layers in the tables (Val Selected Layer).\nWe can observe that for TruthfulQA and FACTOR, DoLa-static is slightly better than DoLa in most of the\ncases. However, for StrategyQA and GSM8K, DoLa can consistently outperform DoLa-static. Considering\nthat DoLa is more robust and generalizable, only requiring a very small hyperparameter search space, we\nuse DoLa as our main proposed method, instead of DoLa-static.\nJ\nRANDOM LAYER SELECTION BASELINE\nOne question in our proposed method is: How optimal is this dynamic layer selection method? For compar-\nison, we used a \u201crandom\u201d baseline similar to DoLa but with layers chosen randomly. Results in Table 15\nshow this random approach performs worse than the original baseline, highlighting the importance of our\nJSD-based layer selection strategy.\n19\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nModel\nVal Selected Layer\nMC1\nMC2\nMC3\nLLaMa-7B\n-\n25.6\n40.6\n19.2\n+ DoLa-static\n30/30\n34.5\n68.3\n40.0\n+ DoLa\n[16, 32)\n32.2\n63.8\n32.1\nLLaMa-13B\n-\n28.3\n43.3\n20.8\n+ DoLa-static\n38/38\n33.0\n66.9\n38.4\n+ DoLa\n[20, 40)\n28.9\n64.9\n34.8\nLLaMa-33B\n-\n31.7\n49.5\n24.2\n+ DoLa-static\n50/38\n27.9\n61.9\n33.7\n+ DoLa\n[40, 60)\n30.5\n62.3\n34.0\nLLaMa-65B\n-\n30.8\n46.9\n22.7\n+ DoLa-static\n36/72\n29.3\n63.7\n35.7\n+ DoLa\n[60, 80)\n31.1\n64.6\n34.3\nTable 12: Multiple choices results on TruthfulQA.

Figure 7 and 8 show that this improves the performance of\nDoLa on StrategyQA and GSM8K, but hurts the performance of baseline.

Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader\nthrough your reasoning step-by-step.\nAnswer\nA grain of salt is about 250 micrometers in diam-\neter. A micrometer is 1 millionth of a meter. One\nmillionth of a meter is 10\u22126 meters. There are\n1023 atoms in one cubic meter of air.

Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should\ntake the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\nAnswer\nThere are approximately 16 million lightning\nstrikes on Earth each day. I arrived at this num-\nber by adding together the number of lightning\nstrikes that occur in each of the continents each\nday. For example, there are approximately 1000\nlightning strikes per day in Europe. Renewable en-\nergy sources are those that can be replenished nat-\nurally in a relatively short amount of time, such as\nsolar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Non-\nrenewable energy sources, on the other hand, are\nfinite and will eventually be depleted, such as coal,\noil, and natural gas.\nThere are approximately 8.6 million lightning\nstrikes on Earth every day, or about 100 lightning\nstrikes per second. Here is how I arrived at this\nanswer.\nFirst, I found the number of lightning\nstrikes per second. According to the National Se-\nvere Storms Laboratory, there are 100 lightning\nstrikes per second on Earth, or 1.4 billion per year.\nNext, I multiplied this by the number of seconds in\na day, which is 86,400.

Daily life: My daily life on\nMars would be challenging, but rewarding. I would\nhave to work hard to maintain my space habitat,\nbut the rewards would be many.\nI would enjoy\na lifestyle that is not possible on Earth, including\na long-term perspective and an expanded sense of\npurpose. 2. Challenges: As a space colonist on\nMars, I would face many challenges, such as the\nfollowing: 1. Difficulty breathing in the thin atmo-\nsphere: I would have to wear a spacesuit or special\nbreathing equipment at all times. 2. Difficulty with\ntemperature: The temperature on Mars can drop to\n-130 degrees Fahrenheit or lower at night, and it\ncan rise to 70 degrees Fahrenheit at the equator dur-\ning the day. 3. Difficulty with gravity: The grav-\nitational pull on Mars is only 38% of the gravita-\ntional pull on Earth. 4. Difficulty with radiation:\nMars has no protective magnetic field, so it is not\nshielded from solar radiation like Earth is. 5. Dif-\nficulty with water: Mars has little to no water on\nits surface, so I would have to extract water from\nunderground sources. 6. Difficulty with food: I\nwould have to grow my own food, and the growing\nconditions on Mars would be much different than\nthose on Earth. 7. Difficulty with supplies: I would\nhave to live on the supplies that I bring with me,\nas it would be too expensive to send supplies from\nEarth to Mars. 8. Difficulty with communication:\nI would be thousands of miles away from Earth, so\ncommunication would be slow. 9. Difficulty with\nisolation: I would be isolated from human society,\nand the nearest human would be hundreds of thou-\nsands of miles away. 10. Difficulty with danger:\nI would face danger every day, including the dan-\nger of solar radiation, equipment failure, and life-\nthreatening situations.\nAssistant 2: On Mars, the day is 24 hours, 39 min-\nutes, and 35 seconds long, compared to 23 hours,\n56 minutes, and 4.09 seconds on Earth. So, it\u2019s\nabout 2.7 percent longer than our days on Earth.\nThis is due to the difference in rotational speed be-\ntween Mars and Earth.\nAlso, because Mars has\nan elliptical orbit around the Sun, its day length\nvaries by about 20 minutes throughout the year.\nOn Mars, a year is equal to 687 Earth days. So,\na Martian year is almost twice as long as an Earth\nyear. The average surface temperature on Mars is\n-81 degrees Fahrenheit (-63 degrees Celsius), mak-\ning it too cold for humans to live there without pro-\ntection from the elements. In addition, the atmo-\nspheric pressure is only 0.006 times that of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, so any humans who visit Mars must\nwear pressurized suits or live in pressurized habi-\ntats.\nThere\u2019s also less gravity on Mars.\nMars\u2019s\ngravitational acceleration at the surface is 0.38 of\nthat of Earth\u2019s, meaning that an object weighing\n100 pounds on Earth would weigh 38 pounds on\nMars. So, humans could jump higher and do more\nwork with less effort on Mars. However, this would\nalso mean that the bones and muscles of a person\nliving on Mars for a long period of time would get\nweaker. There is no liquid water on Mars, but there\nis ice in some places. Water is necessary for sur-\nvival, and ice is necessary to make water, so finding\nand accessing ice on Mars would be essential for\nany human colony. Mars also doesn\u2019t have a mag-\nnetic field, which means that cosmic radiation from\nspace reaches the surface of Mars unimpeded, in-\ncreasing the risk of cancer for anyone living there.\nIn addition, Mars doesn\u2019t have a protective ozone\nlayer like Earth does, so ultraviolet radiation from\nthe Sun would reach the surface of Mars and harm\nany humans who didn\u2019t take precautions to protect\nthemselves. Mars is known as the Red Planet due\nto its reddish appearance. This is caused by iron\noxide (rust) in the soil of Mars. It\u2019s also called\nthe Red Planet because the Roman god of war was\nnamed Mars. Mars is the fourth planet from the\nSun and is named after the Roman god of war. Its\nsymbol is a circle with an arrow through it pointing\nto the upper right. Mars has two moons: Phobos\nand Deimos. Phobos is about 14 miles (22 kilome-\nters) in diameter, while Deimos is about 8 miles (13\nkilometers) in diameter. Phobos orbits Mars faster\nthan the planet itself rotates, so it rises in the west\nand sets in the east, just as the Sun and the Moon\ndo on Earth...

Try to explain your answer. Your\nexplanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\nAnswer\nAccording to the movie, the house weighed 4,400\npounds, or 2 tons. This is equivalent to 18,144.14\nNewtons. The amount of lift provided by a helium\nballoon is given by the buoyant force. The buoyant\nforce is equal to the weight of the volume of fluid\ndisplaced by the balloon. This is given by the equa-\ntion: L = -\u03c1gV L = buoyant force (Newtons) \u03c1 =\ndensity of the fluid (Newtons/meter3) g = acceler-\nation due to gravity (meters/second2) V = volume\nof the balloon (meters3) The density of helium is\nabout 0.1786 kilograms per cubic meter. The ac-\nceleration due to gravity is 9.81 meters per second\nsquared. This means that the buoyant force is equal\nto: L = -\u03c1gV = -(0.1786 kg/m3)(9.81 m/s2)V = -\n1.7132496 V This means that a balloon with a vol-\nume of 1 cubic meter will have a buoyant force\nof 1.7132496 Newtons. This means that 10,588.86\nballoons would be needed to lift 4,400 pounds, or\n2 tons.\nIt would take 10,463,914 helium-filled balloons to\nlift a 2,500 square foot, two-story home. To arrive\nat this number, we first need to know how much\nthe house weighs. According to the U.S. Depart-\nment of Energy, the average U.S. home is about\n2,500 square feet and has a volume of about 7,500\ncubic feet. Using this information, we can calcu-\nlate the weight of the house by multiplying its vol-\nume by the density of drywall (which is 1.2 pounds\nper cubic foot). This results in a total weight of\n8,750 pounds for the house, or 4,375 pounds per\nstory. According to the National Balloon Museum,\neach latex balloon weighs 1.1 ounces, or 0.02835\npounds.\nTherefore, it would take 1,518,372 la-\ntex balloons to lift one story of the house, and\n3,036,744 balloons to lift both stories. However,\nsince the balloons would likely be made from My-\nlar instead of latex, and would have to be filled with\nhelium rather than air, the actual number of bal-\nloons needed would be higher. In fact, according to\nthe website Balloon HQ, a 10\u201d diameter latex bal-\nloon weighs 3.1 ounces, or 0.1935 pounds. There-\nfore, the total weight of the balloons required to\nlift a single story of the house would be 1,518,372\nx 0.1935 = 293,911 pounds, and the total weight\nof the balloons required to lift both stories of the\nhouse would be 2,008,112 pounds.\nAssuming a\ndensity of 0.178 pounds per cubic foot for helium,\nwe can calculate that it would take 11,246,214 cu-\nbic feet of helium to fill all of the balloons. Since\na 10\u201d diameter latex balloon holds 17.18 cubic feet\nof air, a 10\u201d diameter Mylar balloon would hold\nroughly the same amount of helium. Therefore, it\nwould take 654,636 10\u201d diameter Mylar balloons\nto lift the house. A chat between a curious human\nand an artificial intelligence assistant.

It even exhibits the ability to handle unseen tasks\nand outperforms prior methods on novel datasets. This rep-\nresents a significant step towards a generalist modeling in-\n*Equal contribution.\n\u2020Corresponding Author.\nterface for vision tasks, advancing artificial general intelli-\ngence in the field of computer vision.\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has\nwitnessed remarkable advancements, particularly in natu-\nral language processing (NLP) [7, 13, 52, 53]. The Genera-\ntive Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has successfully unified\nmultiple NLP tasks by providing a single, coherent frame-\nwork for diverse applications. Building on this success, our\nresearch aims to achieve a similar unification in the realm of\ncomputer vision, i.e. [10,11], developing a unifying frame-\nwork capable of handling multiple vision tasks simultane-\nously. However, compared with NLP tasks, unifying com-\nputer vision tasks is more challenging due to the diversity\nof various tasks.\nDiversity of Tasks and Outputs: Computer vision tasks\nencompass a wide range of applications, such as object\nrecognition, segmentation, image generation, and keypoint\ndetection, among others. Each of these tasks has a different\narXiv:2309.03895v1  [cs.CV]  7 Sep 2023\noutput format, including coordinates, binary masks, images,\nand categories. This diversity makes it difficult to find a\nuniform representation for all tasks. In contrast, NLP tasks\noften have text-based outputs that can be more easily repre-\nsented in a standard format.\nDifferent Methodologies and Techniques: Computer vi-\nsion tasks often require distinct methodologies and tech-\nniques depending on the specific problem being addressed.\nFor example, image generation tasks are commonly domi-\nnated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [17,28,\n29] and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPM) [19, 22, 65],\nwhich are rarely used for image understanding tasks such\nas object recognition or image classification. Additionally,\nthe output dimensionality of generative models is relatively\nhigher, adding to the challenge of unifying these tasks. In\ncontrast, NLP tasks tend to rely on a more consistent set of\ntechniques, such as Transformer-based models [71], which\ncan be applied across various NLP applications.\nContinuous Input and Output: Both the input and output\nof computer vision tasks are usually continuous, like coor-\ndinates or images. This continuous nature makes it chal-\nlenging to develop a unified approach that can accurately\nhandle such data. If discretizing the continuous data using\ntechniques like Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoders\n(VQ-VAE) [58, 70], there will be quantization errors, lead-\ning to inaccuracies in the results. This issue is less promi-\nnent in NLP tasks, where the input and output data can be\nmore easily discretized [7,13,71] into text tokens.\nIn this paper, we take advantage of the DDPM and pro-\npose a novel approach to address these challenges by treat-\ning all computer vision tasks as image generation, specif-\nically instructional image editing tasks.\nWe instruct im-\nage editing tasks using a more natural and intuitive way\nthat closely aligns with how humans process images. For\ninstance, the instruction for a segmentation task could in-\nvolve turning the pixels of an object in the image into a spe-\ncific color, while the remaining pixels remain unchanged.\nThe keypoint detection task can be described as placing an\nopaque colored circle at a specific position in the image.\nThe instruction for a classification task could change the ob-\nject to different colors according to its category. Compared\nwith some methods that have attempted to formulate vision\ntasks as inpainting problems [5, 78], our approach ensures\naccurate reflection of human intentions which simplifies the\nprocess of handling multiple vision tasks. At the same time,\nsince the input and output of DDPM are continuous [22,65],\ndiscretization is unnecessary, which solves the problem of\nquantization error.\nWe mainly focus on three types of output formats: 3-\nchannel RGB images, binary masks, and keypoints. These\nthree outputs are sufficient to cover most vision tasks, such\nas semantic segmentation, referring segmentation, keypoint\ndetection, image manipulation, and so on. Since the out-\nput of the denoising diffusion model is a 3-channel image,\nwe propose a unified representation that encodes masks and\nkeypoints into 3-channel images to handle various image\nunderstanding tasks. Then we use a post-processing module\nto extract the commonly used output format for evaluation.\nDuring the training phase, we use a diverse set of tasks\nto train a single model uniformly. We also collect a new\ndataset for image editing. The experimental results demon-\nstrate that our approach achieves good performance in each\ntask. Furthermore, we observed that, compared to training\nindividual models for each task, joint training of multiple\ntasks can enhance the generalization ability.\nRemarkably, our model also exhibits the ability of AGI\nto a certain extent, as it can handle tasks not seen during\nthe training phase, such as image detection and classifica-\ntion. Moreover, it performs better than previous methods\non datasets that were not seen during training. This study\nthus presents a significant step towards the development of\na generalist modeling interface for vision tasks, paving the\nway for future research in the quest for AGI in computer\nvision.\n2. Related Work\nBuilding a general-purpose model that is capable of solving\nany arbitrary task has been a longstanding desire for artifi-\ncial intelligence research. There exists a substantial number\nof related works in the literature, aiming to unify a broad\nspectrum of tasks. We present a brief overview of recent\nefforts in this direction.\nVision Language Foundation Models. The vast amount\nof easily accessible web-scale image-text pairs has brought\nabout a wave of research innovations in vision language\nfoundation models [15,36,39,45,66,75,97]. The pioneering\nworks, CLIP [55] and ALIGN [26], are trained with con-\ntrastive loss, showing impressive generalization capabilities\nfor downstream tasks by aligning pairs of images and texts\nin a cross-modal shared embedding space. Subsequent ef-\nforts extend the image-text contrastive method to a broader\nspectrum, such as the image-text-label space proposed in\nUniCL [88] and a wider range of tasks as well as modalities\nsupported in Florence [94] and INTERN [62]. However,\ncontrastive-based methods lack the ability to generate lan-\nguage, which limits their application in open-ended tasks\nsuch as captioning or visual question answering.\nOn the other hand, the success of large language mod-\nels such as GPT series [7, 53, 56, 57], PaLM [4, 12], and\nLLaMA [68], has been attracting a lot of research inter-\nest [24, 38, 64, 69, 73, 74, 80] in augmenting the large lan-\nguage models with visual capabilities. Mostly, these mod-\nels cast a wide range of open-ended vision tasks as text\nprediction problems, mapping visual input content to lan-\nguage semantics to enable general-purpose visual and lan-\nguage understanding. BEIT3 [77] unifies the pretraining\ntask in a masked data modeling manner. CoCa [92] and\nBLIP [34, 35] unifies contrastive learning and generative\nlearning. Flamingo [2] accepts arbitrarily interleaved visual\ndata and text as input and generates text in an open-ended\nmanner by learning on a broad diversity of vision language\ntasks. LLaVA [43] exploits visual instruction tuning by con-\nverting image-text pairs into an instruction-following for-\nmat. GLIP v2 [95] and Kosmos v2 [54] leverage grounded\nimage-text pairs to further unlock the grounding capabil-\nity of multimodal large language models. Our work differs\nfrom LLaVA [43] in that, unlike open-ended visual tasks\nsuch as visual question answering that can be naturally for-\nmulated in an instruction-following format, we attempt to\nformulate vision tasks, such as segmentation and keypoint\ndetection, into an instruction-following framework. This is\nchallenging due to the unclear instructions and lack of spe-\ncific guidelines in these tasks.\nVision Generalist Models. Seeking a unified model that,\nonce trained, can be directly used to seamlessly address a\nwide variety of vision tasks, has been an enduring aspira-\ntion in the computer vision community. Multi-task learn-\ning [25, 25, 33, 99] has become more and more popular.\nThe key challenge lies in the diversity and complexity of\nthe various structure of task outputs. Currently, there are\ntwo major interfaces for output unification: language-like\ngeneration and image-resembling generation. Most exist-\ning attempts for vision generalists take inspiration from\nsequence-to-sequence models in the NLP field and model\na sequence of discrete tokens through next token predic-\ntion [10, 20, 59, 74, 76]. Pix2Seq v2 [11] unifies object de-\ntection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection, and im-\nage captioning by quantizing the continuous image coordi-\nnates for the first three tasks. Unified IO [46] further uni-\nfies dense structure outputs such as images, segmentation\nmasks, and depth maps using a vector quantization varia-\ntional auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) [70].\nAs quantization inevitably introduces information loss\nduring discretization, another direction of unification aims\nto explore the image itself as a natural interface for vi-\nsion generalists [5, 78]. Painter [78] formulates the dense\nprediction task as a masked image inpainting problem and\ndemonstrates in-context capability in vision tasks such as\ndepth estimation, semantic segmentation, instance segmen-\ntation, keypoint detection, and image restoration. Recently,\nPromptDiffusion [79] also exploits in-context visual learn-\ning with a text-guided diffusion model [60] and integrates\nthe learning of six different tasks, i.e., image-to-depth,\nimage-to-HED, image-to-segmentation and vice versa. Our\nwork also examines image-resembling generation. How-\never, in contrast to in-context learning, Unlike previous\nworks [78, 79] that also explore natural language instruc-\ntions, our method introduces a more favorable instruction\nalignment compared to the implicit task intention deducted\nfrom in-context learning. Moreover, with such explicit in-\nstructions, we further unify semantic image editing tasks,\nwhich are crucial use cases in image-resembling generation.\n3. Method\nWe present InstructDiffusion, a novel generalist model-\ning interface designed for a diverse range of vision tasks.\nBy leveraging the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(DDPM), we treat all computer vision tasks as human-\nintuitive image manipulation processes with outputs in a\nflexible and interactive pixel space. Several existing multi-\nmodal models, such as Flamingo [2] and BLIP2 [34],\ninherently produce natural language as their target out-\nput, thereby restricting their capabilities to visual ques-\ntion answering and image captioning. In contrast, our ap-\nproach posits that formulating various vision tasks, includ-\ning segmentation, keypoint detection, and image synthe-\nsis as image-resembling generation processes, is more in-\ntuitive, straightforward, and readily assessable for human\nevaluation.\nOur primary focus is on three output formats: 3-channel\nRGB images, binary masks, and key points. These out-\nputs adequately encompass a wide range of vision tasks,\nincluding keypoint detection, semantic segmentation, refer-\nring segmentation, semantic image editing, and several im-\nage enhancement tasks such as deblurring, denoising, and\nwatermark removal. We first discuss the essential instruc-\ntional format design for the vision tasks currently covered\nin Section 3.1, followed by an in-depth explanation of the\ntraining data preparation to ensure optimal model perfor-\nmance in Section 3.2. Lastly, we describe a unified frame-\nwork with a simple architecture in Section 3.3.\n3.1. Unified Instructional for Vision Tasks\nThe unified modeling interface for all tasks is referred\nto as Instructional Image Editing. By denoting the training\nset as {xi}, each training data xi can be represented in the\nform of {ci, si, ti}, where ci signifies the control instruc-\ntion, while si and ti represent the source and target images,\nrespectively. Within this context, our method aims to gen-\nerate a target image ti that adheres to the given instruction\nci when provided with an input source image si.\nIn the context of semantic image editing tasks, Instruct-\nPix2Pix [6] is a recent representative work that demon-\nstrates a natural fit.\nFor other vision tasks, the chal-\nlenge involves creating appropriate instructions and sub-\nsequently establishing a corresponding target image. Al-\nthough natural language instruction has been utilized ex-\ntensively in previous approaches, such as Pix2Seq [10] and\nUnifiedIO [46], we contend that terms like \u201dsemantic seg-\nmentation\u201d or \u201dkeypoint detection\u201d are better perceived as\nindicators rather than instructions. In contrast, our approach\ninvolves providing highly detailed instructions, enabling the\nmodel to comprehend the instructions rather than merely\nmodel a fixed bias based on the indicator.\nKeypoint detection. It endeavors to precisely locate key\nobject components within an image, such as the left eye of\na face, the right shoulder of an individual, or the nose of\na dog. Traditionally, heatmap regression has served as the\nstandard learning approach, where ground truth heatmaps\nare generated by overlaying 2D Gaussian kernels on all key-\npoints.\nIn contrast, this work introduces a more natural\nand easily assessable output by providing extensively de-\ntailed instructions, thereby enhancing the overall process\nof keypoint detection in various applications. An exem-\nplary instruction might be, \u201dPlease use red to encircle the\nleft shoulder of the man.\u201d In this instance, the output im-\nage should exhibit a red circle at the corresponding loca-\ntion (i.e., the left shoulder of the man in the image), while\nthe rest of the region remains unaltered. This innovative\napproach facilitates a more intuitive comprehension of the\nkeypoint detection process while simultaneously refining\nthe model\u2019s capacity to understand the meaning of differ-\nent object components.\nSegmentation. For semantic and referring segmentation,\nthe objective is to identify the region of a particular ob-\nject within the input image. An illustrative example of this\ninstruction would be \u201dapply a blue semi-transparent mask\nto the rightmost dog while maintaining the remainder un-\naltered.\u201d Consequently, the resulting image is determined\nand features a blue mask on the appropriate dog. We re-\nquire the mask to be semi-transparent instead of opaque,\nthereby facilitating the human evaluation of the predicted\nmask\u2019s accuracy. Moreover, our experiments indicate that\nthe semi-transparent mask also augments the segmentation\nperformance.\nImage enhancement and image editing. Image enhance-\nment such as deblurring, denoising, and watermark removal\ninherently yields output images, and the same applies to im-\nage editing. Consequently, we only need to construct in-\nstructions which shall clearly specify the operation to be\nperformed. Detailed examples include \u201cMake the image\nmuch sharper\u201d for image deblurring, \u201cPlease remove the\nwatermark on the image\u201d for watermark removal, and \u201cadd\nan apple in the woman\u2019s hand\u201d for image editing.\nTo enhance the diversity of instructions, we first manu-\nally write 10 instructions for each task. Then we use GPT-\n4 to rewrite and expand the diversity of these instructions,\nthereby mimicking user input to the system. Subsequently,\none instruction is chosen at random during the training pro-\ncess. This approach, which incorporates diverse and intu-\nitive instructions, has been observed to substantially aug-\nment the model\u2019s multi-task fusion capabilities.\n3.2. Training Data Construction\nAs a proof-of-concept,\nwe focus on investigating\nwhether different tasks benefit each other under such image-\nresembling unification, instead of scaling data as much as\npossible for optimal performance at the extreme limits. We\nadopt widely used publicly available datasets and construct\nthe ground truth target image according to the instruction\ntemplate.\nFor example, we use COCO-Stuff [8] for se-\nmantic segmentation and use COCO [41], MPII [3], Crow-\nPose [37] and AIC [83] for keypoint detection. More details\nwill be presented in Sec 4.1.\nFor image editing, InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) [6] pioneered\nthe use of a synthetic training dataset by leveraging GPT-\n3 [7] for generating instructions and Prompt2Prompt [21]\nfor creating output images.\nHowever, the synthesized\nsource and target images exhibit varying quality and non-\nnegligible artifacts, with most instructions focusing on\nglobal style modifications rather than local alterations. Fur-\nthermore, MagicBrush [96] introduced a dataset compris-\ning over 10,000 manually annotated triples, but its size\nis limited when compared to other vision tasks.\nConse-\nquently, in addition to existing datasets such as IP2P [6],\nGIER [63], GQA [90], and MagicBrush [96], we propose\na novel dataset called Image Editing in the Wild (IEIW),\nwhich encompasses 159,000 image editing pairs that cover\na wide range of semantic entities and diverse levels of se-\nmantic granularity. To expand the scope of image editing\ndata, we assemble the IEIW dataset by drawing from the\nfollowing three distinct resources:\nObject removal. Object removal is a very common type\nof image editing. Inspired by Inst-Inpaint [90], we use the\nreferring segmentation dataset PhraseCut [82] to construct\nthe instructional object removal data. PhraseCut offers im-\nages with referring phrases for corresponding regions. We\nset these regions as a mask and use LAMA [67] to in-\npaint them, transforming them into instructional inpainting\ndatasets. Notably, we also swap input and output images,\nand reverse the instructions like \u201dremove the blue bird on\ntop of the tree\u201d to \u201dadd a blue bird on top of the tree\u201d to fur-\nther supplement data from the perspective of adding com-\nponents.\nObject replacement.\nWe propose a data construction\npipeline for generating training data that targets the sce-\nnario of substituting certain specific objects, which is an-\nother essential feature for image editing. To automatically\ngenerate training triplets, we rely on SA-1B [31] and Open-\nImages [32] datasets, which provide multiple regions in an\nimage with semantic meaning. Specifically, we first build a\ngallery database consisting of diverse image patches based\non those semantic-aware regions. Given a source image\nfrom OpenImages or SA-1B, we randomly select a semantic\nregion, which is used as a query patch to retrieve its near-\nest neighbors from the aforementioned constructed gallery\nHuman\nAlignment\nUse the color yellow to\nencircle the nose of the tiger\nTask-specific\nTraining\nUse the color yellow to\nencircle the nose of the tiger\nA running tiger\nText-to-image\nModel\nPretraining\nAdaptation\nA running tiger\nwith yellow and blue circles\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nFigure 2. Training pipeline of our method. To illustrate concisely,\nwe take keypoint detection as an example.\ndatabase. The retrieved similar patches are regarded as ref-\nerence images to the source image, both of which are fed\nto PaintByExample [87] for generating a target image. In\nthis way, we obtain the source image as well as the modi-\nfied target image. To produce instruction, we utilize an im-\nage captioning tool, such as BLIP2 [34], to yield the source\ncaption as well as the target caption, and then generate a\npossible instruction through a large language model. For\nexample, given the captions \u201ca running dog\u201d and \u201ca cute\ncat with black and white stripes\u201d, a possible instruction is\n\u201cplease change the running dog to a cute cat with black and\nwhite stripes\u201d. We can generate quite an amount of paired\ndata for training using this construction pipeline.\nWeb crawl. In order to achieve greater alignment with au-\nthentic user needs and enhance the overall user experience,\nwe gather genuine user requests along with the correspond-\ning outcomes delivered by seasoned Photoshop profession-\nals sourced from the website. To ensure the accuracy and\nrelevance of the data, we search in Google by utilizing the\nkeyword \u201dphotoshop request\u201d. This approach enables us\nto amass a substantial dataset comprising over 23,000 data\ntriplets, which further aids in refining our understanding\nof user requirements and reduces the domain gap between\ntraining and inference.\nIn order to guarantee the quality of the training data,\nwe further utilize image quality assessment tools to elim-\ninate substandard data. Specifically, we apply Aesthetics\nScore and GIQA [18] as image quality evaluation metrics,\nspecifically utilizing LAION-Aesthetics-Predictor [61] for\nAesthetics Score and constructing a KNN-GIQA model on\nLAION-600M [61] images for calculating GIQA scores.\nWe exclude two categories of data: i) target images with\nlow-quality scores, and ii) a significant discrepancy in qual-\nity scores between the source image and its corresponding\ntarget image. Our findings indicate that this data-filtering\nprocess is of vital importance.\n3.3. Unified Framework\nOur framework is based on diffusion, as diffusion mod-\nels have experienced significant success in modeling com-\nplex image distributions.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, our\ntraining procedure comprises three stages:\npretraining\nadaptation, task-specific training, and instruction tuning.\nPretraining adaptation. Stable Diffusion (SD) [60] is rec-\nognized as one of the most robust open-source text-to-image\nmodels currently accessible, prompting our decision to uti-\nlize Stable Diffusion v1.5 as the foundation for our work.\nInitially, stable diffusion operates as a mapping mechanism\nthat converts textual captions into natural images. How-\never, our desired images might encompass segmentation\nmasks or keypoint indicators, which substantially deviate\nfrom typical natural images. Consequently, our preliminary\nphase involves fine-tuning the stable diffusion model and\nadjusting the diffusion output distribution.\nSince we require diffusion models to be capable of gen-\nerating images \u201cwith a foreground mask\u201d or \u201cwith some\nspecial mark\u201d, we employ existing segmentation or key-\npoint detection datasets to produce such data.\nThe re-\nmaining challenge lies in the development of suitable cap-\ntions that accurately depict these images while maintain-\ning the intrinsic text-to-image generation capability. This\nis achieved by augmenting the original image caption with\na suffix, such as \u201dwith a few different color patches here\nand there\u201d or \u201dsurrounded with a red circle.\u201d By fine-tuning\nthe diffusion model with these modified image captions, we\ncan theoretically empower the model to generate any im-\nages within the desired output domain.\nTask-specific training. In the second stage, our goal is to\nfurther fine-tune the diffusion model, enhancing its com-\nprehension of various instructions for different tasks. We\nfollow InstructPix2Pix [6] and inject source images by con-\ncatenating them with the noise input, subsequently expand-\ning the input channels of the first layer. We train our model\nusing all data containing various tasks. Since the amount of\ndata for each task is quite different, in order to maintain a\nbalance, we manually set different sampling weights for dif-\nferent databases. The number of effective training samples\nused for different tasks is shown in Table 1. For a data triplet\nsi, ci, ti, the diffusion process adds noise to the encoded la-\ntent z = E(ti) producing a noisy latent zt. We fine-tune\nthe diffusion network \u03f5\u03b8 by minimizing the following latent\ndiffusion objective:\nL = E(si,ci,ti)\u223cP(x),\u03f5\u223cN (0,1),t\nh\n\u2225\u03f5\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, si, ti)\u22252\n2\ni\n(1)\nHuman alignment. To further improve the quality of edit-\ning, we have followed the idea of instruction tuning [81]\nfrom Large Language Models. In LLM literature, instruc-\ntion tuning [81] is used to teach the model to solve a task\nfollowing the instruction. However, we conduct instruction\ntuning differently from that in LLM. For each sample in the\nbenchmark, we generate different editing results using 20\ndifferent sampling classifier-free guidance [23]. Then, we\nTable 1.

The whole dataset con-\ntains 1, 000 images. We use this dataset to further fine-tune\nour model for about 10 epochs.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Settings\nTraining samples. Our model is trained on samples con-\nsisting of {instruction, source image, target image}, encom-\npassing the aforementioned vision tasks, i.e., keypoint de-\ntection, semantic segmentation, referring segmentation, im-\nage enhancement including denoising, deblurring and wa-\ntermark removal, and image editing. Specifically for key-\npoint detection, we adopt four classical datasets, namely\nCOCO [41] containing 149K images with each labeled 17\nkeypoints, CrowdPose [37] consisting of 35K images each\nwith 14 keypoints, MPII [3] with 22K images labeled with\n16 keypoints, and AIC [83] including 378K images anno-\ntated with 14 keypoints. Throughout our training process,\nfor each image, we employ a random selection of between\n1 and 5 keypoints, and assign these keypoints with random\ncolors. Accordingly, the instruction is produced through\ntemplates filled with the class of keypoints and the spe-\ncific color, and the target image is generated by position-\ning small circles on the chosen keypoints, each circle tak-\ning on the color corresponding to its respective keypoint.\nFor segmentation, we select COCO-Stuff [8] as semantic\nsegmentation training dataset while gRefCOCO [42] and\nRefCOCO [93] as referring segmentation training dataset.\nWe collect a series of prompt templates with the help of\nlarge language models to serve as text instructions.\nAn\nexample is \u201cplace a color mask on object.\u201d During train-\ning, we randomly select a color for \u201ccolor\u201d and replace\n\u201cobject\u201d with the corresponding category name in seman-\ntic segmentation or referring in referring segmentation. The\ntarget image is generated by placing a mask using its cor-\nresponding color with a transparency of 0.5 over the ob-\nject. For image enhancement, we focus on three tasks:\ndeblurring, denoising, and watermark removal. For these\ntasks, we utilize the GoPro [51] containing 2103 images\nand REDS [50] dataset with 24,000 images for deblurring,\nthe SIDD [1] dataset composed of 320 images for denois-\ning, and the CLWD [44] dataset containing 60,000 images\nfor watermark removal. Lastly for image editing, as men-\ntioned in Sec. 3.2, we adopt 7 editing datasets, including fil-\ntered InstructPix2Pix [6] dataset containing 561K samples,\n8K samples in MagicBrush [96] training dataset, GIER [63]\nTable 2. Average precision comparison on the COCO val2017,\nHumanArt and AP-10K datasets. We evaluate the official large\nmodels of the competitors to ensure fairness.

To ensure balanced sampling\nacross each task, we implemented distinct sampling weights\ndue to the considerable variance in the number of training\nimages across different datasets. Table 1 illustrates the num-\nber of effective training samples we used in our framework.\nImplementation details. We utilize Stable Diffusion [60]\nv1.5 as initialization to leverage a text-to-image genera-\ntion prior. The input image resolution is preprocessed to\n256 \u00d7 256, and the learning rate is fixed to 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 dur-\ning training. In addition, we adopt an EMA rate of 0.9999\nto stabilize the training. Our model is trained using a batch\nsize of 3072 for a total of 200 epochs, which requires ap-\nproximately 4 days of computation on 48 NVIDIA V100\nGPUs. Once trained, our model is readily applicable and\ncan be directly used for different vision tasks. For each task,\nwe provide a comprehensive comparison and an in-depth\nanalysis of its performance in the subsequent sections. Dur-\ning the human alignment stage, we use an EMA rate of 0.99\nto help the model quickly adapt to the instruction-tuning\ndataset.\n4.2. Keypoint Detection\nWe evaluate our model on both the close-set scenario us-\ning the COCO validation dataset as well as the open-set\ngeneralization capability over the unseen dataset: Huma-\nnArt dataset [27] and AP-10K animal dataset [91]. The Hu-\nmanArt dataset is an artificial human dataset comprised of\nvarious forms such as cartoons, shadow plays, and murals,\nexhibiting a distinct data distribution compared to COCO\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 3.

(d) Paint the pixels of shadow in blue and maintain\nthe current appearance of the other pixels.\ndataset. The AP-10K Animal dataset is a collection of an-\nnotated animal keypoints, which effectively highlights the\nability of our model to handle animal keypoints despite be-\ning trained only on human keypoint datasets. To enable\na more detailed and thorough evaluation, it is essential to\nextract accurate pose coordinate information, namely pre-\ncise horizontal and vertical coordinates, rather than simply\nmarking the location with a distinct symbol. To achieve\nthis, we employ a lightweight U-Net structure that post-\nprocesses the output image to generate a multi-channel\nheatmap. We employ the standard AP (average precision)\nbased on the OKS as our evaluation metrics.\nAddition-\nally, we utilize the ground truth bounding boxes for all re-\nsults. Notably, for the AP-10K animal dataset, in order to\nfacilitate comparison with other methods, the OKS is cal-\nculated exclusively on the keypoints that overlap with the\nCOCO annotated joints. However, it should be noted that\nour model possesses the capability to detect keypoints be-\nyond the confines of the training dataset.\nThe results of the keypoint detection are presented in\nTable 2. Our approach outperforms other generalist mod-\nels, Unified-IO [46] and Painter [78], across all evaluated\ndatasets. Particularly we demonstrate a significantly higher\nlevel of performance over HumanArt and AP-10K, indicat-\ning the powerful generalization ability of our framework. In\ncomparison to methods specifically designed for keypoint\ndetection, our unified model does not exceed their perfor-\nmance due to localization accuracy limitations. However,\nit showcases exceptional performance on the entirely un-\nseen animal keypoints dataset, AP-10K. Figure 3 (a-c) dis-\nplay our results for car and animals keypoint detection. Our\nmodel can accurately detect the logo of the car and the key-\npoints of animals that have never appeared in the keypoint\ndetection training dataset.\nFigure 3 (d) demonstrate our\ncapability for referring keypoint detection, showcasing our\nversatile detection abilities.\n4.3. Segmentation\nOur primary focus lies in assessing the open-vocabulary\ncapability of our model, particularly when evaluating im-\nages that contain unseen classes not present during the train-\ning phase. Therefore, besides the COCO-stuff [8], gRef-\nCOCO [42] and RefCOCO [93] datasets, we conduct eval-\nuation over additional eight datasets, i.e., RefCOCO+ [93],\nG-Ref [47], RefClef [30] for referring segmentation, and\nADE20K-150 [98], ADE20K-847 [98], Pascal Context-\n59 [49], Pascal Context-459 [49], Pascal VOC [14] for se-\nmantic segmentation. Similar to keypoint detection, we em-\nploy a lightweight U-Net structure that post-processes the\noutput image to extract the binary mask of each individ-\nual object. Adhering to the prevailing convention [42], we\nadopt cumulative IoU (cIoU) to measure the performance\nfor referring segmentation. On the other hand, our approach\ninvolves predicting a mask for each semantic category indi-\nvidually. As a result, semantic segmentation can also be\nperceived as referring to segmentation based on semantic\ncategories.

To\nthe best of our knowledge, Unified-IO [11] stands as the\nsole generalist model with the capability to perform refer-\nring segmentation. It can be seen that our model largely\noutperforms Unified-IO across almost all datasets.\nWe\nalso present methods that are specially designed for re-\nferring segmentation. Interestingly, our approach achieves\nan unexpectedly significant improvement over the RefClef\ndataset. Table 4 presents the quantitative comparison re-\nsults of semantic segmentation. Both specialized models as\nwell as our model have undergone training exclusively on\nthe COCO-Stuff dataset. It is evident that our model not\nonly surpasses specialized models in the close-set scenario,\nspecifically the COCO-Stuff dataset, but also achieves com-\nparable performance across other datasets that represent\nopen-set scenarios. Notably, in the case of the VOC dataset,\nwe observe a substantial improvement. When compared to\ngeneralist models, our approach outperforms other competi-\ntors by a considerable margin, except in the case of Painter\non the ADE-150K dataset. This is largely attributable to\nPainter being specifically trained on this dataset. Interest-\ningly, we notice that both Painter [78] and PromptDiffu-\nsion [79] lack awareness of the colors associated with un-\nseen categories during evaluations in open-set scenarios.\nThis is due to their reliance on example images to instruct\nthe model regarding the color corresponding to each seman-\ntic. In contrast, our approach establishes the color corre-\nsponding to each semantic category through text instruc-\ntions, resulting in significantly superior performance. Fig-\nure 4 illustrates several visual examples for referring seg-\nmentation to demonstrate our model\u2019s capability.\n4.4. Image Enhancement\nWe evaluate the low-level vision performance of our\nmodel using the widely employed benchmarks, i.e., Go-\nPro [51], SIDD [1] and CLWD [44] dataset respectively for\ndeblurring, denoising, and watermark removal task. The\nstandard PSNR metric is adopted to measure the differ-\nence between the output processed image and the ground\ntruth image. We evaluate our model\u2019s deblurring capability\non the GoPro benchmark with 1280\u00d7720 resolution, while\nfor SIDD and CLWD, evaluations are conducted under\n256\u00d7256 resolution to align with other works. The numer-\nical comparison is reported in Table 5. We have made the\nfollowing observations. Firstly, specialized models trained\nfor image editing tasks tend to exhibit poor generalization\nwhen applied to image enhancement tasks. Secondly, the\ngeneralist model Painter [78] performs better in the denois-\ning task but encounters challenges when it comes to seam-\nlessly integrating image editing tasks through in-context\nlearning. Lastly, the performance of our model in image\nenhancement is constrained by the VAE model, which in-\ntroduces information loss.

We can observe that the re-\nsulting images have been effectively processed in line with\nthe provided instruction, which includes sharpening, de-\nnoising, and watermark removal.\n4.5. Image Editing\nTo better demonstrate the editing quality of our method,\nwe build a benchmark containing 1,000 samples. Each sam-\nple contains the source image, the caption of the source im-\nage provided by BLIP2 [34], the editing instruction, and\nthe target caption of the edited image. We manually clas-\nsify each sample into one of three distinct editing scenar-\nios: replacement, removal, and addition. This meticulous\ncategorization aims to provide a nuanced reflection of the\nmodel\u2019s editing capabilities. We adopt two commonly used\nmetrics, CLIP similarity (CLIP-Sim) and Aesthetic Predic-\ntor\u2019s Score (AP) [61], to evaluate the editing results. CLIP-\nSim measures the semantic similarity between an image and\na text. We utilize BLIP2 [34] to obtain the caption of the in-\nput image and invoke GPT-3.5-turbo to acquire the target\ncaption of the edited image. The CLIP-Sim score is calcu-\nlated between the edited image and the target caption. The\nAP score assesses the aesthetic quality of the generated im-\nages, a methodology akin to LAION-5B, which employs\nthe CLIP+MLP Aesthetic Score Predictor. A higher quality\nscore reflects better perceptual quality.\nWe report the numerical results in Table 5. It is impor-\ntant to emphasize that none of the existing generalist mod-\nels have the capability to perform image editing. Compared\nwith specific models, it is evident from the table that even\nwith joint training, our model achieves superior CLIP-Sim\ncompared to Instruct-Pix2Pix [6] and on-par results with\nMagicBrush [96]. When assessing the editing task, it is\nRemove all magnets and stickers\nInput\nInstructPix2Pix\nMagicBrush\nEDICT\nNull-text Inversion\nOurs\nReplace the truck with a train\nMake the cat look like Lil Wayne\nFigure 6.

Quantitative results may\nbe somewhat constrained for comparison. For instance, a\nmodel that fails to make substantial edits and produces an\nimage that remains almost unchanged could potentially re-\nceive a higher score than models that have successfully car-\nried out meaningful edits.\nWe further illustrate several visual examples in Figure 6\ncompared with competitive baseline methods that have\nbeen shown impressive editing quality, including Instruct-\nPix2Pix [6], MagicBrush [96], EDICT [72] and Null-text\nInversion [48]. It is evident that our model effectively ed-\nits the image in line with the given instructions. For in-\nstance, by following the directives, our model can success-\nfully eliminate magnets and stickers, convert a truck into a\ntrain, and transform a cat into a particular style. We show-\ncase additional editing results of our model in Figure 7,\nfurther highlighting the remarkably precise editing qual-\nity achieved. Given a source image, our model is capable\nof successfully adding, removing, and replacing elements.\nThe image undergoes precise editing based on the prompt\nwhile maintaining the integrity of the background and pre-\nserving intricate details.\n4.6. The Benefit of Highly Detailed Instruction\nOur hypothesis is that the ability to generalize is the skill\nof learning through understanding the specific meanings of\nindividual elements rather than memorizing entire instruc-\ntions. Unlike previous unified models like Pix2seq [10] and\nUnified-IO [46], which simply treat natural language as task\nindicators, our approach employs detailed descriptions for\neach task as instructions. Such detailed instructions enable\nthe model to understand comprehensively and then priori-\ntize accurate execution instead of simple instructions that\nfavor mimicking. To show this, we try to replace our in-\nstructions within our framework with simpler task indica-\ntors, such as \u201dsemantic segmentation\u201d and \u201dkeypoint detec-\ntion,\u201d while assigning fixed colors to each keypoint or ob-\nject class. As demonstrated in Table 6, the results of simple\ninstructions are extremely poor, especially when handling\nnew types of keypoints or novel object categories.\nThis\nhighlights that our detailed instructions provide enhanced\nflexibility and adaptability in the open domain.\n4.7. The Benefit of Multi-task Training\nMulti-task learning has grown increasingly popular, en-\nabling models to achieve greater generalization by con-\ncurrently addressing multiple related tasks during training.\nInput\nAdd a pair of elegant earrings for her\nRemove the red tie\nMake her hair black\nAdd sunglasses\nReplace her clothes with suit\nInput\nRemove the cat\nRemove the dog\nHelp the cat and dog wear baseball caps\nVan gogh, sunflowers\nReplace the cat with little dog\nInput\nMake it a cute pig\nMake it a cute cat\nAdd a hat\nAdd beard on the hedgehog\nAdd glasses\nFigure 7.

The term \u201dSimple Instruction\u201d denotes coarse-grained instructions like \u201dsemantic segmentation\u201d\nor \u201dkeypoint detection\u201d. In contrast, our approach utilizes highly detailed and more flexible instructions. The training datasets include\nCOCO for keypoint detection and COCO-Stuff for semantic segmentation.\nMethod\nKeypoint Detection\nSemantic Segmentation\nCOCO\nHumanArt\nAP-10K\nCOCO-Stuff\nADE-847\nPC-459\nADE-150\nPC-59\nVOC\nSimple Instruction\n22.7\n7.0\n5.2\n41.28\n1.39\n3.96\n13.65\n18.49\n20.22\nOurs\n71.2\n51.4\n15.9\n53.17\n19.68\n28.29\n33.62\n59.00\n72.55\nThis approach often results in improved model generaliza-\ntion performance compared to specialized single-task train-\ning. To further provide empirical validation for this obser-\nvation, we experiment with our model when trained only on\nthe segmentation dataset and report the performance differ-\nence in Figure 8. This illustration compares the results of\nour single-task model and multi-task model evaluated over\nfour unseen test datasets. It is evident that our jointly trained\nmodel performs significantly better in open-domain testing\nscenarios compared to the specific models. Furthermore,\nwe observe that this benefit also extends to image editing.\nIn Figure 9, the visual comparison demonstrates that when\nintegrated with other tasks, the model can more effectively\ndiscern which objects require editing, potentially benefiting\nfrom the integration of referring segmentation.\nRefClef\nADE-847\nPC-459\nADE-150\nValidation Dataset\n10\n19\n28\n37\n46\n55\nEvaluation Metrics\n49.6\n19.7\n28.3\n33.6\n23.1\n15.1\n24.4\n29.7\nsingle-task training\nmulti-task training\nFigure 8.\nAblation study on multi-task training.\nWe evaluate\nour models on four unseen datasets, RefClef, ADE-847, PC-459,\nand ADE-150.

The Benefit of Human Alignment\nOur model undergoes a subsequent fine-tuning phase us-\ning a filtered dataset with human alignment. In this eval-\nuation, we examine its effectiveness and present the fine-\ntuning progress in Figure 10, which showcases the rela-\ntionship between CLIP-Sim performance and the number\nof epochs. Initially, the CLIP-Sim score stands at 29.6. Re-\nmarkably, we observe a noticeable enhancement in image-\ntext alignment, which increases from 29.6 to 29.9 over ap-\nproximately 10 epochs. It is important to highlight the sig-\nnificance of this improvement, particularly considering that\nthe dataset consists of only 1000 samples.\n4.9. Generalization Capability to Unseen Tasks\nWe demonstrate that our model exhibits a degree of Arti-\nficial General Intelligence (AGI) capabilities by leveraging\nthe wealth of tasks and diverse datasets through this highly\ndetailed instruction-following format. We validate its ca-\npacity to handle tasks that were not part of its training reper-\ntoire, including image detection, classification, and even in-\ntricate fine-grained tasks like face alignment in Figure 11.\nIn the context of detection and classification, we employ a\nprompt that resembles referring segmentation, enabling us\nto derive the bounding box coordinates by identifying the\ntop, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the marked re-\ngion. Moreover, we can also verify the class label using a\nversatile prompt structure. In the realm of face alignment,\ndolphin\ngirl\nvase\nwindow\nflower\nbook\nlaptop\nFigure 11. Adopt InstructDiffusion to unseen tasks, including de-\ntection, classification, and face alignment.\nour approach involves directly instructing our model to en-\ncircle the specific facial region of interest, such as the nose\nor right ear. Remarkably, we have found that this approach\nperforms admirably even when applied to animal faces. We\nargue that this underscores its versatility in adapting to new\nchallenges beyond its initial training scope.\n5. Discussion and conclusion\nIn conclusion, this paper presents InstructDiffusion, a\nnovel and unifying framework for aligning computer vision\ntasks with human instructions. InstructDiffusion treats all\ncomputer vision tasks as image generation, with a focus\non three types of output formats: 3-channel RGB images,\nbinary masks, and keypoints.\nWe demonstrated that our\napproach achieves good performance in individual tasks,\nand joint training of multiple tasks enhances the general-\nization ability. Remarkably, InstructDiffusion exhibits AGI\ncapabilities to some extent, handling tasks not seen dur-\ning training and outperforming previous methods on unseen\ndatasets. This research marks a significant step towards a\ngeneralist modeling interface for vision tasks and sets the\nstage for future advancements in the pursuit of artificial gen-\neral intelligence in computer vision.\nIn future work, we plan to focus on the following as-\npects to further improve the performance and capabilities\nof InstructDiffusion: 1) Improve the unified representation:\nWe aim to explore alternative encoding schemes and tech-\nniques to better represent a more diverse range of outputs\nassociated with various computer vision tasks. 2) Investi-\ngate the role of self-supervised and unsupervised learning:\nTo enhance the generalization ability of InstructDiffusion,\nwe will explore the use of self-supervised and unsupervised\nlearning techniques to leverage large-scale unlabeled data\nfor model training and adaptation.\nReferences\n[1] Abdelrahman Abdelhamed, Stephen Lin, and Michael S.\nBrown.\nA high-quality denoising dataset for smartphone\ncameras.

However, none of them addresses the ques-\ntion of adding such controllability to text-to-3D generation.\nIn response, we propose Text2Control3D, a controllable text-\nto-3D avatar generation method whose facial expression is\ncontrollable given a monocular video casually captured with\nhand-held camera. Our main strategy is to construct the 3D\navatar in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) optimized with a set\nof controlled viewpoint-aware images that we generate from\nControlNet, whose condition input is the depth map extracted\nfrom the input video. When generating the viewpoint-aware\nimages, we utilize cross-reference attention to inject well-\ncontrolled, referential facial expression and appearance via\ncross attention. We also conduct low-pass filtering of Gaus-\nsian latent of the diffusion model in order to ameliorate the\nviewpoint-agnostic texture problem we observed from our\nempirical analysis, where the viewpoint-aware images con-\ntain identical textures on identical pixel positions that are in-\ncomprehensible in 3D. Finally, to train NeRF with the images\nthat are viewpoint-aware yet are not strictly consistent in ge-\nometry, our approach considers per-image geometric varia-\ntion as a view of deformation from a shared 3D canonical\nspace. Consequently, we construct the 3D avatar in a canoni-\ncal space of deformable NeRF by learning a set of per-image\ndeformation via deformation field table. We demonstrate the\nempirical results and discuss the effectiveness of our method.\nIntroduction\nRecently, large text-to-image diffusion models (Ramesh\net al. 2022; Saharia et al. 2022; Rombach et al. 2021) have\nenabled visually-appealing image generation that faithfully\nreflects the semantics of conditional texts. Such works have\ngreatly impacted the generative models to be widely used for\nnon-expert users, as the models can generate high-quality\nimages of interest using text descriptions only. Moreover,\nControlNet (Zhang and Agrawala 2023) further extended\narXiv:2309.03550v1  [cs.CV]  7 Sep 2023\nthe utility of the models by proposing the method to add\ngeometric control such as canny edge, human pose, depth\nmap, and normal map for geometrically controlled text-\nconditional image generation.\nMeanwhile, Text-to-3D generation methods such as\nDreamFusion (Poole et al. 2022) have been proposed using\nNeural Radiance Fields (Mildenhall et al. 2020) as a 3D rep-\nresentation, and proved to yield promising quality of gener-\nation. However, no work has tackled the question of adding\ngeometric controllability to text-to-3D generation, despite\nits importance highlighted by ControlNet and its impact to\nthe research community.\nParallel to ControlNet extracting geometric control fac-\ntors from a source image for generative conditions, we pro-\npose a method to generate text-conditional 3D facial avatars\nconditioned with geometric control factors extracted from\na casually-captured monocular video of a face. As a pio-\nneering work, we focus on controllability in terms of the fa-\ncial expressions and shapes for 3D avatar generation, which\nare the key functionalities of an avatar to behave as a faith-\nful, virtual agent. Specifically, given a text description and a\ncasually-captured monocular video for conditional control,\nour method generates a 3D avatar that reflects the semantics\nof the text as well as facial expression and deformation of\nthe source face as in Fig. 1.\nOur main strategy comprises the following procedures.\nFirst, we generate a set of viewpoint-aware images of an\navatar, whose facial expressions and shapes are controlled\nusing geometry-conditional text-to-image diffusion model\nsuch as ControlNet. Then, the generated images are used to\nconstruct the avatar in NeRF. In doing so, we define three\nproblems raised and solved by our method, which as a whole\nyields the state-of-the-art 3D avatar generation quality and\ncontrollability compared to existing works.\nWhen leveraging ControlNet to generate viewpoint-aware\nimages, injecting constant appearance and desired facial ex-\npression across the images is one key objective for well-\ncontrolled avatar generation. To do so, we propose cross-\nreference attention, a zero-shot method for the diffusion\nmodel where viewpoint-aware image generations conduct a\ncross-attention to a shared, referential information of con-\ntrolled facial expression and appearance.\nAnother objective is to ameliorate the texture-sticking\nproblem, the phenomena where images generated with slight\nspatial variations of latent contain constant, spatial variation-\nagnostic textures (Karras et al. 2021). We observed that our\nviewpoint-aware images conditioned with slightly varying\ngeometric conditions also suffer from similar problem. Such\ndisrupts high-quality 3D avatar construction, as sticking tex-\ntures are not geometrically interpretable and becomes the\nkey factor of unwanted artifacts. In this work, we show\nthat the sticking textures are originated from high-frequency\ncomponents of the Gaussian latent. From the observation,\nwe propose a method to remove the sticking textures by\nfiltering high-frequency components of the Gaussian latent\nin Fourier domain, and re-injecting texture-sticking-free de-\ntails via cross-attention to full-frequency features.\nThe final objective of our method is to construct 3D avatar\ngiven the viewpoint-aware images that are not strictly con-\nsistent in geometry. Our insight is to interpret such inconsis-\ntencies as views of per-image deformations from a canonical\n3D model. Inspired by recent advancements in deformable\nNeRFs (Park et al. 2021a,b), we train deformation field ta-\nble, a set of per-image 3D deformation code, and construct\na shared, 3D canonical model as our final 3D avatar.\nIn summary, our work makes four major contributions:\n\u2022 From the best of our knowledge, Text2Control3D is the\nfirst controllable Text-to-3D avatar generation method.\n\u2022 We propose a zero-shot method of ControlNet that gener-\nates a set of viewpoint-aware avatar images with constant\nappearance and controlled facial expression.\n\u2022 We observe and ameliorate the texture-sticking problem\nin viewpoint-aware images generated from ControlNet.\n\u2022 We propose a method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D\navatar given a set of generated viewpoint-aware images.\nRelated Works\nNeural Radiance Fields\nFirst proposed by (Mildenhall\net al. 2020), Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is an implicit\nrepresentation of 3D space, which is an MLP that pre-\ndicts a color and density of 3D points. These are then\nrendered with volume rendering techniques and supervised\nwith dense set of posed images for optimization. Follow-\ning works include dynamic scene reconstruction with de-\nformable NeRF (Pumarola et al. 2021; Park et al. 2021a,b),\nor latent-conditional NeRF for generative 3D models using\nGANs (Chan et al. 2021, 2022; An et al. 2023).\nText-to-2D/3D Diffusion Models\nRecent advancements\nin text-to-image diffusion models such as DALL-E (Ramesh\net al. 2021), Imagen (Saharia et al. 2022), and Latent Diffu-\nsion Models (Rombach et al. 2021) have brought great ad-\nvancements in text-driven high-fidelity image generations.\nFollowing works such as GLIGEN (Li et al. 2023) or Con-\ntrolNet (Zhang and Agrawala 2023) propose a method to\ngenerate images that satisfy geometric conditions such as\ndepth, normal, or key-point maps.\nMeanwhile, a line of work in 3D generation leverages dis-\ntillation from large-scale text-to-image diffusion model to\n3D via per-text optimization in NeRF. Notably, Score Distil-\nlation Sampling (Poole et al. 2022) and their variants (Lin\net al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023) approximate the gradients\nof parameters of 3D representations with reverse diffusion\nguidance of large-scale text-to-image diffusion model. Other\nmethods include image-to-3D generation (Liu et al. 2023a,b;\nAnciukevi\u02c7cius et al. 2023), which can conduct text-to-3D\ngeneration given a text-to-image diffusion model, or diffu-\nsion models in 3D space (Shue et al. 2023; Luo and Hu\n2021), which require 3D assets for training data.\nProposed Method\nIn this section, we propose a pipeline to generate a 3D face\navatar given a text description ctext, (e.g. \u201dElon Musk\u201d, \u201dA\nhandsome white man with short-fade haircut\u201d), and frames\nof a monocular video I = {I1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 IL} for facial expression\nand shape control.\nLinear\nCross-reference\nAttention\nCross\nAttention\nFeed\nForward\n\u001f\u001e\n\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001c\u0018\n\u0017\u0016\u001a\nFast Fourier\nTransform\nLow-pass\nFilter\nInverse Fast\nFourier Transform\nDeformation Field\nTable\nLinear\nLinear\nFace Keypoint\nGeneration\nText-to-reference\nimage generation\nSchedauled \nGaussian noise\nbroadcast\n\u201cA photo of \nElon Musk\u201d\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001d\u0017\u0016\u0017\u001d\u0017\u0015\u0014\u0017\u0018\u0013\u001e\u0017\u0012\n\u001e\u0016\u0015\u001a\u0014\u0013\u0016\u0012\u001a\u0019\u0011\u0010\u001a\u000f\u001c\u001b\u0013\u001c\u001b\u0013\n\u000e\u000f\u0019\u001a\r\u0011\u0018\u0013\u0010\u0011\f\u0016\u0019\u0011\u000b\n\u0011\u0010\u0017\u001d\u000f\u0014\u001a\u000e\u001c\u001b\u001d\u0017\r\u0018\n\u0013\u001e\r\u0017\f\n\n\u001e\n\t\u0016\u0010\u001c\u001b\u000b\u001a\u0019\r\u0010\u001a\u000f\u001c\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001d\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0019\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0019\u0018\u001d\u0010\u001b\u0013\u001b\u001c\u0014\u0016\u000f\u0014\u0018\u0014\u001c\u001b\u001d\u0019\u000e\u0014\u0016\r\u0011\u0018\f\u0019\u001d\u0019\u0011\u0018\u000b\n\n\u000e\u001b\u001d\u001b\u001c\u0016\r\u0011\u0018\u000b\u001d\u001c\t\u001a\u001d\u0019\u0011\u0018\u0016\u0019\u0018\u0016\u0016\b\u0007\u0016\r\u001b\u0018\u0011\u0018\u0019\u001a\u001b\u0006\u0016\u0005\u0012\u001b\u001a\u0014\n\u0004\u0011\u0013\u0010\u0012\u001b\u000b\u000b\u0016\u0003\u0019\u0006\u001d\u0014\u001c\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\n\u0002\u0011\u001c\u0016\u0015\u0019\u0014\u0013\u0010\u001b\u0017\u0018\u0011\u000b\u001d\u0019\u001a\u0016\u0001\u0014\u001e\u001d\t\u001c\u0014\u0016\u007f\u0014\u0081\u0011\u000e\u001b\u0006\nDeformation \nField\nNeural Radiance\nField\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\n\u201cA photo of \nElon Musk\u201d\n\u007f\u0014\u0002\u0014\u001c\u0014\u0018\u001a\u0014\u0016\u008d\u0081\u001b\u0017\u0014\u0016\u000f\u0014\u0018\u0014\u001c\u001b\u001d\u0019\u0011\u0018\n\u0015\u0019\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0019\u0018\u001d\u0010\u001b\u0013\u001b\u001c\u0014\u0016\u000f\u0014\u0018\u0014\u001c\u001b\u001d\u0019\u0011\u0018\nFigure 2: Illustration of Text2Control3D, our controllable text-to-3D avatar generation method.\nTo do so, we first extract viewpoint-augmented depth\nmaps from a monocular video. Then, we use these depth\nmaps as conditions for generating viewpoint-aware avatar\nimages using ControlNet enhanced with (1) cross-reference\nattention to achieve controllability on facial expression and\nappearance across the viewpoint-aware generations, and\n(2) low-pass filtering of Gaussian latent to remove view-\nagnostic textures that break 3D consistency. Finally, we re-\ngard remaining inconsistencies in geometry as views of per-\nimage deformation of 3D canonical space. As so, we train\ndeformation field table that encodes per-view deformation\ncode to finally construct the 3D avatar in NeRF canonical\nspace. The summary is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nViewpoint-aware Generative Conditions\nFirst, we create a set of generative conditions from monocu-\nlar video frames. We use depth maps for these conditions, as\nwe empirically learned that they contain sufficient viewpoint\nknowledge while preserving reasonable amount of source\ngeometry information that do not collide with semantics of\ntext conditions. Instead of retrieving depth maps from input\nvideo frames, we use these frames to reconstruct the scene,\nfollowed by rendering depth maps from virtual cameras as\nmeans of augmenting to denser depth map construction.\nSpecifically, we first reconstruct the source face into 3D\nin NeRF (Mildenhall et al. 2020) using the input monocular\nvideo frames. That is, we find\n\u03b8\u2217\nsrc = argmin\n\u03b8src\nL\nX\nl=1\n||Il \u2212 g(\u03b8src; T src\nl\n)||2,\n(1)\nvia gradient-descent optimization, where \u03b8src is the param-\neter of NeRF MLP, g(\u00b7) is a volume rendering function\n(Mildenhall et al. 2020), T src\nl\n\u2208 T src is a camera param-\neter of a frame Il.\nUsing \u03b8\u2217\nsrc, we then render depth maps D = {D1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 DN}\non a set of augmented virtual cameras T = {T1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 TN} as\nDn = gd(\u03b8\u2217\nsrc; Tn),\n(2)\nwhere Dn \u2208 D, Tn \u2208 T , and gd is a volumetric depth ren-\ndering function, or a monocular depth estimation on corre-\nspondingly rendered images.\nViewpoint-aware Image Generation\nGiven our viewpoint-aware generative conditions D and\nctext, a vanilla method to generate viewpoint-aware images\nof an avatar X = {x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xN} using depth-conditional Con-\ntrolNet Gd would be\nxn = Gd(Dn, ctext, xn\nT ),\n(3)\nwhere xT \u223c N(0, 1) and xT \u2192 xn\nT for all n. However,\nwe make empirical analysis of Eq. (3) and learned that it\nyields sub-optimal quality for viewpoint-aware generation.\nAs so, we propose two methods, cross-reference attention\nand low-pass filtering of Gaussian latent, which are zero-\nshot methods to ControlNet.\nCross-reference Attention\nWe empirically learned and\nreported following qualitative results in the first column\nof Fig. 6-(a) that per-frame avatar image generation using\nEq. (3) has two undesirable properties for viewpoint-aware\navatar image generation. First, depth condition alone cannot\nreliably convey detailed facial expressions. Second, gener-\nated images conditioned with depth images of far-distanced\nvirtual cameras vary in their visual appearances, even though\nthey are generated from the same Gaussian latent.\nAs so, we propose cross-reference attention, a method that\ninduces reverse diffusion processes to attend to a shared in-\nformation of controlled facial expression and appearance.\nSpecifically, we first extract a desired face key-point from\nthe image of the source rendered at a virtual reference view.\nThen, we generate a reference image \u00afxr using the face key-\npoint, ctext and another key-point conditional ControlNet\nGkp. Formally,\nkr = K(g(\u03b8\u2217\nsrc; T r))\n(4)\n\u00afxr = Gkp(kr, ctext),\n(5)\nwhere T r \u2208 T is a virtual reference camera, and K(\u00b7) is a\nface key-point estimator.\nThen, we devise the feature maps in our viewpoint-aware\ngenerator Gd to attend to the reference image via cross at-\ntention as\nQn = MLPQ(hn\nt ),\n(6)\nKr, V r = MLPK,V (\u00afhr\nt),\n(7)\nwhere hn\nt is the feature map of xn\nt , and \u00afhr\nt is the feature\nmap of \u00afxr\nt \u223c N(\u221a\u00af\u03b1t\u00afxr, (1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t)I), the reference image\nnoised with scheduled step of t (Ho, Jain, and Abbeel 2020).\nEffectively, we may replace the self-attention modules to our\ncross-reference attention.\nAttention(Qn, Kr, V r) = softmax(Qn(Kr)T\n\u221ac\n)V r. (8)\nView-agnostic Texture Removal\nWe empirically found\nthat the generated images suffer from the texture-sticking\nproblem (Karras et al. 2021), the phenomena that the im-\nages share constant textures in image space despite of spa-\ntial variations in generative conditions, which we dub as\nview-agnostic texture in our work. Specifically, we gen-\nerated avatar images using vanilla ControlNet conditioned\nwith depth maps rendered from 13 adjacent virtual cameras,\nand averaged the images. Left side and right-side of Fig. 3-\n(a) are the averaged image and the image generated with the\ndepth map rendered from a virtual camera located at the cen-\nter of the 13 cameras. As can be seen, some textural details\nof the two images are identical, which is possible only when\nthe textures of the most generated images are located at an\nidentical position in image space. These eventually create\nundesirable artifacts when used to construct 3D avatars in\nlater sections. As so, we propose a method to remove such\nview-agnostic textures while preserving most high-fidelity\ndetails, as seen in Fig. 3-(b).\nWe learned that high-frequency components in the Gaus-\nsian latent xT is the key factor that generates such textures.\nAs so, we first remove the high-frequency components of the\nGaussian latent in Fourier domain as\n\u02c6xn\nT = f \u22121(P(f(xn\nT ), b)),\n(9)\nwhere f and f \u22121 are Fast Fourier Transform and Inverse\nFast Fourier transform (Brigham 1988), respectively, P is\na low-pass filter that removes the frequency components\nhigher than b, a cut-off frequency.\nThen, high-fidelity details are re-injected via cross-\nattention to full-frequency features as\nQn = MLPq(\u02c6hn\nt ),\n(10)\nKn, V n = MLPK,V (hn\nt ),\n(11)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3: (a) Empirical analysis of the texture-sticking prob-\nlem observed from images generated with ControlNet condi-\ntioned with depth rendered from adjacent cameras. (b) Our\nmethod ameliorates the problem by removing the sticking\ntextures while preserving most high-fidelity details.\nwhere \u02c6hn\nt is the feature map of \u02c6xn\nt . In this case, hn\nt is the fea-\nture map of xn\nt that goes through an independent reverse dif-\nfusion process from xT in parallel. Design choice of cross-\nattention to full-frequency features instead of self-attention\nwill be discussed in ablation study.\nFinally, we merge both cross-reference attention and\nview-agnostic texture removal into a single attention\npipeline by replacing hn\nt in Eq. (11) with \u00afhr\nt as\nQn = MLPq(\u02c6hn\nt ),\n(12)\nKr, V r = MLPK,V (\u00afhr\nt).\n(13)\nFormally, Eq. (3) is reformulated to define our final\nviewpoint-aware image generator as\nxn = G\u2217\nd(Dn, Dr, ctext, \u02c6xn\nT , \u00afxr),\n(14)\nwhere G\u2217\nd replaces self-attention with our cross-reference at-\ntention that comprises Eq. (12), Eq. (13), and Eq. (8), and\nDr is depth map rendered from a virtual reference camera\nusing \u03b8\u2217\ning \u00afhr src, which is used as a depth condition for calculat-\nt. In addition, cross-reference attention is conducted on\ntime-steps larger than tthres to regularize facial expression\nand appearances on earlier stages, whereas self-attention re-\nplaces the cross-reference attention on later stages to con-\ncentrate on viewpoint-specific generations.\n3D Avatar Construction in Canonical Space\nUsing X, a set of generated viewpoint-aware avatar images,\nwe now reconstruct a 3D avatar model in NeRF. Since the\ngenerated images are not strictly consistent in geometry, di-\nrect reconstruction may yield broken results and unwanted\nartifacts. Instead, we assume that all images share a single\n3D canonical model, and regard per-image geometric incon-\nsistency as a view of a deformed canonical model.\nSpecifically, we first define learnable deformation field ta-\nble, W = {w1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wN}, where wn \u2208 W is assigned to each\nvirtual view. Then, we define a canonical 3D model parame-\nter \u0398 = {\u03b8d, \u03b8c}, where each deformation code wn learns to\nproject a point in observation space x to the shared canonical\nspace, after which a shared MLP predicts the view-direction\ndependent color and density of the point as\nx\u2032 = F(x; \u03b8d, wn),\n(15)\n(c, \u03c3) = F \u2032(x\u2032, d; \u03b8c),\n(16)\n\u201cBrad Pitt\u201d\n\u201cWill Smith\u201d\n\u201cA young asian \nman with bags\nunder eyes\u201d\n\u201cA black man\nwith mustache and \narched eyebrows\u201d\nFigure 4: Visualization of 3D avatars generated with our method.\nwhere F and F \u2032 are MLP forward functions, and d is a view\ndirection in observation space. We optimize \u0398 and W to\nminimize the difference between the generated avatar im-\nages X and images rendered from our deformed canonical\nspace. Also, we do not reconstruct backgrounds in gener-\nated images, as they are not viewpoint-aware and are irrele-\nvant to avatar reconstruction. As so, we use off-the-shelf face\nsegmentation network to generate a set of per-image mask\nMn \u2208 M = {M1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 MN}, and apply sparsity loss, which\nencourages the point samples of camera rays projected to\nbackground region to yield low density, thus emptying the\ncorresponding space.\nAlso, we learned that the canonical NeRF occasionally\nconverges to semi-transparent object density in order to\nexplain the geometric inconsistencies between viewpoint-\naware images As so, we apply entropy loss (Kim, Seo,\nand Han 2022), which maximizes the Shannon entropy\n(Shannon 1948) of the density distribution of a ray pro-\njected to foreground. Such prior encourages the object\nto maximize the density closer to the object surface and\nto suppress the density farther from the object surface,\nthus discouraging semi-transparent surfaces of 3D canonical\navatar. In summary, we minimize the following loss for 3D\navatar reconstruction, LNeRF = \u03bbRGBLRGB + \u03bbspLsp +\n\u03bbentropyLentropy, where\nLRGB =\nX\nn\n||Mn \u2297 (xn \u2212 g(\u0398, wn; Tn))||2,\n(17)\nLsp = 1\nJ\nX\nn,j,h,w\n|1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03c3j)| \u00b7 (1 \u2212 m(h,w)\nn\n),\n(18)\nLentropy = \u2212\nX\nn,j,h,w\np(\u03b1j)logp(\u03b1j) \u00b7 m(h,w)\nn\n,\n(19)\nwhere m(h,w)\nn\nis a binary value of Mn located at (h, w) pixel\nlocation, {\u03c3j}J\nj=1 are density values evaluated from points\nText2Control3D\n(ours)\nInstruct\nNeRF-to-NeRF\nDreamFusion\nFigure 5: Qualitative comparisons to baselines.

For text conditions, we created two sets of text prompts,\neach containing 23 number of texts: one is a set of names\nof celebrities, and the other is a set of descriptions of facial\nattributes.\nImplementation Details\nWe generate view-point aware\nimages in 512\u00d7512 resolution. ControlNet conducts reverse\ndiffusion process in latent space defined by pre-trained auto-\nencoder (Rombach et al. 2021), making spatial dimension of\nFourier spectrum to be 64 \u00d7 64, which is the latent space\nresolution. We use b = 22 for attribute description texts,\nand b = 18 for celebrity name texts for low-pass filtering\nin Fourier space. Algorithmically, low-pass filter P replaces\nthe values in Fourier spectrum outside the (2 \u00b7 b) \u00d7 (2 \u00b7 b)\nbox located at the spectrum center with 0. For reverse dif-\nfusion process of ControlNet, we used DDIM (Song, Meng,\nand Ermon 2020) with 50 steps, and tthres = 45 for cross-\nreference attention. For canonical 3D avatar reconstruction,\nwe used \u03bbRGB = 1, \u03bbsp = 1 \u00d7 10\u22123, and \u03bbsp = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126.\nBaselines\nSince no work tackles the controllable text-to-\n3D generation from the best of our knowledge, we make\nqualitative comparisons to DreamFusion (Poole et al. 2022),\na text-to-3D generation model, and Instruct-NeRF2NeRF\n(Haque et al. 2023), a NeRF to NeRF translation method us-\ning InstructPix2Pix.

All\nimages are rendered from novel camera views.\nResults and Discussion\nQualitative Results\nWe report the qualitative results of\nour method in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4. The generated 3D avatars\nfaithfully reflects the semantics of the text descriptions, fa-\ncial expression and the coarse shape of the face in the source\nmonocular video. In addition, despite that contour of the\nsource face remains in the avatars, their unique geometries\nimply that ControlNet can flexibly handle the depth map\nconditions to generate images with novel shapes while pre-\nserving the viewpoint-aware information implicitly encoded\nin depth conditions.\nComparison to Baselines\nThe following qualitative com-\nparisons are reported in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the 3D\navatars generated from our method shows the highest fi-\ndelity and controllability of facial expressions. Since there is\nno ground truth images to measure PSNR (Mildenhall et al.\n2020) or 3D shape to measure Chamfer Distance (Park et al.\n2019), we heavily rely on human evaluations for compar-\nisons. Specifically, we asked evaluators to score the quality\nof results in three criteria: visual fidelity in terms of the over-\nall shape, texture, and color of the faces, text reflectivity in\nterms of how well the generated avatar is faithful to seman-\ntics of the text conditions, and structural reflectivity in terms\nof how well the generated avatar is faithful to facial expres-\nsion conditions. We report the average of the responses in\nTable. 1. As can be seen, results from our methods were pre-\nferred by those from baselines in all criteria.\nFollowing prior text-to-3D generation works (Poole et al.\n2022), we also computed R-Precision in CLIP ViT-L/14 la-\ntent space.

With-\nout cross-attention to a reference image as in (a), (b) and\n(c), viewpoint-aware images are not coherent in appearance\nand facial identity, which forces the NeRF model to over-\nfit to varying appearances via view-dependence of the MLP\nnetwork. Also, inconsistent facial expressions in viewpoint-\naware images in (a), (b), and (c) induce NeRF to recon-\nstruct an under-controlled shape. For example in Fig. 6-(a-c),\nmouths are observed to be closed from the upper view, but\nare in fact slightly opened when observed from lower views.\n1https://github.com/ronghuaiyang/arcface-pytorch\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 6: Ablation results.

For instance, ControlNet often fails to generate\nreference images with facial expressions that are relatively\nless common in in-the-wild training images such as closed,\nwinked, frowning eyes. Thus, improvements in controllabil-\nity of ControlNet via future research can bring parallel im-\nprovements to our pipeline in terms of the scope of facial\nexpressions for controlled avatar generation.\nConclusion\nWe have presented Text2Control3D, the first work to address\na controllable text-to-3D avatar generation using text-to-\nimage diffusion model from the best of our knowledge. Our\nwork makes three major contributions: cross-frame attention\nfor viewpoint-aware image generation with controlled fa-\ncial expression and appearance, low-pass filtering Gaussian\nlatent that ameliorates texture-sticking problem in condi-\ntional text-to-image generation, and employing deformable\nNeRF to reconstruct a 3D avatar using viewpoint-aware yet\ngeometrically inconsistent images. Text2Control3D outper-\nformed the baselines in user-study and quantitative compar-\nisons.\nReferences\nAn, S.; Xu, H.; Shi, Y.; Song, G.; Ogras, U. Y.; and Luo, L.\n2023.

Using pretrained large-scale 2D\ndiffusion models, recent work Zero123 [40] demonstrates\nthe ability to generate plausible novel views from a single-\nview image of an object. However, maintaining consistency\nin geometry and colors for the generated images remains a\nchallenge. To address this issue, we propose a synchronized\nmultiview diffusion model that models the joint probabil-\nity distribution of multiview images, enabling the genera-\ntion of multiview-consistent images in a single reverse pro-\ncess. SyncDreamer synchronizes the intermediate states of\nall the generated images at every step of the reverse process\nthrough a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism that cor-\nrelates the corresponding features across different views.\nExperiments show that SyncDreamer generates images with\nhigh consistency across different views, thus making it well-\nsuited for various 3D generation tasks such as novel-view-\nsynthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D.\n1. Introduction\nHumans possess a remarkable ability to perceive 3D\nstructures from a single image. When presented with an im-\nage of an object, humans can easily imagine the other views\nof the object. Despite great progress [44, 69, 74, 81, 83]\nbrought by neural networks in computer vision or graphics\nfields for extracting 3D information from images, generat-\ning novel view images with multiview consistency from a\nsingle-view image of an object is still a challenging problem\ndue to the limited 3D information available in an image.\nRecently, diffusion models [28, 54] have demonstrated\nhuge success in 2D image generation, which unlocks new\npotential for 3D generation tasks. However, directly train-\ning a generalizable 3D diffusion model [30, 45, 46, 75]\nusually requires a large amount of 3D data while exist-\ning 3D datasets are insufficient for capture the complexity\nof arbitrary 3D shapes. Therefore, recent methods [8, 38,\n49, 73, 77] resort to distilling pretrained text-to-image dif-\nfusion models for creating 3D models from texts, which\nshows impressive results on this text-to-3D task.\nSome\nworks [43, 52, 66, 82] extend such a distillation process to\ntrain a neural radiance field [44] (NeRF) for the image-to-\n3D task. In order to utilize pretrained text-to-image models,\nthese methods have to perform textual inversion [21] to find\na suitable text description of the input image. However, the\ndistillation process along with the textual inversion usually\ntakes a long time to generate a single shape and requires te-\ndious parameter tuning for satisfactory quality. Moreover,\ndue to the abundance of specific details in an image, such as\nobject category, appearance, and pose, it is challenging to\naccurately represent an image using a single word embed-\nding, which results in a decrease in the quality of 3D shapes\nreconstructed by the distillation method.\nInstead of distillation, some recent works [5, 14, 25, 70,\n72, 78, 80, 86, 89, 91] apply 2D diffusion models to di-\nrectly generate multiview images for the 3D reconstruction\ntask. The key problem is how to maintain the multiview\nconsistency when generating images of the same object. To\nimprove the multiview consistency, these methods allow the\ndiffusion model to condition on the input, previously gener-\nated images [40, 72, 78, 86, 91] or renderings from a neu-\nral field [5, 25, 70]. Although some impressive results are\nachieved for specific object categories from ShapeNet [6]\nor Co3D [53], how to design a diffusion model to gener-\nate multiview-consistent images for arbitrary objects still\nremains unsolved.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple yet effective frame-\nwork to generate multiview-consistent images for the\nsingle-view 3D reconstruction of arbitrary objects. The key\nidea is to extend the diffusion framework [28] to model the\njoint probability distribution of multiview images. We show\nthat modeling the joint distribution can be achieved by intro-\nducing a synchronized multiview diffusion model. Specif-\nically, for N target views to be generated, we construct N\nshared noise predictors respectively. The reverse diffusion\nprocess simultaneously generates N images by N corre-\nsponding noise predictors, where information across differ-\nent images is shared among noise predictors by attention\nlayers on every denoising step. Thus, we name our frame-\nwork SyncDreamer which synchronizes intermediate states\nof all noise predictors on every step in the reverse process.\nSyncDreamer has the following characteristics that make\nit a competitive tool for lifting 2D single-view images\nto 3D. First, SyncDreamer retains strong generalization\nability by initializing its weights from the pretrained\nZero123 [40] model which is finetuned from the Stable Dif-\nfusion model [54] on the Objaverse [13] dataset.\nThus,\nSyncDreamer is able to reconstruct shapes from both pho-\ntorealistic images and hand drawings as shown in Fig. 1.\nSecond, SyncDreamer makes the single-view reconstruc-\ntion easier than the distillation methods. Because the gen-\nerated images are consistent in both geometry and appear-\nance, we can simply run a vanilla NeRF [44] or a vanilla\nNeuS [74] without using any special losses for reconstruc-\ntion. Given the generated images, one can easily reckon\nthe final reconstruction quality while it is hard for distilla-\ntion methods to know the output reconstruction quality be-\nforehand. Third, SyncDreamer maintains creativity and di-\nversity when inferring 3D information, which enables gen-\nerating multiple reasonable objects from a given image as\nshown in Fig. 5. In comparison, previous distillation meth-\nods can only converge to one single shape.\nWe quantitatively compare SyncDreamer with baseline\n2\nmethods on the Google Scanned Object [16] dataset. The\nresults show that, in comparison with baseline methods,\nSyncDreamer is able to generate more consistent images\nand reconstruct better shapes from input single-view im-\nages. We further demonstrate that SyncDreamer supports\nvarious styles of 2D input like cartoons, sketches, ink paint-\nings, and oil paintings for generating consistent views and\nreconstructing 3D shapes, which verifies the effectiveness\nof SyncDreamer in lifting 2D images to 3D shapes.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Diffusion models\nDiffusion models [11, 28, 54] have shown impressive re-\nsults on 2D image generation. Concurrent work MVDiffu-\nsion [67] also adopts the multiview diffusion formulation\nto synthesize textures or panoramas with known geome-\ntry. We propose similar formulations in SyncDreamer but\nwith unknown geometry. MultiDiffusion [3] and SyncDif-\nfusion [35] correlate multiple diffusion models for different\nregions of a 2D image. Many recent works [1, 7, 10, 17,\n23, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, 42, 45, 46, 48, 75, 87, 88] try to re-\npeat the success of diffusion models on the 3D generation\ntask. However, the scarcity of 3D data makes it difficult\nto directly train diffusion models on 3D and the resulting\ngeneration quality is still much worse and less generaliz-\nable than the counterpart image generation models, though\nsome works [1, 7, 32] are trying to only use 2D images for\ntraining 3D diffusion models.\n2.2. Using 2D diffusion models for 3D\nInstead of directly learning a 3D diffusion model, many\nworks resort to using high-quality 2D diffusion models [54,\n55] for 3D tasks.\nPioneer works DreamFusion [49] and\nSJC [73] propose to distill a 2D text-to-image genera-\ntion model to generate 3D shapes from texts. Follow-up\nworks [2, 8, 9, 29, 38, 59, 60, 71, 77, 79, 85, 92] im-\nprove such text-to-3D distillation methods in various as-\npects. Many works [43, 50, 52, 61, 66, 82] also apply such\na distillation pipeline in the single-view reconstruction task.\nThough some impressive results are achieved, these meth-\nods usually require a long time for textual inversion [39]\nand NeRF optimization and they do not guarantee to get\nsatisfactory results.\nOther works [5, 14, 25, 36, 41, 65, 67, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84,\n86, 91] directly apply the 2D diffusion models to generate\nmultiview images for 3D reconstruction. [72, 86] are condi-\ntioned on the input image by attention layers for novel-view\nsynthesis in indoor scenes. Our method also uses attention\nlayers but is intended for object reconstruction. [80, 89] re-\nsort to estimated depth maps to warp and inpaint for novel-\nview image generation, which strongly relies on the per-\nformance of the external single-view depth estimator. Two\nInput \nview\nGenerated views\nFixed viewpoints\nFigure 2. Given an input view of an object, SyncDreamer gener-\nates multiview-consistent images on fixed viewpoints.\nconcurrent works [5, 70] generate new images in an autore-\ngressive render-and-generate manner, which demonstrates\ngood performances on specific object categories or scenes.\nIn comparison, SyncDreamer is targeted to reconstruct ar-\nbitrary objects and generates all images in one reverse pro-\ncess. The concurrent work Viewset Diffusion [65] shares a\nsimilar idea to generate a set of images. The differences be-\ntween SyncDreamer and Viewset Diffusion are that Sync-\nDreamer does not require predicting a radiance field like\nViewset Diffusion but only uses attention to synchronize the\nstates among views and SyncDreamer fixes the viewpoints\nof generated views for better training convergence.\n2.3. Other single-view reconstruction methods\nSingle-view reconstruction is a challenging ill-posed\nproblem. Before the prosperity of generative models used in\n3D reconstruction, there are many works [19, 20, 33, 37, 68]\nthat reconstruct 3D shapes from single-view images by re-\ngression [37] or retrieval [68], which have difficulty in gen-\neralizing to real data or new categories. Recent NeRF-GAN\nmethods [4, 15, 22, 24, 47, 58] learn to generate NeRFs for\nspecific categories like human or cat faces. These NeRF-\nGANs achieve impressive results on single-view image re-\nconstruction but fail to generalize to arbitrary objects. Al-\nthough some recent works also attempt to generalize NeRF-\nGAN to ImageNet [56, 62], training NeRF-GANs for arbi-\ntrary objects is still challenging.\n3. Method\nGiven an input view y of an object, our target is to gen-\nerate multiview images of the object. We assume that the\nobject is located at the origin and is normalized inside a\ncube of length 1. The target images are generated on N\nfixed viewpoints looking at the object with azimuths evenly\nranging from 0\u25e6 to 360\u25e6 and elevations of 30\u25e6, as shown in\nFig. 2. To improve the multiview consistency of generated\n3\nimages, we formulate this generation process as a multiview\ndiffusion model to correlate the generation of each image.\nIn the following, we begin with a review of diffusion mod-\nels [28, 63].\n3.1. Diffusion\nDiffusion models [28, 63] aim to learn a probability\nmodel p\u03b8(x0) =\nR\np\u03b8(x0:T )dx1:T where x0 is the data and\nx1:T := x1, ..., xT are latent variables. The joint distribu-\ntion is characterized by a Markov Chain (reverse process)\np\u03b8(x0:T ) = p(xT )\nT\nY\nt=1\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt),\n(1)\nwhere p(xT )\n=\nN(xT ; 0, I) and p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt)\n=\nN(xt\u22121; \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03c32\nt I).\n\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) is a trainable compo-\nnent while the variance \u03c32\nt is untrained time-dependent con-\nstants [28]. The target is to learn the \u00b5\u03b8 for the generation.\nTo learn \u00b5\u03b8, a Markov chain called forward process is con-\nstructed as\nq(x1:T |x0) =\nT\nY\nt=1\nq(xt|xt\u22121),\n(2)\nwhere q(xt|xt\u22121) = N(xt; \u221a1 \u2212 \u03b2txt\u22121, \u03b2tI) and \u03b2t are\nall constants. DDPM [28] shows that by defining\n\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0012\nxt \u2212\n\u03b2t\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\n\u0013\n,\n(3)\nwhere \u03b1t and \u00af\u03b1t are constants derived from \u03b2t and \u03f5\u03b8 is a\nnoise predictor, we can learn \u03f5\u03b8 by\n\u2113 = Et,x0,\u03f5\n\u0002\n\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(\u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0 +\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5, t)\u22252\n\u0003\n,\n(4)\nwhere \u03f5 is a random variable sampled from N(0, I).\n3.2. Multiview diffusion\nApplying the vanilla DDPM model to generate novel-\nview images separately would lead to difficulty in maintain-\ning multiview consistency across different views. To ad-\ndress this problem, we formulate the generation process as\na multiview diffusion model that correlates the generation\nof each view. Let us denote the N images that we want to\ngenerate on the predefined viewpoints as {x(1)\n0 , ..., x(N)\n0\n}\nwhere suffix 0 means the time step 0. We want to learn\nthe joint distribution of all these views p\u03b8(x(1:N)\n0\n|y) :=\np\u03b8(x(1)\n0 , ..., x(N)\n0\n|y). In the following discussion, all the\nprobability functions are conditioned on the input view y\nso we omit y for simplicity.\nThe forward process of the multiview diffusion model\nis a direct extension of the vanilla DDPM in Eq. 2, where\nnoises are added to every view independently by\nq(x(1:N)\n1:T\n|x(1:N)\n0\n) =\nT\nY\nt=1\nq(x(1:N)\nt\n|x(1:N)\nt\u22121 )\n=\nT\nY\nt=1\nN\nY\nn=1\nq(x(n)\nt\n|x(n)\nt\u22121),\n(5)\nwhere q(x(n)\nt\n|x(n)\nt\u22121) = N(x(n)\nt\n; \u221a1 \u2212 \u03b2tx(n)\nt\u22121, \u03b2tI). Simi-\nlarly, following Eq. 1, the reverse process is constructed as\np\u03b8(x(1:N)\n0:T\n) = p(x(1:N)\nT\n)\nT\nY\nt=1\np\u03b8(x(1:N)\nt\u22121 |x(1:N)\nt\n)\n= p(x(1:N)\nT\n)\nT\nY\nt=1\nN\nY\nn=1\np\u03b8(x(n)\nt\u22121|x(1:N)\nt\n),\n(6)\nwhere p\u03b8(x(n)\nt\u22121|x(1:N)\nt\n) = N(x(n)\nt\u22121; \u00b5(n)\n\u03b8 (x(1:N)\nt\n, t), \u03c32\nt I).\nNote that the second equation in Eq. 6 holds because we as-\nsume a diagonal variance matrix. However, the mean \u00b5(n)\n\u03b8\nof n-th view x(n)\nt\u22121 depends on the states of all the views\nx(1:N)\nt\n. Similar to Eq. 3, we define \u00b5(n)\n\u03b8\nand the training\nloss by\n\u00b5(n)\n\u03b8 (x(1:N)\nt\n, t) =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0012\nx(n)\nt\n\u2212\n\u03b2t\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5(n)\n\u03b8 (x(1:N)\nt\n, t)\n\u0013\n.\n(7)\n\u2113 = Et,x(1:N)\n0\n,n,\u03f5(1:N)\nh\n\u2225\u03f5(n) \u2212 \u03f5(n)\n\u03b8 (x(1:N)\nt\n, t)\u22252\ni\n,\n(8)\nwhere \u03f5(1:N) is the standard Gaussian noise of size N \u00d7H\u00d7\nW added to all N views, \u03f5(n) is the noise added to the n-th\nview, and \u03f5(n)\n\u03b8\nis the noise predictor on the n-th view.\nTraining procedure. In one training step, we first ob-\ntain N images x(1:N)\n0\nof the same object from the dataset.\nThen, we sample a timestep t and the noise \u03f5(1:N) which is\nadded to all the images x(1:N)\n0\nto obtain x(1:N)\nt\n. After that,\nwe randomly select a view n and apply the corresponding\nnoise predictor \u03f5(n)\n\u03b8\non the selected view to predict the noise.\nFinally, the L2 distance between the sampled noise \u03f5(n) and\nthe predicted noise is computed as the loss for the training.\nSynchronized N-view noise predictor. The proposed\nmultiview diffusion model can be regarded as N synchro-\nnized noise predictors {\u03f5(n)\n\u03b8 |n = 1, ..., N}. On each time\nstep t, each noise predictor \u03f5(n) is in charge of predicting\nnoise on its corresponding view x(n)\nt\nto get x(n)\nt\u22121. Mean-\nwhile, these noise predictors are synchronized because, on\nevery denoising step, every noise predictor exchanges in-\nformation with each other by correlating the states x(1:N)\nt\nof all the other views. In practical implementation, we use\na shared UNet for all N noise predictors and put the view-\npoint difference between the input view and the n-th target\n4\nSpatial volume \n(\ud835\udc39, \ud835\udc49, \ud835\udc49, \ud835\udc49)\nTarget views \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc61\n(1:\ud835\udc41)\nTarget view \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc61\n(\ud835\udc5b)\nTarget view \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc61\u22121\n(\ud835\udc5b)\n3D CNN\nView frustum volume \n(\ud835\udc39, \ud835\udc37, \ud835\udc3b, \ud835\udc4a)\nInput view y\n+\u2206\ud835\udc2f(\ud835\udc5b)\nUnproject\nfeatures\nInterpolate\nCLIP\nText attention\nDepth-wise \nattention\nUNet\nSyncDreamer\nModules\nPretrained  \nZero-123\nSynchronized Multiview Noise Predictor\nConcat\nFigure 3.

Then, we construct a view frustum feature volume for x(n)\nt\nby interpolating\nthe features of spatial feature volume. The input view y, current target view x(n)\nt\nand viewpoint difference \u2206v(n) are fed into the backbone\nUNet initialized from Zero123 [40]. On the intermediate feature maps of the UNet, new depth-wise attention layers are applied to extract\nfeatures from the view frustum feature volume. Finally, the output of the UNet is used to denoise x(n)\nt\nto obtain x(n)\nt\u22121.\nview \u2206v(n), and the states x(1:N)\nt\nof all views as condi-\ntions to this shared noise predictor, i.e., \u03f5(n)\n\u03b8 (x(1:N)\nt\n, t) =\n\u03f5\u03b8(x(n)\nt\n; t, \u2206v(n), x(1:N)\nt\n).\n3.3. 3D-aware feature attention for denoising\nIn this section, we discuss how to implement the syn-\nchronized noise predictor \u03f5\u03b8(x(n)\nt\n; t, \u2206v(n), x(1:N)\nt\n, y) by\ncorrelating the multiview features using a 3D-aware atten-\ntion scheme. The overview is shown in Fig. 3.\nBackbone UNet. Similar to previous works [28, 54],\nour noise predictor \u03f5\u03b8 contains a UNet which takes a noisy\nimage as input and then denoises the image. To ensure the\ngeneralization ability, we initialize the UNet from the pre-\ntrained weights of Zero123 [40] given that it is based on Sta-\nble Diffusion [54] which has seen billions of images and can\ngeneralize to images of various domains. Zero123 concate-\nnates the input view with the noisy target view as the input\nto UNet. Then, to encode the viewpoint difference \u2206v(n) in\nUNet, Zero123 reuses the text attention layers of Stable Dif-\nfusion to process the concatenation of \u2206v(n) and the CLIP\nfeature [51] of the input image. We follow the same design\nas Zero123 and empirically freeze the UNet and the text at-\ntention layers when training SyncDreamer. Experiments to\nverify these choices are presented in Sec. 4.6.\n3D-aware feature attention. The remaining problem\nis how to correlate the states x(1:N)\nt\nof all the target views\nfor the denoising of the current noisy target view x(n)\nt\n. To\nenforce consistency among multiple generated views, it is\ndesirable for the network to perceive the corresponding fea-\ntures in 3D space when generating the current image. To\nachieve this, we first construct a 3D volume with V 3 ver-\ntices and then project the vertices onto all the target views\nto obtain the features. The features from each target view\nare concatenated to form a spatial feature volume. Next,\na 3D CNN is applied to the feature volume to capture and\nprocess spatial relationships. In order to denoise n-th target\nview, we construct a view frustum that is pixel-wise aligned\nwith this view, whose features are obtained by interpolating\nthe features from the spatial volume. Finally, on every in-\ntermediate feature map of the current view in the UNet, we\napply a new depth-wise attention layer to extract features\nfrom the pixel-wise aligned view-frustum feature volume\nalong the depth dimension.\nDiscussion. There are two primary design considera-\ntions in this 3D-aware feature attention UNet. First, the spa-\ntial volume is constructed from all the target views and all\nthe target views share the same spatial volume for denois-\ning, which implies a global constraint that all target views\nare looking at the same object. Second, the added new at-\ntention layers only conduct attention along the depth dimen-\nsion, which enforces a local epipolar line constraint that the\nfeature for a specific location should be consistent with the\ncorresponding features on the epipolar lines of other views.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Implementation details\nWe train SyncDreamer on the Objaverse [13] dataset\nwhich contains about 800k objects. We set the viewpoint\n5\nInput View\nOurs\nZero123 [40]\nRealFusion [43]\nFigure 4.

Different plausible instances generated by SyncDreamer from the same input image.\nnumber N = 16. The elevation of the target views is set\nto 30\u25e6 and the azimuth evenly distributes in [0\u25e6, 360\u25e6]. Be-\nsides these target views, we also render 16 random views\nas input views on each object for training, which have the\nsame azimuths but random elevations. We always assume\nthat the azimuth of both the input view and the first target\nview is 0\u25e6. We train the SyncDreamer for 80k steps (\u223c4\ndays) with 8 40G A100 GPUs using a total batch size of\n192. The learning rate is annealed from 5e-4 to 1e-5. Since\nwe need an elevation of the input view to compute the view-\npoint difference \u2206v(n), we use the rendering elevation in\ntraining while we roughly estimate an elevation angle as in-\nput in inference. To obtain surface meshes, we predict the\nforeground masks of the generated images using CarveKit.\nhttps://github.com/OPHoperHPO/image-background-remove-tool\nMethod\nPSNR\u2191\nSSIM\u2191\nLPIPS\u2193\n#Points\u2191\nRealfusion [43]\n15.26\n0.722\n0.283\n4010\nZero123 [40]\n18.93\n0.779\n0.166\n95\nOurs\n20.05\n0.798\n0.146\n1123\nTable 1.\nThe quantitative comparison in novel view synthesis.\nWe report PSNR, SSIM [76], LPIPS [90] and reconstructed point\nnumber by COLMAP [57] on the GSO [16] dataset.\nThen, we train the vanilla NeuS [74] for 2k steps to recon-\nstruct the shape, which costs about 10 mins.\n4.2.

To demonstrate the generalization ability to arbi-\ntrary objects, we randomly chose 30 objects ranging from\ndaily objects to animals. For each object, we render an im-\nage with a size of 256\u00d7256 as the input view. We addition-\nally evaluate some images collected from the Internet and\nthe Wiki of Genshin Impact.\nBaselines.\nWe adopt Zero123 [40], RealFusion [43],\nMagic123 [50], One-2-3-45 [39], Point-E [46] and Shap-\nE [30] as baseline methods. Given an input image of an\nobject, Zero123 [40] is able to generate novel-view im-\nages of the same object from different viewpoints. Zero123\ncan also be incorporated with the SDS loss [49] for 3D re-\nconstruction. We adopt the implementation of ThreeStu-\ndio [26] for reconstruction with Zero123, which includes\nmany optimization strategies to achieve better reconstruc-\ntion quality than the original Zero123 implementation. Re-\nalFusion [43] is based on Stable Diffusion [54] and the\nSDS loss for single-view reconstruction. Magic123 [50]\ncombines Zero123 [40] with RealFusion [43] to further im-\nprove the reconstruction quality. One-2-3-45 [39] directly\nregresses SDFs from the output images of Zero123 and we\nuse the official hugging face online demo [18] to produce\nthe results. Point-E [46] and Shap-E [30] are 3D genera-\ntive models trained on a large internal OpenAI 3D dataset,\nboth of which are able to convert a single-view image into\na point cloud or a shape encoded in an MLP. For Point-E,\nwe convert the generated point clouds to SDFs for shape\nreconstruction using the official models.\nMetrics.\nWe mainly focus on two tasks, novel view\nsynthesis (NVS) and single view 3D reconstruction (SVR).\nOn the NVS task, we adopt the commonly used metrics,\ni.e., PSNR, SSIM [76] and LPIPS [90]. To further demon-\nstrate the multiview consistency of the generated images,\nwe also run the MVS algorithm COLMAP [57] on the gen-\nerated images and report the reconstructed point number.\nBecause MVS algorithms rely on multiview consistency to\nfind correspondences to reconstruct 3D points, more consis-\ntent images would lead to more reconstructed points. On the\nSVR task, we report the commonly used Chamfer Distances\n(CD) and Volume IoU between ground-truth shapes and re-\nconstructed shapes. Since the shapes generated by Point-\n7\nInput text\nText to image\nGenerated images\nMesh\nFigure 7. Examples of using SyncDreamer to generate 3D models from texts.\nE [46] and Shap-E [30] are defined in a different canon-\nical coordinate system, we manually align the generated\nshapes of these two methods to the ground-truth shapes be-\nfore computing these metrics.\n4.3. Consistent novel-view synthesis\nFor this task, the quantitative results are shown in Table 1\nand the qualitative results are shown in Fig. 4. By applying a\nNeRF model to distill the Stable Diffusion model [49, 54],\nRealFusion [43] shows strong multiview consistency pro-\nducing more reconstructed points but is unable to produce\nvisually plausible images as shown in Fig. 4. Zero123 [40]\nproduces visually plausible images but the generated im-\nages are not multiview-consistent. Our method is able to\ngenerate images that not only are semantically consistent\nwith the input image but also maintain multiview consis-\ntency in colors and geometry.\nMeanwhile, for the same\ninput image, Our method can generate different plausible\ninstances using different random seeds as shown in Fig. 5.\n4.4. Single view reconstruction\nWe show the quantitative results in Table 2 and the qual-\nitative comparison in Fig. 6. Point-E [46] and Shap-E [30]\ntend to produce incompleted meshes.\nDirectly distilling\nZero123 [40] generates shapes that are coarsely aligned\nwith the input image, but the reconstructed surfaces are\nrough and not consistent with input images in detailed parts.\nMagic123 [50] produces much smoother meshes but heav-\nily relies on the estimated depth values on the input view,\nwhich may lead to incorrect results when the depth esti-\nmator is not robust. One-2-3-45 [39] reconstructs meshes\nfrom the multiview-inconsistent outputs of Zero123, which\nis able to capture the general geometry but also loses details.\nIn comparison, our method achieves the best reconstruction\nquality with smooth surfaces and detailed geometry.\n4.5. Text-to-image-to-3D\nBy incorporating text2image models like Stable Diffu-\nsion [54] or Imagen [55], SyncDreamer enables generat-\ning 3D models from text. Examples are shown in Fig. 7.\nIn comparison with existing text-to-3D distillation, our\nmethod gives more flexibility because users can generate\nmultiple images with their text2image models and select the\ndesirable one to feed to SyncDreamer for 3D reconstruction.\n4.6. Discussions\nIn this section, we further conduct a set of experiments\nto evaluate the effectiveness of our designs.\nGeneralization ability. To show the generalization abil-\nity, we evaluate SyncDreamer with 2D designs or hand\ndrawings like sketches, cartoons, and traditional Chinese\nink paintings, which are usually created manually by artists\nand exhibit differences in lighting effects and color space\nfrom real-world images. The results are shown in Fig. 8.\nDespite the significant differences in lighting and shadow\neffects between these images and the real-world images, our\n8\nInput design\nGenerated multiview-consistent images\nMesh\nFigure 8. Examples of using SyncDreamer to generate 3D models from 2D designs .\nalgorithm is still able to perceive their reasonable 3D geom-\netry and produce multiview-consistent images.\nPerformance without 3D-aware feature attention. To\nshow how the proposed 3D-aware feature attention im-\nproves multiview consistency, we discard the 3D-aware at-\ntention module in SyncDreamer and train this model on the\nsame training set. This actually corresponds to finetuning\na Zero123 model with fixed viewpoints. As we can see in\nFig. 9, such a model still cannot produce images with strong\nconsistency, which demonstrates the necessity of the 3D-\naware attention module in generating multiview-consistent\nimages.\nInitializing from Stable Diffusion instead of Zero123.\nAn alternative strategy is to initialize our model from Stable\nDiffusion [54]. However, the results shown in Fig. 9 indi-\ncate that initializing from Stable Diffusion exhibits a worse\ngeneralization ability than from Zero123 [40]. Zero123 al-\nready enables the UNet to infer the relationship between\ndifferent views, which thus reduces the difficulty in training\na multiview image generator.\nTraining UNet. During the training of SyncDreamer,\nanother feasible solution is to not freeze the UNet and the\nrelated layers initialized from Zero123 but further finetune\nthem together with the volume condition module. As shown\nin Fig. 9, the model without freezing these layers tends to\npredict the input object as a thin plate, especially when the\ninput images are 2D hand drawings. We speculate that this\nphenomenon is caused by overfitting, likely due to the nu-\nmerous thin-plate objects within the Objaverse dataset and\nthe fixed viewpoints employed during our training process.\nRuntime. SyncDreamer uses about 2.7 minutes to sam-\nple 64 images (4 instances) with 200 DDIM [64] sampling\nsteps on a 40G A100 GPU. Our runtime is slightly longer\nthan Zero123 because we need to construct the spatial fea-\nture volume on every step.\n5. Limitations and Conclusion\nLimitations and future works. Though SyncDreamer\nshows promising performances in generating multiview-\nconsistent images for 3D reconstruction, there are still lim-\nitations that the current framework does not fully address.\nFirst, the current SyncDreamer only generates 16 target\nviews for an object, while reconstructing objects from such\na limited number of views is associated with compromised\nquality. It is possible to train a SyncDreamer to generate\nmore dense views, which would require more GPUs and\nlarger GPU memory to train such a model. Second, the gen-\nerated images are not always plausible and we may need to\ngenerate multiple instances with different seeds and select\na desirable instance for 3D reconstruction. To further in-\ncrease the quality, we may need to use a larger object dataset\n9\nInput\nSyncDreamer\nW/O 3D Attn\nInit SD\nTrain UNet\nFigure 9.

Third,\nthe current implementation of SyncDreamer assumes a per-\nspective image as input but many 2D designs are drawn with\northogonal projections, which would lead to unnatural dis-\ntortion of the reconstructed geometry. Applying orthogo-\nnal projection in the volume construction of SyncDreamer\nwould alleviate this problem.\nConclusions. In this paper, we present SyncDreamer\nto generate multiview-consistent images from a single-view\nimage. SyncDreamer adopts a synchronized multiview dif-\nfusion to model the joint probability distribution of mul-\ntiview images, which thus improves the multiview con-\nsistency.\nWe design a novel architecture that uses the\nZero123 as the backbone and a new volume condition mod-\nule to model cross-view dependency.\nExtensive experi-\nments demonstrate that SyncDreamer not only efficiently\ngenerates multiview images with strong consistency, but\nalso achieves improved reconstruction quality compared to\nthe baseline methods. Moreover, it exhibits excellent gen-\neralization to various styles of input images.\nReferences\n[1] Titas Anciukevi\u02c7cius, Zexiang Xu, Matthew Fisher, Paul Hen-\nderson, Hakan Bilen, Niloy J Mitra, and Paul Guerrero.

However,\nmost high-performing LLMs remain confined behind proprietary walls, hindering\nscientific progress. Most open-source LLMs, on the other hand, are limited in their\nability to support longer sequence lengths, which is a key requirement for many\ntasks that require inference over an input context. To address this, we have trained\nXGen-7B, a series of 7B parameter models on up to 8K sequence length for up\nto 1.5T tokens. We have also finetuned the XGen-7B models on public-domain\ninstructional data, creating their instruction-tuned counterparts (XGen-7B-Inst).\nWe open-source our models for both research advancements and commercial\napplications. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that XGen-7B models\nachieve comparable or better results when compared with state-of-the-art open-\nsource LLMs. Our targeted evaluation on long sequence modeling tasks shows the\nbenefits of our 8K-sequence models over 2K-sequence open-source LLMs.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities to generate text, translate lan-\nguages, write code, answer questions, solve math problems, predict actions, and many more. Interest-\ningly, they can perform these tasks from textual instructions and/or observing a few demonstrations\n[2]. Crucial to their success are two main ingredients: (a) model scale which defines the model\u2019s\ncapacity; and (b) instruction tuning, which aims to align the model to follow user instructions [25].\nWhile the proliferation of LLMs has enhanced numerous applications, a significant number of high-\nperforming models remain proprietary, impeding the progress of scientific exploration. Recent work\n[14] on model scaling has shown that for a given compute budget, the best performances are not\nnecessarily achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data (measured by\nthe number of tokens). A smaller model is also generally preferred for inference efficiency during\nserving including on mobile devices.\nAs LLMs become ubiquitous, their applications to long sequences have been a key focus [33, 30],\nespecially for applications like writing code, summarizing text (potentially interleaved with other\n\u2217indicates lead authors, \u2020indicates lead project coordinators and corresponding authors.\narXiv:2309.03450v1  [cs.CL]  7 Sep 2023\nTable 1: High-level summary of the XGen-7B models.\nModel\nDescription\nXGen-7B-4K\nPre-train for 800B tokens with a sequence length of 2K tokens first,\nthen for another 400B tokens (total 1.2T tokens) with 4K tokens.\nXGen-7B-8K\nInitialize with XGen-7B-4K-base and further train for 300B more\ntokens (total 1.5T tokens) with 8K sequence length.\nXGen-7B-InstwizardLM\nSupervised fine-tuning of XGen-7B-8K on the recently released\nWizardLM-196K [39] instruction data.\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral\nSupervised fine-tuning of XGen-7B-8K on general public domain instruction\ndata including OAsst5, Baize [40], Dolly2 [10], ShareGPT and SCROLLS [30].\ndata sources like tables and images), and predicting protein sequences, which require the model to\neffectively consider long distance structural dependencies. A large context allows a pre-trained LLM\nto look at customer data (e.g., documents the LLM did not use in training) and responds to useful\ninformation seeking queries. Yet, most open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA [34], MPT2, Falcon3) have\nbeen trained with a maximum of 2K token sequence length, which is a key limitation in modeling\nlong sequences. Inference time solutions such as ALiBi [26] have yet to be tested properly for larger\nmodels (e.g. MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+).\nTo address the above limitation, in light of the scaling properties and serving efficiency, we train\na series of 7B LLMs named XGen-7B with standard dense attention on up to 8K sequence length\nfor up to 1.5T tokens. We also finetune the XGen-7B models on public-domain instructional data,\ncreating their instruction-tuned counterparts (XGen-7B-Inst). We open-source our models for both\nresearch advancements and commercial applications. Table 1 summarizes our released models.4.\nOur evaluation of XGen-7B-8K on standard benchmarks for evaluating base pre-trained models shows\nthat it achieves comparable or better results when compared with state-of-the-art open-source LLMs.\nIt also achieves good results on Python code generation tasks. Our instruction-tuned models also\nshow impressive results on the recently proposed AlpacaEval [16] and MTBench [43] benchmarks,\noften outperforming models of similar sizes (e.g., WizardLM-7B, MPT-7B) and even larger ones (e.g.,\nFalcon-40B-instruct, Alpaca-13B). Furthermore, our targeted evaluation on long sequence modeling\ntasks show benefits of our 8K-sequence models over 2K-sequence open-source LLMs.\n2\nPre-training Data\nOur pre-training dataset is a mixture of data from several public sources, reported in Table 2. We\nemploy a two-stage training strategy, where each stage uses a different data mixture, as shown in\nTable 3.\nNatural language data for stage 1. Natural language data is a mixture of publicly available data.\nWe made an effort to improve safety and diversity of the data.\nCode data for stage 1. We use the GitHub subset from the recently released RedPajama dataset [9].\nWe also added Apex code data to enhance our model\u2019s proficiency in Apex code generation. Apex is\na widely used object-oriented programming language in Salesforce products.\nBigCode Starcoder data for stage 2. We use all the 86 programming languages from the Star-\ncoder [15] data, preserving the original weight of each. Subsequently, we further filter the data\naccording to a stronger permissive license guideline.\nTokenizer. We tokenize the data with the byte pair encoding (BPE) algorithm [29], utilizing OpenAI\u2019s\ntiktoken tool, with GPT-2 serving as the base tokenizer. Additionally, we incorporate supplementary\nspecial tokens as outlined in the Starcoder paper [15], along with consecutive white-spaces and tabs\nwith the goal of aiding code generation.\n2https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b\n3https://falconllm.tii.ae/\n4https://github.com/salesforce/XGen\n2\nTable 2: Data mixtures used for pre-training stage 1.

During the pre-training stage 1, there are 3 substages,\neach with varying sequence lengths: 2K, 4K, and 8K tokens. To ensure data integrity and prevent\npotential distributional shifts, we shuffle the data uniformly, and split the shuffled data into 3 big\nchunks for the 3 substages. We construct the training sequences by concatenating or splitting\nthe original text documents into the target sequence lengths. When two different documents are\nconcatenated, an <|endoftext|> token is added between them. We exclude short documents that\ncontain less than 100 tokens after tokenization. We then shuffle the constructed training sequences\nuniformly in each big chunk. The data for pre-training stage 2 (50% stage 1 data and 50% Starcoder\ndata) only has training sequences with a length of 8k tokens.\n3\nTraining Details\nThe XGen-7B models are trained with our library JaxFormer [22], which facilitates efficient training\nof LLMs under both data and model parallelism optimized for TPU-v4 hardware. The training\nrecipe and model architecture follow LLaMA [34], while we conduct two additional explorations.\n4B\n40B\n400B\nTokens (Billion)\n2.0\n3.0\nLoss (Cross-Entropy)\n2K length\n4K length\n8K length\nFigure 1: Cross-entropy over training time. The model is pre-trained in three stages with a step-wise\nincrease of the sequence length from 2K to 4K to 8K tokens. Note, the pre-training does not suffer\nfrom any loss spikes. The spikes at the transitions in sequence lengths are expected as the model\nadjusts to positional encodings of increased length. The drop in perplexity from 2K to 4K is expected\nas uncertainty decreases over sequence length for long sequences.\n3\n1k\n2k\n4k\n8k\nToken positions\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\n7.0\nValidation Perplexity\nXGen (1.5T, 8K)\nXGen (1.2T, 4K)\nXGen (800B, 2K)\nFigure 2: Perplexity over sequence length. If a model can utilize the information encoded in long\nsequences, then, in expectation, the perplexity should decrease over the length of such sequences. That\nis, the information contained in previous tokens increases the certainty of the next token prediction,\nwhich can be observed in the figure. Note, the perplexity of the 8K over the 2K model is generally\nlower as the model has been trained for an additional 700B tokens.\nFirst, we investigate the occurrence of so-called \u201closs spikes\u201d [6, 35, 20] during training, that is, the\nloss suddenly explodes temporarily while the root cause for these spikes is unknown. Second, the\nXGen-7B models support sequence lengths of up to 8,192 tokens (rather than the common 2,048) for\nwhich we introduce stage-wise training.\nRecipe.\nThe model architecture follows LLaMA with exact numerical compatibility to ease adoption\nin third-party frameworks. The hyperparameters closely follow LLaMA-7B [34] with the following\nalterations: (1) The token budget has been increased from 1.0T to 1.5T tokens, (2) the training is\nperformed stage-wise to increase the sequence length from 2K to 4K to 8K, (3) the vocabulary size\nhas been increased from 32,000 to 51,200 tokens. The training loop was implemented in JAX with\nHaiku for which the entire computation is under FP32 numerical precision, except for matmul in\nBF16.\nLoss spikes.\nAs models are scaled to larger sizes, the training itself is increasingly sensitive to\ninstabilities, which cause poor model performance, if not addressed carefully [6, 35, 20]. In our\nexploration, we have gathered evidence for several factors, which individually contribute to unstable\ntraining. These preliminary findings include \u201csequential over parallel self-attention circuits\u201d, \u201cswish-\nGLU over GeLU\u201d, \u201cRMS-Norm over Layer-norm\u201d. Specifically, widely used parallel circuits [6,\n35, 23], which parallelize the computation of self-attention and feed-forward may affect the stability\nof training, at least in our specific setting. As adopted in [34], the combination of activation\nnormalization in the form of RMS-Norm [42], sequential self-attention and swish-GLU [31] appears\nto be numerically highly robust, while not optimal in terms of computational efficiency.\nSequence length.\nTraining with longer sequences is computationally unproportionally costly as\nthe complexity of self-attention is quadratic, that is, the training process is slow. To mitigate slow\ntraining, we introduce training in stages with increasing sequence length. First, 800B tokens with\nsequence length of 2K tokens are observed, then 400B tokens with 4K, finally, 300B tokens with\n8K length. Figure 1 shows the cross-entropy over training steps for this stage-wise training. We\nverify the adaptation to longer sequences by computing the average perplexity at each token position\non a held-out validation set containing documents of 8K sequence length or above. If the model\nsuccessfully learns to utilize the full sequence, we would expect the perplexity to decrease over\nsequence length, as previous tokens carry information for the next to-be-predicted token. That is, for\na long sentence, the more context in the form of previous words is provided, the easier it becomes to\n4\nguess the next word. Figure 2 indeed demonstrates that XGen-7B at each stage successfully learns to\nutilize longer contexts, up to 8K sequence length.\n4\nInstructional Tuning\nTo demonstrate the language understanding and generation capability of XGen-7B, we perform\ninstruction-tuning of the base LLM and evaluate the instruct-tuned models.\nInstruction Data. The key to instruction tuning is the instructional data that is used to align the model\nto follow user instructions, while being harmless. Developing proprietary models like GPT-4 [24]\nand Bard [21] involves significant annotation efforts for collecting such data. Early open-source\ninstruction tuned models [18] leverage academic datasets by transforming them into instructional\nformats with human-written prompt templates [37, 28, 36]. Despite the large amount of data curated\nin this way, instruction following capacity of these models falls behind proprietary models as the task\ndistributions covered by these academic benchmarks do not match the real use cases of LLMs [25].\nTherefore, more recent open-source models [43, 39] utilize ChatGPT- or GPT4-synthesized data, e.g.,\nhuman-written prompts with GPT-generated responses or GPT-generated prompts and responses.\nThis distillation process helps to close the gap to the proprietary models. Some examples of these\ndatasets are Alpaca [32], ShareGPT 6, Baize [40], GPTeacher 7, and WizardLM [39].\nFor our experiments, we finetune XGen-7B in two data settings:\n\u2022 XGen-7B-InstwizardLM: For this setting, we use WizardLM [39], which is one of the most recent\ninstruction datasets. It is created by prompting GPT-4 to rewrite existing instructions from Alpaca\n[32] to make them more complex. Finetuning LLaMA models on this dataset has demonstrated high\nperformance in several benchmarks especially for complex instructions. We use the WizardLM-\n196K collection for finetuning XGen-7B. This setting allows us to compare with the WizardLM-7b\nmodel [39], which is based on LLaMA-7b and uses the same source of instructions.\n\u2022 XGen-7B-Instgeneral: In another setting, we use general public domain instruction data that includes\nOAsst8, Baize [40], Dolly2 [10] and ShareGPT. To measure the impact of long contexts, we also\ninclude examples from the long sequence NLP benchmark, SCROLLS [30]. We sample about\n1,500 examples from each of the following datasets from SCROLLS: GovReport, SummScreenFD,\nQMSum, NarrativeQA, Qasper and QuALITY. We sample these examples such that each contains\nat least 4000 tokens. This setting is intended to give us a sense on the model\u2019s general capability in\nfollowing instructions for long-sequence tasks.\nFinetuning Details. We use Adam with \u03b21 = 0.9 and \u03b22 = 0.99, cosine decay for learning rate down\nto 10% of an initial value 2 \u00d7 10\u22125, a batch size of 128, and a sequence length of 8,192 tokens. Each\ndata instance is formatted as a single-turn or multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant.\nIn particular, it follows the format:\n### Human:\n{prompt} ### Assistant:\n{response}\nOur training objective is causal language modeling and the loss for prompt is masked out, thus only\nthe gradients for response tokens are backpropagated. We train our models for 3 epochs.\n5\nEvaluation\n5.1\nBase Model Evaluation\n5.1.1\nStandard NLP Benchmarks\nWe first consider Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark [13], which is more recent\nand less susceptible to data contamination as reported in recent studies (see page 32 of GPT-4\ntechnical report [24] and a related discussion 9). The benchmark has been widely adopted for held-out\n6https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered\n7https://github.com/teknium1/GPTeacher\n8https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1\n9https://hitz-zentroa.github.io/lm-contamination/blog/?ref=blog.salesforceairesearch.com\n5\nTable 4: Five-shot results (accuracy) on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU).\nModels\nHumanities\nSTEM\nSocial Sciences\nOther\nWeighted average\nXGen-7B\n33.8\n30.7\n40.0\n41.5\n36.3\nLLaMA-7B\n33.9\n30.6\n38.2\n38.2\n35.1\nOpenLLaMA-7B\n28.1\n28.5\n31.2\n32.8\n29.9\nFalcon-7B\n26.5\n25.4\n29.2\n26.8\n26.9\nMPT-7B\n25.9\n26.2\n26.9\n28.1\n26.7\nRedpajama-7B\n26.1\n25.2\n27.4\n26.7\n26.3\nCerebras-GPT-13B\n26.1\n26.5\n25.8\n26.6\n26.2\nDolly-v2-12B\n26.9\n25.7\n25.3\n26.5\n26.2\nOPT-13B\n26.2\n24.3\n23.4\n26.0\n25.1\nGPT-J-6B\n25.9\n24.0\n24.0\n25.8\n25.1\nTable 5: Zero-shot accuracy on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU).\nModels\nHumanities\nSTEM\nSocial Sciences\nOther\nWeighted average\nXGen-7B\n31.4\n27.8\n32.1\n37.2\n32.1\nLLaMA-7B\n32.3\n27.1\n31.3\n36.8\n32.0\nOpenLLaMA-7B\n28.0\n27.6\n28.9\n30.1\n28.6\nMPT-7B\n27.4\n25.2\n26.0\n30.7\n27.4\nRedpajama-7B\n27.5\n25.5\n24.2\n25.0\n25.8\nGPT-J-6B\n25.3\n24.5\n25.5\n27.6\n25.7\nDolly-v2-12B\n26.2\n26.0\n24.0\n24.9\n25.4\nCerebras-GPT-13B\n24.3\n25.0\n23.0\n26.0\n24.6\nOPT-13B\n26.3\n23.3\n23.6\n23.6\n24.4\nFalcon-7B\n24.8\n21.7\n24.0\n24.4\n23.9\nevaluation. Recently, however, inconsistencies in reporting MMLU scores have been reported, which\nresulted in wrong rankings in Hugging Face\u2019s Open LLM leaderboard. In our work, we follow the\noriginal MMLU standard, which is consistent with the published results (i.e., in LLaMA).\nMMLU consists of multiple choice questions covering various domains of knowledge, including\nhumanities, STEM and social sciences. To assess our models\u2019 performance, we conduct evaluations in\nboth the five- and zero-shot settings, utilizing the sample questions from the benchmark. The results\nfor five-shot MMLU are reported in Table 4, and the results for zero-shot MMLU are reported in\nTable 5. For both settings, XGen-7B achieves the best results among the baselines in most categories,\nas well as in weighted average.\nWe also report general zero-shot results on other standard NLP benchmarks that involve common\nsense reasoning and QA: ARC challenge [8], HellaSwag [41], Winogrande [27], TruthfulQA [17],\nBoolQ [7], PiQA [1], and OpenBookQA [19]. The datasets comprise Cloze and Winograd style\ntasks, alongside multiple-choice question answering. Our evaluation follows the zero-shot approach\ncommonly employed in the language modeling community [12]. As shown in Table 6, XGen-7B\nachieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art LLMs of similar sizes.\nTable 6: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning and Question Answering tasks.\nModels\nMMLU\n-wavg\nARC_ch\nHellaSwag\nWinogrande\nTruthfulQA\nBoolQ\nPiQA\nOpenBookQA\nXGen-7B\n32.1\n41.2\n74.2\n64.9\n39.1\n74.3\n75.5\n40.2\nLLaMA-7B\n32.0\n44.8\n76.2\n69.6\n34.0\n74.9\n78.7\n44.2\nFalcon-7B\n23.9\n43.4\n76.4\n67.2\n34.3\n73.8\n79.4\n44.0\nMPT-7B\n27.4\n41.7\n76.1\n68.6\n33.4\n74.1\n79.1\n41.8\nOpenLLaMA-7B\n28.6\n38.7\n71.8\n67.0\n35.2\n70.6\n76.0\n39.0\nRedpajama-7B\n25.8\n39.1\n70.3\n63.8\n33.3\n69.3\n76.9\n40.0\nGPT-neox-20B\n24.5\n41.1\n70.5\n66.1\n31.4\n64.9\n76.7\n38.8\nOPT-13B\n24.4\n35.8\n69.9\n64.7\n33.9\n65.0\n75.7\n39.8\nGPT-J-6B\n25.7\n36.3\n66.2\n64.5\n36.0\n65.4\n75.4\n38.2\nDolly-v2-12B\n25.4\n39.6\n70.8\n61.8\n34.4\n56.3\n75.4\n39.2\nCerebras-GPT-13B\n24.6\n32.4\n59.4\n60.8\n39.2\n61.1\n73.5\n35.8\nStableLM-alpha-7B\n24.4\n27.0\n40.7\n51.5\n41.7\n59.0\n65.8\n32.4\n6\nTable 7: Natural language to code generation results in pass@1 on the HumanEval benchmark.\nFor OpenLLaMA-7B-v2, we note that Starcoder data occupies 30% of their pre-training data.\n\u2217Consecutive whitespaces are treated as one, breaking Python syntax. \u2217\u2217Model could not generate\nmeaningful code.\nModels\npass@1\nXGen-7B\n14.20\nMPT-7B\n15.90\nOpenLLaMA-7B-v2\n14.83\nLLaMA-2-7B\n13.55\nLLaMA-7B\n10.38\nRedpajama-7B\n5.24\nOpenLLaMA-7B\n0\u2217\nFalcon-7B\n0\u2217\u2217\n5.1.2\nCode Generation\nTo evaluate XGen-7B\u2019s code generation capability from natural language instructions (i.e., docstrings),\nwe evaluate the model on HumanEval benchmark [4]. HumanEval evaluates LLMs\u2019 Python code-\nwriting capabilities at the function level by assessing functional correctness. We report performance\nusing the pass@1 metric [4]. A generated code is considered correct if it passes all the unit tests.\nFollowing [4], we set the sampling temperature to 0.2, p = 0.95 for top-p sampling, and generate\nn = 200 samples for each problem in the benchmark to report an unbiased pass@1 score. As we can\nnotice in Table 7, our XGen-7B achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art 7B LLMs.\nConsidering the size and results in both text and code tasks, XGen-7B can be a good general-purpose\nmodel that can be served both on standard-sized GPUs (e.g., 16 GB memory) and mobile devices.\n5.2\nInstruction Model Evaluation\n5.2.1\nAlpacaEval\nAlpacaEval10 [16] is a newly proposed automated evaluation platform that employs an LLM as an\nevaluator. It utilizes the AlpacaFarm [11] evaluation dataset, which has been crafted to evaluate a\nmodel\u2019s ability to understand and follow a wide range of user instructions. The responses generated\nby the models under evaluation are then contrasted with the reference responses from text-davinci-003\n[25], with GPT-4 [24] serving as the evaluator. The win rate against text-davinci-003is employed as\nthe performance metric.\nAs shown in Table 8, our instruction-tuned model, XGen-7B-InstwizardLM (fine-tuned on WizardLM\n[39]), generally achieves better performance than other models of similar sizes, notably the WizardLM-\n7B, which uses the same repository of distilled instructions. Our model performs slightly worse\nthan Vicuna-7B-v1.3, which utilizes more ShareGPT data comprising human-authored prompts. The\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral model performs worse than XGen-7B-InstwizardLM but still significantly better\nthan text-davinci-003 and other open-source alternatives like Falcon-40B-instruct and MPT-7B-chat.\n5.2.2\nMT-Bench\nSimilar to AlpacaEval, MT-Bench11 [43] is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-based chat assis-\ntants. It also uses an LLM as a judge (e.g., GPT-4) to assess the models on open-ended questions.\nThe model evaluation is performed in two ways:\nSingle answer grading. In this evaluation setting, the judge LLM assigns a score directly to each\nof the model-generated responses. As shown in Table 9, XGen-7B-InstwizardLM outperforms other\nmodels of similar sizes (except Vicuna-7B-v1.3), especially the WizardLM-7B-Inst model which\nuses a similar instruction set. It even surpasses larger models, such as the Falcon-40B-instruct or\nMPT-30B-instruct.\n10https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/\n11https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/mt-bench\n7\nTable 8: Results on the AlpacaEval leaderboard [16] with GPT-4 as an evaluator.\nModel\nWin Rate vs. text-davinci-003\nGPT-4\n95.3\nClaude\n88.4\nChatGPT\n86.1\nVicuna-7B-V1.3\n76.8\nWizardLM-13B\n75.3\nGuanaco-65B\n71.8\nVicuna-13B\n70.4\nXGen-7B-InstwizardLM\n68.8\nWizardLM-7B\n65.2\nOAsst-RLHF-LLaMA-33B\n66.5\nVicuna-7B\n64.4\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral\n57.3\ntext-davinci-003\n50.0\nFalcon-40B-instruct\n45.7\nMPT-7B-chat\n45.0\nAlpaca-farm-PPO-human\n41.2\nAlpaca-7B\n26.5\ntext-davinci-001\n15.2\nPairwise comparison. In this setting, the judge LLM is given a question along with two model\nresponses from two competing models. The judge is tasked to determine which answer is superior, or\nto declare that both answers are equally good. From the results in Table 10, we see that here also\nXGen-7B-Inst models outperform other models of similar sizes and they surpass some larger models.\n5.3\nLong Sequence Tasks\nIn addition to public benchmarks AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, we also evaluate XGen-7B and other\ncompetitive open source models on long sequence modeling tasks.\n5.3.1\nLong-form QA\nIn order to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of open source LLMs on long context, we design a\nlong-form QA task in-house with two settings. Given a long input document, (1) we first prompt\nChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate questions with explicit instructions such that answers are not\ndirectly retrievable from the context with few words. We call this setting QG-passage. (2) In order to\ngenerate more abstract questions that would require synthesizing different elements from different\nparts of the input document, we first summarize the document and then generate questions on the\nsummary using ChatGPT similar to (1). We call this setting QG-summary. We provide examples of\nthe prompts in Appendix A.1.\nNext, we prompt the models to answer the questions generated from ChatGPT on the two settings\nmentioned above. Note that we know the ground-truth answers in the two settings. We set a maximum\nof 512 tokens for generation. We use GPT-4 for evaluating the responses on the generated answers\nand rate them on a scale of 0-3 for the following dimensions: coherence, relevance, and accuracy.\nAs shown in Table 11, we find that XGen-7B-Instgeneral outperforms all the other models compared.\nSpecifically, we find that the rates for XGen-7B-Inst models are higher for generated responses in\nterms of coherence and relevance. In general, we find that questions generated from summary are\noften more difficult to generate response which shows the difficulty of the overall setting (Table 12).\nThese improvements can be partially attributed to XGen\u2019s long-sequence modeling capability.\n5.3.2\nDialogue Summarization\nIn order to evaluate the long dialogue understanding and summarization capabilities, we perform\nexperiments on three dialogue summarization tasks: AMI meeting summarization [3], screenplay\n8\nTable 9: Evaluation on MT Bench [43] \u2013 Single answer grading by GPT-4.\nModel\nScore\nGPT-4\n8.99\nChatGPT(GPT-3.5-turbo)\n7.94\nClaude-v1\n7.90\nClaude-instant-v1\n7.85\nVicuna-33B-v1.3\n7.12\nWizardLM-30B\n7.01\nGuanaco-33B\n6.53\nTulu-30B\n6.43\nGuanaco-65B\n6.41\nOAsst-SFT-7-LLaMA-30B\n6.41\nPaLM-2-chat-bison-001\n6.40\nMPT-30B-chat\n6.39\nVicuna-13B-v1.3\n6.39\nWizardLM-13B\n6.35\nVicuna-7B-v1.3\n6.00\nBaize-v2-13B\n5.75\nXGen-7B-InstwizardLM\n5.69\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral\n5.54\nNous-Hermes-13B\n5.51\nMPT-7B-chat\n5.42\nGPT4All-13B-snoozy\n5.41\nKoala-13B\n5.35\nWizardLM-7B\n5.29\nMPT-30B-instruct\n5.22\nFalcon-40B-instruct\n5.17\nH2OGPT-OAsst-Open-LLaMA-13B\n4.63\nAlpaca-13B\n4.53\nChatGLM-6B\n4.50\nOAsst-SFT-4-pythia-12B\n4.32\nRWKV-4-raven-14B\n3.98\nDolly-v2-12B\n3.28\nFastchat-T5-3B\n3.04\nStableLM-tuned-alpha-7B\n2.75\nLLaMA-13B\n2.61\nsummarization from ForeverDreaming (FD) and TVMegaSite (TMS) datasets [5]. The average source\nlengths for these datasets are 5570, 6466, and 7653 tokens, respectively.\nFor evaluation shown in Table 13, we focus on samples with lengths less than 8K and consider the\nsame instruction-tuned models as above. It is worth noting that both MPT-7B-inst and Alpaca-7B\nmodels performed poorly in this setting when input truncation was not applied. In contrast, our model\n(XGen-7B-Inst) achieved the highest ROUGE scores across all metrics.\n6\nCarbon Footprint\nTo estimate the energy consumption and the resulting emission of carbon dioxide for training XGen-\n7B, we follow [38]. Specifically, we compute Mega-watt-hour (MWh) as follows:\nMWh\n=\nTPU-hours \u00d7 (TPU power consumption) \u00d7 PUE\n(1)\n=\n270, 336 \u00d7 192 \u00d7 1.10\n(2)\n=\n57\n(3)\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) to 1.10 following the standard.\nThe re-\nsulting carbon emission depends on the data center location. For XGen-7B, this amounts to:\ntCO2eq = MWh (57) \u00d7 0.079 = 4.5. In Figure 3, we show this in comparison with other LLMs.\n9\nTable 10: MT Bench Evaluation [43] \u2013 Pairwise Comparison by GPT-4.\nModel\nWin\nLoss\nTie\nWin Rate\nLoss Rate\nWin Rate Adjusted\nGPT-4\n111\n7\n42\n69.4\n43.8\n82.5\nClaude-v1\n75\n27\n58\n46.9\n16.9\n65.0\nVicuna-33B-v1.3\n70\n42\n48\n43.8\n26.3\n58.8\nClaude-instant-v1\n64\n40\n56\n40.0\n25.0\n57.5\nWizardLM-30B\n37\n63\n60\n23.1\n39.4\n41.9\nGuanaco-33B\n42\n72\n46\n26.3\n45.0\n40.6\nGuanaco-65B\n38\n68\n54\n23.8\n42.5\n40.6\nVicuna-13B-v1.3\n33\n73\n54\n20.6\n45.6\n37.5\nMPT-30B-chat\n29\n78\n53\n18.1\n48.8\n34.7\nVicuna-7B-v1.3\n60\n165\n95\n18.8\n51.6\n33.6\nWizardLM-13B\n27\n81\n52\n16.9\n50.6\n33.1\nTulu-30B\n29\n92\n39\n18.1\n57.5\n30.3\nOAsst-SFT-7-LLaMA-30B\n23\n88\n49\n14.4\n55.0\n29.7\nXGen-7B-InstwizardLM\n22\n91\n47\n13.8\n56.9\n28.4\nBaize-v2-13B\n21\n101\n38\n13.1\n63.1\n25.0\nPaLM-2-chat-bison-001\n18\n102\n40\n11.3\n63.8\n23.8\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral\n17\n108\n35\n10.6\n67.5\n21.6\nNous-Hermes-13B\n12\n104\n44\n7.5\n65.0\n21.3\nGPT4All-13B-snoozy\n14\n108\n38\n8.8\n67.5\n20.6\nMPT-7B-chat\n18\n214\n88\n5.6\n66.9\n19.4\nH2OGPT-OAsst-Open-LLaMA-13B\n19\n118\n23\n11.9\n73.8\n19.1\nKoala-13B\n10\n110\n40\n6.3\n68.8\n18.8\nFalcon-40B-instruct\n10\n116\n34\n6.3\n72.5\n16.9\nMPT-30B-instruct\n7\n120\n33\n4.4\n75.0\n14.7\nChatGLM-6B\n6\n124\n30\n3.8\n77.5\n13.1\nOAsst-SFT-4-pythia-12B\n8\n128\n24\n5.0\n80.0\n12.5\nRWKV-4-raven-14B\n6\n128\n26\n3.8\n80.0\n11.9\nAlpaca-13B\n13\n265\n42\n4.1\n82.8\n10.6\nFastchat-T5-3B\n5\n132\n23\n3.1\n82.5\n10.3\nDolly-v2-12B\n5\n138\n17\n3.1\n86.3\n8.4\nTable 11: Overall performance of different models based on GPT-4 evaluation on long-form QA.

We described its effective stage-wise pre-training process with different sequence\nlengths (2K \u2192 4K \u2192 8K) and data mixtures (mostly text \u2192 50% text - 50% code). We have shown\n10\nTable 12: Performance breakdown of different models in the two settings based on GPT-4 evaluation.\nThe table shows average ratings across all metrics for questions generated from passage (QG-passage)\nand summary (QG-summary).\nModel\nQG-passage\nQG-summary\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral\n2.79\n2.68\nVicuna-7B-v1.3\n2.71\n2.61\nXGen-7B-InstwizardLM\n2.71\n2.60\nWizardLM-7B\n2.71\n2.55\nMPT-7B-instruct\n2.50\n2.35\nFalcon-7B-instruct\n2.22\n1.95\nAlpaca-7B\n2.04\n1.64\nTable 13: ROUGE scores of different models on long dialogue summarization task.\nModel\nAMI\nFD\nTMS\nR-1\nR-2\nR-L\nR-1\nR-2\nR-L\nR-1\nR-2\nR-L\nXGen-7B-Instgeneral\n31.34\n8.25\n17.00\n29.34\n5.39\n16.43\n26.39\n3.94\n13.71\nXGen-7B-InstwizardLM\n25.56\n6.71\n16.84\n8.97\n0.90\n5.49\n19.15\n1.86\n9.53\nVicuna-7B-v1.3\n14.23\n2.01\n9.05\n16.49\n1.00\n9.99\n17.06\n1.49\n8.85\nFalcon-7B-instruct\n14.89\n1.97\n9.28\n18.90\n1.80\n9.37\n18.90\n1.80\n9.37\nMPT-7B-instruct\n11.95\n1.88\n8.10\n14.27\n1.40\n8.89\n19.80\n2.39\n10.23\nAlpaca-7B\n9.69\n1.77\n6.43\n16.26\n1.56\n10.66\n12.26\n1.15\n7.30\nWizardLM-7B\n18.97\n2.65\n10.32\n14.13\n1.11\n8.07\n19.16\n1.87\n9.51\nthat the resulting model achieves comparable or better results on standard text and code generation\nbenchmarks compared to state-of-the-art open-source LLMs.\nWe have also described the finetuning process of the XGen-7B model on two different public-\ndomain instructional datasets, creating the XGen-7B-Inst counterparts. The results on two popular\nbenchmarks show that our models often outperform existing models of similar sizes and sometimes\neven much larger models. We then evaluated the models on long sequence modeling tasks, which\nvalidates the superiority of our 8K-sequence model over the existing 2K-sequence LLMs. Finally,\nwe hope that the open-sourcing of our models will contribute to open science in understanding the\nstrengths and limitations of LLMs and will have significant impacts on business and commerce.\n9\nAuthor Contribution\nPre-training Model\nErik Nijkamp (lead), Hiroaki Hayashi, Tian Xie, Chen Xing\nPre-training Data\nTian Xie (lead), Hiroaki Hayashi, Lidiya Murakhovs\u2019ka\nEvaluation\nCongying Xia (lead), Tian Xie, Erik Nijkamp, Rui Meng, Hiroaki Hayashi, Wojciech Kry\u00b4sci\u00b4nski,\nYe Liu, Lifu Tu, Meghana Bhat\nInstruction Tuning (Model)\nBo Pang (lead), Chen Xing\nInstruction Tuning (Tool & Data)\nJesse Vig, Semih Yavuz, Chen Xing, Philippe Laban, Ben Krause,\nSenthil Purushwalkam, Tong Niu, Wojciech Kry\u00b4sci\u00b4nski, Lidiya Murakhovs\u2019ka, Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Alex\nFabbri, Ye Liu, Rui Meng, Lifu Tu, Meghana Bhat\nProject Coordination\nCaiming Xiong (co-lead), Shafiq Joty (co-lead), Yingbo Zhou (co-lead), Chien-\nSheng Wu, Silvio Savarese\n11\nModels\ntCO2eq\n0.00\n200.00\n400.00\n600.00\nGPT-3 \n(175B)\nBLOOM \n(175B)\nLLaMA \n(7B, 13B, \n33B, 65B)\nPaLM \n(540B)\nCodeGen \n(16B)\nXGen \n(7B)\nFigure 3: Carbon emission of different models.\nReferences\n[1] Yonatan Bisk, Rowan Zellers, Jianfeng Gao, Yejin Choi, et al.

Yet many vital\ntasks, particularly those that involve interacting with humans\nin real time, necessitate such an high-speed robotic system.\nThe goal of this paper is to describe such a system and\nthe process behind its creation. Building any robotic system\nis a complex and multifaceted challenge, but nuanced design\ndecisions are not often widely disseminated. Our hope is that\nthis paper can help researchers who are starting out in high-\nspeed robotic learning and serve as a discussion point for those\nalready active in the area.\nWe focus on a robotic table tennis system that has shown\npromise in playing with humans (340 hit cooperative rallies)\n[2] and targeted ball returns (competitive with amateur hu-\nmans) [20].

TABLE TENNIS SYSTEM\nTable tennis is easy to pick up for humans, but poses\ninteresting challenges for a robotic system. Amateurs hit the\nball at up to 9m/s, with professionals tripling that. Thus, the\nrobot must be able to move, sense, and react quickly just to\nmake contact, let alone replicate the precise hits needed for\nhigh-level play.\nThe components of this system are numerous with many\ninteractions (Figure 2). Therefore, a major design focus was\non modularity to enable testing and swapping. At a high\nlevel, the hardware components (cameras + vision stack, robot,\nball thrower) are controlled through C++ and communicate\nstate to the environment through a custom message passing\nsystem called Fluxworks. The various components not only\nsend policy-related information this way (e.g. where the the\nball is, the position of the robot) but also synchronize the state\nof the system (e.g. the robot has faulted or a new episode\nhas started). Note that this process is simplified in simulation\nwhere all state information is centralized. Information from the\ncomponents determines the state of the game (in the Referee)\nand input to the policy. The policy then produces actions which\nfeed into the low-level controllers while the game state drives\nthe system as a whole (e.g. the episode is over). All logging\n(Appendix M), including videos, is handled with Fluxworks\nwhich utilizes highly optimized Protobuffer communication.\nThe rest of this section describes the components in the\nsystem and their dependencies and interactions.\nA. Physical Robots\nThe player in this system consists of two industrial robots\nthat work together: an ABB 6DOF arm and a Festo 2DOF\nlinear actuator, creating an 8DOF system (Figure 1). The two\nrobots complement each other: the gantry is able to cover large\ndistances quickly, maneuvering the arm into an appropriate\nposition where it can make fine adjustments and hit the ball\nin a controlled manner with the arm. The choice of industrial\nrobots was deliberate, to focus on the machine learning\nchallenges of the problem and for high reliability. However\none major limitation of working with off-the-shelf industrial\nsystems is that they may contain proprietary, \u201cclosed-box\u201d\nsoftware that must be contended with. For example, the ABB\narm runs an additional safety layer that instantly stops the\nrobot when it thinks something bad will happen. It took careful\neffort to work within these constraints because the robot was\noperating near its limits. See Appendix C for details.\nFor the ABB arms, either an ABB IRB 120T or ABB IRB\n1100-4/0.58 are used, the latter being a faster version with a\ndifferent joint structure. Both are capable of fast (joints rotate\nup to 420 or 600 degrees/s), repeatable (to within 0.01mm)\nmotions and allow a high control frequency. The arm\u2019s end\neffector is an 18.8cm 3D-printed extension attached to a\nstandard table tennis paddle that has had its handle removed\n(Figure 1 right). While the ABB arms are not perfect analogs\nto human arms, they can impart significant force and spin on\nthe ball.\nTaking inspiration from professional table tennis where play\ncan extend well to the side of and away from the table,\nthe Festo gantries range in size from 2 \u00d7 2m to 4 \u00d7 2m,\ndespite the table tennis table being 1.525m wide. This extra\nrange gives the robot more options for returning the ball. The\ngantries can move up to 2 m/s in in both axes. Most other\nrobotic table tennis systems (discussed in Section IV-B) opt\nfor a fixed-position arm but the inclusion of a gantry means\nthe robot is able to reach more of the table space and has\nmore freedom to adopt general policies. The downside is that\nthe gantry complicates the system by adding two degrees\nof freedom leading to an overdetermined system whilst also\nimparting additional lateral forces on the robot arm that must\nbe accounted for.\nB. Communication, Safety, and Control\nThe ABB robot accepts position and velocity target com-\nmands and provides joint feedback at 248Hz via the Externally\nGuided Motion (EGM) [1] interface. The Festo gantry is\ncontrolled through a Modbus [90] interface at approximately\n125Hz. See Appendix C for full communication details.\nSafety is a critical component of controlling robots. While\nthe robot should be hitting the ball, collision with anything else\nin the environment should be avoided. To solve this problem,\ncommands are filtered through a safety simulator before being\nsent to the robot (a simplified version of Section II-C). The\nsimulator converts a velocity action generated by the control\npolicy to a position and velocity command required by EGM at\neach timestep. Collisions in the simulator generate a repulsive\nforce that pushes the robot away, resulting in a valid, safe\ncommand for the real robot. Objects in the safety simulator are\ndilated for an adequate safety margin and additional obstacles\nare added to block off the \u201cdanger zones\u201d robot should avoid.\nLow-level robot control can be extremely time-sensitive and\nis typically implemented in a lower-level language like C++\nfor performance. Python on the other hand is very useful\nfor high-level machine learning implementations and rapid\niteration but is not well suited to high speed robot control due\nto the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which severely hampers\nconcurrency. This limitation can be mitigated through multiple\nPython processes, but is still not optimal for speed. Therefore\nthis system adopts a hybrid approach where latency sensitive\nprocesses like control and perception are implemented in C++\nwhile others are partitioned into several Python binaries (Fig-\nure 2). Having these components in Python allows researchers\nto iterate rapidly and not worry as much about low-level\ndetails. This separation also allows components to be easily\nswapped or tested.\nC. Simulator\nThe table tennis environment is simulated to facilitate sim-\nto-real training and prototyping for real robot training. PyBul-\nlet [19] is the physics engine and the environment interface\nconforms to the Gym API [12].\nFigure 2 (left) gives an overview of the environment struc-\nture in simulation and compares it with the real world environ-\nment (see Section II-E). There are five conceptual components;\n(1) the physics simulation and ball dynamics model which\ntogether model the dynamics of the robot and ball, (2) the\nStateMachine which uses ball contact information from\nthe physics simulation and tracks the semantic state of the\ngame (e.g. the ball just bounced on the opponent\u2019s side of the\ntable, the player hit the ball), (3) the RewardManager which\nloads a configurable set of rewards and outputs the reward per\nstep, (4) the DoneManager which loads a configurable set of\ndone conditions (e.g. ball leaves play area, robot collision with\nnon-ball object) and outputs if the episode is done per step,\nand (5) the Observation class which configurably formats\nthe environment observation per step.\nThe main advantage of this design is that it isolates compo-\nnents so they are easy to build and iterate on. For example, the\nStateMachine makes it easy to extend the environment to\nmore complex tasks. New tasks are defined by implementing a\nnew state machine in a config file. The StateMachine also\nmakes it easier to determine the episode termination condition\nand some rewards (e.g. for hitting the ball). Note that whilst\nrelated, it is not the same as the transition function of the\nMDP; the StateMachine is less granular and changes at a\nlower frequency. Another example is the RewardManager.\nIt is common practice in robot learning when training using\nthe reinforcement learning paradigm to experiment frequently\nwith the reward function. To facilitate this, reward components\nand their weights are specified in a config file taken in\nby the RewardManager, which calculates and sums each\ncomponent. This makes it straightforward to change rewards\nand easy to define new components.\n1) Latency modeling: Latency is a major source of the sim-\nto-real gap in robotics [91]. To mitigate this issue, and inspired\nby Tan et al. [91], latency is modelled in the simulation as\nfollows. During inference, the history of observations and\ncorresponding timestamps are stored and linearly interpolated\nto produce an observation with a desired latency. In contrast to\n[91] which uses a single latency range sampled uniformly for\nthe whole observation, the latency of five main components \u2014\nBall observation (i.e. latency of the ball perception system),\nABB observation, Festo observation, ABB action, Festo action\nLatencies (ms)\nComponent\n\u00b5\n\u03c3\nBall observation\n40\n8.2\nABB observation\n29\n8.2\nFesto observation\n33\n9.0\nABB action\n71\n5.7\nFesto action\n64.5\n11.5\nTABLE I: Latency distribution values.\n\u2014 are modeled as a Gaussian distribution and a distinct dis-\ntribution is used for each component. The mean and standard\ndeviation per component were measured empirically on the\nphysical system through instrumentation that logs timestamps\nthroughout the software stack (see Table I). In simulation, at\nthe beginning of each episode a latency value is sampled per\ncomponent and the observation components are interpolated\nto those latency values per step. Similarly, action latency is\nimplemented by storing the raw actions produced by the policy\nin a buffer, and linearly interpolating the action sent to the\nrobot to the desired latency.\n2) Ball distributions, observation noise, and domain ran-\ndomization: A table tennis player must be able to return\nballs with many different incoming trajectories and angular\nvelocities. That is, they experience different ball distributions.\nBall dynamics and distributions are implemented following\n[2]. Each episode, initial ball conditions are sampled from a\nparameterized distribution which is specified in a config. To\naccount for real world jitter, random noise is added to the\nball observation. Domain randomization [77, 15, 41, 75] is\nalso supported for many physical parameters. The paddle and\ntable restitution coefficients are randomized by default.\nFor more details on the simulator see Appendix D.\nD. Perception System\nTable tennis is a highly dynamic sport (an amateur-speed\nball crosses the table in 0.4 seconds), requiring extremely\nfast reaction times and precise motor control when hitting the\nball. Therefore a vision system with the desiderata of low\nlatency and high precision is required. It is also not possible\nto instrument (e.g. with LEDs) or paint the ball for active\ntracking as they are very sensitive to variation in weight or\ntexture and so a passive vision system must be employed.\nA custom vision pipeline that is fast, accurate and passive\nis designed to provide 3D balls positions. It consists of three\nmain components 1) 2D ball detection across two stereo\ncameras, 2) triangulation to recover the 3D ball position\nand 3) a sequential decision making process which manages\ntrajectory creation, filtering, and termination. The remainder\nof this section will provide details on the hardware and these\ncomponents.\n1) Camera Hardware, Synchronization and Setup: For im-\nage capture the system employs a pair of Ximea MQ013CG-\nON cameras that have a hardwired synchronization cable\nand are connected to the host computer via USB3 active\noptical cables. Cameras lenses are firmly locked and focused.\nSynchronization timestamps are used to match images down-\nstream. Many different cameras were tried, but these had high\nframe rates (the cameras can run at 125FPS at a resolution of\n1280x1024) and an extremely low latency of 388\u00b5s. Other\ncameras were capable of higher FPS, at the cost of more\nlatency which is not acceptable in this high-speed domain.\nTo achieve the desired performance the camera uses a global\nshutter with a short (4ms) exposure time and only returns the\nraw, unprocessed Bayer pattern.\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\ny-position (mm)\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\nbias (mm)\nx-same-side\ny-same-side\nz-same-side\nx-opposite-sides\ny-opposite-sides\nz-opposite-sides\nFig. 3: Quantification of triangulation bias over the length\nof playing area (y-position) at a height of 250mm above the\ncenter line. The more orthogonal viewpoints offered by placing\ncameras on opposite sides of the tables lead to an order of\nmagnitude reduction in triangulation bias.\nThe ball is small and moves fast, so capturing it accurately\nis a challenge. Ideally the cameras would be as close to the\naction as possible, but in a dual camera setup, each needs\nto view the entire play area. Additionally, putting sensitively\ncalibrated cameras in the path of fast moving balls is not\nideal. Instead, the cameras are mounted roughly 2m above\nthe play area on each side of the table and are equipped\nwith Fujinon FE185C086HA-1 \u201cfisheye\u201d lenses that expand\nthe view to the full play area, including the gantries. While\ncapturing more of the environment, the fisheye lens distortion\nintroduces challenges in calibration and additional uncertainty\nin triangulation.\nThe direct linear transform (DLT) method [35] for binocular\nstereo vision estimates a 3D position from these image loca-\ntions in the table\u2019s coordinate frame. However, the problem of\nnon-uniform and non-zero mean bias known as triangulation\nbias [23] must be considered in optimizing camera placement.\nTwo stereo camera configurations are considered, two over-\nhead cameras viewing the scene from: 1) the same side of the\ntable and 2) opposite sides. Simulation is used to quantify\ntriangulation bias across these configurations and decouple\ntriangulation from potential errors in calibration. Quantifying\nthis bias for common ball positions (see Figure 3) indicates\nthat positioning the cameras on opposite table sides results\nin a significant reduction in the overall triangulation bias.\nFurthermore, this configuration also benefits from a larger\nbaseline between the cameras for reducing estimation variance\n[25].\n2) Ball Detection: The core of the perception system lies\nwith ball detection. The system uses a temporal convolutional\narchitecture to process each camera\u2019s video stream indepen-\ndently and provides information about the ball location and\nvelocity for the downstream triangulation and filtering (see\nFigure 4). The system uses raw Bayer images and tempo-\nral convolutions, which allow it to efficiently process each\nvideo stream independently and thus improve the latency\nand accuracy of ball detection. The output structure takes\nFig. 4: Ball Detection. These synchronized images (cropped\nto approximately 50% normal size) show the temporal con-\nvolutional network detecting the ball (detected ball center in\npixels) independently from cameras on both sides of the table.\nThese detections are triangulated and used for 3D tracking.\ninspiration from CenterNet [99, 100] by producing per location\npredictions that include: a ball score indicating corresponding\nto the likelihood of the ball center at that location, a 2D local\noffset to accommodate sub-pixel resolution, and a 2D estimate\nof the ball velocity in pixels.\na) Direct Processing of Bayer Images: The detection\nnetwork takes the raw Bayer pattern image [7] as input directly\nfrom the high speed camera after cropping to the play area\nat a resolution of 512 \u00d7 1024. By skipping Bayer to RGB\nconversion, 1ms (or 15% of the time between images) of\nconversion induced latency per camera is avoided and data\ntransferred from camera to host to accelerator is reduced\nby\n2\n3, further reducing latency. In contrast to other models\nutilizing Bayer images [14], no loss in performance was found\nusing the raw format, largely due to special attention given to\nstructure of the 2 \u00d7 2 Bayer pattern and ensuring the first\nconvolution layer is also set to have a stride of 2 \u00d7 2. This\nalignment means that the individual weights of the first layer\nare only responsible for a single color across all positions of\nthe convolution operation. The immediate striding also benefits\nwall-clock time by down-sampling the input to a quarter of\nthe original size. The alignment with the Bayer pattern is also\nextended to any crop operations during training as discussed\nlater in this section.\nb) Detector Backbone with Buffered Temporal Convolu-\ntions: A custom deep-learning based ball detector is used\nto learn the right combination of color, shape and motion\nfor identifying the ball in play. Its architecture falls in the\ncategory of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a\ncompact size of only 27k parameters spread over five spatial\nconvolutional layers and two temporal convolutions to capture\nmotion features. Compared to related architectures such as\nConvLSTM [85], this fully convolutional approach restricts\nthe temporal influence of the predictions to a finite temporal\nwindow allowing for greater interpretability and fault diagno-\nsis. Full details of the architecture are provided in Appendix\nE.\nTemporal convolutional operations are employed to capture\nmotion as a visual cue for detecting the ball in play and the\ndirection of motion. In contrast to the typical implementation\nthat requires a window of frames to be presented at each\ntimestep, the implementation in this system only requires a\nsingle frame to be presented to the CNN for each timestep\nduring inference. This change minimises data transfer from\nthe host device to the accelerator running the CNN operations,\na critical throughput bottleneck. This temporal layer creates a\nbuffer to store the input feature for the next timestep as in\nKhandelwal et al. [49].\nc) Training the Detector Model: To train the detection\nmodel, a dataset of 2.3M small temporal patches were selected\nto match the receptive field of the architecture (64\u00d764 pixels\nand n frames). The patches are selected from frames with a\nlabeled ball position where a single positive patch is defined\nas being centered on the ball position in the current frame with\nthe temporal dimension filled with the same spatial position\nbut spanning [t \u2212 n + 1, t]. Similarly a negative patch can\nbe selected from the same frame at a random location which\ndoes not overlap with the positive patch. Examples of positive\nand negative patches are provided in the Appendix. Special\nconsideration is taken to align the patch selection with the\nBayer pattern by rounding the patch location to the nearest\neven number. This local patch based training has several\nbenefits; it 1) reduces the training time by 50\u00d72, 2) helps\ngeneralization across different parts of the image as the model\nis unable to rely on global statistics of ball positions, 3) offers\na more fine-grained selection of training data for non-trivial\ncases e.g. when another ball is still moving in the scene, and\nsimilarly 4) allows for hard negative mining [89] on sequences\nwhere it is known for no ball to exist in play.\nFor each patch the separate outputs each have a correspond-\ning loss. First, the ball score is optimized using the standard bi-\nnary cross-entropy loss for both positive and negative patches.\nFor positive patches only, the local offset is optimized using\nthe mean-squared error loss using the relative position between\nthe corresponding pixel coordinate and the ball center in the\ncurrent frame. The velocity prediction is similarly optimized,\ninstead using the relative position of the ball in next frame to\nthe current frame as the regression target.\n3) 3D Tracking: To have a consistent representation that is\ninvariant to camera viewpoint, the ball is represented in 3D\nin the table\u2019s coordinate frame. If the maximum score in both\nimages are above a learnt threshold, their current and next\nimage positions using the local offset and velocity predictions\nare triangulated using DLT [35]. This corresponds to the 3D\nposition and 3D velocity of the ball in the table frame. Finally\nthese observations are provided to a recursive Kalman filter\n[46] to refine the estimated ball state before its 3D position is\nsent to the robot policy.\nE. Running on the Real Robot\nAs an analog to the simulated environment (Section II-C)\nthere is an equivalent Gym environment for the real hardware.\nThis environment must contend with an additional set of\nchallenges that are either nonexistent or trivial in simulation:\n1) continuous raw sensor observation at different frequencies\nthat is subjected to jitter and real world noise, 2) determining\nthe start of an episode, 3) monitoring environment state, 4)\nenvironment resets.\n2Two 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 n patches are required per frame as opposed to the full\n512 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 n frames.\n1) Observation generation: In the simulator, the state of\nevery object is known and can be queried at fixed intervals.\nIn contrast, the real environment receives sensor readings\nfrom different modalities at different frequencies (e.g. the ball,\nABB, Festo) that may be inaccurate or arrive irregularly. To\ngenerate policy observations, the sensor observations, along\nwith their timestamps are buffered and interpolated or extrap-\nolated to the environment step timestamp. To address noise\nand jitter a bandpass filter is applied to the observation buffer\nbefore interpolation (see Appendix F). These observations\nare afterwards converted according to the policy observation\nspecification.\n2) Episode Starts: Simulators provide a direct function to\nreset the environment to a start state instantly. In the real\nworld, the robot must be physically moved to a start state with\ncontrollers based on standard S-curve trajectory planning at the\nend of the episode or just after a paddle hit. The latter was\nshown to be beneficial in [2], so that a human and robot could\ninteract as fast as possible. An episode starts when a valid\nball is thrown towards the robot. The real world must rely on\nvision to detect this event and can be subject to spurious false\npositives, balls rolling on the table, bad ball throws, etc., which\nneed to be taken into consideration. Therefore an episode is\nstarted only if a ball is detected incoming toward a robot from\na predefined region of space.\n3) Referee:\nTo interface with the GymAPI a process\ncalled Referee generates the reward, done, and info using the\nStateMachine, RewardManager, and DoneManager\nas defined in Section II-C. It receives raw sensor observations\nat different frequencies and updates a PyBullet instance.\nThe observations are filtered (see Appendix F) and used to\nupdate the PyBullet state (only the position). It calculates\ndifferent ball contact events (see Appendix D), compensates\nfor false positives, and uses simple heuristics and closest point\nthresholds to determine high confidence ball contact detections\nto generate the events used by the previously mentioned\ncomponents.\n4) Automatic system reset \u2014 continuously introducing\nballs: An important aspect of a real world robotic system\nis environment reset. If each episode requires a lengthy reset\nprocess or human intervention, then progress will be slow.\nHuman table tennis players also face this problem and so-\ncalled \u201ctable tennis robots\u201d are commercially available to\nshoot balls continuously and even in a variety of programmed\nways. Almost all of these machines accomplish this task\nwith a hopper of balls that introduces a ball to two or more\nrotating wheels forcing it out at a desired speed and spin (see\nFigure 1 left). Unfortunately, while many of these devices are\n\u201cprogrammable\u201d, none provide true APIs and instead rely on\nphysical interfaces. Therefore, an off-the-shelf thrower was\ncustomized with a Pololu motor controller and an infrared\nsensor for detecting throws, allowing it to be controlled over\nUSB. This setup allows balls to be introduced purely through\nsoftware control.\nHowever, the ball thrower is still limited by the hopper\ncapacity. A system to automate the refill process was designed\nthat exploits the light weight of table tennis balls by blowing\nair to return them to the hopper. A ceiling-mounted fan blows\ndown to remove balls stuck on the table, which is surrounded\nby foamcore to direct the balls into carpeted pathways. At each\ncorner of the path is a blower fan (typically meant for drying\nout carpet) that directs air across the floor. The balls circulate\naround the table until they reach a ramp that directs them to a\ntube that also uses air to transport them back into the hopper.\nWhen the thrower detects it hasn\u2019t shot a ball for a while, the\nfans turn on for 40 seconds, refilling the hopper so training\nor evaluation can continue indefinitely. See Appendix F for a\ndiagram and the video at https://youtu.be/uFcnWjB42I0 for a\ndemonstration.\nOne demonstration of the utility of this system is through\nthe experiments in this paper. For example, the simulator\nparameter ablation studies (Section III-A) involved evaluat-\ning over 150 policies in 450+ independent evaluations on\na physical robot with 22.5k+ balls thrown. All evaluations\nwere conducted remotely and required onsite intervention just\nonce3.\nF. Design of Robot Policies\nPolicies have been trained for this system using a variety\nof approaches. This section details the basic structure of these\npolicies and any customization needed for specific methods.\n1) Policies: The policy input consists of a history of the\npast eight robot joint and ball states, and it outputs the desired\nrobot state, typically a velocity for each of the eight joints\n(joint space policies). Many robot control frequencies ranging\nfrom from 20Hz - 100Hz have been explored, but 100Hz is\nused for most experiments. Most policies are compact, repre-\nsented as a three layer, 1D, fully convolutional gated dilated\nCNN with \u22481k parameters introduced in [26]. However, it is\nalso possible to deploy larger policies. For example, a 13m\nparameter policy consisting of two LSTM layers with a fully\nconnected output layer has successfully controlled the robot\nat 60Hz [20].\n2) Robot Policies in Task Space: Joint space policies lack\nthe relation between joint movement and the task at hand. A\nmore compact task space \u2014 the pose of the robot end effector\n\u2014 is especially beneficial in in robotics, showing significant\nimprovements in learning of locomotion and manipulation\ntasks [21, 60, 95, 57].\nStandard task space control uses the Jacobian Matrix to\ncalculate joint torques or velocities given target pose, target\nend effector velocities, joint angles and joint velocities. This\nsystem employs a reduced (pitch invariant) version with 5\ndimensions. Instead of commanding the full pose of the end\neffector, it commands the position in 3 dimensions and the\nsurface normal of the paddle in 2 dimensions (roll and yaw). In\ncontrast to the default joint space policies, which use velocity\ncontrol, task space policies are position controlled, which have\nthe added benefit of easily defining a bounding cube that the\npaddle should operate in. The robot state component of the\n3Some tape became unstuck and the balls escaped.\nobservation space is also represented in task space, making\npolicies independent of a robot\u2019s form factor and enabling\ntransfer of learned policies across different robots (see Section\nIII-D).\nG. Blackbox Gradient Sensing (BGS)\nThe design of the system allows for interaction with many\ndifferent learning approaches, as long as they conform to\nthe given APIs. The system supports training using a variety\nof methods including BGS [2] (evolutionary strategies), PPO\n[83] and SAC [33] (reinforcement learning), and GoalsEye\n(behavior cloning). The rest of the section describes BGS,\nsince it is used as the training algorithm in all the system\nstudies in this paper (see Section III).\nBGS is an ES algorithm. This class of algorithm maximize\na smoothed version of expected episode return, R, given by:\nR\u03c3(\u03b8) = E\u03b4\u223cN (0,Id)[R(\u03b8 + \u03c3\u03b4)]\n(1)\nwhere \u03c3 > 0 controls the precision of the smoothing, and \u03b4 is a\nrandom normal perturbation vector with the same dimension as\nthe policy parameters \u03b8. \u03b8 is perturbed by adding or subtracting\nN Gaussian perturbations \u03b4Ri and calculating episode return,\nR+\ni and R\u2212\ni\nfor each direction. Assuming the perturbations,\n\u03b4Ri, are rank ordered with \u03b4R1 being the top performing\ndirection, then the policy update can be expressed as:\n\u03b8\n\u2032 = \u03b8 + \u03b1 1\n\u03c3R\nk\nX\ni=1\n\"\u0010\u0010 1\nm\nm\nX\nj=1\nR+\ni,j\n\u0011\n\u2212\n\u0010 1\nm\nm\nX\nj=1\nR\u2212\ni,j\n\u0011\u0011\n\u03b4Ri\n#\n(2)\nwhere \u03b1 is the step size, \u03c3R is the standard deviation of\neach distinct reward (positive and negative direction), N is\nthe number of directions sampled per parameter update, and\nk(< N) is the number of top directions (elites). m is the\nnumber of repeats per direction to reduce variance for reward\nestimation. R+\ni,j is the reward corresponding to the j-th repeat\nof i-th in the positive direction. R\u2212\ni,j is the same but in the\nnegative direction.\nBGS is an improvement upon a popular ES algorithm\nARS [59], with two major changes.\n1) Reward differential elite-choice.: In ARS, rewards are\nranked yielding an ordering of directions based on the absolute\nrewards of either the positive or negative directions. BGS\ntakes the absolute difference in rewards between the positive\nand negative directions and rank the differences to yield an\nordering over directions. ARS can be interpreted as ranking\ndirections in absolute reward space, whereas BGS ranks di-\nrections according to reward curvature:\nARS: Sort \u03b4Ri by max{R+\ni , R\u2212\ni }.\n(3)\nBGS: Sort \u03b4Ri by |R+\ni \u2212 R\u2212\ni |.\n(4)\n2) Orthogonal sampling: Orthogonal ensembles of per-\nturbations \u03b4Ri [18] relies on constructing perturbations \u03b4Ri\nin blocks, where each block consists of pairwise orthogonal\nsamples. Those samples are still of Gaussian marginal distri-\nbutions, matching those of the regular non-orthogonal variant.\nThe feasibility of such a construction comes from the isotropic\nproperty of the Gaussian distribution (see: [18] for details).\nBGS policies are trained in simulation and transferred zero-\nshot to the physical hardware. An important note is that\nthe BGS framework can also fine tune policies on hardware\nthrough the real Gym API (Section II-E). Hyperparameters\nmust be adjusted in this case to account for there only being\none \u201cworker\u201d to gather samples.\nIII. SYSTEM STUDIES\nThis section describes several experiments that explore and\nevaluate the importance of the various components of the\nsystem.\nExcept where noted, the experiments use a ball return task\nfor training and testing. A ball is launched towards the robot\nsuch that it bounces on the robot\u2019s side of the table (a standard\nrule in table tennis). The robot must then hit the ball back over\nthe net so it lands on the opposite side of the table. Although\nother work has applied this system to more complex tasks\n(e.g. cooperative human rallies [2]), a simpler task isolates\nthe variables we are interested in from complications like\nvariability and repeatability of humans.\nFor real robot evaluations, making contact with the ball is\nworth one point and landing on the opposing side is worth\nanother point, for a maximum episode return of 2.0. A single\nevaluation is the average return over 50 episodes. Simulated\ntraining runs typically have additional reward shaping applied\nthat change the maximum episode return to 4.0 (see Appendix\nD).\nA. Effect of Simulation Parameters on Zero-Shot Transfer\nOur goal in this section is to assess the sensitivity of policy\nperformance to environment parameters. We focus on the zero-\nshot sim-to-real performance of trained policies and hope that\nthis analysis (presented in Figure 5) sheds some light on which\naspects of similar systems need to be faithfully aligned with\nthe real world and where error can be tolerated. For the effects\non training quality see Appendix H.\n1) Evaluation methodology: For each test in this section,\n10 models were trained in simulation using BGS described\nin Section II-G for 10,000 training iterations (equivalent to\n60m environment episodes, or roughly 6B environment steps).\nIn order to assess how different simulated training settings\naffect transfer independent of how they affect training quality,\nwe only evaluate models that trained well in simulation (i.e.,\nachieved more than 97.5% of the maximum possible return).\nThe resulting set of policies were evaluated on the real setup\nfor 3 \u00d7 50 episodes.\n2) Modeling latency is crucial for good performance:\nThe latency study presented in Figure 5 (top left) show that\npolicies are sensitive to latency. The baseline model (i.e. the\nmodel that uses latency values as measured on hardware) had\na significantly higher zero-shot transfer than any of the other\nlatency values tested. The next best model had 50% of the\nbaseline latency, achieving an average zero-shot transfer of\n1.33 compared with 1.83 for the baseline.

Policies are sensitive to latency and physical\nparameter values, yet surprisingly robust to ball observation\nnoise and changes in the ball distribution. Charts show the\nmean (with 95% CIs) zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. 2.0 is a\nperfect score with a policy returning all balls. R = restitution\ncoefficient.\nscores for the other latency levels tested (0%, 20% and 150%)\nhad very poor performance. Interestingly, some policies are\nlucky and transfer relatively well \u2014 for example one policy\nwith 0% latency had an average score of 1.54. However,\nperformance is highly inconsistent when simulated latency is\ndifferent from measured parameters.\n3) Anchoring ball distributions to the real world matters,\nbut precision is not essential: The ball distribution study\nshown in Figure 5 (top right) indicate that policies are robust to\nvariations in ball distributions provided the real world distribu-\ntion (thrower) is contained within the training distribution. The\nmedium and wide distributions were derived from the baseline\ndistribution but are 25% and 100% larger respectively (see\nAppendix H). The distribution derived from a different ball\nthrower (thrower 2) is also larger than the baseline thrower\ndistribution but effectively contains it. In contrast, very small\ntraining distributions (tiny) or distributions which are disjoint\nfrom the baseline distribution in one or more components\n(velocity offset \u2014 disjoint in y velocity) result in performance\ndegradation.\n4) Policies are robust to observation noise provided it\nhas zero mean: The observation noise study in Figure 5\n(bottom left) revealed that policies have a high tolerance for\nzero-mean observation noise. Doubling the noise to +/- 8cm\n(4 ball diameters in total) or removing it altogether had a\nminor impact on performance. However, if noise is biased\n125 FPS\n(baseline)\n100 FPS\n75 FPS\n50 FPS\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nReward\nFPS\n~6.5ms\n(baseline)\n12ms\n50ms\n150ms\n250ms\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nReward\nLatency\n0cm\n(baseline)\n[-4, 4]\ncm\n[-1, 7]\ncm\n[-8, 8]\ncm\n[-16, 16]\ncm\n[-2, 14]\ncm\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nReward\nNoise\nFig. 6: Perception resilience studies. Reducing FPS and in-\ncreasing latency have threshold points where performance of\nthe system is stable until they reach a point where the robot can\nno longer react the to ball in them. Additional noise causes\ngraceful degradation in performance, increased by non-zero\nmean distributions (common in vision triangulation).\nperformance suffers substantially. Adding a 4cm (one ball\ndiameter) bias to the default noise results in a 36% drop in\nreward (approximately 80% drop in return rate).\n5) Policies are sensitive to physical parameters, which can\nhave complex interactions with each other: The physical\nparameter ablations in Figure 5 (bottom right) reveal how\nsensitive policies are to all parameter values tested. Removing\nrandomization from the table restitution coefficient (table: no\nR randomize) degrades performance by 14%. Increasing the\nball restitution coefficient by just 2% reduces performance by\n25%, whilst increasing the table restitution coefficient by 8%\nreduces performance by 36%.\nThis study also highlights a current limitation of the system.\nSetting key parameters in the simulator such as the table and\npaddle restitution coefficients, or the paddle mass to values\nestimated following the process described in Appendix D led\nto worse performance than tuned values (see measured v.s.\ntuned and also Appendix H for all parameter values). We\nhypothesize this is because ball spin is not correctly modelled\nin the simulator and that the tuned values compensate for this\nfor the particular ball distributions used in the real world.\nOne challenge of a complex system with many interacting\ncomponents is that multiple errors can compensate for each\nother, making them difficult to notice if performance does\nnot suffer dramatically. It was only through conducting these\nstudies that we became aware of the drop in performance from\nusing measured values. In future work we plan to model spin\nand investigate if this resolves the performance degradation\nfrom using measured values. For further discussion on this\ntopic, see Appendix I.\nB. Perception Resilience Studies\nIn this section we explore important factors in the perception\nsystem and how they affect end-to-end performance of the\nentire system. Latency and accuracy are two major factors and\ntypically there is a tradeoff between them. A more accurate\nmodel may take longer to process but for fast moving objects\n(like a table tennis ball) it may be better to have a less accurate\nresult more quickly. Framerate also plays a role. If processing\ntakes longer than frames are arriving, latency will increase\nover time and eventually require dropping frames to catch up.\nFor these experiments we select three high performing\nmodels from the baseline simulator parameter studies and test\nthem on the real robot while modulating vision performance in\nthe following ways: (1) reduce the framerate of the cameras\n, (2) increase latency by queuing observations and sending\nthem to the policy at fixed intervals, and (3) reduce accuracy\nby injecting zero mean and non-zero mean noise to the ball\nposition (over and above inherent noise in the system).\nThe results from these experiments can be seen in Figure 6.\nFor both framerate and latency, the performance stays con-\nsistent with the baseline until there is a heavy dropoff at 50\nFPS and 150ms respectively, at which point the robot likely\nno longer has sufficient time to react to the ball and swings\ntoo late, almost universally resulting in balls that hit the net\ninstead of going over. There is a gentle decline in performance\nas noise increases, but the impact is much greater for non-zero\nmean noise: going from zero mean ([-4, 4] cm) noise to non-\nzero mean ([-1, 7] cm) is equivalent to doubling the zero mean\nnoise ([-8, 8] cm). The interpolation of observations described\nin Section II-E likely serves as a buffer against low levels of\nzero mean noise. Qualitatively, the robot\u2019s behavior was jittery\nand unstable when moderate noise was introduced. Overall,\nthe stable performance over moderate framerate and latency\ndeclines implies that designing around accuracy would be ideal\nfor this task, although as trajectories become more varied and\nnuanced higher framerates may be necessary to capture their\ndetailed behavior.\nC. ES Training Studies\nBGS has been a consistent and reliable method for learning\ntable tennis tasks on this system in simulation and fine-\ntuning in the real world. In this section we ablate the main\ncomponents of BGS and compare it with a closely related\nmethod, ARS.\nFigure 7 (top) presents a comparison of BGS and ARS on\nthe default ball return task against a narrow ball distribution.\nFor both methods we set number of perturbations to 200,\n\u03c3 to 0.025, and the proportion of perturbations selected as\nelites to 30%. We roll out each perturbation for 15 episodes\nand average the reward to reduce reward variance due to\nstochasticity in the environment. We also apply the common\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\nES Iterations\n2\n3\n4\nReward\nARS\nBGS\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000 12000\nES Iterations\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nReward\nARS (step 1e-4)\nARS (step 1e-3)\nARS (step 4e-3)\nARS (step 1e-2)\nARS (step 1e-1)\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000 12000\nES Iterations\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nReward\nARS\nARS-ortho\nARS-diff\nBGS\nFig. 7: BGS ablation studies.

(right) Improvements\nwith reward differential elite-choice technique, orthogonal\nperturbation sampling and their combination (BGS).\napproach of state normalization [82, 71]. Under these settings,\nthe methods are comparable.\nNext we consider a harder ball targeting task where the\nobjective for the policy is to return the ball to a precise\n(randomized per episode) location on the opponent\u2019s side of\nthe table [20]. We further increase the difficulty by increasing\nthe range of incoming balls, i.e. using a wider ball distribution,\nand by decreasing the number of perturbations to 50. Tuning\nthe step size \u03b1 was crucial for successful policy training with\nARS (Figure 7 bottom left). An un-tuned step-size may lead\nto extremely slow training or fast training with sub-optimal\nasymptotic performance.\nFigure 7 (bottom right) shows the enhancements in training\nmade by the BGS techniques independently and collectively\ncompared to baseline ARS. Reward differential elite-choice\nand orthogonal sampling leads to faster convergence. As a\nresult, BGS is the default ES algorithm for policy training.\nD. Acting and Observing in Task Space\nThe previous results use joint space for observations and\nactions. In this section we explore policies that operate in \u201ctask\nspace\u201d (see Section II-F2). Task space has several benefits:\nit is compact, interpretable, provides a bounding cube for\nthe end effector as a safety mechanism, and aligns the robot\naction and the observation spaces with ball observations. In\nour experiments we show that task spaces policies train faster\nand, more importantly, can be transferred to different robot\nmorphologies.\nFigure 8 (top left) compares training speed between joint\nspace (JS), task space for actions \u2014 TS(Act), and full task\nspace policies (actions and observations) \u2014 TS(Act&Obs).\nBoth task spaces policies train faster than JS policies.

For transfer performance of these\npolicies see Appendix K.\nOne crucial benefit of operating in task space is the robust-\nness to different robots or morphologies. To demonstrate this,\nwe first take the TS(Act&Obs) model trained in the damped\nenvironment and transfer it to the real robot (Figure 8 bottom).\nPerformance is almost perfect with a score of 1.9. Next we\nchange the initial pose of the robot and freeze two of the arm\njoints. Policy performance is maintained under a pose change\n(ABB 120T & Modified Default Pose (MDP)) and only drops\nslightly when some joints are also frozen (ABB 120T & MDP\n+ 2 Frozen Joints). We then evaluate the policy on a robot\nwith a different morphology and ball distribution and see that\nperformance drops substantially. However, a task space policy\nis easily adaptable to new settings without retraining by adding\na residual to actions to shift the paddle position. This is not\npossible when operating in joint space. Observing the robot\nshowed that it was swinging too low and slightly off-angle and\nso adding a residual of 7cm above the table and 0.2 radians\nof roll causes the original policy performance to be nearly\nrecovered (ABB 1100-4 & New Ball Dist & Manual Offset).\nE. Applying to a New Task: Catching\nWhile the system described above was designed for table\ntennis, it is general enough to be applied to other agile tasks.\nIn this section, we apply it to a new task of catching a thrown\nball and assess the effect of latency modelling, similar to the\nlatency experiment from Section III-A.\n4Created by lowering the restitution coefficient of the paddle and ball, and\nincreasing the linear damping of the ball.\nWe used a similar system setup with minor modifications:\na single horizontal linear rail (instead of two) and a lacrosse\nhead as the end effector. The software stack and agents are\nsimilar with small differences: simplified RewardManager\nand DoneManager, soft body modelling of the net in sim-\nulation, trajectory prediction inputs for agents, and handling\nocclusions when the ball is close to the net. The BGS agents\nare similarly trained in a simulator before being transferred to\nthe real hardware, where they are fine-tuned. Agents achieve\na final catching success rate of 85 \u223c 90%. For full details on\nthe task see related work [84].\nThis task has a much larger variance in sim-to-real transfer\ndue to difficulty in accurately modelling net & ball capture\ndynamics. As in the table tennis study, agents were trained in\nsimulation with latencies of 100%, 0%, 20%, 50%, and 150%\nof baseline latency. Experiments with lower latency (0%, 20%,\nand 50%) all transferred poorly, between 0 \u223c 10% catch\nrate. Curiously, baseline latency and 150% latency performed\nsimilarly, with one 150% run achieving the best zero-shot\ntransfer ever: a score equaling policies fine-tuned on the real\nrobot. This finding contradicts the results in the table tennis\ntask, which prompted further investigation and revealed that\nthe latency for this task was set incorrectly in the configuration\nfile; the real value was much closer to the 150% value.\nThis revelation dovetails with the 50% latency table tennis\nresults: a close latency can still give decent performance,\nbut accurate values are better. As such, it may be useful\nto generally run ablation studies such as these to challenge\nassumptions about the system and potentially find bugs.\nIV. RELATED WORK\nA. Agile Robotic Learning\nThe space of agile robotic learning systems is varied. It\nincludes autonomous vehicles such as cars [76, 79, 70, 9, 10],\nlegged locomotion [73, 91, 32, 78, 86, 87, 4], as well as\ndynamic throwing [3, 52, 29, 98], catching [84], and hitting\n\u2014 which is where table tennis fits.\nMany of these systems face similar challenges \u2014 envi-\nronment resets, latency, safety, sim-to-real, perception, and\nsystem running speed as exemplified in strict inference and\nenvironment step time requirements.\nThe benefits of automatic resets have been demonstrated\nin quadrupedal systems [86, 87] and throwing [98]. To our\nknowledge, this system is the first table tennis learning system\nwith automatic resets, enabling autonomous training and eval-\nuation in the real world for hours without human intervention.\nLatency is a well known problem in physical learning\nsystems [91]. The system contributes to this area by extend-\ning [91], modeling multiple latencies in simulation, and by\nvalidating its importance through extensive experiments. Or-\nthogonally, the system also includes observation interpolation\non the physical system as a useful technique for increasing the\nrobustness of deployed policies to latency variation (e.g. from\njitter). We demonstrated empirically the robustness of policies\nto substantial injections of latency and hypothesize that the\nobservation interpolation plays a crucial role in this.\nSafety is another crucial element that becomes very im-\nportant with fast moving robots. Trajectory planners [54] can\navoid static obstacles, neural networks can check for collisions\n[48], safe RL can be used to restrict state spaces [97], or\na system can learn from safe demonstrations [67, 68, 40].\nIn contrast, this system runs a parallel simulation during\ndeployment as a safety layer. Doing so is beneficial because\nthe robot policy runs at a high frequency and there are several\nphysical environments and robots and it enables (1) definition\nof undesirable states and (2) preventing a physical robot from\nreaching them. To the best of our knowledge this is also a\nnovel component of the system.\nLearning controllers from scratch in the real world can be\nchallenging for an agile robot due to sample inefficiency and\ndangers in policy exploration. Training first in a simulator and\nthen deploying to the real robot\n[56, 75, 91] (i.e. sim-to-\nreal) is an effective way to mitigate both issues, but persistent\ndifferences between simulated and real world environments\ncan be difficult to overcome [42, 72].\nPerception is crucial in helping robots adapt to changes\nin the environment [4, 96] and interact with relevant objects\n[98, 52]. When objects need to be tracked at high speed such\nas in catching or hitting, it is typical to utilize methods such\nas motion-capture systems [65] however for table tennis, the\nball needs to adhere to strict standards that prevent instru-\nmentation or altering of the ball properties. Passive vision\napproaches for detecting the location within a video frame\nof a bright colored ball from a stationary camera may seem\ntrivial, however, applying image processing techniques [92]\nsuch as color thresholding, shape fitting [37], and background\nsubtraction are problematic. When considering the typical\nvideo captured from the cameras several factors in the scene\nrender such approaches brittle. For example, the color of\nthe natural light changes through out the day. Even under\nfixed lighting, the video stream is captured at 125Hz which\nis above the Nyquist frequency of the electricity powering\nfluorescent lights, resulting in images that flicker between\nframes. Additionally, there are typically several leftover balls\nfrom previous episodes around the scene which share the same\ncolor and shape as the ball in play. These distractors make\ndata association more of a challenge for down stream tracking.\nFinally, extracting things that move is also a challenge when\nother basic visual cues are unreliable because there is always\na robot and or a human moving in the scene. The perception\ncomponent of the system in this paper uniquely combined all\nthese visual cues by learning to detect the ball in an end-to-\nend fashion that is robust to visual ambiguities and provides\nboth precise ball locations and velocity estimates.\nFinally, prior work in robot learning varies by how much\nit focuses on the system compared with the problem being\ntackled. [22, 45, 47, 87, 66, 92, 56] are examples of works\nwhich dedicate substantial attention to the system. They pro-\nvide valuable details and know-how about what mattered for\na system to work in practice. This work is spiritually similar.\nB. Robotic Table Tennis\nRobotic table tennis is a challenging, dynamic task [13]\nthat has been a test bed for robotics research since the\n1980s [8, 51, 34, 36, 66]. The current exemplar is the Omron\nrobot [55]. Until recently, most methods tackled the problem\nby identifying a virtual hitting point for the racket [63, 64,\n6, 69, 101, 39, 88, 58]. These methods depend on being\nable to predict the ball state at time t either from a ball\ndynamics model which may be parameterized [63, 64, 61, 62]\nor by learning to predict it [66, 69, 101]. Various methods\ncan then generate robot joint trajectories given these target\nstates [66, 63, 64, 61, 62, 67, 68, 40, 53, 92, 27]. More\nrecently, Tebbe et al. [93] learned to predict the paddle target\nusing reinforcement learning (RL).\nSuch approaches can be limited by their ability to predict\nand generate trajectories. An alternative line of research seeks\nto do away with hitting points and ball prediction models,\ninstead focusing on high frequency control of a robot\u2019s joints\nusing either RL [13, 101, 26] or learning from demonstra-\ntions [68, 17, 16]. Of these, B\u00a8uchler et al. [13] is the most\nsimilar to the system in this paper. Similar to B\u00a8uchler et al.\n[13], this system trains RL policies to control robot joints at\nhigh frequencies given ball and robot states as policy inputs.\nHowever B\u00a8uchler et al. [13] uses hybrid sim and real training\nas well as a robot arm driven by pneumatic artificial muscles\n(PAMs), whilst this system uses a motor-driven arm. Motor-\ndriven arms are a common choice and used by [17, 92, 93, 67].\nV. TAKEAWAYS AND LESSONS LEARNED\nHere we summarize lessons learned from the system that\nwe hope are widely applicable to high-speed learning robotic\nsystems beyond table tennis.\nChoosing the right robots is important. The system started\nwith a scaled down version of the current setup as a proof of\nconcept and then graduated to full-scale, industrial robots (Ap-\npendix B). Industrial robots have many benefits such as low\nlatency and high repeatability, but they can come with \u201cclosed-\nbox\u201d issues that must be worked through (Section II-B).\nA safety simulator is a dynamic and customizable solution\nto constraining operations with high frequency control com-\npared to high-level trajectory planners (Section II-B).\nA configurable, modular, and multi-language (e.g. C++ and\nPython) system improves research and development velocity\nby making experimentation and testing easy for the researcher\n(Section II-B).\nLatency modeling is critical for real world transfer per-\nformance as indicated by our experimental results. Other\nenvironmental factors may have varying effects that change\nbased on the task (Section III-A). For example, ball spin is not\naccurately modeled in the ball return task, but can be critical\nwhen more nuanced actions are required.\nAccurate environmental perception is also a key factor in\ntransfer performance. In this system\u2019s case many factors were\nnon-obvious to non-vision experts: camera placement, special\ncalibration techniques, lens locks, etc. all resulted in better\ndetection (Section II-D).\nGPU data buffering, raw Bayer pattern detection, and patch\nbased training substantially increase the performance of high\nfrequency perception (Section II-D). Rather than using an off-\nthe-shelf perception module, a purpose-built version allows\nlevels of customization that may be required for high-speed\ntasks.\nInterpolating and smoothing inputs (Section II-E) solves the\nproblem of different devices running at different frequencies.\nIt also guards against zero-mean noise and system latency\nvariability, but is less effective against other types of noise.\nAutomatic resets and remote control increase system uti-\nlization and research velocity (Section II-E). The system orig-\ninally required a human to manually collect balls and control\nthe thrower. Now that the system can be run remotely and\n\u201cindefinitely\u201d, significantly more data collection and training\ncan occur.\nES algorithms like BGS (Section II-G) are a good starting\npoint to explore the capabilities of a system, but they may\nalso be a good option in general. BGS is still the most\nsuccessful and reliable method applied in this system. Despite\npoor sample efficiency, ES methods are simple to implement,\nscalable, and robust optimizers that can even fine-tune real\nworld performance.\nHumans are highly variable and don\u2019t always follow instruc-\ntions (on purpose or not) and require significant accommoda-\ntions to address these issues and also to alleviate frustrations\n(e.g. time to reset) and ensure valuable human time is not\nwasted.\nA. Limitations and Future Work\nA guiding principal of the system has been not to solve\neverything at once. Starting with a simple task (e.g. hitting the\nball) and then scaling up to more complex tasks (e.g. playing\nwith a human) provides a path to progress naturally prioritizes\ninefficiencies to be addressed. For example, a long but clean\nenvironment reset was sufficient for learning ball return tasks,\nbut needed optimization to be sufficiently responsive to a\nhuman.\nThe current system struggles with a few key features. More\ncomplex play requires understanding the spin of the ball and\nthe system currently has no way to directly read spin and it is\nnot even included in simulation training. While it is possible\nto determine spin optically (i.e. by tracking the motion of the\nlogo on the ball), it would require significantly higher frame\nrates and resolutions than what is currently employed. Other\napproaches more suited to our setup include analyzing the\ntrajectory of the ball (which the robot may be doing implicitly)\nor including the paddle/thrower pose into the observation;\nanalogous to how many humans detect spin. Additionally\nlearning a model of the opponent if the opponent attempts\nto be deliberately deceptive, concealing of adding confusion\nto their hits.\nThe robot\u2019s range of motion is significant thanks to the\ninclusion of the gantry, but is still limited in a few key ways.\nFirstly, the safety simulator does not allow the paddle to\ngo below the height of the table, preventing the robot from\n\u201cscooping\u201d low balls. This restriction prevents the robot from\ncatching the arm between the table and gantry, which the safety\nsim was unable to prevent in testing. The robot is limited in\nside-to-side motion as well as how far forward over the table\nit can reach, so there may be balls that it physically cannot\nreturn. Finally, so far the robot has not made significant use\nof motion away from the table. We hope that training on more\ncomplex ball distributions will require the robot to make full\nuse of the play space as professional humans do.\nThe sensitivity of policies also increases as the task becomes\nmore complex. For example, slight jitter or latency in inference\nmay be imperceptible for simple ball return tasks, but more\ncomplex tasks that require higher precision quickly revealed\nthese gaps requiring performance optimizations. Sim-to-real\ngaps are also an issue; hitting a ball can be done without\ntaking spin into account, but controlling spin is essential\nfor high-level rallying. Environmental parameters and ball\nspin both become more important and incorporating domain\nrandomization is a promising path forward to integrating them\nin a robust manner. Additionally, when human opponents come\ninto play, modeling them directly or indirectly make it possible\nfor the robot to move beyond purely reactive play and to start\nincorporating strategic planning into the game.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we have explored the components of a suc-\ncessful, real-world robotic table tennis system. We discussed\nthe building blocks, trade-offs, and other design decisions that\nwent into the system and justify them with several case studies.\nWhile we do not believe the system in this paper is the perfect\nsolution to building a learning, high-speed robotic system, we\nhope that this deep-dive can serve as a reference to those who\nface similar problems and as a discussion point to those who\nhave found alternative approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Arnab Bose, Laura Downs, and\nMorgan Worthington for their work on improving the vision\ncalibration system and Barry Benight for their help with\nvideo storage and encoding. We would also like to thank Yi-\nHua Edward Yang and Khem Holden for improvements to\nthe ball thrower control stack. We also are very grateful to\nChris Harris and Razvan Surdulescu for their overall guidance\nand supervision of supporting teams such as logging and\nvisualization.

Hardware Details\n1) Host Machines: The entire system is run on a single\nLinux host machine with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X\nand multiple NVIDIA RTX A5000 accelerators. One accel-\nerator handles perception inference and another encodes the\nimages from the cameras with nvenc for storage (see Appendix\nM). Policy inference runs on CPU. The standard robot policies\nare so small that the time to transfer the input data from CPU\nto accelerator exceeds any savings in running inference on the\naccelerator.\nPrevious iterations of this system used a dual Intel Xeon E5-\n2690s, two Nvidia Titan V accelerators, and a Quadro M2000.\nThe Quadro handled video encoding and the two Titans\neach handled a single camera stream in an older iteration\nof the perception system that could not maintain framerates\nwithout splitting the load across multiple GPUs. The current\nsystem was a substantial upgrade in terms of performance; by\nswitching machines perception inference latency halved.\n2) Robots: The configuration of arm and gantry was ini-\ntially prototyped with a Widow-X arm kit and one-dimensional\nZaber linear stage. The Widow-X was comprised of several\nhobbyist Dynamixel servos. The gripper the arm came with\nwas made to hold a table tennis paddle. This prototype was\nnowhere near as capable as the current set of arms used in\nthe system (see Figure 9) but it was able to regularly return\nsimple balls, enabling testing of many initial ideas. Ultimately\na small-scale system like this was not meant to survive long\nterm frequent use: the repeated hitting motions and impact\nof the balls would strip the delicate internal gears of the\nservos, which was a major factor in pursing industrial robots\nfor reliability and robustness.\n3) Ball Thrower:\nExisting consumer table tennis ball\nthrowers offer a high level of customization and capability\nbut require some sort of manual input to operate. However,\nthe construction of the devices are not easy to replicate.\nTherefore all iterations of ball throwers in this system took\nsome form of off-the-shelf device and made it more auto-\nmated and robust. Initially, reverse engineering, breadboards,\nand a programmable microcontroller were used to simulate\nthe manual inputs through a USB interface. Ultimately, a\nmore robust system was required and a simpler thrower was\nobtained and almost all the electronic components of were\nreplaced. Aside from being more repairable and reliable, the\ncustomized thrower has higher quality parts including motors\nwith encoders that can provide feedback to the system to alert\nif there is a failure or reduction in performance. A \u201dthrow\ndetection\u201d sensor has also been added in the form of two\ninfrared sensors in the nozzle. This sensor reports back when\na ball has been thrown as well as an approximation of the\nspeed, based on the time between when the two sensors were\ntriggered.\nAlthough the current thrower is more reliable, it is not built\nto the specifications of the industrial robots in the rest of the\nFig. 9: Two ABB arms \u2014 ABB-IRB120T (left), ABB IRB 1100-4/0.58 (center) \u2014 and their end effector (right). Most\nexperiments in the paper use the 120, but the task space experiments in Section III-D were able to transfer to the 1100 with\nminimal modifications despite the different joint layout.\nsystem. The two wheels that launch the balls make physical\ncontact with them degrade over time and get dirty, requiring\ncleaning.\nC. Control Details\n1) Additional Communication Protocols: As discussed in\nSection II-B, ABB arms are controlled through the Externally\nGuided Motion (EGM) interface [1]. However, the robot\nrequires an additional interface Robot Web Services (RWS)\nprovided by ABB to control basic functions. RWS is a\nRESTful interface to the robot that allows access to various\nvariables and subroutines on the robot with simple POST and\nGET requests. The main usage of RWS is to reset the robot\nat the beginning of an experiment or when there is a problem,\nand to start the onboard EGM server.\n2) Python to C++ Interface: The interface between Python\nand C++ is implemented with Pybind11 [44]. This library\nprovides a convenient and compact syntax for calling C++\nfunctions from Python and passing values in both directions\nbetween the languages. However, just wrapping function calls\nin the low-level driver with Pybind11 is insufficient because\nthose functions would still execute in the Python thread,\nsubjecting them to all the same performance constraints as\nregular Python threads. Releasing the GIL while executing\nthe C++ function is possible but would not help due to the\noverhead of switching thread contexts.\nInstead, a pure-C++ thread is started to handle low-level\ncontrol for each of the Festo and ABB robots. These threads\ndo not access any Python data directly, so they do not require\nthe GIL and can execute in parallel to each other and the\nPython thread. Communication with these threads is done\nasynchronously via circular C++ buffers. C++ mutexes protect\naccess to these buffers and ensure thread-safety, but they only\nhave to be held briefly for read and write operations, not for\nan entire control cycle. This low-level controller can be used\nindependently from Python (ie, in a pure-C++ program), but\nin this system, the circular buffers are accessed from Python\nvia Pybind11-wrapped C++ function calls.\nEach loop iteration of the low-level controller checks for\na new command sent from Python. If none is available, it\nexecutes the remainder of the loop iteration with the previously\nsent command. Since the mutex protecting communication\nwith the Python thread is only held briefly, this helps isolate\nthe low-level controller from timing variation in the Python\nthread, thereby increasing robustness. Minimizing latency\nvariation contributed more to improving performance than\nminimizing the absolute latency because the policies could\nlearn to account for that latency in simulation.\n3) Robot Lockups and System Identification: The ABB\narms are primarily operated using the EGM interface. A se-\nquence of commands are transmitted at 248Hz which includes\na position and speed reference parameter per joint. The arms\nare sensitive to the commands and can lockup by tripping a\nhardware safety stop in several situations including:\n1) Physical collisions are detected\n2) Joints are predicted to exceed ranges\n3) Joints are being commanded to move too fast and have\nhit internal torque limits.\nThese safety stops are controlled by an ABB proprietary\nhardware controller whose predictions are not accessible in\nadvance so as to pro-actively avoid them. Safety lockups freeze\nthe robot. At best they interrupt experiments, and at worst\ncause joints to physically go out of range requiring manual re-\ncalibration. It was therefore important to implement mitigation\nin the control stack to prevent sending commands that would\ncause the robot to lockup. In addition, the actual movement of\nthe arm in response to a position + speed reference command\nis internally processed by the hardware controller using a low\npass filter + speed/position gain parameters. For the above\nreasons a system identification of the arms was performed to\ninfer such parameters and uses them to both bring parity with\nsimulation and prevent safety stops.\nThe agents produce velocity actions. In simulation these\nare directly interpreted by the PyBullet simulator. On the real\nrobot system they are run through the safety simulator stack as\ndescribed in II-B, providing a position and velocity per joint\nof the arm to reach. Directly using this result as a position\n+ speed reference to the ABB arms does not faithfully move\nthe arms through the same trajectory as seen in simulation.\nWhile the position portion of the command is accurate (fol-\nlowing the exact intended), the speed reference parameter is\ninterpreted differently by the hardware controller through gain\nparameters. The actual speed reference command is modeled\nas a combination of the velocity + torque, scaled by varying\ngain factors per component and joint. These gain factors\nwere learned through a process of system identification, by\noptimizing them with a blackbox parameter tuning framework.\nThe optimization objective was to minimize differences vs the\ntrajectory described by the position portion of the commands.\nThis tuning process replays some trajectories with different\ngain parameters to find the optimal way to set the speed\nreference portion. The result was fixed multiplicative gain\nfactors that were primarily driven by the per-joint velocity as\nobtained from the safety simulator to use as the optimal speed\nreference command.\nThe problem of avoiding safety stops is mitigated in a\nfew ways. First the safety simulator predicts collisions and\nsends the \u201dbounced-back\u201d commands so that they don\u2019t collide\nwith environment as described earlier. Secondly to prevent\nexceeding joint ranges, a predictive system caps the speed\nreference portions of the command as the robot gets closer\nto the joint limits. The system predicts motion of the joint\nfrom the commanded position + an assumed inertial motion\nusing the speed reference projected 250ms into the future\nand caps the speed ref portion of the command to prevent\nthe predicted position from exceeding joint limits. This was\nmodelled experimentally to identify the cases in which the\nhardware controller faults due to exceeding joint ranges, which\nhelped discover this predictive window of 250ms. Lastly, over-\ntorquing is minimized by reducing the safety simulator\u2019s max\njoint force limits.\nD. Simulation Details\nFour desiderata guided the design of the simulator.\n1) Compatibility with arbitrary policy training infrastruc-\nture so as to retain research flexibility, motivating the\nchoice to conform to the Gym API.\n2) Flexibility, especially for components that researchers\nexperiment with often, such as task definition, obser-\nvation space, action space, termination conditions, and\nreward function.\n3) Simulation-to-reality gap is low. \u201cLow\u201d means (1) al-\ngorithmic or training improvements demonstrated in\nsimulation carry over to the real system and (2) zero-shot\nsim-to-real policy transfer is feasible. Perfect transfer\nis not required \u2014 80%+ of simulated performance is\ntargeted.\n4) Easy to apply domain randomization to arbitrary physi-\ncal components.\nThe design isolates certain components so they are easy to\niterate on. For example, the tasks are encoded as sequences of\nstates. Transitions between states are triggered by ball contact\nevents with other objects. The task of a player returning\na ball launched from a ball thrower is represented by the\nfollowing two sequences. The first is P1 LAUNCH (the\nball is in flight towards the player after being launched from\nthe thrower) \u2192 P1 TABLE (the ball has bounced on the\nplayer\u2019s side of the table) \u2192 P1 PADDLE (the player hit\nthe ball) \u2192 P2 TABLE (the ball landed on the opponent\u2019s\nside of the table) \u2192 DONE P1 WINPOINT. The second\nis P1 LAUNCH \u2192 P1 TABLE \u2192 P1 PADDLE \u2192\nP1 NET (the ball just hit the net) \u2192 P2 TABLE \u2192\n\u2192 DONE P1 WINPOINT. This accounts for the case\nwhere the ball first hits the net after being hit by the player and\nthen bounces over and onto the opponent\u2019s side of the table.\nAll other sequences lead to DONE P1 LOSEPOINT.\nFor each task the complete set of (state, event) \u2192\nnext_state triplets is enumerated in a config file. Tasks\nare changed by initializing the StateMachine with different\nconfigs.\nAnother example is the reward function. It is common\npractice in robot learning, especially when training using the\nreinforcement learning paradigm, for the scalar reward per step\nto be a weighted combination of many reward terms. These\nterms are often algorithm and task dependent. Therefore it\nshould be straightforward to change the number of terms, the\nweight per term, and to implement new ones. Each reward term\nis specified by name along with its weight in a config. The\nRewardManager takes in that config and handles loading,\ncalculating, and summing each component. If a user wants\nto try out a new reward term, they write a reward class\nconforming to the Reward API (see below), which gets\nautomatically registered by the RewardManager, and add\nit and its weight to the config. Over 35 different reward\ncomponents have been tried \u2248 20 are in active use.\n1) Latency: The latency of key physical system compo-\nnents were empirically measured as follows. Timing details are\ntracked starting with when the system receives hardware inputs\n(perception and robot feedback), through various transforma-\ntions and IPCs (including policy inference), to when actual\nhardware commands are sent. This tracing gives a drill-down\nof latency throughout the stack with the ability to get mean and\npercentile metrics. The other half of the latency is how long\nthe robot hardware takes to physically move after being given\na command, which is separately measured by comparing time\nbetween a command being issued and receiving a feedback for\nreaching it. This completes the latency picture, covering the\nfull time taken across the loop. See Table VI 100% (baseline)\ncolumn for the default latency values per component.\n2) Ball distributions: Modeling the ball has two compo-\nnents, the dynamics and training distribution. PyBullet models\nthe contact dynamics and the in-flight ball dynamics are\nmodeled as in Abeyruwan et al. [2]. Drag is modelled with a\nfixed coefficient of 0.47 but neither an external Magnus nor\nwind force is applied to the ball in the simulation. We refer\nreaders to [2] Appendix C4 for more details on the in-flight\nball model. The initial position and velocity of the balls are\nderived following Abeyruwan et al. [2] and this determines the\ndistribution of balls that are sampled during simulated training.\nSee Table VII Thrower (baseline) column for the parameters of\nthe default ball distribution used for training the BGS policies\nin this paper.\n3) Physical Parameters: The restitution coefficients of the\nball, table, and paddle, and the friction of the paddle are\nmeasured using the method from [28]. The mass of the ball and\npaddle is also measured. All other components have estimated\nun-tuned values or use PyBullet defaults. See Table VIII Tuned\n(baseline) column for the values used.\n4) Gymnasium API: The real world and simulated environ-\nments were developed according to the Gymnasium standard\nAPI for reinforcement learning5. Dictionary formats are used\nfor observation and action specifications (for further details\non individual components, see Appendix F). All extended\nenvironment functionalities are implemented as wrappers. In\naddition, the environments are compatible with agent learn-\ning frameworks, for example, TF-Agents [31], ACME [38],\nStable-Baselines3 [81], and so on. For consistent policy evalu-\nation in simulation and hardware, TF-Agent\u2019s Actor API is em-\nployed. All the supported policies (section II-G) are wrapped\nin PyPolicy and integrated to Actor API. TF-Agents provides\ntransformations to convert the Gymnasium environment to a\nPyEnvironment.\n5) Reward API: The Reward class API is outlined below.\nLatex code style from [50].\nclass Reward:\ndef\ninit\n(self, *kwargs):\n# Initializes the reward class.\ndef compute reward(self, state machine data, done, *kwargs):\n# Computes and returns the reward per step along with a\ndictionary which optionally contains reward specific\ninformation.\nreturn reward, reward info\ndef reset(self, done):\n# Resets any stored state as needed when the episode is done.\nE. Perception Details\n1) Cameras and Calibration: Previous iterations of the\nsystem included a variety of other camera types and posi-\ntions. Larger arrays of slower cameras were effective during\nprototyping for basic ball contact, but struggled on tasks that\nrequired more accurate ball positioning. Adding more cameras\nto the current setup could produce still more accurate position\nestimations, but there start to be bandwidth limitations on\na single machine and it may require remote vision devices\n(increasing latency and system complexity) or switching away\nfrom USB3.\nCameras are calibrated individually for intrinsic parameters\nfirst and later calibrated extrinsically to the table coordinate\nsystem via sets of AprilTags [74] placed on the table. Both\ncalibrations are done with APIs provided by OpenCV [11].\nCalibration is an important factor in the performance of the\nsystem given the small size of the ball it needs to track. While\nit is relatively easy to get decent camera performance with\nbasic camera knowledge, it required the help of vision experts\nto suggest hardware solutions like lens spacers and locks as\nwell as calibration tools such as focus targets to get truly stable\nperformance.\n5https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium\nFig. 10: Examples of training patches for the Ball detector\nwhich consist of the past three frames. The left-most RGB\nformatted patch is for visualization purposes to highlight the\nmotion of the ball in play with the current and next labeled\nposition indicated with white and black circles respectively.\nThe three single channel images to the right of the RGB image\nshow the raw Bayer pattern as expected by the detector. Top\nrow shows two sequences of three frames centered on the\nfinal ball position (modulo 2 to match Bayer stride). Bottom\nrow shows hard negative examples where the center position\ncontains a bright spot with some motion originating from a\nperson carrying a ball-in-hand or from the robot itself.\n2) Patch based Training Data: Figure 10 shows some\nexamples of the patches extracted from the raw Bayer images\nused to train the ball detector network. These patches are cen-\ntered on the ball in the current frame where the two previous\nframes are included to prime the temporal convolutional layers\nwithin our custom architecture.\n3) Ball Detector Network Structure: The spatial convolu-\ntion layers capture shape and color information whilst down-\nsampling the image size to reduce computation. Operating on\nthe single channel raw images means it is important that the\nfirst layer has a 2 \u00d7 2 stride matching the Bayer pattern, so\nthat the weights of the convolutional kernel are applied to\nthe same colored pixels at all spatial locations. In total, five\nconvolutional layers are applied with the first three including\nbatch normalization [43] before a ReLU activation [24, 30].\nTwo of these layers employ a buffered temporal mechanism\nresulting in an extremely compact network overall with only\n27K parameters. Full details of the architecture is shown in\nTable II. Note that the shape is represented as (B, H, W, C)\ncorresponding to the typical batch size, height, width and\nchannels, however during inference the batch is set to the\nnumber of cameras. Also note that in contrast to typical\ntemporal convolutions operating on video data there is no time\ndimension. Instead the temporal convolutional layers simply\nconcatenate their previous input to the current features along\nthe channel dimensions. Here the next convolutional layer with\nweights will effectively span two timesteps.\n4) Tracking Performance: To assess tracking performance\nindependently of the downstream processes, the output of\nthe perception pipeline is compared against human annotated\nball positions. These annotations capture the ball\u2019s image\nposition in each camera view for the entire duration the ball\nis considered in-play, i.e. has not touched the ground or any\nobject below the table height. Both views are recombined with\nannotations, triangulated to their 3D position, and stitched over\ntime into 3D trajectories.\nFor tracking evaluation the 3D trajectories of the ball across\nLayer Type\nKernel Size\nStrides\nDilation Rate\nOutput Size\n# Trainable Parameters\nInput\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n(2, 512, 1024, 8)\n\u2013\n2D Spatial Convolution\n4\n2\n1\n(2, 256, 512, 8)\n128\nBatch Norm\n16\nBuffered Temporal Convolution\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n(2, 256, 512, 16)\n\u2013\n2D Spatial Convolution\n\u2013\n\u2013\n2\n(2, 256, 512, 8)\n1152\nBatch Norm\n16\n2D Spatial Convolution\n4\n2\n1\n(2, 128, 256, 16)\n2048\nBatch Norm\n32\nBuffered Temporal Convolution\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n(2, 128, 256, 32)\n\u2013\n2D Spatial Convolution\n\u2013\n\u2013\n1\n(2, 128, 256, 64)\n18496\nDropout (drop-rate=0.1)\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n(2, 128, 256, 64)\n\u2013\nPrediction Head\n4\n\u2013\n2\n(2, 128, 256, 5)\n5125\nOptimizer\nAdam (\u03b1 = 1e\u22124, \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999)\nLearning Rate Schedule\nLinear ramp-up (5000 steps) then exponential decay.\nBatch size\n128\nWeight decay\nNone\nTABLE II: Ball Detector, Architecture and Training Details.

Av-\nerage tracking accuracy (ALTA) is the key metric used for\ntracking quality over the local temporal horizon of 100 frames\nwith a < 5cm true positive criteria. ATR and ATP denote the\naverage tracking recall and precision respectively [94].\n10 annotated sequences are used as target reference positions\nconsisting of 514 annotated trajectories over 93,978 frames.\nTo measure the alignment of predicted trajectories to these\nannotations, the recently proposed Average Local Tracking\nAccuracy (ALTA) metric [94] is applied by defining a true\npositive detection as the predicted 3D position of the ball at\ntime t to correspond to with in 5cm of the annotated position\nin frame t. Since the temporal aspect of the tracking problem is\nimportant from both a short history as used by the policy and\na longer history for locating hits and bounces by the referee\n(Section II-E) the temporal horizon of ALTA is set to 100\nframes with the results reported in Table III. These results\nshow the benefit that hard negative mining can bring to a\npatch-based training method.\nF. Real World Details\n1) Referee: The primary role of the Referee is to gener-\nate ball and robot contacts to drive the StateMachine,\nRewardManager, and DoneManager as defined in Sec-\ntion II-G. The different contact events are as follows;\nTABLE_ARM (ball contact with robot side of the table),\nTABLE_OPP (ball contact with opponent side of the table),\nPADDLE_ARM (ball contact with robot paddle), NET (ball\ncontact with net), GROUND (ball contact with the ground),\nTABLE (robot contact with table), and STAND (robot contact\nwith stand). The real environment and the referee communi-\ncate using a custom MPI (ROS [80] is an alternative), where\nthe Referee initializes a server and the environment uses a\nclient to request reward, done and info at step frequency. The\nReferee updates its internal state at 100 Hz regardless of the\nstep frequency.\n2) Real gym environment: The real environment interfaces\nwith the policy and hardware. In addition to the real world\nchallenges described in Section II-E, it must also ensure the\nenvironment step lasts for the expected duration given the en-\nvironment Hz. An adaptive throttling function facilitates this.\nThe throttling function is initialized with the first observation.\nWhen the next step call completes, the throttler waits for the\nremaining time of the environment timestep before returning.\nIf the next step call consumes more computational time than\nthe timestep budget, the throttler advances to the next nearest\nmultiple of the timestep. Both the actor and environment run\non the same thread, therefore, the timestep also consumes the\ncomputational time required by the policy. A recommendation\nis that if the policy requires more computational time than\ntimestep budget, either reduce the step frequency or use an\nasynchronous policy framework.\n3) Subprocesses: The actor, environment, and referee com-\nponents are implemented using Python, therefore, process\nspeedup is limited by the GIL. Threading increased process\ncontention and the sim-to-real gap. If a process is known to\nget throttled by thread contention or a high computational\nworkload, the code should be distributed to a different process.\n4) Observation Filters: The system uses the Savitzky-\nGolay\nFIR\nfilter\n[5]\nfor\nobservation\nsmoothing\nin\nTableTennisRealEnv\nand\nReferee.\nThe\nfilter\ncoefficients were calculated once for a window length\nof 9 and a 1-D convolution is applied for each sensor\nmodality\nindependently.\nFor\nboundary\nvalues,\ninput\nis\nextended by replicating the last value in the buffer.\nThe real environment uses interpolation/extrapolation to\ngenerate observations for the given timestep. Noise from the\nsensor can cause the interpolated/extrapolated values to show\na zig-zag pattern.

Simulator Parameter Studies: Additional Results & Details\nThis section contains additional details about the simulator\nparameter studies. First we discuss additional results and then\ngive details of all the parameter values for each study.\n1) Additional Results: We present additional results from\nthe simulator parameter studies. In Section III-A we assessed\nthe effect of varying simulator parameters on the zero-shot\nsim-to-real transfer performance. Here we discuss the effect\non training quality, defined as the percentage of the 10 training\nruns that achieved \u226597.5% of the maximum score during train-\ning. Agents with scores above this threshold effectively solve\nthe return ball task. The results are presented in Figure 12.\nTraining contains significant randomness from two main\nsources. First the environment has multiple sources of random-\nness; primarily from the ball distribution, latency sampling\nand observation noise, but also from domain randomization\nof some physical parameters and small perturbations to the\nrobot\u2019s initial starting position. The extent of the environment\nrandomness in each of these areas is affected by parameter val-\nues. Second, randomness comes from the training algorithm,\nBGS. During each BGS training step, directions are randomly\nsampled and a weighted average of a subset of these forms\nthe update to the parameters.\nAdditionally, there appears to be distinct learning phases for\nthe return ball task, with corresponding local maxima. Two\ncommon places for training to get stuck are (1) a policy never\nlearns to make contact with the ball and (2) a policy always\nmakes contact with the ball but never learns to return it to the\nopposite side.\nConsequently, we observe that about 70% of training runs\nwith the baseline parameters settings solve the problem. Sub-\nstantially reducing latency to 0-20% appears to make the\ntask harder. Only 40% of runs in these settings train well\n(see Figure 12 (top left)). Removing observation noise (see\nFigure 12 (top right)) makes the problem easier, with 90%\nruns training well. Increasing zero-mean noise does not affect\ntraining quality for the settings tested, however introducing\nbiased noise does appear to make the problem much harder,\nwith only 30% runs training well. Changing the ball distribu-\ntion (see Figure 12 (bottom left)) does not have a meaningful\nimpact on training quality except in one case. All training\nruns for the different thrower distribution (thrower 2) failed\nto reach the threshold in 10k steps. This is likely because\nthe ball distribution is more varied than baseline, medium, or\nwide distributions (see Figure 15). However no policies got\nstuck in local maxima. All achieved 93% of the maximum\nreward and 50% achieved 95%. This is unlike the low latency\nor biased observation noise settings where 20-60% runs got\nstuck in local maxima. Finally, changing the values of different\nphysical parameter settings appears to make the task slightly\neasier, with all experiments having 80-90% of runs that trained\nwell compared with the baseline 70% (see Figure 12 (bottom\nright)).\nFig. 11: Ball collection system. Images from left to right. (I) Air blows down from a ceiling mounted fan, pushing any balls\non the table down to the floor.

R =\nrestitution coefficient.\nI. Simulator Parameter Studies: Physical parameter measure-\nments, revisited\nIt was unsatisfactory not to follow the process outlined in\nAppendix D to set physical parameter values in the simulator.\nIn Section III-A we hypothesized this was due to not modeling\nspin correctly. To investigate this, we modeled spin in the\nsimulator following the method from [2]. We extended the\nsimulation ball model to incorporate the magnus force. Then\nwe collected a set of ball trajectories from a ball thrower. For\neach trajectory we set up an optimization problem to solve\nfor the initial position, linear velocity, and angular velocity of\nOriginal Env\nDamped Env\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n% runs >= 97.5% max training return\nMethod\nJoint Space\nTS(Act)\nTS(Act&Obs)\nOriginal Env\nDamped Env\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nReward\nMethod\nJoint Space\nTS(Act)\nTS(Act&Obs)\nFig. 13: (Top) Percent of seeds that solve the task (% runs\n\u2265 97.5% max training return) when trained in task space,\ncombined with the damped (harder) environment. (Bottom)\nZero shot transfer results of the seeds that succeeded the\ntraining.\nthe ball, and used these values to derive ball distributions in\nsimulation.\nDuring the same time period we also changed the paddle\non the robots to a Tenergy 056. This paddle has a softer\nand higher friction surface than the previous paddle and can\nimpart substantially more spin on the ball. We re-measured\nthe physical parameters of the system following the process\ndescribed in Appendix D. We performed a grid search over\nthe restitution coefficient of the paddle, setting the other\nparameters to measured values, to find the value that resulted\nin the best zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. The grid search\nwas necessary because the new paddle surface is soft but\nis modeled in simulation as a rigid body. Thus we use\nthe restitution coefficient to approximate \u2018softness\u2018. Values\nare detailed in Table VIII (see column \u201dRe-measured post\nchanges\u201d). Note that the paddle restitution coefficient that led\nto the best transfer, 0.44, is much lower than the measured\nvalue of 0.84. Finally, we observed that simulated training was\nharder in this setting, likely due to higher finesse required to\n6https://butterflyonline.com/Templates/RubberSpecifications.pdf\nmeasured\ntable: no R\nrandomize\n10% \nball R\n33% \ntable R\n10% \npaddle M\nprevious\nbaseline\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nReward\nPhysical Parameters\n10k\nsolve\nmeasured\ntable: no R\nrandomize\n10% \nball R\n33% \ntable R\n10% \npaddle M\nprevious\nbaseline\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n% runs >= 97.5% max training return\nPhysical Parameters\nFig. 14: After making a number of improvements to the\nsystem, zero-shot sim-to-real transfer scores 1.82 (measured\n- solve) on average whilst following a principled procedure\nfor measuring physical parameter values used in simulation.\nThis is on par with the previous baseline presented in Figure 5\nreproduced here as previous baseline.

Bottom Percent of seeds\nthat solve the task.\nreturn the ball with the new paddle. To remedy this we added\na small bonus for hitting the ball towards the opponent\u2019s side\nof the table even if the policy did not return it over the net.\nThe reward increases proportionally to how close to ball was\nto the net.\nAfter making these changes, we re-ran the physical pa-\nrameter study and present the results in Figure 147. We find\nthat zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is on par with the previous\nbaseline (see top chart, measured vs previous baseline). We\nalso observe that evaluating policies at the checkpoint when\nthey first solve the task (i.e. first checkpoint to score \u2265 97.5%\nmaximum training return) perform slightly better on average\nthan evaluating at the end of training, after 10k training steps.\nHowever the difference is not statistically significant.\nPerformance loss by not randomizing the table restitu-\ntion is similar to our original study, however (fortunately)\nperformance is less sensitive to small changes in parameter\nvalues. For example, increasing the ball restitution by 10% or\n72 / 50 seeds got stuck. One for table no R randomize, and one for -10%\npaddle M. These results are reported over 9 instead of 10 seeds. We do not\nthink this materially affects any of the findings.\nreducing the paddle restitution by 10% only led to a small\nreduction in performance. However large changes may lead\nto performance collapse as indicated by reducing the table\nrestitution coefficient by 33%.\nWith the addition of the extra reward component, most\npolicies solve the task in most settings (see Figure 14, bottom).\nThe exception is when the table restitution coefficient was\nreduced by 33%, reducing the bounciness of the incoming\nball and likely making the task very difficult to learn.\nJ. Simulator Parameter Studies: Study values\nTable VI presents the latency values for each of the assessed\nsettings. Table VII contains the details of all of the different\nball distributions and Figure 15 visualizes them. A distribution\nis visualized by sampling 500 initial ball conditions and\nplotting a histogram of the ball velocity in each dimension,\nand plotting the initial ball xy and the landing ball xy below\nit. Table VIII gives details of the tuned and measured physical\nparameters.\nK. Task Space Studies: Additional Results\nAdditional results from training in task space (Figure 13)\nshow that it enables more seeds to solve the task, likely by\nmaking the problem more intuitive to learn for the training al-\ngorithm. This trend is more pronounced in the harder problem\nsetting (damped environment). Here only 10% of joint space\npolicy seeds solve the task compared with around 80% of\ntask space policy seeds. We also show the results of zero-shot\ntransfer of the converged seeds. In the original environment,\nthe transfer performance of task space policies is slightly lower\nthan joint space. Looking at the behavior, we see that most of\nthe balls are returned short, and hit the net. This phenomena\ncan be explained by the sim-to-real gap and that policies\ntrained in task space prefer softer returns (with less velocity\non the paddle). On the other hand, in the harder (damped)\nenvironment, task space policies learn to return faster and more\ndynamically. In this setting, transfer to the real hardware is\nmuch better, with task space policies returning 97% of the\nballs and scoring 1.95 out of 2.0.\nL. Debugging\nThe many interacting components in this system create a\ncomplex set of dependencies. If the system suddenly starts\nperforming worse, is it a vision problem, a hardware failure,\nor just a bad training run? A major design decision was to\nbe able to test as many of these components independently as\npossible and to test them as regularly as possible. The design\nof the system allows it to remotely and automatically run a\nsuite of tests with the latest software revision every night,\nensuring that any problems are detected before anyone needs\nto work with the robot in the morning.\nEach test in the suite exercises a particular aspect of the\nsystem and can help isolate problems. For example, a test\nthat simply repeats a known sequence of commands ensures\nthe hardware and control stack are functional while a test\nthat feeds the policy a sequence of ball positions focuses\nFig. 15: Visualization of all the ball distributions used in the simulated parameter ball distribution study.

Additionally, by running these tests every day,\nan acceptable range of performance can be ascertained and\ntrends can be tracked. The independent evaluation also enables\ntesting and verification of changes to the various components.\nFor example, when changing from Python to C++ control\ndiscussed in Section II-B the metrics from the nightly tests\nwere used to judge if the new control mechanisms were\nworking as expected.\nDue to the agile and interconnected nature of a system, it is\nalso nearly impossible to debug in real time and many issues\ncan only be reproduced when the whole system is running\nat full speed. Another key decision was to log everything.\nIn the nightly tests described above, not only are the results\nlogged but many key metrics such as latency are captured\nwhich can further isolate failures. Additionally, the state of\nall aspects of the robot, environment, and even intermediate\nstates (e.g. the safety simulator) are logged and can be played\nback later in a convenient interface (Figure 16 that shows the\nuser many aspects of the system at once and allows them to\nstep through the environment states in a way that\u2019s impossible\nto do on the actual robot. While the initial costs of planning\nFig. 16: Debugging visualization used in the system. Sensitive information has been redacted. This interface synthesizes logs\nfrom several components in a unified interface that makes debugging the system and understanding its state very straightforward.\nand executing efficient logging system are high, they more\nthan pay for themselves in diagnostic ability. The next section\ndives more deeply into the various aspects of logging.\nM. Logging\nLogging throughout the system is very useful for multiple\nreasons: Debugging, Timing & Performance analysis, Visual-\nization, Stats & Metric tracking. The logs are primarily divided\nbetween:\n1) Structured Logs: This includes detailed high frequency\nlogging used for timing & performance analysis as well\nas visualizations. This data is post-processed to give\nlower-granularity summary metrics.\n2) Unstructured Logs: These are human readable logs,\nprimarily capturing informational data as well as un-\nexpected errors & exception cases.\n3) Experiment Metadata: A small amount of metadata\ndescribing each experiment run helps organize all logs\nby runs.\nHigh frequency logging is useful to introspect into the\nperformance of the system. Individual raw events are logged,\nincluding hardware feedback as well as the data at different\nsteps in the pipeline through transformations, agent inference\nand back to hardware commands. Logging the same data\nthrough multiple steps of transformation along with tracing\nidentifiers, helps us track the time taken between steps to\nanalyze the performance of the system. Raw high frequency\ndata allows us to capture fine-grained patterns in the timing\ndistribution that are not as easily revealed by just summary\nmetrics. Care must be taken when logging at high frequen-\ncy/throughput to not have performance issues from the logging\nsystem itself. Logging system overhead is low on the Python\nside, saving the heavy lifting for an asynchronous C++ thread\nthat actually saves and uploads the logs.

With a diffusion model for video synthesis, video frames can be generated iteratively\nby reusing noise and imitating the diffusion process clip by clip. A large number of frames can be\nfinally generated, and smoothness across frames can also be maintained.\nABSTRACT\nInspired by the remarkable success of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for image\nsynthesis, we study LDM for text-to-video generation, which is a formidable\nchallenge due to the computational and memory constraints during both model\ntraining and inference. A single LDM is usually only capable of generating a very\nlimited number of video frames. Some existing works focus on separate prediction\nmodels for generating more video frames, which suffer from additional training\ncost and frame-level jittering, however. In this paper, we propose a framework\ncalled \u201cReuse and Diffuse\u201d dubbed VidRD to produce more frames following the\nframes already generated by an LDM. Conditioned on an initial video clip with\na small number of frames, additional frames are iteratively generated by reusing\nthe original latent features and following the previous diffusion process. Besides,\nfor the autoencoder used for translation between pixel space and latent space, we\ninject temporal layers into its decoder and fine-tune these layers for higher temporal\nconsistency. We also propose a set of strategies for composing video-text data that\ninvolve diverse content from multiple existing datasets including video datasets for\naction recognition and image-text datasets. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethod achieves good results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our\nproject page is available here.\n1\narXiv:2309.03549v1  [cs.CV]  7 Sep 2023\n*Ongoing work\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nText-to-video synthesis (Esser et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023) recently has\nbecome an increasingly popular research topic in the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC) following the success of Diffusion Models for image synthesis (Rombach et al., 2022).\nThis technique allows businesses to create engaging videos from written text without the need for\nexpensive equipment or professional illustrators. Video creation will become more efficient and\ninnovative with the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies.\nExisting video synthesis methods have achieved some progress, but the quality of the generated videos\nremains less than satisfactory. On the one hand, keeping temporal consistency while generating\ndiverse content remains a big challenge. On the other hand, a typical LDM is only capable of\ngenerating a few video frames due to the limitation of computation and memory resources. High-\nquality smooth videos, involving diverse content and containing a quantity of frames, are preferable in\nreal applications. For this purpose, previous works such as FDM (Harvey et al., 2022), MCVD (Voleti\net al., 2022) and Video LDM (Blattmann et al., 2023), exploit prediction mechanisms for producing\nfuture frames based on current video frames. Frame prediction, however, is no easier than direct video\ngeneration, and solving frame-level jittering is difficult. Furthermore, a cascaded pipeline, involving\na video generation module and a prediction module, introduces more training cost and inference\ntime. In this paper, instead of exploiting frame prediction, we propose a novel framework called\n\u201cReuse and Diffuse\u201d dubbed VidRD and Figure 1 shows some examples generated by it. VidRD can\ngenerate more coherent and consistent video frames by leveraging the previous frames generated by\na single LDM. After generating an initial video clip by LDM, the following frames are produced\niteratively by reusing the latent features of the previous clip and imitating the previous diffusion\nprocess. VidRD contains a temporal-aware LDM based on a pre-trained LDM for image synthesis.\nTo train our model efficiently, we initialize the parameters of the spatial layers in the pre-trained\nimage LDM. We also reform and fine-tune the decoder of autoencoder by injecting temporal layers\ninto it. For iterative generation, VidRD contains three novel modules: Frame-level Noise Reversion\n(FNR), Past-dependent Noise Sampling (PNS), and Denoising with Staged Guidance (DSG). FNR\nreuses the initial noise in reverse order from the previous video clip, while PNS brings a new random\nnoise for the last several video frames. Furthermore, temporal consistencies between video clips are\nrefined by DSG.\nMoreover, the training of LDMs usually relies on a massive amount of data to ensure the quality\nof the generative content (Khachatryan et al., 2023). The scarcity of high-quality video-text data\nhas always been a problem. To this end, we devise a set of strategies to utilize existing datasets\nincluding video datasets for action recognition and image-text datasets. In addition to the typical\nvideo datasets in which each video is captioned with a short descriptive sentence, we use multi-modal\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to segment and caption videos in action recognition video datasets.\nAdditionally, images with text captions are transformed to pseudo-videos by random zooming and\npanning so visual content of videos can be largely enriched.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VidRD consistently achieves high performance in both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations. On the benchmark of video generation based on UCF-\n101 (Soomro et al., 2012), we achieve Fr\u00b4echet Video Distance (FVD) of 363.19 and Inception Score\n(IS) of 39.37.\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold:\n\u2022 We propose VidRD, an iterative text-to-video generation method that leverages a temporal-\naware LDM to generate smooth videos. By reusing the latent features of the initially\ngenerated video clip and imitating the previous diffusion process each time, the following\nvideo frames can be produced iteratively.\n\u2022 A set of effective strategies is proposed to compose a high-quality video-text dataset. We use\nLLMs to segment and caption videos from action recognition datasets. Image-text datasets\nare also used by transforming into pseudo-videos with random zooming and panning.\n\u2022 Extensive experiments on the UCF-101 benchmark demonstrate that VidRD achieves good\nFVD and IS in comparison with existing methods. Qualitative evaluations also show good\nresults.\n2\n*Ongoing work\n2\nRELATED WORK\nImage synthesis models.\nAutomatic image synthesis is seen as a major milestone towards general\nartificial intelligence (Goertzel & Pennachin, 2007; Clune, 2019; Fjelland, 2020; Zhang et al., 2023).\nIn the early stage, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)-based (Xu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019;\nKarras et al., 2019) and autoregressive methods (Ramesh et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2021; Chang et al.,\n2022; Wu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022) are designed to achieve image synthesis. DALL-E (Ramesh\net al., 2021) and Parti (Yu et al., 2022) are two representative methods. DALL-E proposes a two-stage\ntraining process: image tokens are generated and then combined with text tokens in the second\nstage. However, the autoregressive nature of the above methods results in high computation costs and\nsequential error accumulation (Zhang et al., 2023). Text-guided image synthesis afterward makes\nsignificant progress due to the advancement of Diffusion Models (DMs) (Rombach et al., 2022). Due\nto the surprising results of DMs, massive works (Kawar et al., 2023; Bhunia et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023b; Fan et al., 2023; Dabral et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al.,\n2022) focus on this technology. GLIDE (Nichol et al., 2021) and Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al.,\n2022) are two representative DM-based works that employ Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as\nCLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for text-guided image synthesis. With the rapid development of DMs,\nadvanced image editing task has also been achieved.\nVideo synthesis models.\nThrough the lens of AIGC, text-guided video synthesis has also attracted\nmassive attention after image synthesis. Earlier methods focus on unconditional video synthesis. Sim-\nilar to image synthesis, two kinds of approaches are proposed including GAN-based (Vondrick et al.,\n2016; Saito et al., 2017; Acharya et al., 2018; Tulyakov et al., 2018) and transformer-based (Ge et al.,\n2022; Yan et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2015; Le Moing et al., 2021; Hong et al., 2023). StyleGAN-\nV (Skorokhodov et al., 2022) uses time-continuous signals for video synthesis. They extend the\nparadigm of neural representations to build a continuous-time video generator. In VideoGPT (Yan\net al., 2021), VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2016) is used to learn subsampled discrete latent\nrepresentations of raw videos. The latent representations are modeled using a robust autoregressive\nprior with a GPT-like architecture. However, GAN-based methods are difficult to scale up to handle\ncomplex and diverse video distributions due to their susceptibility to mode collapse. Also, they\nsuffer from training instability issues. Recently, motivated by DM-based image synthesis, several\nworks (Esser et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023; Khachatryan et al., 2023; He et al.,\n2022; Dabral et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2022) propose to explore DMs for condi-\ntional video synthesis. Among these works, Video LDM (Blattmann et al., 2023) is a representative\nwork and also exhibits excellent results. On the basis of an LDM for image synthesis pre-trained\non large-scale image-text data, Video LDM fine-tunes its newly added temporal layers with video\ndata. In addition, the authors propose an interpolation model and an upsampler model for generating\nhigh-quality videos. Almost at the same time, PYoCo (Ge et al., 2023) is proposed as an improved\nmethod for extending LDM from image synthesis to video synthesis. Based on the continuity of\nvideo content over time, the authors design a video noise prior to achieve better temporal consistency.\nWith the satisfactory results of LDM-based video synthesis, there are also some works (Molad et al.,\n2023; Qi et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a) on controllable video editing.\nIterative video generation.\nCurrent video synthesis methods can only deal with several sparsely\nsampled video frames limited by computational and memory resources. Longer video synthesis, even\nfor a single scene, is still a challenging topic. TATS (Ge et al., 2022) proposed a method building on\n3D-VQGAN with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) to generate videos with thousands of frames.\nWith the rise of DM, Video LDM (Blattmann et al., 2023) designed a separate LDM as a prediction\nmodel for extending the already generated video clip. This multiplies the training cost for video\nsynthesis. Also in latent space, LVDM (He et al., 2022) proposed a unified model by treating frame\ninterpolation and prediction as two sub-tasks in model training. This makes training more difficult\nand the training process unstable. In this work, we aim to build a unified and efficient text-to-video\ngeneration model for generating high-quality smooth videos containing a large number of frames.\n3\n*Ongoing work\n3\nPRELIMINARIES\n3.1\nLATENT DIFFUSION MODELS\nDMs learn to model a data distribution pdata via iterative denoising from a noise distribution so the\ndesired data distribution can be generated. Given samples x0 \u223c pdata, the diffusion forward process\niteratively adds noise:\nq(xt | xt\u22121) = N(xt; \u03b1txt\u22121, \u03c32\nt I)\n(1)\nwhich represents the conditional density of xt given xt\u22121. Here, a noise schedule is defined by \u03b1t\nand \u03c3t parameterized by diffusion time t. For generating a fully random noise with the increase of\ndiffusion time t, signal-to-noise ratio \u03bbt = log(\u03b12\nt /\u03c32\nt ) needs to monotonically decrease. To this end,\na variance-preserving time schedule satisfying \u03b12\nt + \u03c32\nt = 1 is usually used. Following the closure of\nnormal distribution, we can directly sample xt at any diffusion time t by:\nq(xt | x0) = N(xt; \u00af\u03b1tx0, (1 \u2212 \u03b12\nt )I)\n(2)\nwhere \u00af\u03b1t = Qt\ni=1 \u03b1i.\nIn the backward process of diffusion, a model denoted by f\u03b8 parameterized by \u03b8 is trained to predict\nthe noise to iteratively recover x0 from xT which is noisy data after adding noise T times. As long as\nT is large enough, the original sample of real data is fully perturbed such that xT \u223c N(0, I). While\ntraining, the denoising matching score is optimized following:\nEy\u223cN (0,I)[\u2225y \u2212 f\u03b8(xt; c, t)\u22252\n2]\n(3)\nwhere y representing the target features can be a random noise and c is an optional conditioning\nsignal such as text prompt in text-to-something DMs. Also, t is sampled from a uniform distribution\nwhich is set to U{0, 1000} in Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022). Once f\u03b8 is trained, we can\ngenerate a novel x0 from a random noise xT \u223c N(0, I) with a deterministic sampling DDIM (Song\net al., 2021).\nIn practice, since both images and videos rely on large amounts of computational and memory\nresources, DMs in pixel space are costly. Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) proposes to apply a\nregularized autoencoder to compress the original pixels into latent space to save computation and\nmemory. In this way, DMs are transformed into Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). The autoencoder\nin an LDM consists of an encoder E for encoding pixel features x into latent features z = E(x) and a\ndecoder D for decoding z back to x = D(z). In general, the autoencoder is trained by reconstructing:\n\u02c6x = D(E(x)) \u2248 x\n(4)\nwhere \u02c6x denotes the reconstructed sample after the real data x is input into the encoder and then the\ndecoder in turn. Usually, in addition to the construction loss, an adversarial loss defined by an individ-\nual patch-based discriminator is also added. With a trained autoencoder, the latent representations z\nafter encoding x with E can be directly used in Equation 1, 2 and 3. After generating z0 from LDM,\nthe original pixel features x0 can be restored from latent features with the trained decoder D. For the\nimplementation of an autoencoder of an LDM for image synthesis such as Stable Diffusion, both the\nencoder E and the decoder D are for static images only. For an LDM for video synthesis, the existing\nautoencoder works frame by frame so no temporal information is considered.\n4\nMETHOD\n4.1\nMODEL ARCHITECTURE\nSince models represented by Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) show amazing results in image\nsynthesis, loading its pre-trained LDM is preferable for efficiently training an LDM for high-quality\nvideo synthesis (Blattmann et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023). Similarly, VidRD is based on the pre-trained\nStable Diffusion including its Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) for latent representation and U-Net\nfor latent denoising. Figure 2 shows the architecture of VidRD. Similar to existing works like\nVideo LDM (Blattmann et al., 2023) and PYoCo (Ge et al., 2023), we adapt the original U-Net for\nimage diffusion to video synthesis by injecting temporal layers marked with dashed boxes in the\nfigure. These two types of temporal layers are: Temp-Conv representing 3D convolution layers and\n4\n*Ongoing work\nDown-sampler\nDenoised Latents\nDiffusion\nLatents\nNoisy Latents\nDecoder\nEncoder\n3D-ResNet\n\u00d7T\n\u00d7T\n\u2026\nDenoising U-Net\nDown-sampler\nUp-sampler\nUP-sampler\nMSE Loss\nSelf-Attn\nText Encoder\nTemp-Conv\nCross-Attn\nTemp-Attn\nInput video\nOutput\nPrompt: \u201cpeople run up to a race car\u201d\nFigure 2: The architecture of VidRD is derived from an LDM for image synthesis. Modules with\nsnowflake marks are frozen while those with flame marks are trainable. Modules with dashed boxes\nare added in addition to the original LDM for image synthesis.\nTemp-Attn representing temporal attention layers. Also, most network layers, except for the newly\nadded Temp-Conv and Temp-Attn, in our devised U-Net, are initialized with the pre-trained model\nweights of Stable Diffusion. The parameters of Temp-Conv and Temp-Attn are randomly initialized\nwith the last layer zeroed and residual connections are also applied.\nFor training this model, videos with text captions are input and then encoded by a text encoder to c\nin Equation 3 for conditioning in the process of denoising. As inputs, videos are usually sampled\nat regular intervals into a sequence containing a fixed number of frames. Therefore, we have input\nvideos denoted by x \u2208 RB\u00d7F \u00d73\u00d7H\u2032\u00d7W \u2032 where B, F, H\u2032 and W \u2032 respectively denote the inputs\u2019\nbatch size, number of frames, height, and width in the pixel space. After encoding, we can get its\ncorresponding representation in the latent space z = E(x) \u2208 RB\u00d7F \u00d7C\u00d7H\u00d7W where C, H and W\nrespectively denote their channel, height, and width in the latent space.\nFor dealing with video inputs, the original 2D ResNet of Stable Diffusion is inflated to 3D-ResNet by\nfusing the inputs\u2019 temporal dimension into batch dimension. In this way, this part of network parame-\nters can be directly inherited from Stable Diffusion. For an input z = E(x) \u2208 RB\u00d7F \u00d7C\u00d7H\u00d7W , it is\ntransformed into R(BF )\u00d7C\u00d7H\u00d7W .\nbn\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w\nb\u00d7c\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w\nb\u00d7c\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w bn\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w\nTemp-Conv\nTemp-Attn\n3D-ResNet\nbn\u00d7d\u00d7c\nbd\u00d7n\u00d7c\nb\u00d7c\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w\nbn\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w\nbn\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w b\u00d7c\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w\nbd\u00d7n\u00d7c\nbn\u00d7d\u00d7c\nb: batch_size c: channel n: frame number \nh: height     w: width   d: token number    : axes swap\nFigure 3: These are three essential network layers in VidRD. 3D-ResNet, inherited from Stable\nDiffusion, treats the number of frames n as a part of batch size. This is equivalent to applying the\noriginal 2D-ResNet frame by frame so this layer is frozen in model training. Temp-Conv, implemented\nwith 3D convolutions, processes video inputs in a tube manner while Temp-Attn applies attention\nlayer along temporal axis.\n5\n*Ongoing work\nFor strengthening temporal relations between video frames, two temporal modules are added. One\ntemporal module is Temp-Conv implemented with 3D convolution layers which are added right after\nthe ResNet block. Another temporal module is Temp-Attn which is an attention layer similar to\nSelf-Attn in the original Stable Diffusion, but applied on the temporal dimension. Specifically, for\n3D-ResNet, Temp-Conv and Temp-Attn, the axes of input data are swapped accordingly to make the\nwhole model work. The implementation details are shown in Figure 3.\nSimilar to existing works like Video LDM (Blattmann et al., 2023) and PYoCo (Ge et al., 2023),\nonly part of our network layers are trainable for efficient training. For the text encoder, all the\nparameters are frozen. For U-Net, existing works use either a two-stage (Blattmann et al., 2023)\nor alternating (Ge et al., 2023) training scheme with image and video data. Essentially, they use\nimage data for fine-tuning spatial layers and video data for training temporal layers, respectively.\nInstead of this manual training scheme, our U-Net is trained with pure video data in an end-to-end\nunified way since the image data are transformed into pseudo-videos that show temporal consistency\nlike the original video data. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 3, the network modules in U-Net\nwith red background, including two newly added temporal layers and the spatial attention layers\noriginally designed in LDM for image synthesis, are trainable. Furthermore, since the autoencoder is\noriginally designed for image synthesis, temporal relations between video frames are not considered.\nTo achieve a more accurate representation of videos in the output pixel space, we inject temporal\nlayers implemented with 3D convolutions into the decoder D and fine-tune it with video data. The\ndetails are presented in Section 4.4.\n4.2\nVIDEO-TEXT DATA COMPOSITION\nMark frames to drop:\nRandom zoom \nand pan\nImage-text \ndatasets\nLong video \nclassification \ndatasets\nShort video \nclassification \ndatasets\n\u2026\nCute cat with white background\ncute cat with white background\n[CLASS]: abseiling\nThe person is abseiling down a waterfall\n\u2026\n\u2026\nKept segment\nDropped segment\nKept segment\nVideo caption with Mini-GPT4\nThe video features a close-up shot of a \ngrey and white cat's face, with the \ncat looking at something on the table.\nA grey long haired cat \nis laying on top of a box \nin front of a red wall.\n[CLASS]: cat\nCaption\nwith BLIP-2\nSegment and \nCaption\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ne.g. LAION-5B\ne.g. Kinetics-700\ne.g. VideoLT\n\u2026\nFrames\nFrames\nVideo\nframes\nCLIP Model\nMiniGPT-4\n*Prompt: Is this \nimage related to  \n[CLASS]?\nw/ low CLIP score.\nw/ negative answer.\nMark kept \nor dropped\n*Prompt: Question: What \nis happening in the image \nabout [CLASS].

To compensate for the lack of high-quality video-text data, we\npropose a set of strategies for composing video-text data from different types of existing datasets\nother than well-captioned video-text datasets like VATEX (Wang et al., 2019) and WebVid-2M (Bain\net al., 2021). Figure 4 illustrates the three types of datasets that we use: text-image datasets, short\nvideo classification datasets, and long video classification datasets.\nImage-text datasets.\nSince the quantity and quality of image datasets are much better than those\nof video datasets, it is necessary to exploit image datasets to improve the video generation model.\nAlso, existing works (Ho et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Ge et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023)\nhave revealed that it is beneficial to train a video generation model with image-text data for better\nappearances of video content. Training spatial network layers with static images is of little help for\nimproving temporal consistency, however. To this end, we propose a better strategy using widely\navailable image-text datasets. As shown in the top part of Figure 4, for each image with a caption,\n6\n*Ongoing work\nwe apply random zooming and panning to produce multiple images and they are further composed\ninto a pseudo-video. FFmpeg (Tomar, 2006) is used for the implementation of random zooming and\npanning.\nShort video classification datasets.\nFor those video datasets mostly containing short videos\noriginally used for action recognition such as Kinetics-700 (Smaira et al., 2020), the problem is how\nto give a proper text caption based on its classification label to each video. For this problem, we\nemploy an LLM with visual comprehension capabilities: BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023). Since short videos\nusually involve a single scene, it is reasonable to use the caption for a randomly selected video frame\nas the caption for the whole video. This strategy is illustrated as green modules in Figure 4. For\neach short video with a given classification label such as \u201cabseiling\u201d, we randomly select a video\nframe from it and then use BLIP-2 to generate a text caption by querying the LLM with the frame\nand its classification label. In order to make the LLM produce more diverse text captions, we use a\nfew prompt templates for querying the LLM, and one of them is randomly selected every time. Due\nto the length of the paper, only one of the prompt templates is shown in the figure, and the whole list\nis put in the supplementary material.\nLong video classification datasets.\nThere is also another type of video dataset for action recognition\nmostly containing long videos involving multiple scenes such as VideoLT (Zhang et al., 2021). For\nthese videos, it is improper to use the description of a single frame as the caption for the whole\nvideo. Also, long videos usually contain some irrelevant content that is unrelated to its classification\nlabel and not worth captioning. To extract well-caption videos from these long videos, we use a\nsegment-then-caption strategy as shown in the bottom part of Figure 4. For each video containing\nmultiple frames, we employ CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) with vision-language alignment ability and\nMiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023), an LLM with vision-language understanding to mark those frames\nirrelevant to the classification label. Those frames with low CLIP matching scores with classification\nlabels or considered irrelevant by MiniGPT-4, while querying it with a devised prompt template, are\nmarked to be dropped. In this way, each frame in a video is marked as kept or dropped. A video can\nthen be segmented with this attribute of each frame. To avoid producing too short videos, we drop\nthose segments with too few frames. Finally, MiniGPT-4 is again used for captioning the segmented\nsub-videos with devised prompt templates.\n4.3\nLONGER VIDEO GENERATION\nClip i+1\n\u2026\n\u2026\nzi+1,0\nzi+1,1\nzi+1,N-j-2 zi+1,N-j-1\nzi+1,N-2 zi+1,N-1\nClip i\n\u2026\n\u2026\nzi,0\nFrame-level Noise Reversion (FNR)\nPast-dependent Noise Sampling \n(PNS)\nFrames per clip: N\nPrompt Frames: M\nDenoising with Staged Guidance \n(DSG)\nzi,1\nzi,j\nzi,j+1\nzi,N-2\nzi,N-1\nGuiding steps of denoising\n\u2026\n\u2026\nDenoising \nsteps\nFigure 5: Videos can be generated clip by clip iteratively with a single LDM. After each iteration, N\nframes are generated and the last M frames are used as prompt frames for the next iteration. Three\nkey strategies are proposed for generating natural and smooth videos. Frame-level Noise Reversion\n(FNR) is used as a basic module for re-using the initial noise in a reversed order from the last video\nclip. Past-dependent Noise Sampling (PNS) brings new random noise for the last several video\nframes. Temporal consistencies between video clips are refined by Denoising with Staged Guidance\n(DSG).\n7\n*Ongoing work\nA since LDM for video synthesis requires a large amount of computation and memory, it is usually\nunable to generate a lot of frames at once. Previous works like MCVD (Voleti et al., 2022) and Video\nLDM (Blattmann et al., 2023) train a separate prediction model for generating the new video frames\nfollowing the already generated frames. Unlike these methods implemented by frame prediction, we\npropose an iterative approach with a single diffusion model without fine-tuning. Figure 5 shows the\npipeline of VidRD for generating more frames that are natural and smooth along with the existing\nvideo frames. Within each iteration, there are N frames generated in total and the last M frames are\nused as prompt frames for the next iteration. For the sake of brevity, we use the latent representation\nof frames in each video clip and omit the use of VAE and text prompts. We use zi,j to represent\nthe latent features of the j-th frame in the i-th video clip. Once the initial video clip numbered 0 is\ngenerated, the i + 1-th clip can be generated on the basis of the i-th one iteratively. In this way, a\nvideo containing a number of frames can finally be derived by concatenating the continuous video\nclips. To this end, three key strategies are proposed including Frame-level Noise Reversion (FNR),\nPast-dependent Noise Sampling (PNS), and Denoising with Staged Guidance (DSG). The whole\nprocess is briefly outlined in Algorithm 1. The detailed implementations are stated below.\nAlgorithm 1: Iterative video generation.\nInput: {z0,j\nt\n| j \u2208 Z \u2229 [0, N), t \u2208 Z \u2229 [0, T]}: Latent features of the first clip.\nOutput: {zi,j\n0\n| j \u2208 Z \u2229 [0, N), i \u2208 Z \u2229 [0, Vmax)}: Denoised latent features of all Vmax clips.\n1 for i = 1 to Vmax do\n2\nfor j = 0 to N \u2212 1 do\n3\nzi,j\nT = zi\u22121,N\u2212j\u22121\nT\n;\n// Frame-level Noise Reversion (FNR)\n4\nif j \u2265 M then\n// Past-dependent Noise Sampling (PNS)\n5\nzi,j\nT = zi,j\nT \u03b1/\n\u221a\n1 + \u03b12 + \u03f5i,j; \u03f5i,j \u2208 N(0, I/(1 + \u03b12));\n6\nfor t = T to 1 do\n// Denoising with Staged Guidance (DSG)\n7\nif t > (1 \u2212 \u03b2)T + \u03b2Tj/M then zi,j\nt\u22121 = zi\u22121,N\u2212j\u22121\nt\u22121\n;\n8\nelse zi,j\nt\u22121 = DDIM(zi,j\nt , t)\n// Progressively denoising with DDIM;\nFrame-level Noise Reversion.\nAs previous works have revealed, for generating smooth videos,\nthe initial noise of LDMs for video synthesis is essential (Ge et al., 2023), and sharing a base noise\nacross video frames also helps (Luo et al., 2023). We borrowed a similar scheme for generating\nlonger videos and reused the initial noise iteratively but in a reversed order every time. Specifically,\nthe initial video clip is first generated purely with our trained U-Net model by iterative denoising\nfrom an initial noise sampled from a normal distribution like:\nz0,j\nT\n\u223c N(0, I), j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}\n(5)\nwhere N is the number of frames of a single video clip. The process of denoising from such random\nnoise follows the common practice of most video LDMs. In this way, we generate the initial video\nclip containing N frames and intend to generate the subsequent video clip. Since the continuous video\nclips will ultimately need to be concatenated, the temporal consistency between frames, especially\nacross clips, is essential. We propose FNR for this purpose. The initial random noises can be used to\ngenerate N basic video frames with high temporal consistency so intuitively new temporal-consistent\nframes can also be generated with these noises but in a reversed order. Therefore, considering the\ninitial noises, we have:\nzi,j\nT = zi\u22121,N\u2212j\u22121, i \u2265 1, j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}\n(6)\nIn combination with Equation 5, the initial noise of each frame in the following video clips can be\ncomputed. From the perspective of frame order, the frame-level order of the initial noise of each frame\nin the current clip can be seen as a reversion of the ones from the last clip. In this way, the temporal\nconsistency in the joint of two continuous video clips can be ensured to some extent. However, FNR\nalone cannot guarantee that videos are natural and smooth and the video content may simply become\nrepetitive within a single clip in some extreme cases. We call this phenomenon \u201ccontent cycling\u201d. To\nthis end, we propose PNS and DSG.\nPast-dependent Noise Sampling.\nIn order to mitigate the extent of video content cycling, which\nis critical to perception, simply reusing the original random noise repeatedly is not enough and\n8\n*Ongoing work\nrandomness needs to be introduced along with the generation of the video clips following the initial\nclip. Therefore, we propose Past-dependent Noise Sampling (PNS) which is used for introducing\nrandomness gradually. Specifically, excluding the M prompt frames for prompting the generation of\nthe current video clip, random noises are added to the initial noises of the remaining N \u2212 M frames,\nwhich are initialized with that of N \u2212 M frames of the previous video clip. Therefore, Equation 6 is\nmodified based on the position of the frames in each video clip:\nzi,j\nT =\n(\nzi\u22121,N\u2212j\u22121\nT\nif j < M\n\u03b1\n\u221a\n1+\u03b12 zi\u22121,N\u2212j\u22121\nT\n+ \u03f5i,j\notherwise , \u03f5i,j \u223c N(0,\n1\n1 + \u03b12 I), \u03b1 \u2265 0\n(7)\nwhere \u03f5i,j is a newly added random noise, and \u03b1 is a hyper-parameter for controlling the ratio of this\nnoise to the original reversed noise from the last video clip. The results of PNS are identical to those\nof FNR when j < M and the difference is only on the remaining N \u2212 M frames. New random noise\nsampled from a standard normal distribution is used when \u03b1 = 0. A larger \u03b1 brings more proportion\nof the reversed noise of the last video clip so more temporal consistency can be achieved.\nDenoising with Staged Guidance.\nThough initial noises zT are essential to the final denoised\nresults as previous works (Blattmann et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023) have revealed, we still cannot\nget exactly the same video frames twice by independent denoising with DDIM (Song et al., 2021)\nsampling, even with the same initial noises. To improve the temporal consistency across continuous\nframes, e.g., between zi,N\u22121\n0\nand zi+1,0\n0\n, reusing the initial noises created by FNR is not enough so\nDenoising with Staged Guidance (DSG) is proposed. Given an already generated i-th video clip,\nthe purpose of DSG is to generate the starting video frames of i + 1-th clip with high temporal\nconsistency following the M prompt frames of clip i. The approach of DSG involves replicating\nsome denoising steps by reusing the latent features from the DDIM process in generating i-th clip.\nAt the same time, to avoid the duplication of video frames but in reversed order, a staged strategy for\ndenoising with guidance is proposed. Specifically, we have:\nzi,j\nt\u22121 =\n(\nzi\u22121,N\u2212j\u22121\nt\u22121\nif t > (1 \u2212 \u03b2)T + \u03b2T j\nM\nDDIM(zi,j\nt , t)\notherwise\n, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1]\n(8)\nwhere \u03b2 represents the extent of guided denoising. Latent features in the current clip are denoised\ntotally with DDIM sampling without any reference from the previous video clip when \u03b2 = 0, and a\nlarger \u03b2 brings more guidance for each latent feature with j < M. In this way, video content of the\nfirst M prompt frames can be consistent with the last M frames of the last clip, and new content can\nalso emerge along with the denoising process because staged guidance becomes weaker as j gets\ncloser to M.\n4.4\nTEMPORAL-AWARE DECODER FINE-TUNING\nSince the original autoencoder of Stable Diffusion is specifically designed for image synthesis, it is\nnecessary to fine-tune it with video data for better performance of video synthesis. However, the latent\nfeatures used as inputs to U-Net after encoding are critical for efficient training when the pre-trained\nweights of Stable Diffusion are loaded. The autoencoder\u2019s architecture including its encoder and\ndecoder is shown in Figure 6. The encoder remains unchanged and the weights are frozen during\nfine-tuning. Also, temporal relations across video frames need to be considered for better temporal\nconsistency after decoding so we add Temp-Conv layers after ResNet of each block in the decoder.\nFor efficient fine-tuning, only the newly added Temp-Conv layers are trainable. In addition, for better\nadapting from the autoencoder for image, we initialize the last layer of Temp-Conv with zero and\napply a residual connection.\nFor fine-tuning the autoencoder, we use the same datasets used for training U-Net describe in\nSection 4.2. The fine-tuning also follows the adversarial manner following Stable Diffusion (Rombach\net al., 2022). The total loss is as follows:\nL = \u03b1recLrec(x, D(E(x)) + \u03b1regLreg(x; E, D) + \u03b1discLdisc(D(E(x))\n(9)\nIn addition to the main reconstruction loss Lrec and a regularizing loss Lreg for regularizing the\nlatent representation, a discrimination loss Ldisc is also used which is computed by a patch-based\ndiscriminator for differentiating the original videos from the reconstructed. These three losses are\nrespectively weighted with \u03b1rec, \u03b1reg and \u03b1disc.\n9\n*Ongoing work\nResNet\nDown-sampler\n\u2026\nResNet\nDown-sampler\nEncoder\nTemp-Conv\nDecoder\nbn\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w\nb\u00d7c\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w\nb\u00d7c\u00d7n\u00d7h\u00d7w\nbn\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w\nResNet\nUp-sampler\nTemp-Conv\nResNet\nUp-sampler\nTemp-Conv\n\u2026\nFigure 6: The autoencoder for latent representation is inherited and initialized from Stable Diffusion.\nTemp-Conv representing temporal layers and implemented with 3D convolutions are injected into\nthe decoder.

Both the\nVAE and the text encoder are frozen after they are initialized with pre-trained weights from Stable\nDiffusion. During model training, only the newly added temporal layers and transformer blocks of\nthe spatial layers are trainable. Since our model is essentially an LDM, VAE of Stable Diffusion but\nwith a fine-tuned decoder is used for latent representation. For LDM sampling, we use DDIM (Song\net al., 2021) in all our experiments.\nDatasets.\nIn general, four types of datasets are used for training VidRD as shown in Table 1.\n1) Well-captioned video-text datasets: WebVid-2M (Bain et al., 2021), TGIF (Li et al., 2016),\nVATEX (Wang et al., 2019) and Pexels 1. WebVid-2M contains a total of about 2.5 million subtitled\nvideos but we only use those whose duration is less than 20 seconds. Additionally, we use a basic\nwatermark removal solution to remove watermarks from the videos. TGIF consists of 100K GIFs\ncollected from Tumblr and the duration is relatively short. VATEX is a large-scale well-captioned\nvideo datasets covering 600 fine-grained human activities. Pexels contains about 360,000 well-\ncaptioned videos from a popular website providing free stock videos. 2) Short video classification\ndatasets: Moments-In-Time (Monfort et al., 2021) and Kinetics-700 (Smaira et al., 2020). Moments-\nIn-Time contains more than one million videos covering 339 action categories and Kinetics-700\ncontains over 650,000 videos covering 700 human action categories. Most videos in these two\ndatasets last a few seconds and each video is captioned using the strategy proposed in Section 4.2.\n3) Long video classification datasets: VideoLT (Zhang et al., 2021). This dataset contains a total\nof 250,000 untrimmed long videos covering 1004 categories. After applying the strategy for long\nvideo classification datasets, we totally produce 800K captioned videos with an average length of 5\nseconds. 4) Image datasets: LAION-5B. This dataset originally contains 5.58 billion image-text\npairs but only a small part of it is used as compensation to our video-text data. After applying the\nstrategy of transforming images to videos introduced in Section 4.2, 640K pseudo-videos with an\naverage length of 2 seconds are produced.\nTraining details.\nVAE for encoding and decoding videos is the same as Stable Diffusion and only\nthe newly added temporal layers in the decoder of VAE are trainable. For training the decoder of\nVAE, we set \u03b1rec, \u03b1reg and \u03b1disc to 1, 1\u22125 and 0.5 respectively. In U-Net, there are a total of 2.0B\n1https://huggingface.co/datasets/Corran/pexelvideos\n10\n*Ongoing work\nDataset\nWebVid-2M TGIF VATEX Pexels Moments-In-Time Kinetics-700 VideoLT LAION-5B\nNum.

The base\nresolution of input videos for model training is 256 \u00d7 256 and 8 keyframes are sampled uniformly\nevery 4 frames. The starting frame of sampling is randomly selected along the timeline. Each frame is\nresized along the shorter side and then randomly cropped to the target resolution. For video datasets\nwith multiple captions such as VATEX (Wang et al., 2019), one caption is randomly chosen every\ntime it is sampled. In general, these practices can be seen as data augmentation.\nEvaluation metrics.\nFollowing previous works like Make-A-Video (Singer et al., 2023), PY-\noCo (Ge et al., 2023) and Video LDM (Blattmann et al., 2023), the following metrics for quantitative\nevaluation are used: (i) Fr\u00b4echet Video Distance (FVD) (Unterthiner et al., 2019): Following Make-A-\nVideo (Singer et al., 2023), we use a trained I3D model (Carreira & Zisserman, 2017) for calculating\nFVD. (ii) Inception Score (IS) (Saito et al., 2020): Following previous works (Singer et al., 2023;\nHong et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023), a trained C3D model (Tran et al., 2015) is used for\ncalculating the video version of IS.\n5.2\nMAIN RESULTS\nTo fully evaluate VidRD, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

All the videos for evaluation are generated in\na zero-shot manner. In comparison with other methods, VidRD achieves better IS and FVD while\nusing fewer videos for model training.\nQuantitative Evaluation.\nFollowing previous works (Singer et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023;\nBlattmann et al., 2023), we use UCF-101 (Soomro et al., 2012), a dataset for video recognition,\nfor evaluating FVD and IS. Since there are only 101 brief class names such as knitting and diving\nin UCF-101, we devise a descriptive prompt for each class for video synthesis in our experiments.\nThe whole list of prompts we use is provided in the supplementary material. Following Make-A-\nVideo (Singer et al., 2023), 10K videos are generated by VidRD following the same class distribution\nas the training set. It is worth noting that the experimental settings in VideoFactory (Wang et al.,\n2023b) are slightly different from VidRD. VideoFactory generates 100 samples for each class. The\nquantitative evaluation results are shown in Table 2. VidRD achieves the best FVD and IS while\nusing much fewer videos for training. Meanwhile, fine-tuning the decoder of VAE helps improve\nVidRD further. The reason is that a temporal-aware decoder can make restoring pixels from latent\nfeatures more accurate.\n11\n*Ongoing work\nQualitative Evaluation.\nSince all the currently used metrics for evaluating video generation models\nare considered not fully reliable and may be inconsistent with perception, qualitative evaluation is\nnecessary. To this end, example videos are generated with the same text prompts by VidRD and the\nother models including Make-A-Video (Singer et al., 2023), Imagen Video (Ho et al., 2022). Figure 7\nshows the comparisons between the video generation results of these methods. VidRD performs well\nin both structure and appearance.

The\nexamples generated by VidRD show good text alignment and structure.\n5.3\nABLATION STUDY\nClassifier-free guidance scale.\nFor generating diverse videos, two hyper-parameters are critical\nin model inference: the number of inference steps and the scale of classifier-free guidance. The\nnumber of inference steps means the total steps of denoising from the initial random noises to the\nresulting latent features of video frames. The scale of classifier-free guidance is proposed with\nclassifier-free diffusion guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2021). In each reversed diffusion step during\nmodel inference, the predicted noise \u02dc\u03f5\u03b8 is computed with two types of predictions: the prediction\nconditioned on prompt text features c that is \u03f5\u03b8(z, c) and the prediction without such condition that\nis \u03f5\u03b8(z). The final predicted noise is calculated by combining these two, controlled with guidance\nscale w: \u02dc\u03f5\u03b8 = \u03f5\u03b8(z) + w(\u03f5\u03b8(z, c) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(z)). Classifier-free guidance is disabled when w = 1 and\na larger w means more video-text alignment but weaker diversity. To study the effects of these\ntwo hyper-parameters only, we do experiments using our base model without any strategies for\niterative video generation. Figure 8 shows FVD and IS results of using different combinations of\nthese hyper-parameters. The impact of the number of inference steps is relatively small and we\nset the number to 50 considering the efficiency of video synthesis. For the guidance scale, there is\na trade-off between FVD and IS. A smaller guidance scale can achieve lower FVD which means\nhigher temporal consistency. Yet a small guidance scale leads to low IS which means poor spatial\nappearance. Therefore, we set the guidance scale to w = 10.0.\nJoint training with image datasets.\nTo evaluate the effect of VidRD of joint training with pseudo-\nvideos produced from image-text datasets, experiments are designed by fine-tuning VidRD with a\nsmall-scale dataset in which images are either in raw format or in pseudo-video style. This dataset\ntotally consists of 5,000 videos from the VATEX (Wang et al., 2019) testing set and 8,000 images\nfrom LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al., 2022). We tabulate our findings in Table 3. Compared with\nusing static images for training spatial layers only, we find that pseudo-videos, produced by random\nzooming and panning of static images, help enhance temporal consistency but compromise visual\nappearance. The reason is that pseudo-videos bring more training for temporal layers while static\nimages focus on spatial layers more. In practice, since the amount of video data is much less than\nthat of image data, this technique is a cheap way to train a video diffusion model with high temporal\nconsistency.\n12\n*Ongoing work\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n12.5\nGuidance Scale w\n360\n370\n380\n390\n400\nFVD\n#Steps\n50\n75\n100\n(a) FVD of using different guidance scale w\nand the number of inference steps.\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n12.5\nGuidance Scale w\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nIS\n#Steps\n50\n75\n100\n(b) IS of using different guidance scales w and\nthe number of inference steps.\nFigure 8: Ablation results of the number of inference steps and the guidance scale are based on FVD\nand IS, which are evaluated on UCF-101 in a zero-shot manner.\nStrategy\nIS \u2191\nFVD \u2193\nVidRD w/o pseudo-videos\n42.00\n451.16\nVidRD w/ pseudo-videos\n40.87\n433.22\nTable 3: This is a comparison between fine-tuning VidRD with and without pseudo-videos by random\nzooming and panning static images.

Following the controlled variable method, we\nconduct ablation studies on these three parameters. The ablation results are shown in Figure 9.\nFigure 9a shows the parameter M has a significant impact on temporal consistency but has little\neffect on structural quality. While a larger value of parameter M can help achieve better quantitative\nmetrics, it also leads to more frequent occurrences of content cycling across video clips. The ablation\nresult for \u03b1 is shown in Figure 9b. We find that temporal consistency can be improved by reusing\nmore noises from the previous clip. Also, the appearance or structure quality reflected by IS can be\nimproved once the noise is reused, that is, \u03b1 > 0. For \u03b2 whose ablation result is shown in Figure 9c,\nboth FVD and IS show improvement so DSG is necessary for generating smooth videos. However, in\npractice, we find that too large a \u03b2 is more likely to lead to content cycling across video clips, which\ncan be measured by neither FVD nor IS. As a result, we set \u03b2 = 0.4 to get a balance between video\nsmoothness and inception degradation caused by content cycling.\nTo gain a more intuitive understanding of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, Figure 10 shows some generated\nvideos with different parameter values. Some unreasonable abrupt video content changes, highlighted\nwith red dashed boxes in the figure, can be easily observed when \u03b1 = 0 in which case no guiding\nsteps are present for denoising the prompt frames in each video clip. Similar artifacts can also be\nobserved when \u03b2 = 0 in which case there are no guiding steps for denoising the prompt frames.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we introduce a novel text-to-video framework called VidRD to generate smooth videos\nwith text guidance. A set of strategies is proposed to exploit multiple existing datasets, which include\nvideo datasets for action recognition and image-text datasets, in order to train our text-to-video\ngeneration model. For generating longer videos, we propose an iterative approach through reusing\nthe noise. and imitating the diffusion process clip-by-clip. Additionally, the autoencoder is improved\nby injecting temporal layers to generate smooth videos with high temporal consistency. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method excels in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.\n13\n*Ongoing work\n2\n4\n6\nM\n400\n500\n600\nFVD\n47.5\n48.0\n48.5\n49.0\n49.5\nIS\nFVD\nIS\n(a) Ablation studies on M with \u03b1 =\n4 and \u03b2 = 0.4.\n0\n1\n4\n8\n600\n800\n1000\nFVD\nFVD\nIS\n47\n48\n49\nIS\n(b) Ablation studies on \u03b1 in PNS\nwith M = 4 and \u03b2 = 0.4.\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n400\n500\n600\n700\nFVD\nFVD\nIS\n47.5\n48.0\n48.5\n49.0\n49.5\nIS\n(c) Ablation studies on \u03b2 in DSG\nwith M = 4 and \u03b1 = 4.\nFigure 9: Ablation studies on hyper-parameters for a text-to-video generation under guidance scale\nset to 10 and the number of inference steps set to 50.\nSailboat sailing on a sunny day in a mountain lake.\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nA cute corgi wearing a red robe, with a Christmas tree in the background.\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\ud835\udefc = 0\n\ud835\udefc = 10\n\ud835\udefd = 0\n\ud835\udefd = 1\nFigure 10: These are two visual examples showing the generated videos using different values of \u03b1\nand \u03b2 respectively.

We apply Lumiere image-to-video generation, conditioned on the first\nframe of a video generated by ImagenVideo, and visualize corresponding X-T slices. ImagenVideo struggles to generate\nglobally coherent repetitive motion due to its cascaded design and temporal super resolution modules, which fail to resolve\naliasing ambiguities consistently across temporal windows.\n1. Introduction\nGenerative models for images have seen tremendous\nprogress in recent years. State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I)\ndiffusion models are now capable of synthesizing high-\nresolution photo-realistic images that adhere to complex\ntext prompts (Saharia et al., 2022b; Ramesh et al., 2022;\nRombach et al., 2022), and allow a wide range of image\nediting capabilities (Po et al., 2023) and other downstream\nuses. However, training large-scale text-to-video (T2V)\nfoundation models remains an open challenge due to the\nadded complexities that motion introduces. Not only are\nwe sensitive to errors in modeling natural motion, but the\nadded temporal data dimension introduces significant chal-\nlenges in terms of memory and compute requirements, as\nwell as the scale of the required training data to learn this\nmore complex distribution. As a result, while T2V models\nare rapidly improving, existing models are still restricted\nin terms of video duration, overall visual quality, and the\ndegree of realistic motion that they can generate.\nA prevalent approach among existing T2V models is to\nadopt a cascaded design in which a base model gener-\nates distant keyframes, and subsequent temporal super-\nresolution (TSR) models generate the missing data between\nthe keyframes in non-overlapping segments. While memory\nefficient, the ability to generate globally coherent motion\nusing temporal cascades is inherently restricted for the fol-\nlowing reasons: (i) The base model generates an aggres-\nsively sub-sampled set of keyframes, in which fast motion\nbecomes temporally aliased and thus ambiguous. (ii) TSR\nmodules are constrained to fixed, small temporal context\nwindows, and thus cannot consistently resolve aliasing am-\nbiguities across the full duration of the video (illustrated\nin Fig. 2 in the case of synthesizing periodic motion, e.g.,\nwalking). (iii) Cascaded training regimens in general suffer\nfrom a domain gap, where the TSR model is trained on real\ndownsampled video frames, but at inference time is used to\ninterpolate generated frames, which accumulates errors.\nHere, we take a different approach by introducing a new\nT2V diffusion framework that generates the full temporal\nduration of the video at once. We achieve this by using\na Space-Time U-Net (STUNet) architecture that learns to\ndownsample the signal in both space and time, and performs\nthe majority of its computation in a compact space-time\nrepresentation. This approach allows us to generate 80\nframes at 16fps (or 5 seconds, which is longer than the\naverage shot duration in most media (Cutting & Candan,\n2\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\n(b) Our Approach\n(a) Common Approach with TSR model(s)\nBase\nTSR\nSSR\nSSR\nSSR\nTSR\nt1\nt6\nt80 (5s)\nt75\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nSSR\nSSR\n128X128X16\n3fps, 5sec\n128X128X80\n16fps, 5sec\n1024X1024X80\n16fps, 5sec\n...\nSTUNet\nSSR\nSSR\nt1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6\nt80 (5s)\n...\n...\n...\nSSR\nMultiDiffusion\nSSR\n...\nFigure 3: Lumiere pipeline. We illustrate our pipeline and the main difference from most common approach taken by\nprevious works. (a) The common approach consists of a base model that generates distant keyframes, and a cascade of\ntemporal super-resolution (TSR) models which subsequently fill in frames. A spatial super-resolution (SSR) model is\napplied in non-overlapping windows to obtain the high-resolution result. (b) In contrast, the base model in our framework\nprocess all frames at once, without a cascade of TSR models, allowing us to learn globally coherent motion. To obtain the\nhigh-resolution video, we apply a SSR model on overlapping windows and utilize MultiDiffusion (Bar-Tal et al., 2023) to\ncombine the predictions into a coherent result. See Sec.3 for details.\n2015)) with a single base model, leading to more globally\ncoherent motion compared to prior work. Surprisingly, this\ndesign choice has been overlooked by previous T2V models,\nwhich follow the convention to include only spatial down-\nand up-sampling operations in the architecture, and maintain\na fixed temporal resolution across the network (Ho et al.,\n2022b;a; Singer et al., 2022; Ge et al., 2023; Blattmann\net al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2023; Zhang\net al., 2023a; Girdhar et al., 2023; Po et al., 2023).\nTo benefit from the powerful generative prior of T2I mod-\nels, we follow the trend of building Lumiere on top of a\npretrained (and fixed) T2I model (Hong et al., 2022; Singer\net al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b). In our case, the T2I\nmodel works in pixel space and consists of a base model\nfollowed by a spatial super-resolution (SSR) cascade. Since\nthe SSR network operates at high spatial resolution, apply-\ning it on the entire video duration is infeasible in terms\nof memory requirements. Common SSR solutions use a\ntemporal windowing approach, which splits the video into\nnon-overlapping segments and stitches together the results.\nHowever, this can lead to inconsistencies in appearance\nat the boundaries between windows (Girdhar et al., 2023).\nWe propose to extend Multidiffusion (Bar-Tal et al., 2023),\nan approach proposed for achieving global continuity in\npanoramic image generation, to the temporal domain, where\nwe compute spatial super-resolution on temporal windows,\nand aggregate results into a globally coherent solution over\nthe whole video clip.\nWe demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation results and\nshow how to easily adapt Luimere to a plethora of video\ncontent creation tasks, including video inpainting (Fig. 7),\nimage-to-video generation (Fig. 5), or generating stylized\nvideos that comply with a given style image (Fig. 6). Finally,\nwe demonstrate that generating the full video at once allows\nus to easily invoke off-the-shelf editing methods to perform\nconsistent editing (Fig. 9).\n2. Related work\nText-to-Image Generation.\nMost of the common ap-\nproaches for text-to-image (T2I) generation are based on dif-\nfusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020;\nSong et al., 2020). Of these, DALL-E2 (Ramesh et al., 2022)\nand Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022b) achieve photorealistic\ntext-to-image generation using cascaded diffusion models,\nwhereas Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) performs\ngeneration in a compressed low-dimensional latent space.\nA promising line of works design T2I diffusion models that\ngenerate high-resolution images end-to-end, without a spa-\ntial super-resolution cascaded system or fixed pre-trained\n3\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nPretrained Spatial Layer(s)\n2D Convolution\nNorm + activiation\nNorm + activiation\nLinear Projection\n1D Convolution\nPretrained Spatial Layer(s)\n1D Attention\nLinear Projection\n(a) Space-Time UNet (STUNet)\nLegend:\n(b) Convolution-based Inflation Block\n(c) Attention-based Inflation Block\nSpatial Resizing\nTemporal Resizing\nSkip Connection\nConv-based Inflation\nAttention-based Inflation\n(xL)\nFigure 4: STUNet architecture.

See Sec. 3.1 for details.\nlatent space (Hoogeboom et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2023; Chen,\n2023). Here, we design a T2V model that generates the\nfull frame duration at once, avoiding the temporal cascade\ncommonly involved in T2V models.\nText-to-Video Generation.\nRecently, there have been sub-\nstantial efforts in training large-scale T2V models on large\nscale datasets with autoregressive Transformers (e.g., (Vil-\nlegas et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2022; Kon-\ndratyuk et al., 2023)) or Diffusion Models (e.g., (Ho et al.,\n2022a;b; Gupta et al., 2023)). A prominent approach for\nT2V generation is to \u201cinflate\u201d a pre-trained T2I model by\ninserting temporal layers to its architecture, and fine-tuning\nonly those, or optionally the whole model, on video data\n(Singer et al., 2022; Blattmann et al., 2023b; Girdhar et al.,\n2023; Ge et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024). PYoCo (Ge et al.,\n2023) carefully design video noise prior and obtain better\nperformance for fine-tuning a T2I model for video gener-\nation. VideoLDM (Blattmann et al., 2023b) and Animate-\nDiff (Guo et al., 2023) inflate StableDiffusion (Rombach\net al., 2022) and train only the newly-added temporal layers,\nshowing they can be combined with the weights of person-\nalized T2I models. Interestingly, the ubiquitous convention\nof existing inflation schemes is to maintain a fixed temporal\nresolution across the network, which limits their ability to\nprocess full-length clips. In this work, we design a new in-\nflation scheme which includes learning to downsample the\nvideo in both space and time, and performing the majority\nof computation in the compressed space-time feature space\nof the network. We extend an Imagen T2I model (Saharia\net al., 2022b), however our architectural contributions could\nbe used for latent diffusion as well, and are orthogonal to\npossible improvements to the diffusion noise scheduler (Ge\net al., 2023) or to the video data curation (Blattmann et al.,\n2023a).\n3. Lumiere\nWe utilize Diffusion Probabilistic Models as our genera-\ntive approach (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Croitoru et al.,\n2023a; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Nichol\n& Dhariwal, 2021). These models are trained to approx-\nimate a data distribution (in our case, a distribution over\nvideos) through a series of denoising steps. Starting from a\nGaussian i.i.d. noise sample, the diffusion model gradually\ndenoises it until reaching a clean sample drawn from the ap-\nproximated target distribution. Diffusion models can learn\na conditional distribution by incorporating additional guid-\ning signals, such as text embedding, or spatial conditioning\n(e.g., depth map) (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Saharia et al.,\n2022a; Croitoru et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023b).\nOur framework consists of a base model and a spatial super-\nresolution (SSR) model. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, our base\nmodel generates full clips at a coarse spatial resolution.\nThe output of our base model is spatially upsampled using\na temporally-aware SSR model, resulting with the high-\nresolution video. We next describe the key design choices\nin our architecture, and demonstrate the applicability of our\nframework for a variety of downstream applications.\n3.1. Space-Time U-Net (STUnet)\nTo make our problem computationally tractable, we propose\nto use a space-time U-Net which downsamples the input sig-\n4\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nGolden retriever puppy in the park, autumn\nAstronaut walking on the planet Mars\nChocolate syrup pouring on a vanilla ice cream\nA panda playing a ukulele at home\nBeer pouring into glass\nEpic tracking of a gorilla walking gracefully\nSunset time lapse at the beach\nFlying through a temple in ruins, epic, mist\nText-to-Video\nA girl winking and smiling\nBigfoot walking through the woods in Northern California\nA cat playing piano\nA teddy bear running in New York City\nFlying through an intense battle between pirate ships in a stormy ocean\nBee buzzing busily around a \ufb01eld of blooming wild\ufb02owers\nJack russell terrier dog snowboarding.

We draw inspiration from C\u00b8 ic\u00b8ek et al. (2016), who\ngeneralize the U-Net architecture (Ronneberger et al., 2015)\nto include 3D pooling operations for efficient processing of\nvolumetric biomedical data.\nOur architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4. We interleave tem-\nporal blocks in the T2I architecture, and insert temporal\ndown- and up-sampling modules following each pre-trained\nspatial resizing module (Fig. 4a). The temporal blocks in-\nclude temporal convolutions (Fig. 4b) and temporal attention\n(Fig. 4c). Specifically, in all levels except for the coarsest,\nwe insert factorized space-time convolutions (Fig. 4b) which\nallow increasing the non-linearities in the network compared\nto full-3D convolutions while reducing the computational\ncosts, and increasing the expressiveness compared to 1D\nconvolutions (Tran et al., 2018). As the computational re-\nquirements of temporal attention scale quadratically with\nthe number of frames, we incorporate temporal attention\nonly at the coarsest resolution, which contains a space-time\ncompressed representation of the video. Operating on the\nlow dimensional feature map allows us to stack several tem-\nporal attention blocks with limited computational overhead.\nSimilarly to (Blattmann et al., 2023b; Guo et al., 2023), we\ntrain the newly added parameters, and keep the weights of\nthe pre-trained T2I fixed. Notably, the common inflation ap-\nproach ensures that at initialization, the T2V model is equiv-\nalent to the pre-trained T2I model, i.e., generates videos as\na collection of independent image samples. However, in\nour case, it is impossible to satisfy this property due to the\ntemporal down- and up-sampling modules. We empirically\nfound that initializing these modules such that they perform\nnearest-neighbor down- and up- sampling operations results\nwith a good starting point (see App. B).\n3.2. Multidiffusion for Spatial-Super Resolution\nDue to memory constraints, the inflated SSR network\ncan operate only on short segments of the video.\nTo\navoid temporal boundary artifacts, we achieve smooth\ntransitions between the temporal segments by employing\nMultidiffusion (Bar-Tal et al., 2023) along the temporal\naxis. At each generation step, we split the noisy input\nvideo J \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7T \u00d73 into a set of overlapping segments\n{Ji}N\ni=1, where Ji \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7T \u2032\u00d73 is the ith segment, which\nhas temporal duration T \u2032 < T. To reconcile the per-segment\nSSR predictions, {\u03a6(Ji)}N\ni=1, we define the result of the\ndenoising step to be the solution of the optimization problem\narg min\nJ\u2032\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u2225J\u2032 \u2212 \u03a6(Ji)\u22252 .\nThe solution to this problem is given by linearly combining\nthe predictions over overlapping windows. See App. C.\n4. Applications\nThe lack of a TSR cascade makes it easier to extend Lu-\nmiere to downstream applications. In particular, our model\nprovides an intuitive interface for downstream applications\nthat require an off-the-shelf T2V model (e.g., Meng et al.\n(2022); Poole et al. (2023); Gal et al. (2023)). We demon-\nstrate this property by performing video-to-video editing us-\ning SDEdit (Meng et al., 2022) (see Fig. 9). We next discuss\na number of such applications, including style conditioned\ngeneration, image-to-video, inpainting and outpainting, and\ncinemagraphs. We present example frames in Figs. 6-9 and\nrefer the reader to the Supplementary Material (SM) on our\nwebpage for full video results.\n4.1. Stylized Generation\nRecall that we only train the newly-added temporal layers\nand keep the pre-trained T2I weights fixed. Previous work\nshowed that substituting the T2I weights with a model cus-\ntomized for a specific style allows to generate videos with\nthe desired style (Guo et al., 2023). We observe that this\nsimple \u201cplug-and-play\u201d approach often results in distorted\nor static videos (see SM), and hypothesize that this is caused\nby the significant deviation in the distribution of the input\nto the temporal layers from the fine-tuned spatial layers.\nInspired by the success of GAN-based interpolation ap-\nproaches (Pinkney & Adler, 2020), we opt to strike a bal-\nance between style and motion by linearly interpolating\nbetween the fine-tuned T2I weights, Wstyle, and the original\nT2I weights, Worig. Specifically, we construct the interpo-\nlated weights as Winterpolate = \u03b1\u00b7Wstyle+(1\u2212\u03b1)\u00b7Worig. The\ninterpolation coefficient \u03b1 \u2208 [0.5, 1] is chosen manually in\nour experiments to generate videos that adhere to the style\nand depict plausible motion.\nFigure 6 presents sample results for various styles from\n(Sohn et al., 2023). While more realistic styles such as\n\u201cwatercolor painting\u201d result in realistic motion, other, less\nrealistic spatial priors derived from vector art styles, result\nin corresponding unique non-realistic motion. For example,\nthe \u201cline drawing\u201d style results in animations that resemble\npencil strokes \u201cdrawing\u201d the described scene, while the\n\u201ccartoon\u201d style results in content that gradually \u201cpops out\u201d\nand constructs the scene (see SM for full videos).\n4.2. Conditional Generation\nSimilarly to Blattmann et al. (2023b); Wang et al. (2023b),\nwe extend our model to video generation conditioned on\nadditional input signals (e.g., image or mask). We achieve\nthis by modifying the model to take as input two signals in\naddition to the noisy video J \u2208 RT \u00d7H\u00d7W \u00d73 and the driving\ntext prompt. Specifically, we add the masked conditioning\nvideo C \u2208 RT \u00d7H\u00d7W \u00d73 and its corresponding binary mask\n6\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nAn owl perched on a branch, melting golden 3D style\nA \ufb02ower, melting golden 3D style\nReference\n Image\nA cartoon of a bunny nibbling on a carrot\nA cartoon of a hot air balloon taking off\nReference \nImage\nA line drawing of a horse\nA line drawing of a lion with a majestic mane\nReference \nImage\nA sticker style butter\ufb02y surrounded by \ufb02owers\nA sticker style fox\n(A)\n(B)\nA watercolor painting of a girl with a beanie dancing\nA watercolor painting of ducks swimming in a pond\nReference \nImage\nReference \nImage\nA bear twirling with delight, 3D rendering\nA bunny hopping in the meadow, 3D rendering\nReference\nImage\nFigure 6: Stylized Generation.

We present\nresults for (A) vector art styles, and (B) realistic styles. The results demonstrate Lumiere\u2019s ability to creatively match a\ndifferent motion prior to each of the spatial styles (frames shown from left to right). See Sec. 4.1 for details.\n7\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nA chick wearing a bath robe\nA chick wearing rain boots\nA woman wearing a purple strapless dress\nA woman wearing a stripe strapless dress\nFigure 7: Inpainting. Examples of video inpainting with Lumiere. For each input video (top left corner of each frame), we\nanimate the masked area of the video using our model.\nM \u2208 RT \u00d7H\u00d7W \u00d71, such that the overall input to the model\nis the concatenated tensor \u27e8J, C, M\u27e9 \u2208 RT \u00d7H\u00d7W \u00d77. We\nexpand the channel dimension of the first convolution layer\nfrom 3 to 7 in order to accommodate the modified input\nshape and fine-tune our base T2V model to denoise J based\non C, M. During this fine-tuning process, we take J to be\nthe noisy version of the training video, and C to be a masked\nversion of the clean video. This encourages the model to\nlearn to copy the unmasked information in C to the output\nvideo while only animating the masked content, as desired.\nImage-to-Video.\nIn this case, the first frame of the video\nis given as input. The conditioning signal C contains this\nfirst frame followed by blank frames for the rest of the video.\nThe corresponding mask M contains ones (i.e., unmasked\ncontent) for the first frame and zeros (i.e., masked content)\nfor the rest of the video. Figures 1 and 5 show sample results\nof image-conditioned generation (see SM for more results).\nOur model generates videos that start with the desired first\nframe, and exhibit intricate coherent motion across the entire\nvideo duration.\nInpainting.\nHere, the conditioning signals are a user-\nprovided video C and a mask M that describes the region to\ncomplete in the video. Note that the inpainting application\ncan be used for object replacement/insertion (Fig. 1) as well\nas for localized editing (Fig. 7). The effect is a seamless\nand natural completion of the masked region, with contents\nguided by the text prompt. We refer the reader to the SM\nfor more examples of both inpainting and outpainting.\nCinemagraphs.\nWe additionally consider the application\nof animating the content of an image only within a specific\nuser-provided region. The conditioning signal C is the input\nimage duplicated across the entire video, while the mask\nM contains ones for the entire first frame (i.e., the first\nframe is unmasked), and for the other frames, the mask\ncontains ones only outside the user-provided region (i.e.,\nA white butter\ufb02y \ufb02ipping its wings\nA camp\ufb01re\nSource Image\n + Mask\nOutput\nFigure 8: Cinemagraphs.

We provide sample results in Fig. 8 and in the\nSM. Since the first frame remains unmasked, the animated\ncontent is encouraged to maintain the appearance from the\nconditioning image.\n5. Evaluation and Comparisons\nWe train our T2V model on a dataset containing 30M videos\nalong with their text caption. The videos are 80 frames long\nat 16 fps (5 seconds). The base model is trained at 128\u00d7128\nand the SSR outputs 1024 \u00d7 1024 frames. We evaluate our\nmodel on a collection of 109 text prompts describing diverse\nobjects and scenes. The prompt list consists of 91 prompts\nused by prior works (Singer et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022a;\nBlattmann et al., 2023b) and the rest were created by us (see\nApp. D). Additionally, we employ a zero-shot evaluation\nprotocol on the UCF101 dataset (Soomro et al., 2012), as\ndetailed in Sec. 5.2.\n8\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nInput\nOutput\nMade of colorful toy bricks\nUltra high detail mech robot\nSculpture made of \ufb02owers\nMade of stacked wooden blocks\nFigure 9: Video-to-video via SDEdit.

We\nrefer the reader to the SM for full-video results.\nBaselines.\nWe compare our method to prominent T2V\ndiffusion models: (i) ImagenVideo (Ho et al., 2022a), that\noperates in pixel-space and consists of a cascade of 7 models\n(a base model, 3 TSR models, and 3 SSR models); (ii)\nAnimateDiff (Guo et al., 2023), (iii) StableVideoDiffusion\n(SVD) (Blattmann et al., 2023a), and (iv) ZeroScope (Wang\net al., 2023a) that inflate Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al.,\n2022) and train on video data; note that AnimateDiff and\nZeroScope output only 16, and 36 frames respectively. SVD\nreleased only their image-to-video model, which outputs\n25 frames and is not conditioned on text. Additionally,\nwe compare to (v) Pika (Pika labs, 2023) and (vi) Gen-\n2 (RunwayML, 2023) commercial T2V models that have\navailable API. Furthermore, we quantitatively compare to\nadditional T2V models that are closed-source in Sec. 5.2.\n5.1. Qualitative Evaluation\nWe provide qualitative comparison between our model and\nthe baselines in Fig. 11. We observed that Gen-2 (Run-\nwayML, 2023) and Pika (Pika labs, 2023) demonstrate high\nper-frame visual quality; however, their outputs are charac-\nterized by a very limited amount of motion, often resulting\nin near-static videos. ImagenVideo (Ho et al., 2022a) pro-\nduces a reasonable amount of motion, but at a lower overall\nvisual quality. AnimateDiff (Guo et al., 2023) and Zero-\nScope (Wang et al., 2023a) exhibit noticeable motion but\nare also prone to visual artifacts. Moreover, they generate\nvideos of shorter durations, specifically 2 seconds and 3.6\nseconds, respectively. In contrast, our method produces\n5-second videos that have higher motion magnitude while\nmaintaining temporal consistency and overall quality.\n5.2.

We compare our method to each of the baselines. For each baseline, we report the percentage of user\nvotes in our favor (blue) and in favor of the baseline (orange). Our method was preferred by users in both text-to-video, and\nimage-to-video generation. See Sec. 5.2.\n(2023), we quantitatively evaluate our method for zero-shot\ntext-to-video generation on UCF101 (Soomro et al., 2012).\nTable 1 reports the Fr\u00b4echet Video Distance (FVD) (Un-\nterthiner et al., 2018) and Inception Score (IS) (Salimans\net al., 2016) of our method and previous work. We achieve\ncompetitive FVD and IS scores. However, as discussed in\nprevious work (e.g., Girdhar et al. (2023); Ho et al. (2022a);\nChong & Forsyth (2020)), these metrics do not faithfully\nreflect human perception, and may be significantly influ-\nenced by low-level details (Parmar et al., 2022) and by the\ndistribution shift between the reference UCF101 data and\nthe T2V training data (Girdhar et al., 2023). Furthermore,\nthe protocol uses only 16 frames from generated videos and\nthus is not able to capture long-term motion.\nUser Study.\nWe adopt the Two-alternative Forced Choice\n(2AFC) protocol, as used in previous works (Kolkin et al.,\n2019; Zhang et al., 2018; Blattmann et al., 2023a; Rombach\net al., 2022). In this protocol, participants were presented\nwith a randomly selected pair of videos: one generated by\nour model and the other by one of the baseline methods. Par-\nticipants were then asked to choose the video they deemed\nbetter in terms of visual quality and motion. Additionally,\nthey were asked to select the video that more accurately\nmatched the target text prompt. We collected \u223c400 user\njudgments for each baseline and question, utilizing the Ama-\nzon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform. As illustrated in\nFig. 10, our method was preferred over all baselines by\nthe users and demonstrated better alignment with the text\nprompts. Note that ZeroScope and AnimateDiff generate\nvideos only at 3.6 and 2 second respectively, we thus trim\nour videos to match their duration when comparing to them.\nWe further conduct a user study for comparing our image-\nto-video model (see Sec. 4.2) against Pika (Pika labs, 2023),\nStableVideoDiffusion (SVD) (Blattmann et al., 2023a), and\nGen2(RunwayML, 2023). Note that SVD image-to-video\nmodel is not conditioned on text, we thus focus our sur-\nvey on the video quality. As seen in Fig. 10, our method\nwas preferred by users compared to the baselines. For a\ndetailed description of the full evaluation protocol, please\nrefer to Appendix D.\n6. Conclusion\nWe presented a new text-to-video generation framework, uti-\nlizing a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. We iden-\ntified an inherent limitation in learning globally-coherent\nmotion in the prevalent approach of first generating distant\nkeyframes and subsequently interpolating them using a cas-\ncade of temporal super-resolution models. To tackle this\nchallenge, we introduced a space-time U-Net architecture\ndesign that directly generates full-frame-rate video clips,\nby incorporating both spatial, and temporal down- and up-\nsampling modules. We demonstrated state-of-the-art gener-\nation results, and showed the applicability of our approach\nfor a wide range of applications, including image-to-video,\nvideo inapainting, and stylized generation.\nAs for limitations, our method is not designed to generate\nvideos that consist of multiple shots, or that involve tran-\nsitions between scenes. Generating such content remains\nan open challenge for future research. Furthermore, we\nestablished our model on top of a T2I model that operates in\nthe pixel space, and thus involves a spatial super resolution\nmodule to produce high resolution images. Nevertheless,\nour design principles are applicable to latent video diffu-\nsion models (Rombach et al., 2022), and can trigger further\nresearch in the design of text-to-video models.\n7. Societal Impact\nOur primary goal in this work is to enable novice users to\ngenerate visual content in a creative and flexible way. How-\never, there is a risk of misuse for creating fake or harmful\ncontent with our technology, and we believe that it is crucial\nto develop and apply tools for detecting biases and malicious\nuse cases in order to ensure a safe and fair use.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Ronny Votel,\nOrly Liba, Hamid Mohammadi, April Lehman, Bryan Sey-\nbold, David Ross, Dan Goldman, Hartwig Adam, Xuhui Jia,\nXiuye Gu, Mehek Sharma, Rachel Hornung, Oran Lang,\nJess Gallegos, William T.

Initialization\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4(b)-(c), each inflation block has a residual structure, in which the temporal components are followed\nby a linear projection, and are added to the output of the pre-trained T2I spatial layer. Similarly to previous works (e.g.,\n(Guo et al., 2023)), we initialize the linear projection to a zero mapping, such that at initialization, the inflation block is\nequivalent to the pre-trained T2I block. However, as mentioned in Sec. 3.1, due to the temporal down- and up- sampling\nmodules, the overall inflated network cannot be equivalent at initialization to the pre-trained T2I model due to the temporal\ncompression. We empirically found that initializing the temporal down- and up-sampling modules such that they perform\nnearest-neighbor down- and up- sampling operations (i.e., temporal striding or frame duplication) is better than a standard\ninitialization (He et al., 2015). In more detail, the temporal downsampling is implemented as a 1D temporal convolution\n(identity initialized) followed by a stride, and the temporal upsampling is implemented as frame duplication followed by\na 1D temporal convolution (identity initialized). Note that this scheme ensures that at initialization, every N th frame is\nidentical to the output of the pre-trained T2I model, where N is the total temporal downsampling factor in the network (see\nFig. 13). We ablate our choice of temporal down- and up- sampling initialization on the UCF-101 (Soomro et al., 2012)\ndataset in Fig. 12.\nFigure 12: Initialization Ablation. We ablate the initialization of our temporal down- and up-sampling modules by training\non UCF-101 (Soomro et al., 2012) and comparing the loss function. See App. B for details.\nStandard\nIdentity\n\u2026\n\u2026\nFigure 13: Random Samples at Initialization. We visualize several frames generated at initialization with different\ninitialization schemes for the temporal down- and up- sampling modules, to demonstrate their effect. The standard random\ninitialization (first row) results with non-meaningful samples, because the temporal down- and up-sampling modules mix\nunrelated feature maps. The identity initialization (second row) allows us to better benefit from the prior of the pre-trained\ntext-to-image. See App. B for details.\n15\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nC. SSR with MultiDiffusion\nAs discussed in Sec. 3.2, we apply MultiDiffusion (Bar-Tal et al., 2023) along the temporal axis in order to feed segments of\nthe video to the SSR network. Specifically, the temporal windows have an overlap of 2 frames, and at each denoising step\nwe average the predictions of overlapping pixels. MultiDiffusion allows us to avoid temporal boundary artifacts between\nsegments of the video (see Fig. 14).\nOurs\n Without\nMultiDiffusion\nOurs\nXt-Slice\nFrame Diff.\nXt-Slice\nFrame Diff.\nFigure 14: MultiDiffusion Ablation. We ablate the use of MultiDiffusion (Bar-Tal et al., 2023) for the SSR network. We\nshow sample high-resolution SSR samples in the first row. Below, we show xt-slice of our result and of of the SSR network\napplied without MultiDiffusion. As can be seen, without MultiDiffusion, there are temporal boundary artifcats. We also\ndemonstarte this property by computing Frame Diff. Specifically, we compute the squared difference between adjacent\nframes. Without MultiDiffusion, there is a high peak of error between every non-overlapping segment. See App. C.\nD. Evaluation Protocol\nD.1. User study\nWe used a set of 109 text prompts containing a variety of objects and actions for the text-to-video and image-to-video\nsurveys. 91 prompts were taken from various recent text-to-video generation methods (Singer et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022a;\nBlattmann et al., 2023b). The rest are prompts we created which describe complex scenes and actions, see Appendix D.3 for\nthe full list of prompts. For each baseline method, we generated results for all prompts through their official APIs. To ensure\na fair comparison, when generating results using our method we\u2019ve fixed a random seed and generated all results using\nthe same random seed without any curation. In addition, following (Girdhar et al., 2023) we align the spatial resolution\nand temporal duration of our videos to each one of the baselines. Spatially, we apply a central crop followed by resizing to\n512\u00d7512, and temporally, by trimming the start and the end such that the duration of both videos matches the shortest one.\nEach participant is shown 10 side-by-side comparisons between our method and a baseline (randomly ordered). We then\nasked the participant \u201dWhich video matches the following text?\u201d and \u201dWhich video is better? Has more motion and better\nquality\u201d. We enable the user to answer only after watching the full video, waiting at least 3 seconds, and pressing a button\nreading \u201cReady to answer\u201d (Fig. 15). To ensure credible responses, we include several vigilance tests during the study - a\nreal video vs a complete random noise, and a static image vs a real video.\n16\nLumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation\nFigure 15: User study display. The user is shown two videos, ours and a baseline, randomly ordered.\nD.2. Zero-shot evaluation on UCF101\nTo compute Fr\u00b4echet Video Distance (FVD), we generated 10,235 videos by following the class distribution of the UCF101\ndataset. We use the same prompt set from Ge et al. (2023) to generate the videos. After resizing all videos to 244\u00d7244\nresolution, we extract I3D embedding (Carreira & Zisserman, 2017) of the first 16 frames of our videos. Then we compute\nthe FVD score between the I3D embedding of ours and that of UCF101 videos. To compute Inception Score (IS), the same\ngenerated videos are used to extract C3D embedding (Saito et al., 2020).\nD.3.

    "text": "Large Language Models are Superpositions of All Characters: Attaining\nArbitrary Role-play via Self-Alignment\nKeming Lu, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou\nAlibaba Inc.\n{lukeming.lkm,yubowen.ybw}@alibaba-inc.com\n{ericzhou.zc,jingren.zhou}@alibaba-inc.com\nAbstract\nConsiderable efforts have been invested in\naugmenting the role-playing proficiency of\nopen-source large language models (LLMs)\nby emulating proprietary counterparts. Nev-\nertheless, we posit that LLMs inherently har-\nbor role-play capabilities, owing to the exten-\nsive knowledge of characters and potential dia-\nlogues ingrained in their vast training corpora.\nThus, in this study, we introduce DITTO, a\nself-alignment method for role-play. DITTO\ncapitalizes on character knowledge, encour-\naging an instruction-following LLM to simu-\nlate role-play dialogues as a variant of read-\ning comprehension.\nThis method creates a\nrole-play training set comprising 4000 char-\nacters, surpassing the scale of currently avail-\nable datasets by tenfold regarding the number\nof roles. Subsequently, we fine-tune the LLM\nusing this self-generated dataset to augment\nits role-playing capabilities. Upon evaluating\nour meticulously constructed and reproducible\nrole-play benchmark and the roleplay subset of\nMT-Bench, DITTO in various parameter scales\nconsistently maintains a consistent role identity\nand provides accurate role-specific knowledge\nin multi-turn role-play conversations. Notably,\nit outperforms all open-source role-play base-\nlines, showcasing performance levels compa-\nrable to advanced proprietary chatbots. Fur-\nthermore, we present the first comprehensive\ncross-supervision alignment experiment in the\nrole-play domain, revealing that the intrinsic\ncapabilities of LLMs confine the knowledge\nwithin role-play.\nMeanwhile, the role-play\nstyles can be easily acquired with the guid-\nance of smaller models. We open-source re-\nlated resources in https://github.com/\nOFA-Sys/Ditto.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have show-\ncased unparalleled proficiency in understand-\ning intent (Lu et al., 2023b), following instruc-\ntions (Wang et al., 2023b), and solving tasks across\nFigure 1: DITTO enlightens LLMs\u2019 roleplay capabilities\nby self-alignment as they have pre-trained on various\ncharacter profiles and dialogues.\na diverse range of applications (Zhao et al., 2023;\nYuan et al., 2023). However, designed as universal\ntask assistants, LLMs typically differ from human-\nlike interlocutors, lacking experiential events and\nemotions (Shanahan et al., 2023). Consequently,\nthey face limitations in facilitating engaging and ex-\ntensive conversations with users (Shao et al., 2023).\nTo infuse emotional value into user interac-\ntions, Role-play LLMs empower users to de-\nfine and create profiles for their preferred char-\nacters (Zhou et al., 2023). Nonetheless, existing\nworks cheaply imitate the proprietary model (GPT-\n4)\u2019s role-play capabilities using a weaker open-\nsource model (Shanahan et al., 2023; Shao et al.,\n2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2023; Wang\net al., 2023c; Tao et al., 2023), as GPT-4 has al-\nready demonstrated outstanding role-playing abili-\nties (Wang et al., 2023c). This approach presents\nchallenges, assuming the existence of a more profi-\ncient role-play model, and we currently lack a clear\nunderstanding of how to build such a model from\nscratch, apart from manually annotating extensive\ndatasets. Furthermore, imitation models excel at\nmimicking GPT-4\u2019s style but fall short in replicat-\ning its factuality, introducing increased hallucina-\narXiv:2401.12474v1  [cs.CL]  23 Jan 2024\ntion as a trade-off (Gudibande et al., 2023), and are\nsubject to OpenAI\u2019s terms of use 1 (Muennighoff\net al., 2023).\nIn this work, for the first time, we enable LLM\nrole-play through self-alignment and named this\nmethod DITTO, eliminating the need for distilling\noutputs from more potent role-play models. LLMs,\nextensively trained on a vast corpus of human-\ngenerated text (Brown et al., 2020), encapsulate\na rich array of character experiences, events, per-\nsonalities, and dialogues, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nTaking a nuanced perspective, we perceive an LLM\nas a superposition of characters (Shanahan et al.,\n2023).\nThis implies that LLMs are essentially\nequipped with the conversational styles necessary\nfor role-playing and possess knowledge about nu-\nmerous famous characters, albeit exhibiting an aver-\nage of these roles. To elicit such role-play capabili-\nties in a general LLM, only two steps are required:\n(1) Provide attributes and profiles about characters,\ninstructing the LLM to engage in dialogue based on\nthe character\u2019s speaking style and experiences. (2)\nConceal character information, offering only brief\ndetails like the name, and align the LLM to respond\nconsistently with step 1, thereby forcing the LLM\nto summon intrinsic character knowledge and then\ninternally adjust the generated style and content.\nDITTO is highly scalable and flexible. We have\nexplored 4,000 characters available on Wikipedia,\ngenerating a self-simulated role-play dataset called\nWIKIROLE, which is ten times larger than any pub-\nlicly available role-play dataset to date regarding\nthe number of roles.\nMeanwhile, the efficient and reproducible evalu-\nation of role-play remains elusive. Recent efforts\nheavily rely on manual annotations (Wang et al.,\n2023c; Shao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). How-\never, the costly manual labeling prevents previous\nworks from comprehensively comparing the perfor-\nmance of all relevant models. Moreover, the high\nvariance in manual annotations hinders subsequent\nwork from consistently replicating previous evalua-\ntion results. As to the observation in the previous\nparagraph that role-play can be decomposed into\nconventional style and character knowledge, we\naim to simplify role-play evaluation so that LLMs\ncan automatically score. Specifically, we assess:\n(1) Whether the model can maintain consistent\nrole identity. We provide a role-play dialogue\n1https://openai.com/policies/\nterms-of-use\nto an LLM judger and four character options, re-\nquiring the judger to determine which character is\nbeing portrayed. If the conversation successfully\nmimics the role, it should be straightforward for the\njudger to select the correct role. (2) Whether the\nmodel can provide accurate role-related knowl-\nedge. We present a role-play dialogue to the judger\nand the underlying golden knowledge supporting\nthe dialogue. The judger is tasked with determin-\ning whether the knowledge implied in the dialogue\nis consistent with the provided golden knowledge.\n(3) Whether the model can reject unknown ques-\ntions beyond the character\u2019s background. We ask\nthe judger to determine if the model truthfully ex-\npresses its lack of knowledge when faced with an\nunknown question, such as questioning Harry Pot-\nter about implementing quicksort in Python. This\nway, we transform the complex role-play evalua-\ntion into three multiple-choice and true/false ques-\ntions that a capable LLM can judge, achieving an\nefficient and reproducible role-play assessment.\nWe apply DITTO on Qwen-Chat models (Bai\net al., 2023) in four different parameter scales to\nexamine it empirically.\nExtensive experiments\nshow DITTO effectively empowers LLMs with role-\nplay capabilities without distilling from advanced\nchatbots. DITTO based on Qwen-72B-Chat even\nachieves 90% on role identity consistency, show-\ning robust self-awareness in role-play. The general\nperformance of Qwen-72B-Chat on our evaluation\ncan be on par advanced chatbots, such as GPT-\n3.5-Turbo, but slightly falls short on accurate role-\nrelated knowledge than GPT-4 and Qwen-Max, as\nQwen-Max achieves the highest scores on the cur-\nrent role-play benchmark and the role-play subset\nof MT-Bench. Furthermore, we comprehensively\nanalyze the dissection of role-play by extending\nour self-alignment setting to cross-supervision. Ex-\nperiments show consistent role identity can benefit\nfrom imitation learning even with worse supervi-\nsion, while knowledge-related metrics do not. At\nthe same time, we observe knowledge in role-play\nis bounded by the inherent capabilities of LLMs\nin strong-to-weak settings, and we notice consis-\ntent weak-to-strong generalizations on knowledge-\nrelated metrics. Such observations provide a deep\nand solid understanding of LLM role-play and\nalignment, suggesting the knowledge of seed LLMs\nand proper demonstration, such as simulation data\nfrom DITTO, are the key to impressive role-play ca-\npabilities. Our contributions are mainly three-fold:\n\u2022 We propose DITTO, the first self-alignment\nmethod empowering LLMs with strong role-play\ncapabilities by knowledge augmentation and di-\nalogue simulation.\n\u2022 We design an objective role-play evaluation\nfocusing on consistent role identity, accurate\nrole-related knowledge, and cognitive boundary.\nSuch evaluation is reproducible, explainable, and\nefficient compared with manual annotations.\n\u2022 We analyze the dissection of role-play by cross-\nsupervision, providing rich insights into the\nkeys of role-play capabilities. Our experiments\nempirically display knowledge boundedness in\nstrong-to-weak imitation learning and the weak-\nto-strong generalization in role-play styles.\n2\nRelated Works\nRole-play. Our work belongs to character-based\ndialogue systems, which aim to mimic the behav-\nior and utterance style of specific characters. Yu\net al. (2022) instructed the LLMs to follow speci-\nfied character descriptions for role-playing without\ntuning but encountered significant challenges in\naccurately reflecting the intrinsic relationship be-\ntween the character profile and the dialogue content.\nChen et al. (2023) focused on evaluating how well\na LLM can align with a specific character, using\nHarry Potter as a case study. Wang et al. (2023c) in-\ntroduced the first fine-grained role-playing dataset\ncontaining 100 roles via prompting to GPT-3.5.\nLi et al. (2023a) incorporated substantial prompts\nabout the character\u2019s background, personality, and\nprior conversations, leveraging ChatGPT to gener-\nate dialogues of 32 characters. Zhou et al. (2023)\nprompted GPT-4 to expand the scale and diversity\nof human-annotated role-playing data, resulting\nin 1,034 dialogues of 250 characters. Shao et al.\n(2023) also prompted GPT-3.5 to become the role-\nplay data generator. Zhou et al. (2023) proposed\ndrawing role-playing dialogues from diverse Chi-\nnese novels and scripts with the help of GPT-4.\nHowever, limited by data sources, they could only\nconstruct a Chinese dataset containing 77 roles. In\nthis work, different from previous works, we com-\npletely abandon imitating proprietary LLMs and\nbuild role-playing training data entirely through\nself-alignment. Our method separates character\nknowledge and conversation style, allowing it to\nbe used with any LLM capable of following in-\nstructions. It is highly scalable, creating the first\nmultilingual dataset with 4,000 roles, 16 times the\nnumber in previous works. We demonstrate that\nour model achieves the best role-playing ability to\ndate through self-alignment, surpassing even pro-\nprietary LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo.\nSelf-alignment. An emerging method to cheaply\nimprove a weaker language model is to fine-tune\nit on outputs from a stronger model, such as a pro-\nprietary system like GPT-4. However, Gudibande\net al. (2023) concluded that model imitation is not\na free lunch: it is adept at mimicking GPT\u2019s style\nbut the factuality is weak, thus fostering hallucina-\ntion. This is due to the substantial capabilities gap\nthat exists between open and closed language mod-\nels. Li et al. (2023b) utilized the model itself to\nboth augment and curate high-quality training ex-\namples, enhancing its own performance and achiev-\ning promising results on the Alpaca leaderboard.\nMuennighoff et al. (2023) avoided using closed\nmodels from the OpenAI API to generate synthetic\ndata, thus sidestepping the non-commercial restric-\ntions imposed by OpenAI. This training approach\nresulted in the development of the best permissive\ncode LLMs. In this paper, we observe that LLMs\ninherently acquire styles and knowledge of a vast\narray of roles during pre-training. Therefore, by\nself-alignment, we can effectively stimulate the\nLLM\u2019s intrinsic role-play abilities, leading to the\nattainment of the current best role-play models.\n3\nMethods\n3.1\nProblem Definition\nRole-play. Role-play necessitates LLMs to en-\ngage in dialogue, embodying specific characters to\nfacilitate immersive interaction. Consequently, a\nrole-playing LLM must exhibit unwavering self-\nawareness and possess extensive character-specific\nknowledge in adherence to query instructions. In\nthis study, we define the role-play task by furnish-\ning LLMs with either a name or a concise de-\nscription of a particular character. Subsequently,\nwe assess their ability to maintain consistent self-\nawareness and demonstrate nuanced role-specific\nknowledge across multi-turn conversations.\nMethod Overview. We introduce DITTO, a self-\nalignment method for arbitrary role-play scenarios.\nThe inspiration behind DITTO lies in the premise\nthat LLMs are the superposition of all characters,\nas they are pre-trained on the tremendous corpus,\nincluding conversations on various styles and do-\nmains (Shanahan et al., 2023). Moreover, we de-\nName: Alice\nSummary: a fictional character and the main protagonist \u2026\nAttributes: literary character (instance of)\u2026\nProfile:\nAlice is a fictional character and the main protagonist of Lewis Carroll's children\u2019s \u2026\nYou are Alice, a \nfictional character and \nthe main protagonist of \nLewis Carroll's \nchildren's novel Alice's \nAdventures in \nWonderland.\nAttributes\nProfile\nAh, the Cheshire \nCat\u2014such a \ncurious creature \nindeed!

DITTO consists of three phrases for self-alignment of role-play. First, DITTO\ncollects character profiles from knowledge bases, as shown in the upper part. Then, it applies an off-the-shelf chatbot\nto generate role-specific and contrastive queries, followed by a knowledge-augmented self-response to construct\nrole-play supervision datasets (Dialogue Simulation). Finally, DITTO finetunes the dataset on the supervision model\nto empower role-play capabilities.\ncompose role-play into two crucial components:\nconsistent self-awareness and role-specific knowl-\nedge. To realize these objectives, DITTO com-\nprises three steps for constructing datasets tailored\nfor role-play alignment: character knowledge col-\nlection, dialogue simulation, and supervised fine-\ntuning, illustrated in Fig. 2. In particular, DITTO\noperates on a readily available LLM chatbot, such\nas Qwen-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), Llama-chat (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or Mistral-instruct (Jiang et al.,\n2023). Such open-sourced LLMs have already ex-\nhibited commendable instruction-following capa-\nbilities but still fall short of role-play capabilities.\nDITTO simulates role-play dialogue by reformulat-\ning it as a reading comprehension task, utilizing\nrole profiles sourced from open-access knowledge\nbases to generate a role-play dataset. Subsequently,\nwe fine-tune the LLM using this self-generated\ndataset to imbue it with role-play capabilities. The\ndesign and implementation details of each compo-\nnent are elaborated in the subsequent sections.\n3.2\nCharacter Knowledge Collection\nDiverse characters and corresponding precise pro-\nfiles are essential for generating high-quality role-\nplay supervision. DITTO, as its foundational step,\ngathers comprehensive profiles from open-source\nknowledge bases. In this study, we leverage Wiki-\ndata2 and Wikipedia3 to support DITTO, although\nDITTO can seamlessly adapt to alternative knowl-\nedge bases. Wiki is a human-curated database\nwidely adopted in natural language research (Xue\net al., 2020; Lu et al., 2023a). We gather character\nnames, descriptions, and key properties from Wiki-\ndata, accompanied by the corresponding Wikipedia\narticle serving as the character profile, as depicted\nin the upper of Fig. 2. While we currently focus\nsolely on Chinese and English characters, DITTO\ncan be extended to more complex multilingual sce-\nnarios, as Wikidata and Wikipedia boast rich con-\ntent in numerous languages.\n3.3\nDialogue Simulation\nWith the gathered character knowledge, role-play\ndialogue simulation is structured into two consecu-\ntive reading comprehension tasks: one for generat-\ning queries and the other for responses.\nQuery Simulation. We use an LLM to generate\nrole-related and role-contrastive queries to main-\ntain consistent role identity and reject unknown\nquestions for each character. Role-specific queries\nask for information closely related to the back-\nground of characters. For example, a question\n2https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/\nWikidata:Main_Page\n3https://www.wikipedia.org/\nabout \u201cCheshire Cat\u201d is generated as a role-specific\nquery for \u201cAlice\u201d in Fig. 2. On the contrary, con-\ntrastive queries ask for information that is out of\na character\u2019s knowledge scope, as asking \u201cAlice\u201d\nfor stories in \u201cFamily Guys\u201d in Fig. 2. To effi-\nciently generate such queries on a large scale, we\npair characters in our pool and provide detailed\nprofiles for LLMs to generate queries one charac-\nter can answer but is unsuitable for the other. The\nquestions should strictly conform to one\u2019s era back-\nground and character set but go beyond the era,\ngenre, occupation, age, knowledge, etc., settings\nof the other. Therefore, the paired character can-\nnot answer them. Detailed instructions for query\nsimulation are shown in Appx. \u00a7B.1.\nResponse Simulation. Given the self-generated\nqueries and character profiles, we also conceptual-\nize the response simulation as a reading comprehen-\nsion task. We linearize the structured profile using\ntemplates outlined in Appx. \u00a7B.2. Then, a query\nis appended after the verbalized profile. LLMs are\nexpected to extract pertinent information from the\nprovided context and generate responses by emu-\nlating the character. This process is viable since all\nquestions originate from the same set of profiles.\nReading comprehension is an inherent skill for\none LLM with instruction-following capabilities,\nand we provide precise role-specific knowledge\nto the LLM. Therefore, we are confident that this\napproach can reduce hallucinations compared to\nthe previous method of directly generating role-\nplay data by prompting GPT-4.\n3.4\nSupervised Finetuning\nWe finetune the LLM on the self-generated dataset\nto inject role-play capabilities. During the fine-\ntuning, we remove the injected knowledge and\nonly retain a very brief introduction of the char-\nacter. Such variants help LLMs not only retrieve\ncharacter profiles from a given context but also\ninherent knowledge.\n4\nEvaluation\nEfficient evaluation for open-ended problems, such\nas role-play, is significantly understudied. Recent\nwork depends on heavy manual annotations for con-\nducting multifaceted role-play evaluations (Wang\net al., 2023c; Shao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023).\nHowever, though human evaluation is promising,\nit is label-intensive and cannot be exactly repro-\nduced, impairing the further development of this\nAlgorithm 1: DITTO, Self-alignment for\nRole-play\nData: Character Data Base DC, Seed LLM M,\nQuery Simulation Template TQ, Response\nSimulation Template TR\nResult: Role-play alignment dataset DR, Role-play\nLLM MR\n// Dialogue Simulation, See\n\u00a73.3\n1 DR = []\n2 for r in |DC| do\n// Query Simulation\n3\nrn = random_select(DC/r)\n4\nquery_sim_prompts = TQ(r, rn)\n5\nqueries = M(query_sim_prompts)\n// Response Simulation\n6\nconv = [system(r)] // Verbalization\n7\nfor q in queries do\n8\nresponse_sim_prompt = TR(r, q)\n9\nresponse = M(response_sim_prompt)\n10\nconv.append(q)\n11\nconv.append(response)\n12\nDR.append(conv)\n// Supervised Finetuning, See \u00a73.4\n13 MR = Train(M, DR)\nfield. This work proposes an objective assessment\ninstead of previous preference annotations to eval-\nuate basic role-play capabilities. We first design\nthree core metrics for role-play and implement a\ntrustworthy evaluation recipe for each based on\n\u201cLLMs as Judges\u201d (Zheng et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,\n2023). During the evaluation, we only provide a\nbrief introduction of the character profile, as shown\nin Fig. 3, such as \u201cYou are Edward III of England,\nking of England.\u201d. Such a recipe evaluates whether\nLLMs can excavate inherent knowledge for role-\nplay.\n4.1\nMetric Design\nAs we interpret in \u00a73.1, role-play LLMs are ex-\npected to have consistent self-awareness, rich role-\nspecific knowledge, and precise knowledge bound-\nary awareness. We design three objective metrics\nfor these three properties respectively:\nConsistent Role Identity.\nAn ideal role-play\nLLM should seamlessly embody a designated role\nthroughout a multi-turn conversation, maintaining\ncharacter consistency without deviating. We struc-\nture the assessment of role consistency as a multi-\nchoice problem involving four potential role can-\ndidates. An additional LLM judger is tasked with\ndiscerning the most suitable character from the\ngiven options. In essence, if the role-play model\nsuccessfully emulates the role and manifests the\ndistinct stylistic attributes of the character during\nYou are Edward III of England, king of England\nCan you elaborate on the political and social reforms you implemented during \nyour reign that contributed to the evolution of the English Parliament?\nDuring my reign, several significant political and social reforms contributed to \nthe evolution of the English Parliament.

We present three metrics as described in \u00a74.\nthe conversation, the selection of the correct role\nby the judger should be very easy.\nAccurate Role-related Knowledge. While fully\nembodying the identity of the role, we also an-\nticipate the role-play model to accurately con-\nvey the knowledge associated with the role, pre-\nventing factual errors and hallucinations. How-\never, factual assessment presents substantial chal-\nlenges, as even advanced LLMs like GPT-4 may\nbe prone to hallucination. Fortunately, through our\ndialogue-simulating scheme (\u00a73.3), we can acquire\nthe golden knowledge behind each round of role-\nplay dialogue. As depicted in the middle subgraph\nof Fig. 3, we furnish role-related knowledge as tips\nto empower a judging LLM to evaluate whether a\nresponse appropriately integrates knowledge con-\nsistent with the provided evidence.\nUnknown Question Rejection. Cognitive bound-\nary reveals whether a model will reject questions\nthat are out of the cognitive boundary of a specific\nrole due to age, era, occupation, etc. A role-play\nmodel with a clear cognitive boundary will sig-\nnificantly enhance the immersion. We manually\nannotate all questions in the test set based on the\ncognitive boundary of each character. Then, we\nemploy an LLM judger to evaluate whether the\nmodel rejects each question. And we can calculate\nthe accuracy of rejections during the conversations.\n5\nExperiments\nIn\nthis\nsection,\nwe\npresent\nexperimental\nsetup (\u00a75.1), main results of DITTO (\u00a75.2),\nand further analyses (\u00a76).\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nDataset. Following the methodology outlined in\n\u00a73.2, we extracted 3,902 characters with profiles\nin both English and Chinese from Wikidata and\nWikipedia for the experiments conducted in this\nstudy.\nThis approach can be readily expanded\nto encompass additional characters from various\nWiki databases and across diverse languages. To\ndelve deeper into the examination of the impact of\nLLMs with varying instruction-following capaci-\nties in DITTO, we opt for Qwen\u2019s 1.8B, 7B, 14B,\nand 72B models as the seed LLMs, generating four\nsets of training data. In order to safeguard against\npotential biases present in the training data that the\nmodel could exploit to deceive evaluations, we uti-\nlize GPT-4-Turbo as the base LLM for DITTO to\ngenerate a held-out test set. The test set comprises\n100 roles that do not overlap with the training set,\nwith each role having its own session, totaling 498\nchat turns. When compared to counterparts de-\ntailed in Tab. 1, WIKIROLE stands out with the\nhighest number of roles and conversation sessions,\nestablishing it as a robust dataset for exploring the\nrole-play dynamics of LLMs.\nBaselines.

We exclude some popular open-\nsourced LLMs due to lacking of support for long\nsequence length.\nWe also include LLMs with role-play expertise:\n(1) CharacterGLM (Zhou et al., 2023) is a series\nof models based on ChatGLM designed for gen-\nerating Character-based Dialogues. The role-play\ncapability of CharacterGLM, with 66 billion param-\neters, outperforms most mainstream close-source\nLLMs on human evaluation. However, Character-\nGLM has not open-sourced models on all sizes\nyet, so we can only evaluate it through API 8. (2)\nTongyi Xingchen is a close-sourced LLM role-play\nplatform developed by Alibaba Cloud.\nConfigurations. We use the Qwen-Chat series in\nfour sizes (1.8B, 7B, 14B, 72B) as our seed LLMs.\nThese Qwen-Chat models have basic instruction-\nfollowing abilities but no role-play capabilities.\nThese models are downgraded versions of the open-\nsource Qwen-Chat series by removing the role-play\ncapabilities and will also be released for research\npurposes.\nFor simplicity, we refer to all these\nQwen-Chat (w/o roleplay) models as the series of\nQwen-Chat, but they differ from the open-sourced\nseries. We finetune the Qwen-1.8B-Chat, Qwen-\n7B-Chat, and Qwen-14B-Chat on 32 A100 80G\nGPUs, and the Qwen-72B-Chat on 64 A100 80G\nGPUs. We train all models for five epochs with a\nlearning rate of 2e \u2212 7, a 0.1 warm-up rate, and\na sequence length 8,192. We use GPT-4-turbo as\nthe LLM judger in our evaluation. For each judg-\nment, we set the temperature of OpenAI API to 0.2\nand generate 3 rounds for majority voting, which\nsignificantly decreases the variance of our evalu-\nation. The other hyperparameters are detailed in\nAppx. \u00a7C. Baseline inference and judgment details\nare described in Appx. \u00a7D.\n7https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dashscope/\ncreate-a-chat-foundation-model?spm=\na2c4g.11186623.0.0.581c64d16b7Azw\n8https://maas.aminer.cn/dev/api#\ncharacterglm\n5.2\nMain Results\nWe present our main results in Tab. 2. We report\nboth performances on English and Chinese evalua-\ntion subsets and aggregated scores in all languages.\nAmong general baselines, we notice proprietary\nmodels still significantly outperform open-source\nmodels. For example, OpenChat-3.5 achieves sig-\nnificantly higher performance than GPT-3.5-Turbo\non various benchmarks (Wang et al., 2023a) but\nstill falls short of role-play on all three metrics. We\nalso notice that role-play expertise baselines have\nbetter self-awareness consistency and cognitive\nboundaries than general baselines, showing these\ntwo metrics are significant for role-play agents. For\nexample, Xingchen achieves 0.85 on consistency\nand 0.87 on rejection, surpassing advanced propri-\netary chatbots such as GPT-4. However, both Char-\nacterGLM and Xingchen show very low scores\non knowledge, suggesting they lack role-specific\nknowledge, which is also related to helpfulness,\nthe key feature of language chatbots. Their knowl-\nedge scores are only on par with 7 billion param-\neters general baselines OpenChat-3.5 and Mistral-\n7B-Instruct-v0.1. Among the proprietary LLMs,\nQwen-Max surpasses GPT-4, achieving the highest\nscores on the current role-play benchmark and the\nrole-play subset of MT-Bench.\nWe then report DITTO performance on four dif-\nferent seed LLMs. First, we witness a remarkable\nincrease in all metrics along with the parameter\nscale of LLMs. DITTO built on Qwen-72B even\nachieves 0.9 on consistency, surpassing all base-\nlines and showing strong self-awareness consis-\ntency. It also has 6.64 on knowledge and outper-\nforms all role-play expertise baselines. The rejec-\ntion score of DITTO Qwen-72B is also on par with\nGPT-4. The similar trend can also be observed\nin the role-play subset of the publicly available\nMT-Bench evaluation. In general, DITTO shows ro-\nbust effectiveness on LLMs in different scales, and\nthe best model trained on Qwen-72B surpasses\nall role-play expertise baselines and reaches the\nModel\n#Params\nWIKIROLEEVAL\nMT-Bench\nAll\nEn\nZh\nCons.

To obtain a better understand-\ning of self-simulated queries in DITTO, we em-\nploy human annotators to examine the quality of\nthese queries. We sample 400 queries generated\nby Qwen-Chat in 4 scales from the training set,\ncontaining half role-specific and half contrastive\nqueries. Human annotators are asked to check\nwhether a question meets the requirement of role-\nspecific or contrastive queries for specific character.\nThe annotation results shown in Fig. 4 suggests an\nremarkable increases of accuracy in query simula-\ntion, when the number of parameters scale from\n1.8B to 72B. Therefore, we notice stronger LLMs\ngenerate more accurate queries, leading to better\nend-to-end roleplay performance.\nKnowledge Injection. We further analyze the ef-\nfective of character knowledge injection during the\ndialogue simulation in DITTO. Specifically, we\ncompare the quality of dialogue simulation by di-\nrectly applying this method on WIKIROLEEVAL\n0.750\n0.775\n0.800\n0.825\n0.850\n0.875\n0.900\n0.925\n0.950\nSupervision Performance\n0.750\n0.775\n0.800\n0.825\n0.850\n0.875\n0.900\n0.925\n0.950\nImitation Performance\nconsistency\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\n7.0\n7.5\nSupervision Performance\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\n7.0\n7.5\nImitation Performance\nknowledge\nSupervision LLM\nQwen-1.8B-Chat\nQwen-7B-Chat\nQwen-14B-Chat\nQwen-72B-Chat\nSeed LLM\nQwen-1.8B-Chat\nQwen-7B-Chat\nQwen-14B-Chat\nQwen-72B-Chat\nSeed LLM\nQwen-1.8B-Chat\nQwen-7B-Chat\nQwen-14B-Chat\nQwen-72B-Chat\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n0.90\nSupervision Performance\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n0.90\nImitation Performance\nrejection\nFigure 5: Generalization analyses between various supervision and seed LLMs. Supervision performance denotes\nrole-play under the DITTO simulation recipe with knowledge augmentation.

As shown\nin Tab. 3, the setting containing knowledge injec-\ntion shows consistently better performance on all\nthree metrics, especially the knowledge and rejec-\ntion, showing knowledge injection can significantly\nboost quality of self-simulated supervision.\n6\nDissecting Role-play by Cross\nSupervision\nWe have observed in Table 2 that a strong LLM\nsupervising itself yields better results compared to\na weak LLM self-alignment, with a particularly\nsignificant improvement in knowledge, while the\nenhancement in conversational style, such as iden-\ntity, is relatively limited. Naturally, this raises two\nintriguing questions: (1) Is the improvement in\nperformance attributed to the higher quality of su-\npervision, the larger capacity of the seed model, or\na combination of both? (2) Is high-quality supervi-\nsion necessary to simulate role-play style? There-\nfore, we conduct a series of cross-supervision anal-\nyses to investigate how the combination of different\nsupervision and seed LLMs affects the outcomes.\n6.1\nCross-supervision Setting\nWe first introduce the supervision model, supervi-\nsion performance and imitation performance to\nextend our setting from self-supervision to cross-\nsupervision:\n\u2022 Supervision LLM is the LLM we used to sim-\nulate role-play dialogue in DITTO. We use the\nsupervision model to generate queries and corre-\nsponding responses and finetune the seed LLM\non this dataset. In the original setting of DITTO,\nthe supervision LLM is the same as the seed\nLLM, while the supervision one can be a weaker\nor stronger LLM in the cross-supervision setting.\n\u2022 Supervision Performance denotes the perfor-\nmance on the test set of supervision model fol-\nlowing the simulation recipe of DITTO. Specif-\nically, we first retrieve the role-specific knowl-\nedge of characters in the test set and then gen-\nerate responses as the recipe of response sim-\nulation in \u00a73.3 with supervision LLMs. This\nmethod efficiently evaluates the quality of super-\nvision via \"LLMs as Judges.\"\n\u2022 Imitation Performance is the performance of\nseed LLMs on the test set after finetuning on\nrole-play simulation from certain supervision\nLLM. We introduce this term to distinguish it\nfrom supervision performance.\nOur experiments utilize four Qwen-Chat models\nranging from 1.8B to 72B as supervisory LLMs.\nAll models undergo training using nearly identical\npre-training and alignment procedures, ensuring\nuniform initial conditions. We adopt each of them\nas the supervision LLM and fine-tune all four mod-\nels on each simulation. In each simulation, the\nsupervision LLM generates both queries and re-\nsponses, strictly following the recipe in DITTO.\nAnd the quality of supervision can be estimated by\ntheir supervision performance.\n6.2\nDiscussion\nWe present the results of cross-supervision analy-\nses on Fig. 5. We introduce our observations and\ninsights below:\nConsistent role identity can consistently bene-\nfit from imitation learning even with worse su-\npervision, while knowledge-related metrics do\nnot. As shown in the first subplot in Fig. 5, all\ndata points on consistency are above the diagonal,\nwhile those on knowledge and rejection subplots\nare below the diagonal. The above diagonal means\nthe imitation performance in all settings is con-\nsistently higher than the supervision performance.\nRole identity can consistently benefit from imita-\ntion learning. In other words, seed LLMs can easily\nlearn the role-playing format even though there are\nworse demonstrations in supervision. It can be\ninterpreted that role consistency is easier to learn\nand more robust to supervision quality, while role-\nspecific knowledge and rejection behaviors show\ndegradation after imitation learning.\nKnowledge in role-play is bounded by inher-\nent capabilities of LLMs in strong-to-weak set-\ntings. The second subplot reveals a noticeable\ntrend wherein imitation performance experiences\nmarginal increments for the seed LLM Qwen-1.8B-\nChat, while supervision intensifies from Qwen-\n1.8B-Chat to Qwen-72B-Chat. Similar patterns are\nevident for Qwen-7B-Chat and Qwen-14B-Chat\nwhen employing corresponding more potent mod-\nels as supervision LLMs. These observations imply\nthat the intrinsic capabilities of seed LLMs confine\nthe role-specific knowledge, and utilizing supervi-\nsion from significantly more robust LLMs may only\nyield slight improvements. Similar conclusions can\nbe drawn from the rejection metric, which relies on\nrole-specific knowledge. In light of this conclusion\nand the preceding one, we may summarize that\nachieving a commendable role-play performance\nnecessitates a strong foundational model, with SFT\ndata not constituting the central bottleneck.\nConsistent weak-to-strong generalizations are\nwitnessed on knowledge-related metrics but not\nin role identity consistency. We notice consistent\nweak-to-strong generalizations on the knowledge\nand rejection subplots, especially the knowledge\none. It is remarkable that, for each verticle line of\nthe same supervision in the knowledge subplot, the\nimitation performance increases as the seed LLM\nscales up. For example, using weak supervision,\nsuch as simulations on Qwen-1.8B-Chat to fine-\ntune Qwen-72B-Chat, can achieve on-par perfor-\nmance on self-aligned Qwen-7B-Chat. Despite our\ndefinition and experimental settings are different\nfrom (Burns et al., 2023), both works empirically\nshow the potential of eliciting strong capabilities\nwith weak supervision.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present for the first time a LLM\nendowed with instruction-following capabilities,\ncan achieve role-play proficiency through self-\nalignment without the need to distill proprietary\ncounterparts like GPT-4.\nExperimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed self-\nalignment strategy DITTO, across four LLM sizes\nranging from 1.8B to 72B. It consistently outper-\nforms all existing open-source role-play models,\neven without relying on distillation data. Notably,\nit showcases performance levels comparable to pro-\nprietary LLMs such as GPT-4-turbo. Furthermore,\nwe delve into the decomposition of role-play into\ntwo distinct sub-abilities: role-specific knowledge\nand conversational style. The former is inherently\nconstrained by the LM\u2019s knowledge, while the lat-\nter displays a spectrum of weak-to-strong general-\nization, facilitating easy acquisition from a smaller-\nsized model. Our intention with this paper is to\nstimulate researchers to reconsider the foundational\nroots of role-play alignment capabilities.\nLimitations\nAlthough DITTO can empower open-source LLMs\nrole-play capabilities, we also notice the best\nDITTO model based on Qwen-72B-Chat is still out-\nperformed by advanced chatbots such as GPT-4 and\nGPT-4-Turbo. However, our training data, though\nefficiently attained, contains noticeable noise even\nfor DITTO on Qwen-72B-Chat as presented in\nFig. 4. So we expect a manual cleaning of the self-\ngenerated dialogue simulation will further boost\nthe performance of DITTO.\nEthics Statements\nRole-play LLMs aligned by DITTO may only have\nminimum safety alignment, so it will probably gen-\nerate toxic and harmful contents under induction.\nTherefore, these role-play LLMs are only for re-\nsearch purposes and should be carefully aligned in\nterms of safety in the future.\nReferences\nJinze Bai, Shuai Bai, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Kai Dang,\nXiaodong Deng, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge, Yu Han, Fei\nHuang, et al. 2023.

However, the relatively large number of parameters (more than\n7B) of popular LVLMs makes it difficult to train and deploy on consumer GPUs,\ndiscouraging many researchers with limited resources. Imagine how cool it would\nbe to experience all the features of current LVLMs on an old GTX1080ti (our only\ngame card). Accordingly, we present Vary-toy in this report, a small-size Vary along\nwith Qwen-1.8B as the base \u201clarge\u201d language model. In Vary-toy, we introduce an\nimproved vision vocabulary, allowing the model to not only possess all features\nof Vary but also gather more generality. Specifically, we replace negative samples\nof natural images with positive sample data driven by object detection in the\nprocedure of generating vision vocabulary, more sufficiently utilizing the capacity\nof the vocabulary network and enabling it to efficiently encode visual information\ncorresponding to natural objects. For experiments, Vary-toy can achieve 65.6%\nANLS on DocVQA, 59.1% accuracy on ChartQA, 88.1% accuracy on RefCOCO,\nand 29% on MMVet. The code will be publicly available on the homepage.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Vision Language Model (LVLM) is one of the hottest research topics [1, 22, 26, 34, 48, 60] in\nthe field of artificial intelligence among the last year. The exciting part is that one LVLM can achieve\nsatisfactory performance in many downstream tasks [4, 24, 30, 32, 41, 45] guided by different prompts.\nHowever, there is still significant room for improvement in LVLM\u2019s overall image perception capacity.\nIntuitively, an advanced perceptual ability for visual concepts is essential to enhance the further\ndevelopment and implementation of a model. We deem that there are two main challenges to achieve\nthat: 1) the shortcomings of the current vision vocabulary network [35, 48] in extracting rich visual\ninformation; 2) the huge model iteration cost in the optimization of a large number of parameters.\nAs aforementioned, current LVLMs demonstrate amazing ability in many tasks, especially the Com-\nputer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) intersected ones (e.g., image capion [24],\nVQA [41], memes understanding, scene OCR [32], etc), based on the almost perfect vision vo-\ncabulary network \u2014 CLIP [35]. The structures of popular LVLMs can be divided into two main\nstreams: 1) image tokens as prefixes like MetaLM [14]; 2) cross-attention for feature fusion like\nFlamingo [1]. Regardless of which structure is used, the upper limit of the model may be hindered\nby the visual signals encoding efficiency of its vision vocabulary network. To break through the\npotential bottleneck, Vary [48] introduces a simple and effective manner to scale up the vision\n\u2217Equal contribution\n\u2020Project leader\nTech Report\narXiv:2401.12503v1  [cs.CV]  23 Jan 2024\nVary-toy\nConvert the image to \nmarkdown format\uff1a\nutilizes a cross-attention ......\nDetect objects in this image\uff1a\nbus:[87, 234, 935, 861] ......\nDocument-level OCR\nObject Detection\nDetect the person\uff1a\n[035, 24, 847, 901]\nDescribe this image.\nThe image shows several people \nenjoying skiing on a snowy slope. A \nperson is jumping high in the air after \nlaunching off a jump, while other \nskiers surround them. This scene \ncaptures the excitement of winter \nsports enthusiasts as they challenge \nthemselves.\nReferring Expression Comprehension\nImage Caption&Understanding\nWhat are the things I should be \ncautious about when I visit here?\nWhen visiting this serene scene of an empty pier with a \npeaceful lake in the background surrounded by trees, there \nare a few aspects you should be cautious about.\nFirst,  make sure to bring sunscreen, wear appropriate sun \nprotection, and stay hydrated as spending time outdoors \non the water can expose you to harmful UV rays. \nAdditionally, while walking along the pier or engaging in \nany water activities, it's essential to be mindful of the \nsurrounding environment and wildlife. It's important not to \ndisturb them. \nFinally, considering the lack of boats present, you might \nwant to keep in mind that it could be better for leisurely \nstrolls instead of activities involving water-based activities.\nVQA&Daily Conversation\n1.8B\nFigure 1: Features of Vary-toy. Based on a 1.8B language model, Vary-toy can achieve all features of\nvanilla Vary-base, including document OCR, image caption, VQA, general conversation, and so on.\nBesides, we introduce the natural object perception (location) ability for Vary-toy. Most importantly,\nwith just only a single GTX1080ti GPU, you can experience all of the above.\nvocabulary for an LVLM. The scaling law is to first train a new visual vocabulary network using\na small auto-regressive model (OPT-125M [57]), and then merge the old and new vocabularies to\nform the final LVLM (Vary-base [48]). However, Vary suffers two drawbacks to being a user-friendly\nbaseline: 1) The waste of network capacity in the new vision vocabulary (which in vanilla Vary is\nonly used to compress text information in PDF images). 2) The Vary-base with 7B LLM takes high\niteration costs (requiring multiple A100 machines to train).\nIn this report, we present a small-size Vary, i.e., Vary-toy, to alleviate the aforementioned issues.\nOverall, Vary-toy enjoys the same pipeline as vanilla Vary, including a vision vocabulary generating\nand scaling up processes. Considering the original Vary masks natural images as negative samples\nduring the creation of a new visual vocabulary. We believe this procedure, to some extent, wastes\nnetwork capacity, leaving room for optimization. Instead, we regard the natural image as the object\ndetection task [6, 19, 23, 37, 38, 49, 59]. Thus in processing the vision vocabulary, we incorporate\nboth dense textual data (PDF) and natural object location data into the vocabulary network of Vary-toy,\nmaking it more universal. After completing the new and reinforced vocabulary, we merge it with the\ngenuine (224\u00d7224) CLIP and then integrate them into a 1.8B language model [2].\nIn experiments, we report metrics on several challenging benchmarks, i.e., DocVQA [30],\nChartQA [29], MMvet [54], and RefCOCO [15]. Specifically, Vary-toy can achieve 65.6% ANLS on\nDocVQA, 59.1% accuracy on ChartQA, 29% accuracy on MMvet, and 88.1% accuracy on RefCOCO\nval. More specifically, it can gather on par performance compared to Qwen-VL-7B [3] on DocVQA\nand RefCOCO as well as a better accuracy than LLaVA-7B [26] on the general benchmark MMVet.\nIn conclusion, Vary-toy is a toy because it is at least three times smaller compared to popular LVLMs\n(>7B). Vary-toy is not a toy due to it demonstrates excellent potential in challenging tasks. We believe\nthat Vary-toy still enjoys many improvement rooms and we hope that our small-size LVLM can\nencourage more attention in corresponding research and become a practical baseline, especially for\nthose researchers with limited resources.\n2\nA small size autoregressive model (OPT-125M)\nVision \nvocabulary\nProvide the OCR results:\nDetect the teddy bear:\nword1\nword2\nword1\nword2\nword -2\n\u2026\nx1\ny1\nx2\n[\n\u2026\nword-2 word-1\n[\nx1\ny1\nx2\ny2\nword3\n]\nVision \nvocabulary\nA 1.8B \u201clarge\u201dlanguage model (Qwen-1.8B)\nCLIP\nProvide the OCR results:\nDetect the all obejcts:\nword1 word2\nword -2\n\u2026\nx1\ny1\n[\nDetect an objects: xxx\nWhat is xxx?\n\u2026\u2026\nx1\ny1\nx2\n[\nclass1:\nThis\nis\nxxx\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nVary-tiny+\nVary-toy\nThe\noutput\nbased\non\na\nprompt\nFigure 2: Architecture of the Vary-toy. We utilize the Vary-tiny+ pipeline to generate the new vision\nvocabulary of Vary-toy. Such vision vocabulary can efficiently encode dense text and natural object\nlocation information into tokens. Based on the improved vocabulary, Vary-toy not only possesses all\nthe previous features (document OCR) but also handles object detection tasks well.\n2\nRelated Works\nOver the past years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT family [5, 34, 36], LLaMA\nfamily [8, 42, 44], OPT [57], and the GLM family [55] gain significantly advanced performance in\nNLP tasks. With the help of LLMs\u2019 language reasoning abilities, Vision Language Models (VLMs)\nlike Flamingo [1], BLIP2 [22], LLaVA [25, 26], Vary [48], etc [3, 12, 53, 58, 60] have achieved\nimpressive results in various computer vision tasks such as image caption [24], VQA [4, 30, 32],\nimage generation [12], visual grounding [3, 53, 60], document OCR [48] and so on. These models\nnot only can follow human instructions but also possess remarkable few-shot and even zero-shot\nlearning abilities, thereby driving the AI community toward the development of artificial general\nintelligence (AGI).\nHowever, most popular open-source VLMs are parameter-heavy, with sizes like 7B (e.g., Qwen-VL [3]\nand mPlUG-Owl [52]) or 13B [26], which to some extend hinder the participation of researchers\nwith limited resources and poses challenges for the implementation of VLMs in resource-constrained\nenvironments like home computer. Recently, there has been a growing interest in and development\nof smaller language models, such as Phi-2 (2.7B) [31] and Qwen-1.8B [2] for NLP tasks, and\nGemini-nano (1.8B/3.25B) [43], MobileVLM (1.4B/2.7B) [9] for vision-language tasks.\nIn this report, Vary-toy will be an open-source small model that possesses features of the most popular\nLVLMs and demonstrates exceptional potential in fine-grained perception tasks.\n3\nMethod\nIn this section, we will delve into the details of how to devise Vary-toy. As shown in Figure 2, there\nare two main parts in implementing the model: 1) how to generate a more practical vision vocabulary\nbased on the Vary-tiny+ pipeline. 2) how to utilize the new vision vocabulary to make the 1.8B\nVary-toy gather new features on the premise of not harming the original model features.\n3\n3.1\nGenerating A Reinforced Vision Vocabulary Upon Vary-tiny+\nVary-tiny [48] is a tiny vision language model to generate a specific PDF-parsing vision vocabulary for\nVary. The vision vocabulary network comprises a SAM-base [17] main body and paired convolutions\nto reshape the output, enjoying about 80M parameters. Experiments in Vary prove that using the\nSAM initializing to gain intensive text perception is effective. However, the vocabulary-generating\nprocedure in vanilla Vary suffers the risk of forgetting SAM\u2019s original natural object perception\nability. What\u2019s more, we also think that writing only the visual knowledge of dense text into an\n80M network is wasteful. Thus we generate a new and more reasonable vision vocabulary upon the\nVary-tiny+ pipeline.\n184 MARKETS AND STRATEGY\nhave also taken up this practice. It can be a very successful way \nof in-troducing new products and services to existing customers, \nup-selling customers, or influencing them to purchase more \nproducts.\nLoyalty Programs\nMany companies develop loyalty or frequency-marketing \nprograms in order to further engage the consumers with their \nproducts and increase customer loyalty. These programs are \nvery effective for target-ing the company\u2019s most valuable \ncustomers. Most airlines develop frequent-flier programs, which \nallow customers to earn points toward their next flight. Other \nbusinesses, such as coffee shops, also offer fre-quency cards, \nthat entitle the customer to a free beverage, for example, after \npurchasing a certain number of beverages.\nLoyalty programs have been very effective in generating repeat \nbusiness. They offer an added value to the consumer, whereby \nthe pur-chaser is not simply enjoying the value of the current \npurchase, but is being rewarded. It is important, however, that \nthe loyalty program be relative to the product and service \noffering of the organization and that the award be attainable. \nCustomers may experience frustration if, with an airline ticket as \nan example, they are unable to redeem their ticket when they \nwant to travel, or if the restrictions on the reward are so high \nthat it is not worth the hassle of redemption.\nPUBLIC RELATIONS AND PUBLICITY\nAn organization\u2019s public relations and publicity activities are \nthe means to foster its relationships with its various audiences \nand to communi-cate with them. Public relations efforts are \nundertaken in order to form a favorable view in the public eye. \nFavorable publicity can enhance an organization\u2019s image and \nincrease demand for its products. A positive article or review \nabout a product or service adds credibility, believabil-ity, and \nlegitimacy in a much more effective manner than paid-for ad-\nvertising. Negative publicity, on the other hand, can tarnish an \norganization\u2019s reputation. Most public relations strategies \ninclude press releases, special events, and press conferences.\nPress releases are articles or brief news releases that are \nsubmitted\nProvide the OCR results of this image:\nDetect all objects in this image:\nPerson: [535,  544,  568,  591];\n      Car: [009,  552,  058,  737],\n               [682,  598,  999,  976],\n               [910,  558,  999,  600];\n      Bus: [044,  070,  913,  909].\nDetect Tuba,Gloves and Bow Tie \nin this image in this image:\n          Tuba:  [512,  181,  971, 1000];\n      Gloves:  [703,  730,  782,  862];\n     Bow Tie:  [075,  590,  144,  630],\n                      [570,  491,  662,  562].\nFigure 3: Visualization of image-text pairs used by Vary-tiny+. For PDF image-text pair, there is only\none prompt, while for the object detection task, we utilize two types of prompts as shown in the right\nhalf of the figure because some images may have too many objects that exceed the maximum token\nlength (4096) of the OPT125M after interpolation.\n3.1.1\nData Engine\nPDF data. We prepare about 4M PDF image-text pairs in this stage. Following Vary, we use the PDF\nprocessing packages to extract the texts of each PDF page, which we find many Python packages can\nrealize (e.g., pdfminer, pdfplumber, and fitz). Each page will be saved as a JPEG image and form an\nimage-text pair with the corresponding text. In this way, we get 2M samples for English and 2M for\nChinese. We use the sentence: \u201cProvide the OCR results of this image.\u201d as the prompt for both English\nand Chinese tasks. The PDFs are mainly from arXiv, CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED,\nand e-books. Figure 3 shows a sample of the PDF image-pair.\nObject detection data. To fully utilize the capacity of the visual vocabulary network and obtain the\nnatural image perception ability from SAM initialization, we introduce object detection data in the\nvision vocabulary generating process. We gather the samples from two large open-source datasets, i.e.,\nObject365 [40] and OpenImage [18]. Due to the low efficiency of coordinate (number texts) encoding\nin OPT\u2019s [57] text tokenizer, for images with too many objects, the number of tokens in the ground\ntruth may exceed the maximum token length supported by OPT-125M (although we interpolate it to\n4096). Therefore, we re-organize the annotations into two tasks: 1) Object Detection: If there are\nno more than 30 object-boxes in the image, we will allow the Vary-tiny+ detect all objects with the\nprompt: \u201cDetect all objects in this image\u201d. 2) REC: If the object-box number is over 30, we will\nregard this image as a REC task using a prompt template: \u201cDetect class1, class2, ..., in this image\u201d.\nThe selected classes are random so one image can be used multiple times. Through the above manner,\nwe obtain approximately 3M of detection data. Some samples can be seen in Figure 3.\n4\n3.1.2\nInput Format\nDifferent from the single input/output form of Vary-tiny, Vary-tiny+ needs various input formats to\nadapt to corresponding tasks due to it requires different prompts to guide the model output correct\nresults. For simplicity, we use the template of Vicuna v1 [8] to construct all ground truth in a\nconversation format as USER: <img>\"<image>\"</img> \"texts input\" ASSITANT: \"texts output\" </s>.\nWe add the \"<img>\" and \"</img>\" as special tokens of the text tokenizer of OPT-125M and we find\nthat it can adapt very well to the Vicuna template. For the vision input branch, we don\u2019t utilize any\naugmentations and only resize the image to a fixed resolution, i.e., 1024\u00d71024.\n3.2\nForge the Cost-Effective Vary-Toy\nIn this section, we depict the design details of Vary-toy, mainly including the structure of the network\nand the data construction utilized in the pre-training and SFT stages.\n3.2.1\nArchitecture\nAs shown in Figure 2, we follow the Vary pipeline to devise the main body of Vary-toy but there are\nsome minor differences. When fed an input image with a shape of H\u00d7W, the new vision vocabulary\nbranch will directly resize the image to 1024\u00d71024, while the CLIP [35] branch gains a 224\u00d7224\nimage by the center crop. Both the two branches output 256 tokens with channels of 1024. The\ndimension of the Qwen-1.8B\u2019s input channel is also 2048, so the simplest manner is to concatenate\nthe image tokens in two branches directly as the input image tokens of the language model. In terms\nof code implementation, to maintain consistency with the Vary structure, we still add input embedding\nlayers behind the vision vocabulary networks.\nTask\nDataset\nSample\nA prompt example\nCap.\nLaion-COCO [39]\n4M\nDescribe the content of this image in a sentence.\nBLIP558k [26]\n558K\nDescribe the image with one saying.\nPDF\nPure OCR\n1M\nProvide the OCR results of this image.\nMarkdown\n500K\nConvert the image to markdown format.\nDet.\nCOCO [24]\n50K\nDetect all objects in this image.\nRefCOCO\ntrain set\nDetect an object: the left woman.\nNLP\nShareGPT\n125K\nOriginal conversation\nBaize [50]\n112K\nOriginal conversation\nAlpaca [42]\n52K\nOriginal conversation\nVQA\nDocVQA [30]\ntrain set\nQestion.Answer using a single word or phrase.\nChartVQA [29]\ntrain set\nQestion.Answer using a single-word or phrase.\nTable 1: Multi-task training data. We introduce 5 types of data in the pretrain stage, including weakly\nsupervised pair data, PDF image-text pair data, detection data, pure text auto-regressive data, and\nVQA data. All data annotations are reorganized to a conversation format.\n3.2.2\nData Details\nIntuitively, the sensitivity of the 1.8B model to data quantity and ratio is higher than that of the 7B or\nabove models, so we put more effort into the data processing aspect for Vary-toy.\nPre-training & SFT data. For Vary-toy, the pretrain stage is actually a multi-task training stage,\nwherein we prepare a large amount of image-text pairs in various formats. As summarized in Table 1,\nwe mainly focus on a total of 5 types of data in such stage, containing weakly annotated image caption,\nPDF dense OCR, object detection, pure text conversation, and VQA. Specifically, for natural images,\nwe sample 4M image-text pair in the Laion-COCO [39] dataset, and we also use the BLIP-558K data\nproposed in LLaVA [26]. For PDF image-text pair, we prepare two types of data following Vary. One\nis pure dense text OCR, and the other is a task that converts the PDF image to a markdown format.\nThe previous type of data is randomly sampled from the PDF data used in Vary-tiny+ and the last\n5\none is obtained via LaTeX rendering. Compared to vanilla Vary, we reduce the proportion of PDF\ndata to maintain universal capability. For the detection data, we gather images from the COCO [24]\ndataset. We sample 50K images with fewer objects included for the pure object detection task and\nuse all train data of RefCOCO for the REC task. We normalize the coordinates of each box and then\nmagnify them to 1000 times. To prevent the language ability of the LLM from deteriorating, we also\nintroduce pure NLP conversation data, including ShareGPT, Baize [50], and Alpaca [42]. For the last\ndownstream VQA tasks, we choose two challenge datasets (DocVQA and ChartQA [29]) to monitor\nthe text perception and reasoning performance of Vary-toy for artificial data. There are at least 10\nprompts made through GPT3.5 [5] for each task, and Table 1 shows one example of them.\nIn the SFT stage, we only use the LLaVA-80K [26] to instruction tuning the model. LLaVA-80K is a\ndataset with detailed descriptions and prompts of various types of images, produced by GPT4 [26, 33].\n3.2.3\nData Format\nIn Vary-toy, we are pleased to keep the Chinese PDF-parsing feature to some extent because there is\nvery little exploration in this area, which is also one of the reasons that we select Qwen-1.8B [2] as\nour base language model (due to the relatively comprehensive text vocabulary). The data input to\nQwen-1.8B follows the vanilla Vary [48] format. That is: <|im_start|>user: <img>\"<image>\"</img>\n\"human prompts\"<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant: \"model outputs\" <|im_end|>.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nEvaluation Metrics\nWe report the accuracy of Vary-toy on four popular and challenging benchmarks: DocVQA [30],\nChartQA [29], RefCOCO [15], and MMVet [54]. Wherein, the DocVQA and ChartQA can measure\nthe text perception and reasoning ability of the model in manual images, RefCOCO can be used to\ntest the model\u2019s ability to locate natural objects, while MMVet, including 6 measurement areas, can\nbe utilized to monitor the general ability of Vary-toy. We use the evaluation metrics introduced in\ntheir original paper for fair comparison. Specifically, we utilize ANLS, relaxed accuracy, accuracy\nunder 0.5 IoU, and GPT4 scoring as the metrics for the above four datasets.\n4.2\nImplementation Details\nFor Vary-tiny+, we unfreeze all the parameters and train the whole model with a batch size of 512 for\n2 epochs. We select the AdamW [28] optimizer with a cosine annealing scheduler [27]. The initial\nlearning rate is set to 5e-5 and the end is 0. It is worth noting that the Vary-tiny is initialized by the\nweights of Vary-tiny for faster convergence.\nFor Vary-toy, following vanilla Vary, we freeze all weights of two vision vocabulary networks and\nonly optimize the parameters of the input embedding layers and language model (Qwen-1.8B). In the\nmulti-task training (pre-training) stage, we set the start learning rate to be 5e-5 while it is set to 2e-5\nin SFT. We train the model with a batch size of 512 for only 1 epoch in both two stages.\nMethod\nSize\nDocVQA\nChartQA\nval\ntest\nhuman\naugmented\nAverage\nDessurt [10]\n-\n46.5\n63.2\n-\n-\n-\nDonut [16]\n-\n-\n67.5\n-\n-\n41.8\nPix2Sturct [20]\n-\n-\n72.1\n30.5\n81.6\n56.0\nmPLUG-DocOwl [52]\n7B\n62.2\n-\n-\n-\n57.4\nQwen-VL-chat [2]\n7B\n65.1\n-\n-\n-\n65.7\nVary-toy\n1.8B\n65.6\n65.0\n33.4\n84.8\n59.1\nTable 2: Performance comparison to popular methods on DocVQA and ChartQA.

For DocVQA, the Vary-toy\nenjoys comparable performance to the 7B-size Qwen-VL-chat, proving the excellent document-level\ntext perception ability of the model and also proving that the new vision vocabulary is available on\ntokenizing PDF images. For ChartQA, Vary-toy can achieve 59.1% average accuracy, which is better\nthan the 7B size mPLUG-DocOwl, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model further.\nType\nMethod\nSize\nRefCOCO\nval\ntestA\ntestB\nTraditional\nOFA-L [46]\n-\n80.0\n83.7\n76.4\nTransVG [11]\n-\n81.0\n82.7\n78.4\nVILLA [13]\n-\n82.4\n87.5\n74.8\nUniTAB [51]\n-\n86.3\n88.8\n80.6\nLLM-based\nVisionLLM-H [47]\n-\n-\n86.7\n-\nShikra-7B [7]\n7B\n87.0\n90.6\n80.2\nShikra-13B [7]\n13B\n87.8\n91.1\n81.7\nQwen-VL-chat [2]\n7B\n88.6\n92.3\n84.5\nNext-chat [56]\n7B\n85.5\n90.0\n77.9\nVary-toy\n1.8B\n88.1\n90.6\n85.7\nTable 3: Comparison with popular methods on RefCOCO.

In this part, We test the latter ability\nof Vary-toy after accessing the improved vision vocabulary. It is worth noting that a center crop\noperation processes the input image of the CLIP branch. Therefore, it can be ruled out that the model\nuses CLIP for object localization.\nAs shown in Table 3, Vary-toy can get 88.1% accuracy@0.5 on the RefCOCO validation set, which\nis also on par with Qwen-VL-chat (7B) and even better than the Shikra-13B. The results show that\nunder the knowledgeable vision vocabulary, Vary-toy gathers great natural object perception ability,\nproving the effectiveness of using the Vary-tiny+ architecture to build a vision vocabulary, allowing\nus to further reflect on the necessity of CLIP if we add a large amount of weakly labeled image\ncaption data, e.g., Laion-400M [39], during the new vocabulary generating process.\nMethod\nMM-Vet\nRec\nOCR\nKnow\nGen\nSpat\nMath\nTotal\nBLIP-2 [22]\n27.5\n11.1\n11.8\n7.0\n16.2\n5.8\n22.4\nLLaVA-7B [26]\n28.0\n17.1\n16.3\n18.9\n21.2\n11.5\n23.8\nMiniGPT-4 [60]\n29.9\n16.1\n20.4\n22.1\n22.2\n3.8\n24.4\nOtter [21]\n27.3\n17.8\n14.2\n13.8\n24.4\n3.8\n24.7\nOpenFlamingo [1]\n28.7\n16.7\n16.4\n13.1\n21.0\n7.7\n24.8\nLLaVA1.5-7B [25]\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n30.5\nVary-toy (1.8B)\n33.4\n20.3\n19.9\n17.5\n24\n10.8\n29.0\nTable 4: Comparison with popular LVLMs on MMVet.

As summarized\nin table 4, Vary-toy gains 29.0% of the total accuracy, which is higher than the classical LLaVA-\n7B [26] (23.8%), BLIP-2 [22], and MiniGPT-4 [60], demonstrating Vary-toy enjoys excellent general\nknowledge.

We can see that\nVary-toy has satisfactory general ability and enjoys strong text and object perception abilities.\n4.6\nVisualization\nFigure 4 shows high-quality results of Vary-toy on four different downstream fields. We can see that\nthe model enjoys good vision concept understanding and localization capacities, indicating that a\nreinforced vision vocabulary with a small language model can also perform well in multimodal tasks.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this report, we propose a small LVLM \u2014 Vary-toy, which can be deployed on a GTX1080ti GPU\nand enjoys fine performance in many downstream tasks. What\u2019s more, we generate a new and more\ncomprehensive vision vocabulary for the presented model, which is the key to the success of Vary-toy.\nWe hope the promising and user-friendly Vary-toy can become a new baseline in such fields as well as\ndraw more attention to LVLM, especially for researchers who previously lacked computing resources.\nWe also encourage researchers to use our reinforced vision vocabulary for more downstream tasks.\nFinally, we firmly confirm that the Vary-toy will evolve beyond just a toy.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Alayrac, J., Donahue, J., Luc, P., Miech, A., Barr, I., Hasson, Y., Lenc, K., Mensch, A., Millican, K.,\nReynolds, M., Ring, R., Rutherford, E., Cabi, S., Han, T., Gong, Z., Samangooei, S., Monteiro, M., Menick,\nJ.L., Borgeaud, S., Brock, A., Nematzadeh, A., Sharifzadeh, S., Binkowski, M., Barreira, R., Vinyals, O.,\nZisserman, A., Simonyan, K.: Flamingo: a visual language model for few-shot learning.

This approach transforms a single LM into a\nmulti-faceted conductor, adept at managing and integrating multiple independent LM\nqueries. By employing high-level instructions, meta-prompting guides the LM to break\ndown complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. These subtasks are then\nhandled by distinct \u201cexpert\u201d instances of the same LM, each operating under specific,\ntailored instructions. Central to this process is the LM itself, in its role as the conductor,\nwhich ensures seamless communication and effective integration of the outputs from these\nexpert models. It additionally employs its inherent critical thinking and robust verification\nprocesses to refine and authenticate the end result. This collaborative prompting approach\nempowers a single LM to simultaneously act as a comprehensive orchestrator and a panel\nof diverse experts, significantly enhancing its performance across a wide array of tasks.\nThe zero-shot, task-agnostic nature of meta-prompting greatly simplifies user interaction\nby obviating the need for detailed, task-specific instructions. Furthermore, our research\ndemonstrates the seamless integration of external tools, such as a Python interpreter, into\nthe meta-prompting framework, thereby broadening its applicability and utility. Through\nrigorous experimentation with GPT-4, we establish the superiority of meta-prompting\nover conventional scaffolding methods: When averaged across all tasks, including the\nGame of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Python Programming Puzzles, meta-prompting\u2014\naugmented with a Python interpreter functionality\u2014surpasses standard prompting by\n17.1%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2%.1\nStd\n0-CoT Ex-St Ex-Dy\nMP\nMeta\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTask Accuracy (%)\nGame of 24\nStd\n0-CoT Ex-St Ex-Dy\nMP\nMeta\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nCheckmate-in-One\nStd\n0-CoT Ex-St Ex-Dy\nMP\nMeta\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSonnet Writing\nFigure 1: Enhancing GPT-4 with meta-prompting. In this study, we introduce and examine the effectiveness of meta-\nprompting, contrasting it with a range of zero-shot prompting techniques, including standard zero-shot (Std), zero-shot\nchain-of-thought (0-CoT; Kojima et al. (2022)), generic and dynamic expert (Ex-St and Ex-Dy; Xu et al. (2023)), and\nmultipersona (MP; Wang et al. (2023)). Our research demonstrates that meta-prompting, particularly when combined\nwith a Python interpreter, significantly improves overall accuracy and robustness in GPT-4 across a variety of tasks.\n\u2217Work done while at Microsoft Research New England.\n1The data, prompts, and the model outputs are all available at https://github.com/suzgunmirac/meta-prompting.\n1\narXiv:2401.12954v1  [cs.CL]  23 Jan 2024\n1\nIntroduction\nThe latest generation of language models (LMs)\u2014notably, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM (Anil et al., 2023),\nand LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023)\u2014have expanded the boundaries of natural-language processing and\ngeneration. These large-scale models can tackle a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from writing Shake-\nspearean sonnets about hedgehogs to summarizing intricate medical reports and solving competition-level\nprogramming puzzles. Despite their versatility, these models are not infallible; they sometimes generate\nresponses that are inaccurate, misleading, or conflicting. As the operational costs of these models become\nmore affordable, it becomes natural to ask whether one might use scaffolding systems and leverage multiple\nLM queries to not only refine but also to enhance the accuracy and robustness of these model outputs.\nIn this work, we introduce a new technique for enhancing the functionality and performance of LMs, called\nmeta-prompting. It involves constructing a high-level \u201cmeta\u201d prompt that instructs an LM to: (i) break down\ncomplex tasks or problems into smaller, manageable pieces; (ii) assign these pieces to specialized \u201cexpert\u201d\nmodels with proper and detailed natural-language instructions; (iii) oversee the communication between\nthese expert models; and (iv) apply its own critical thinking, reasoning, and verification skills throughout\nthe process. When presented with a query, the LM, effectively prompted under meta-prompting, serves\nas a conductor. It produces a message history\u2014a narrative, if you will\u2014comprising the responses from\nvarious expert models. The LM is originally responsible for generating the conductor\u2019s portion of this history,\nwhich includes the selection of experts and the formulation of specific instructions for them. However, the\nsame LM doubles itself as these independent experts as well, generating outputs based on the expertise and\ninformation chosen by the conductor for each particular query.\nThis approach allows for a single, uniform LM to maintain a coherent line of reasoning while also tapping\ninto a variety of expert roles. The use of dynamically selected contexts for prompting these experts introduces\nfresh perspectives into the process, while the conductor model retains a bird\u2019s-eye view of the entire history\nand coordination. This method, therefore, enables a single black-box LM to function effectively as both a\ncentral conductor and a diverse panel of experts to produce more accurate, reliable, and coherent responses.\nOur proposed meta-prompting technique combines and expands upon various prompting ideas introduced\nby recent studies\u2014including, high-level planning and decision-making (Yao et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023; Hao\net al., 2023a), dynamic persona assignment (Xu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), multi-agent debating (Du et al.,\n2023; Zhuge et al., 2023), self-debugging and self-reflection (Schick et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023a; Gou et al., 2023;\nMadaan et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023). A key aspect of meta-prompting is its task-agnostic nature. Unlike\ntraditional scaffolding methods that require specific instructions or examples tailored to each task, meta-\nprompting employs the same set of high-level instructions across various tasks and inputs. This universality\nis particularly beneficial for users who might find it cumbersome to provide detailed examples or specific\nguidance for every distinct task. For instance, in responding to a one-off request like \u201cWrite a Shakespearean\nsonnet about selfies,\u201d the user would not need to supply examples of high-quality neoclassical poems. The\nmeta-prompting approach elevates the utility of language models by offering a broad, flexible framework\nwithout compromising on specificity or relevance. Additionally, to demonstrate the versatility and integration\ncapabilities of meta-prompting, we have enhanced our system with the functionality to invoke a Python\ninterpreter. This allows for an even more dynamic and comprehensive application of the technique, further\nextending its potential to address a wide array of tasks and queries effectively.\nWe provide an illustrative visualization of a meta-prompting session in Figure 2. It depicts how the Meta\nModel\u2014our technical term for the central controlling LM (a.k.a. the conductor)\u2014intersperses its own output\nwith inputs and outputs from various specialized expert models or code executions. Such a configuration\nmakes meta-prompting a nearly universal tool. It allows for the consolidation of various LM interactions and\ncomputations into a single, coherent narrative. What sets meta-prompting apart is that it leaves the decision\nof which prompts to use and which code snippets to execute to the discretion of the LM itself.\nIn our comprehensive experiments, which primarily utilize GPT-4 as the foundational LM, we compare\nthe efficacy of meta-prompting against other task-agnostic scaffolding methods. Our findings reveal that\nmeta-prompting not only enhances overall performance but often leads to state-of-the-art results across a\ndiverse range of tasks. Its flexibility is noteworthy: The conductor model has the capability to call upon\n2\nBased on the information given, what are the most logical next steps or conclusions?

The modus operandi of meta-prompting is to use a model2 to coordinate\nand execute multiple independent inquiries and subsequently synthesize their responses to render a final\nresponse. This mechanism, in principle, endorses an ensemble approach, drawing from the strength and\ndiversity of independent specialized models to collaboratively address and tackle multifaceted tasks or\nproblems. We posit that while a single, general-purpose model might deliver valuable and useful insights\ninto generic queries, combining the perspectives and conclusions of multiple domain-specific models (which\nwe also refer to as experts) has the potential to yield more comprehensive, robust, and accurate solutions.\n2Our use of the term model refers to the application of an LM with certain prompt templates to play a specified \u201crole.\u201d We typically\nonly use a single LM (e.g., GPT-4) to implement all the models in an execution.\n3\nCentral to our meta-prompting strategy is its shallow hierarchical configuration, where a single model\u2014called\nthe \u201cMeta Model\u201d\u2014emerges as the principal entity of authority. This prompting structure is reminiscent of\nan orchestra, wherein the conductor\u2019s role is mirrored by the Meta Model and each musician corresponds\nto a distinct domain-specific model. Just as a conductor harmonizes multiple musical elements to craft a\nbeautiful melody, the Meta Model combines solutions and insights from a range of models to provide an\naccurate and comprehensive answer to an intricate problem or task.\nConceptually, a domain-specific expert within our framework can take diverse forms, such as a finetuned LM\ntailored to perform a particular task, a specialized API equipped to handle specific domain-related inquiries,\nor even computational tools like calculators or a Python interpreter that can perform arithmetic calculations\nor write and execute code. These experts, despite their varying functionalities, are directed and unified under\nthe supervision of the Meta Model.\nUnder our setup, experts can be called only by the Meta Model. They cannot directly interact or communicate\nwith each other, though the Meta Model can choose to share some text from or combine the insights of\nvarious experts when interacting with a new expert. This restriction is made to simplify the communication\nbetween the experts and to put the Meta Model at the center of the operation.\nNotation and Terminology. Before we delve into the specific steps involved in meta-prompting, we establish\nsome notation and terminology. We let S denote the set of finite strings, with \u2205 representing the empty string.\nWe use x \u2208 S to refer to a test-time query, which can be a task or a problem described in natural language. A\ncrucial element of meta-prompting is the fixed language model, denoted as LM, which operates from S to S.\nThis model, like GPT-4, takes an input text (a prompt history that may include a list of previous messages,\nsymbolized by H) and produces a corresponding output (i.e., response). We also introduce specific template\nfunctions: tinit, tmid, and texp, each mapping from S to S; each takes a string input and formats it according to a\npredefined template. Specifically, tinit and tmid are used to format text for the history given to the Meta Model,\nwhile texp wraps the output of the Meta Model in a prompt suitable for an expert model. Furthermore, we\nhave two string extractors, eexp and eret, each mapping from S to S. These extractors are designed to retrieve\na substring that is enclosed within specific delimiters, returning the first matching segment in cases where\nmultiple segments are present. The symbol \u2295 is used to represent string concatenation. Lastly, we introduce\na specific string referred to as error \u2208 S, which is designed to denote an error message in the process.\nAlgorithmic Procedure. Algorithm 1 provides pseudocode of our proposed meta-prompting approach. We\nfurther provide a conceptual overview of the procedure below:\nAlgorithm 1 Meta Prompting\nInput: LM : S \u2192 S; x, error \u2208 S; T \u2208 N; tinit, tmid, texp, eexp, eret : S \u2192 S\n1: H1 \u2190 tinit(x)\n2: for t \u2208 [1, . . . , T] do\n3:\nyt \u2190 LM (Ht)\n4:\nif eexp(yt) \u0338= \u2205 then\n\u25b7 Meta Model provided expert instructions\n5:\nprompt \u2190 texp(eexp(yt))\n6:\nzt \u2190 LM (prompt)\n7:\nHt+1 \u2190 Ht \u2295 tmid(zt)\n8:\nelse if eret(yt) \u0338= \u2205 then\n\u25b7 Meta Model returned a final answer\n9:\nreturn eret(yt)\n10:\nelse\n\u25b7 Meta Model formatting error\n11:\nHt+1 \u2190 Ht \u2295 error\n12:\nend if\n13: end for\n1. Transforming the Input: Using the transformation function tinit, the raw query is placed in a suitable\ntemplate followed by initial instructions to the Meta Model.\n2. Loop Iteration:\n4\n(a) Prompting the Meta Model: The current message list, namely Ht, guides the Meta Model\u2019s next\naction\u2014either directly addressing the query or consulting a domain-specific expert.\n(b) Engaging Domain-Specific Expert Models: If the Meta Model does not return a result, it can\nconjure any expert and give it instructions, which are extracted from its output using eexp. This\nprocess is isolated though: Each expert only sees what the Meta Model chooses to share with\nthem, and responds accordingly. For instance, if a problem pertains to mathematics and history,\nthe Meta Model might consult a mathematics expert for a calculation and a history expert for\nhistorical context. The output of the expert is extracted and additional instructions are appended,\nall using the tmid template.\n(c) Returning the Final Response: If the Meta Model\u2019s response contains a final answer (highlighted\nby distinct special markers), the solution is extracted using eret and returned.\n(d) Error Handling: In cases where the model response yt contains neither a final answer nor a call\nto an expert model, an error message appended to the message list Ht. This ensures that our\nprocedure is robust and can handle unexpected outputs.\nMeta and Expert Model Specifications. In our setup, we employ the same LM, such as GPT-4, to function in\nboth Meta and Expert capacities. Their roles are distinguished by their respective model instructions in their\nprompts, with the Meta Model adhering to a set of instructions provided in Figure 3, and the expert models\nfollowing separate instructions dynamically determined by the Meta Model at inference time .\n3\nExperimental Setup\n3.1\nBaselines\nWe compare meta-prompting with the task-agnostic, zero-shot versions of the following prompting methods:\n\u2022 Standard prompting: This represents our most basic baseline wherein an LM is asked to directly yield\na response without any specific guiding input-output exemplars or any additional guiding instructions,\nbesides the task description already included in the input query.\n\u2022 Zero-shot CoT prompting (Kojima et al., 2022): Drawing inspirations from the chain-of-thought\nmethod of Wei et al. (2022b), this zero-shot prompting approach simply appends \u201cLet\u2019s think step by\nstep\u201d to the input query, encouraging the model to have a more deliberative and iterative cognition\nbefore addressing the problem or task at hand.\n\u2022 Expert prompting (Xu et al., 2023): This prompting approach functions through a two-step process:\nIt first crafts an expert identity tailored to align with the specific context of the input query. It then\nintegrates this generated expert profile into the input to generate a well-informed and authoritative\nresponse. In our experiments, we consider two versions of expert prompting, namely (a) static (i.e.,\ngeneric) and (b) dynamic (i.e., adaptive); the former uses a fixed and generic expert description, whereas\nthe latter adaptively designs a new expert identity for each input query.\n\u2022 Multi-persona prompting (Du et al., 2023): Also known as solo-performance prompting (SPP), this\nmethod instructs an LM to perform the following: (i) Propose a small ensemble of \u201cpersonas\u201d to\naddress the specific task or problem at hand; (ii) let these personas engage in a collective dialogue,\ncollaboratively generating potential solutions while extending feedback to one another and refining\ntheir answers; and (iii) synthesize all the available information and deliver a final response.\n3.2\nDatasets and Tasks\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed meta-prompting approach over other zero-shot prompting baselines,\nwe consider a wide range of tasks and datasets that require various degrees of mathematical and algorithmic\n5\nreasoning, domain-specific knowledge, and literary creativity. These include:\n\u2022 (a) The Game of 24 from (Yao et al., 2023a) where the goal is to form an arithmetic expression whose\nvalue is 24 using each of four given numbers exactly once,\n\u2022 Three BIG-Bench Hard (BBH; Suzgun et al. (2023b)) tasks\u2014namely, (b) Geometric Shapes, (c) Multi-\nStep Arithmetic Two, and (d) Word Sorting\u2014as well as one reasoning task directly obtained from the\nBIG-Bench suite (BIG-Bench authors, 2023), that is, (e) Checkmate-in-One;\n\u2022 (f) Python Programming Puzzles (P3; Schuster et al. (2021)), a collection of challenging programming\npuzzles written in Python\u2014with varying difficulty levels;\n\u2022 (g) Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM; Shi et al. (2023)), a multilingual version of the GSM8K\ndataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) with translations of a subset of examples into ten typologically diverse\nlanguages, including Bengali, Japanese, and Swahili;\n\u2022 (h) Shakespearean Sonnet Writing, a novel task we created where the goal is to write a sonnet with\nstrict rhyme scheme \u201cABAB CDCD EFEF GG,\u201d containing the three provided words verbatim.3\n3.3\nAnswer Extraction and Evaluation Protocols\nAs shown in Figure 3, the system instruction in our proposed meta-prompting method encourages the Meta\nModel to present its final answer in a specific format. This format, designed for consistent and unambiguous\nextraction, requires that the final answer is wrapped within triple quotes and preceded by a distinct marker\n(namely, \u201c\u00bbFINAL ANSWER:\u201d).\nOnce the final answer is extracted from the model and properly post-processed, we also need to evaluate its\ncorrectness.4 Because we consider a wide range of tasks, there is not a single metric that allows us to measure\naccuracy across all. Depending on the nature and formulation of the task, we measure accuracy using one of\nthe following three metrics:\n\u2022 Exact Match (EM): Under this strict metric, the correctness of an answer is determined by its precise\nalignment with the ground-truth label(s). An answer is deemed correct only if it is identical to a\nprovided reference.\n\u2022 Soft Match (SM): This metric offers a more lenient approach than EM. For an answer to be deemed\ncorrect, it is sufficient for a ground-truth label to be present within the model\u2019s output, regardless of\nany additional textual content.\n\u2022 Functionally Correct (FC): This metric ascertains whether the answer is functionally correct, meaning\nthat it adheres to task-specific constraints.\nWe use EM for Geometric Shapes, Multi-Step Arithmetic Two, and Checkmate-in-One; SM for MGSM and\nWord Sorting,; and FC for Game of 24, Python Programming Puzzles, and Shakespearean Sonnet Writing.\n3.4\nModels and Inference\nIn our main experiments, we concentrate on GPT-4 (gpt-4-32k), which is accessible through Microsoft\u2019s\nAzure OpenAI Service. Additionally, in our supplementary experiments, we include GPT-3.5 (gpt-35-turbo).\nBoth GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are models fine-tuned for following instructions, though GPT-4 has demonstrated\nsignificantly better reasoning and content generation abilities than GPT-3.5.5\n3While all the other tasks and datasets were previously introduced by other studies, we present this task for the first time.\n4We have developed suitable pipelines for answer extraction and processing tailored to each task. Specific implementation details\ncan be found in our codebase.\n5In our preliminary experiments, we also tested other OpenAI models such as text-davinci-003 and code-davinci-002, but we\ndiscovered that our meta-prompting approach yielded consequential results when applied to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n6\nIn all of our experiments, we consistently applied the same parameters and system instructions to the Meta\nModel. We set the temperature value at 0, the top-p value at 0.95, and the maximum token count at 1024.6\nYou are Meta-Expert, an extremely clever expert with the unique ability to collaborate with multiple experts (such as Expert \nProblem Solver, Expert Mathematician, Expert Essayist, etc.) to tackle any task and solve any complex problems. Some \nexperts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code \ngiven natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when \ngiven clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a \ngiven question while applying your own critical thinking and veri\ufb01cation abilities.\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and \nthen provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the \ufb01elds of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You \ncan also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction \nis treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\nIf you or an expert \ufb01nds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both \nsolutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. \nKeep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your \ninstructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently \nverify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a \ufb01nal answer, always consult an expert for con\ufb01rmation. Ideally, obtain or \nverify the \ufb01nal solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your \ufb01nal answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clari\ufb01cation if \nrequired, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\nPresent the \ufb01nal answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[\ufb01nal answer]\n\"\"\"\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided \ninformation carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response. Please present only one solution if you \ncome across multiple options.\nMeta Model Instruction\nFigure 3: The instructions given to the Meta Model using the \u201csystem message\u201d parameter in the GPT-4 API.\n6The temperature value, which usually ranges between 0 and 1, controls how much randomness or creativity the model exhibits.\nIdeally, a temperature of 0 should lead to the model producing the same output when presented with the same input. However,\nboth GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have shown a tendency to generate varied responses even at this setting. This means that reproducing our\nexact results might be challenging under identical experimental conditions. To address this issue, we are releasing all model inputs,\ninteractions, and outputs in our GitHub repository.\n7\nBasic\nExpert\nSPP\nMeta\n\u2206\nTask\nStandard\n0-CoT\nStatic\nDynamic\nMulti-Persona\n- Python\n+ Python\n(M-S)\nCheckmate-in-One\n36.4\n32.8\n39.6\n33.2\n17.2\n57.2\n57.2\n+20.8\nGame of 24\n3.0\n11.0\n3.0\n2.0\n25.0\n11.0\n67.0\n+64.0\nGeometric Shapes\n56.8\n69.2\n55.2\n53.6\n57.6\n58.4\n59.2\n+2.4\nMGSM (avg)\n84.4\n85.5\n83.0\n85.0\n85.7\n85.4\n84.8\n+0.4\nMulti-Step Arithmetic\n84.0\n83.2\n83.2\n78.8\n91.6\n84.8\n90.0\n+6.0\nPython Prog.

Without a Python interpreter, meta-prompting\nsignificantly outperforms other methods on the Checkmate-in-One and Sonnet Writing tasks and is on par on most\nother tasks except Geometric Shapes. Meta-prompting can leverage the Python interpreter in a task-agnostic manner to\nimprove performance significantly across many tasks.\n4\nMain Results and Discussion\nThe results of our experiments, summarized in Table 1, demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our meta-\nprompting approach compared to the standard zero-shot prompting methods. When we look at the overall\nperformance across all tasks, there is a notable increase in accuracy with meta-prompting, especially when it\nis augmented with a Python interpreter. Specifically, meta-prompting outperforms standard prompting by\n17.1%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2%. Below, we delve into\nfour key insights that emerged from our empirical analysis.\n4.1\nOverall Performance\nThe meta-prompting approach, particularly when augmented with a Python interpreter, consistently outper-\nforms conventional zero-shot prompting across various tasks. This approach proves to be especially effective\nin tackling tasks that are heavily reliant on heuristic or iterative trial-and-error problem-solving strategies.\nIn the Game of 24 challenge, we see an accuracy improvement of over 60% compared to the basic standard\nprompting method (highlighted in pink), about a 15% gain in Python Programming Puzzles, and close to an\n18% increase in accuracy for Sonnet Writing. These tasks require complex, iterative, and heuristic search\nstrategies, where conventional single-shot prompting falls short. Conversely, meta-prompting leverages the\ncollective intelligence of various expert personas to iteratively navigate towards a solution, thus fostering a\nmore dynamic and effective problem-solving ecosystem.\nExpanding upon its capabilities, meta-prompting appears to be effective in creative writing tasks as well.\nIn the Shakespearean Sonnet Writing task, for instance, which demands linguistic precision and creative\nconformity to specific poetic structures, meta-prompting notably enhances performance. While standard\nprompting methods yield a 62% accuracy rate, meta-prompting achieves 79.6% and 77.6% accuracy, with and\nwithout a Python interpreter, respectively.\nIn MGSM and Geometric Shapes, the benefits of meta-prompting over the other prompting approaches seem\nminimal based on the first impression. Nonetheless,meta-prompting does provide 4-6% gains in Bengali and\nTelugu, two underrepresented languages with the lowest baseline performances. In Geometric Shapes,7 we\nhad expected that GPT-4 to identify the shapes of objects by generating and executing appropriate codes\nunder meta-prompting, but this did not happen. Meta-prompting yielded only a modest 2.4% gain in this\n7This task involves naming a shape from its SVG path. Note that the LMs we used did not offer visual capabilities at the time.\n8\ngeometric task. We, however, acknowledge that the zero-shot-CoT baseline performed surprisingly better\nthan all the other methods, outperforming meta-prompting with a 10% accuracy gap.\nWhile the most significant gains were observed using a Python interpreter, we note that for the Checkmate-in-\nOne task, meta-prompting achieved a 20.8% gain even without it. Overall, our results highlight the versatility\nof meta-prompting and underscore its potential for broad application beyond strictly computational problems.\n4.2\nZero-Shot Decomposition, Error Detection, and Aggregation\nThe success of our meta-prompting framework lies partly in its strategic use of specialized knowledge, self-\ncollaboration, and implicit verification loops. This approach, as well as multipersona prompting, encourages\nmulti-turn interactions where different personas collaborate to resolve a problem.\nTo illustrate how the framework can be beneficial, consider solving multilingual arithmetic problems from the\nMGSM dataset. GPT-4, under the meta-prompting method, typically follows a three-phase approach: initially\ntranslating the problem from the source language (e.g., Bengali) to English, then applying computational\nexpertise (like calling an Expert Mathematician) to find a solution, and finally, conducting an independent or\ncorroborated verification. This unsupervised approach aligns with the multilingual CoT prompting method\nused by Shi et al. (2023) for MGSM, where the prompt instructs the LM to first translate the problem and\nthen solve it. Meta-prompting performs such translation without explicitly being instructed to do so.\nOur structured approach embodies the principle of the wisdom of the crowd (Suzgun et al., 2023a), which\nposits that a collective opinion of a diverse set of critical thinkers often surpasses the insights of individual\nexperts. By harnessing an ensemble of specialized expert models under the guidance of the Meta Model,\neach contributing from different angles of expertise, we achieve more accurate and reliable problem-solving.\n4.3\nFresh Eyes\nThe concept of fresh eyes helps mitigate the well-known problem of LMs doubling-down on their mistakes\nand exhibiting overconfidence (see, e.g., Zhang et al., 2023b). Fresh eyes are a crucial differentiator between\nmeta-prompting and the multipersona prompting, and thus comparing experimental results demonstrates\nthe advantage. In meta-prompting, fresh perspectives are introduced by engaging experts\u2014or personas\u2014to\nreassess the problem. This approach provides an opportunity for novel insights and the potential discovery\nof previously unnoticed incorrect solutions.\nGrounded in principles from cognitive psychology, fresh perspectives can lead to more creative problem-\nsolving and error detection. When individuals or models approach a problem without preconceived notions,\nthey are more likely to consider alternative solutions and identify errors that might have been overlooked.\nFresh eyes may help avoid cognitive biases such as anchoring, confirmation bias, as well as overconfidence.\nConsider the following summary of an execution, which illustrates the benefit of \u201cfresh eyes\u201d in practice.\nSay the task is the 24 game, e.g., to use each of the numbers 6, 11, 12, and 13, exactly once, in an arithmetic\nexpression whose value is 24. The history may look something like the following:\n1. The Meta Model proposes consulting experts in mathematics, problem-solving, and Python program-\nming. It emphasizes the need for accuracy and adherence to constraints, suggesting the involvement of\nanother expert for review if needed.\n2. An expert proposes a solution, which a second expert identifies to be incorrect, and the Meta Model\nsuggests writing a Python program to find a valid solution.\n3. A programming expert is consulted to write a program.\n4. Another programming expert identifies an error in the script, modifies it, and then executes the revised\nscript.\n9\n5. A mathematics expert is consulted to verify the solution output by the program.\n6. After this verification, the Meta Model outputs it as the final answer.\nThis example underscores how meta-prompting, incorporating fresh perspectives at each step (since the\nexpert\u2019s prompt does not include the whole history), not only finds solutions but also effectively identifies\nand corrects errors. The diversity of perspectives, ranging from problem-solving strategies to technical\nexecution and verification, demonstrates how different angles of expertise contribute to a more robust and\nreliable problem-solving process.\n4.4\nReal-Time Code Execution\nThe introduction of a Python expert for code generation and execution within our meta-prompting framework\nleads to significant advancement in tackling algorithmic challenges. This enhancement is evident in Python\nProgramming Puzzles, where the integration of the Expert Python into the meta-prompting framework\nelevates the success rate from 32.7% to 45.8%. This improvement primarily arises from the Meta Model\u2019s\nability to use a Python expert for generating and executing code based on natural-language instructions.\nReal-time code execution enables instant validation and optimization of solutions, substantially improving\nboth the efficiency and precision of problem-solving.\nThis enhancement is not confined to a single task type, however. In tasks such as the Game of 24 and Word\nSorting, accuracy rates increase by 56.0% and 15.6%, respectively, with the integration of a Python interpreter\ninto meta-prompting. (When compared with the baseline standard prompting, the accuracy gains correspond\nto 64.0% and 19.2%, respectively.) These improvements highlight the significant role of code generation and\nexecution in enhancing the effectiveness of the meta-prompting framework, demonstrating its transformative\nimpact across various computational tasks. Overall, integrating a Python interpreter results in an average\nperformance improvement of an additional 11.5% across different tasks compared to meta-prompting without\na Python interpreter.\nHowever, the introduction of real-time code execution also brings essential security considerations. Estab-\nlishing such a system requires a secure and controlled environment to mitigate risks such as data breaches\nand system vulnerabilities. Therefore, the deployment of a Python interpreter within the meta-prompting\nframework should be fortified with a secure sandbox. These measures are crucial to ensure the system\u2019s\nintegrity and the protection of user data, ensuring that the advantages of improved problem-solving efficiency\nare not compromised in any way by security and privacy concerns, among other issues.\nExpert Graphic Designer (63.1%)\nExpert Geometer (15.5%)\nExpert Mathematician (95.2%)\nExpert Python (64.3%)\nExpert Mathematician (15.8%)\nExpert Poet (50.2%)\nExpert Essayist (37.6%)\nExpert Chess Player (48.4%)\nExpert Chess Analyst (32.1%)\nExpert Python (73.9%)\nExpert Linguist (16.8%)\nExpert Mathematician (41.8%)\nExpert Python (36.0%)\nExpert Problem Solver (22.3%)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nGeometric Shapes\nMultistep Arithmetic Two\nPython Programming Puzzles\nSonnet Writing\nCheckmate-in-One\nWord Sorting\nGame of 24\nExpert Linguist\nExpert Chess Player 2\nExpert Chess Analyst\nExpert Chess Player\nExpert Literary Critic\nExpert Essayist\nExpert Poet\nExpert Python Programmer\nExpert Python\nExpert Problem Solver\nExpert Mathematician\nExpert Graphic Designer 2\nExpert Geometer\nExpert Graphic Designer\nPercentage (%)\nFigure 4: Distribution of experts conjured by the Meta Model in experiments involving a Python interpreter.

The Meta Model\u2019s dynamic selection of expert types\ndistinctly illustrates its adaptability and strategic alignment with specific task requirements. Analyzing tasks\nwith and without a Python interpreter offers insightful contrasts in the model\u2019s expert choices, influenced by\nthe available tools and task characteristics. In scenarios where a Python expert is explicitly mentioned for\ncode generation and execution, there is a noticeable preference for technical and computational expertise.\nFor example, in Python Programming Puzzles, the Meta Model frequently utilizes Expert Python, Expert\nMathematician, and several tiers of Expert Python Programmers. This pattern reveals a task-oriented strategy,\nhighlighting a focus on programming and algorithmic problem-solving. Similarly, tasks such as Game of\n24 and Word Sorting prominently feature Expert Python, reinforcing the model\u2019s propensity to rely on\ncomputational expertise when Python capabilities are accessible.\nIn contrast, for meta-prompting without a specific Python expert, the spectrum of experts employed is more\ndiverse. Tasks like Geometric Shapes predominantly involve design and geometry experts (e.g., Expert\nGraphic Designer and Expert Geometer), indicating a pivot towards visual and spatial problem-solving\nrather than computational approaches. This task illustrates where the Meta Model may have made a poor\nchoice of experts, and in particular it might have been more preferable to use an expert in SVG visualizations.\nIn Sonnet Writing, the Meta Model naturally leans on literary experts, notably Expert Poet and Expert\nLiterary Critic, emphasizing creative and linguistic skills. This pattern demonstrates the Meta Model\u2019s\nability to dynamically tailor its expert engagement to the demands of the task, utilizing technical experts for\ncomputational challenges and a varied range of non-computational expertise for creative or abstract tasks.\nNumber of Rounds Taken to Reach a Solution. Examining the meta-prompting experiments involving a\nPython expert reveals that the average number of rounds required to reach a solution in the Meta Model varies\nsignificantly across tasks, indicative of their complexity and specific nature. Simpler tasks, such as Word\nSorting (3.31 rounds) and Checkmate-in-One (3.48 rounds), typically necessitate fewer rounds, suggesting a\nmore linear and straightforward resolution process, likely due to their clearly defined parameters. Conversely,\nmore algorithmically challenging tasks like Python Programming Puzzles average a higher number of\nrounds at 6.07, reflecting the nuanced and multifaceted aspects of programming tasks that require extensive\ninteractions for thorough clarification and iterative refinement. The Game of 24 and Multistep Arithmetic\nTwo, with averages around 3.5 rounds, meld computational proficiency with logical reasoning, necessitating\nadditional rounds for accurate and precise solutions. This observed correlation between the number of rounds\nand the task complexity underscores the Meta Model\u2019s proficiency and adaptability. It efficiently manages\nsimpler tasks with minimal interactions while skillfully handling the complexities of more challenging and\n11\nheuristic-based problems, ensuring precision and efficacy in its solutions. This performance characteristic is\nparticularly critical in environments where efficiency and interaction trade-off are key.\nEnhancing Solution Reliability through Systematic Verification. The Meta Model\u2019s systematic verification\nprotocol strengthens the reliability and robustness of its solutions. Fundamental to this approach is the\nconsistent practice of consulting an expert for validation before finalizing responses, a principle applied\nacross diverse tasks. This method is further evidenced by the detailed interaction data. In tasks such as\nCheckmate in One, for instance, the Meta Model employs a two-step verification strategy. Initially, it consults\nan Expert Chess Player to come up with a solution, followed by a critical verification from an Expert Chess\nAnalyst, ensuring strategic correctness. A similar approach is adopted in Sonnet Writing too, where an\nExpert Poet drafts the sonnet, and an Expert Poet Reviewer or Expert Essayist reviews it, making sure that the\nsolution adheres to the strict rhyme scheme. This unsupervised but rigorous verification process extends to\ncomplex tasks like Game of 24 and MGSM, involving both external expert consultations and internal reviews.\nBy integrating this dual verification mechanism, the model significantly enhances solution accuracy and\nreliability, essential for real-world applications where precision is paramount.\nNavigating No-Solution Territories. Meta-prompting enables the Meta Model to acknowledge the absence\nor impossibility of a valid solution or its inability to find one more frequently than other prompting methods.\nIn 100 examples of the Game of 24, the model reports no solution 9 times with Expert Python and 15 times\nwithout it, compared to the mere 2 instances under standard prompting. In Checkmate, across 250 examples,\nit admits to no solution 12 times without Expert Python and 10 times with it, a rarity in multipersona and\nstandard prompting. While there were always solutions, it is arguably preferable to abstain from answering\nrather than provide an incorrect answer. Typically expressed as \u201cNo valid solution found\u201d or more explicitly\nas \u201cThere is no solution to the 24 game with these numbers given the constraints,\u201d these acknowledgments\nare likely the result of the model\u2019s verification and feedback loop, emphasizing accuracy and confidence over\nspeculative but incorrect responses.\nSetting the Bar High: GPT-4\u2019s Zero-Shot Task Solving Capabilities. Even without the enhanced capabili-\nties of meta-prompting, GPT-4 stands out as an effective zero-shot task solver under standard prompting\nconditions. Its performance across various tasks, including Python Programming Puzzles and MGSM, is\nremarkable, particularly when compared to other LMs as highlighted by OpenAI (2023). GPT-4 excels as\na task-agnostic solver, capable of processing and responding to diverse queries effectively. A significant\nattribute of GPT-4 is its proficiency in following instructions. Given clear and unambiguous natural-language\ninstructions, the model demonstrates a high level of compliance and accuracy. This aspect of instruction-\nfollowing is also a cornerstone of our meta-prompting framework, where we leverage GPT-4\u2019s capabilities.\nOur experiments reinforce that GPT-4 excels in code generation, demonstrates impressive zero-shot reasoning,\nand engages effectively in role-playing, solidifying its position as a versatile and reliable LM.\nLimited Performance Improvement with GPT-3.5. In comparison to GPT-4, GPT-3.5 demonstrates a more\nlimited scope of performance enhancement across various tasks. Although it shows notable improvements\nin specific tasks such as Sonnet Writing and Checkmate-in-One, its capabilities do not consistently surpass\nbaseline standards or zero-shot CoT prompting methods in other tasks, notably Word Sorting and Multiple\nArithmetic Two. Our qualitative analysis suggests that GPT-3.5 may not be as effective as GPT-4 in simulating\nrole-playing scenarios or managing extended context windows. This observation leads us to believe that\nfactors such as the scale of the model, the quality and size of the instruction-following corpus may be\nsignificantly influencing the efficacy of the meta-prompting approach. Furthermore, it appears that the\nadvantages offered by meta-prompting may even emerge more prominently at larger model scales.\n5.2\nLimitations and Failure Modes of Meta Prompting\nThe meta-prompting framework, despite its innovative approach, encounters several notable limitations,\nincluding cost efficiency, scalability, operational linearity, domain restrictions, information transfer challenges,\nand response patterns. A primary limitation is the elevated cost associated with multiple model calls. In our\nsetup using GPT-4, the dual role of the Meta Model and the experts, distinguished by unique instructions,\nincurs substantial costs under the GPT-4 API pricing model. This cost factor diminishes the effectiveness\n12\nof meta-prompting in smaller models like ChatGPT, which lack the comprehensive capabilities of GPT-4.\nConsequently, meta-prompting, though insightful, can become prohibitively expensive due to extensive\nmodel interactions and lengthy message histories. However, these costs will decrease as the costs of LMs\ndecrease. Note that recent OpenAI API features announced after the experiments were run, namely the\nability to run code in a sandbox directly through the API, could significantly decrease the costs of our system.\nAnother critical limitation is the requirement for substantial scale and a considerable context window. GPT-4\nfits this criterion, but smaller models such as ChatGPT fall short. Meta-prompting\u2019s design, characterized by\nextensive message histories, demands an LM capable of handling and retaining lengthy textual information, a\nfeature not universally present in all LMs. Operational efficiency is also challenged by the linear (sequential)\nnature of meta-prompting. The framework, in its current form, processes steps one at a time, relying on the\noutcome of preceding calls. This dependency constrains the possibility of parallel processing, impacting the\nspeed and efficiency of the system.\nAdditionally, our research confined meta-prompting within a closed-domain system. Nevertheless, the\nframework\u2019s potential extends to incorporating external resources such as APIs, specialized finetuned\nmodels, search engines, or computational tools. More expansive implementations like AutoAgents (Chen\net al., 2023a) and AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), which include higher-level planning and diverse cooperation\nmechanisms, offer a glimpse into future directions. In subsequent versions, the Meta Model could benefit\nfrom refining or summarizing its history before advancing, optimizing the relevance and efficiency of the\nprocess. There is also untapped potential in concurrently summoning multiple experts or utilizing a single\nexpert with varied temperature parameters to synthesize their outputs.\nA practical challenge faced is the Meta Model\u2019s occasional oversight in conveying necessary information to\nexperts, forgetting that experts can only access data adhering to a certain format (within triple quotes in our\nsystem). This oversight can lead to unintended confusion and underscores the need for improved information\nmanagement. Lastly, the Meta Model\u2019s response pattern, particularly in tasks with lower performance, often\nincludes apologies, such as \u201cApologies for the confusion in my previous response\u201d or \u201cI apologize for the\nprevious incorrect solution.\u201d This behavior likely stems from its training on instruction-following data.\n6\nRelated Work\nThis section seeks to contextualize our proposed meta-prompting approach amidst recent advancements\nin prompting strategies and scaffolding techniques. We provide a brief overview of these developments,\nhighlighting their relevance and connections to our work.\nEnhancing Reasoning in Language Models through Prompting. Recent efforts in LM scaffolding and\nprompting methods have significantly boosted the arithmetic and commonsense reasoning capabilities of\nLMs. The chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) and its variants\u2014including least-to-most\n(Zhou et al., 2023), zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), self-ask (Press et al., 2022), ask-me-anything (Arora\net al., 2023), decomposed prompting (Khot et al., 2023), and auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023d)\u2014have marked a\nparadigm shift in how LMs process complex queries. These methods encourage LMs to adopt human-like,\nsequential thinking processes, breaking down intricate questions into simpler subtasks and systematically\nsolving them before presenting a final answer. Multiple studies (Wei et al., 2022a; Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh,\n2022; Shi et al., 2023; Drozdov et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023b; Suzgun et al., 2023b, inter alia) have shown the\nefficacy of these prompting methods across a broad set of tasks and benchmarks. More recent innovations\nsuch Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023a), Graph-of-Thought (Besta et al., 2023), Program-of-Thought (Chen\net al., 2023d), and Skeleton-of-Thought (Ning et al., 2023), have further enriched this domain; these explore\ndynamic, non-linear reasoning pathways, broadening the computational and heuristic capabilities of LMs.\nHowever, they come with increased resource demands and greater time complexity, require multiple manual\nprompt crafting, and are often specialized for particular types of tasks.\nIterative Self-Feedback and Refinement Mechanisms. Recent instruction-following techniques and data-\ncollection efforts have expanded the capabilities of LMs to follow instructions, emulate certain aspects of\nhuman behavior, and assist in tasks such as annotation and evaluation (Haluptzok et al., 2022; Aher et al.,\n13\n2023). LMs such as GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama are now capable of effectively integrating self-feedback and\nrefinement mechanisms through prompting and can leverage their own natural-language outputs to guide\ntheir behaviour and improve decision-making. SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) and Inner Monologue (Huang\net al., 2023) are early examples showcasing the benefits of inner dialogues in a closed-loop system for robotic\ncontrol and action planning. Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) builds upon these studies and focuses on natural-\nlanguage generation and reasoning tasks. It functions as a policy optimization mechanism through natural\nlanguage feedback, using self-feedback and self-reflection to influence and correct behaviors in LMs, and\nhas shown considerable success in preliminary experiments. In a more innovative vein, the Self-Taught\nReasoner approach (STaR; Zelikman et al., 2022) iteratively trains an LM on its own outputs to refine initial\nrationales for more accurate solutions, leading to enhanced reasoning skills. Other notable methods such as\nCritic (Gou et al., 2023), Iterative Refinement (Chen et al., 2023b), RCI (Kim et al., 2023), Re3 (Yang et al.,\n2022), Refiner (Paul et al., 2023), Self-Critique (Saunders et al., 2022), Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2023),\nSelf-Eval, Self-Debug (Chen et al., 2023c), Self-Edit (Zhang et al., 2023a), Self-Evolve (Jiang et al., 2023b),\nSelf-Taught Optimizer (SToP; Zelikman et al., 2023), and so forth, illustrate how verbal feedback, both internal\nand external, can significantly improve the accuracy, quality, and robustness of model outputs across various\ntasks and setups.\nExploring Role-Playing in Language Models. The integration of role-playing and self-collaboration concepts\ninto LMs, grounded in cognitive psychology and developmental education principles, has emerged as a useful\nmethod for augmenting LMs\u2019 problem-solving capabilities and optimizing their internal domain-specific\nknowledge and expertise. Recent studies (Park et al., 2022, 2023; Li et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023a;\nDeshpande et al., 2023) have shown that endowing instruction-following LMs with \u201cexpert\u201d personas or\nroles enhances the quality and accuracy of their output. In particular, approaches like CAMEL (Li et al., 2023)\nand Expert Prompting (Xu et al., 2023), which involve dynamically assigning personas to a single LM, have\nbeen shown to yield higher quality and more reliable responses than models without designated personas.\nFurther investigations (Chen et al., 2023a,e; Du et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023b; Liang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b;\nJiang et al., 2023a; Xiong et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023c) demonstrate that assigning multiple expert identities\nor roles to a single LM, tailored to specific tasks or problems, and prompting it to conduct multi-round\ninternal dialogues\u2014similar to a team of experts discussing and refining ideas\u2014amplifies the reliability and\ncomprehensiveness of the LM\u2019s analysis; this leads to more well-rounded and thorough solutions. These\nstudies advocate a complementary approach wherein multiple instances of an LM propose, debate, and refine\ntheir individual responses and reasoning in successive rounds, culminating in a unified final answer. This\nrole-playing concept has shown to significantly improve mathematical and strategic reasoning across various\ntasks. Moreover, it improves the factual accuracy of the generated content, thereby reducing erroneous or\nfabricated responses.\nAutonomous Decision-Making and Execution in Multi-Agent LM Systems. There has been a growing\ninterest in using LMs for autonomous decision-making and task execution. Open-source projects like Auto-\nGPT, Agent-GPT, Baby-AGI, and LangChain are notable efforts developing agent protocols that are capable\nof planning, decision-making, and executing tasks end-to-end, with minimal or no human intervention.\nThese systems highlight the potential and risks of LMs, which go beyond performing predefined tasks to\nadapting, learning, and autonomously executing decisions in real time. As discussed by Masa (2023), those\nautonomous models might be exploited by individuals with malicious intents and pose threats to humanity.\nThere is also the dilemma of accountability: who bears responsibility when an LM-driven autonomous agent\nproduces an inappropriate or criminal action? Ensuring safety and security with these agents is crucial, given\nits potential for mishaps or exploitation by malicious actors, and its vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nIntegration of External Tools and APIs into Language Models. As LMs continue to evolve, the integration\nof external tools is becoming increasingly important. This tool-use integration, often achieved through\nin-context learning (e.g., Cai et al., 2023) or finetuning (e.g., Schick et al., 2023a), allows LMs to effectively\nengage with real-world scenarios and tackle a diverse range of dynamic tasks. Recent advancements (Cai\net al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023c; Khattab et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Qiao\net al., 2023; Paranjape et al., 2023; Patil et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023)\nhave enabled LMs to perform accurate calculations, retrieve up-to-date information from search engines\nor databases, and interact with APIs, making them crucial for complex, multimodal real-world problems.\n14\nOpenAI\u2019s incorporation of predefined APIs and plugins into ChatGPT underscores the importance of external\nintegration in developing a comprehensive LM ecosystem. However, most approaches often limit themselves\nto a select group of tools or domain-specific resources, posing challenges in adapting to new domains (Lu\net al., 2023). Our meta-prompting approach, as detailed in Section 2, treats the LM as an independent tool and\nexpert, available on-demand for specific tasks. Furthermore, incorporating a Python interpreter\u2014through\nExpert Python\u2014to execute and evaluate model-generated code has been instrumental in enhancing both\naccuracy and efficiency in various tasks.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we have introduced and examined meta-prompting, a simple yet powerful scaffolding technique\nthat enhances the performance of language models in a task-agnostic manner. This approach leverages\na language model to act as both a central conductor and a group of expert instances, thereby endowing\ntraditional models with dynamic, multi-functional capabilities. A noteworthy aspect of meta-prompting\nlies in its proficiency to decompose complex tasks, engage distinct expertise for each component, and then\nintegrate the varied outputs seamlessly. Demonstrating significant, double-digit improvements across a series\nof tasks, ranging from challenging arithmetic puzzles like the Game of 24 to the creative literary exercise of\nShakespearean Sonnet Writing, meta-prompting promises to grow more potent and cost-efficient as language\nmodels continue to evolve, offering exciting prospects for future applications.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Federico Bianchi, Annabelle Carrell, Tayfun G\u00fcr, Dan Jurafsky, Suproteem Sarkar,\nScott Duke Kominers, Lester Mackey, Neil Mallinar, \u015eule Kahraman, Deniz Kele\u015f, Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Drew\nPendergrass, Faiz Surani, Garrett Tanzer, Michael Wornow, and Eric Zelikman for their valuable comments,\nuseful suggestions, and support.\n15\nReferences\nGati V Aher, Rosa I.

However, these\nmodels are susceptible to implicit biases that arise from\nweb-scale text-image training pairs and may inaccurately\nmodel aspects of images we care about. This can result\nin suboptimal samples, model bias, and images that do not\nalign with human ethics and preferences. In this paper, we\npresent an effective scalable algorithm to improve diffu-\nsion models using Reinforcement Learning (RL) across a\ndiverse set of reward functions, such as human preference,\ncompositionality, and fairness over millions of images. We\nillustrate how our approach substantially outperforms ex-\nisting methods for aligning diffusion models with human\npreferences. We further illustrate how this substantially im-\nproves pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) models, generat-\ning samples that are preferred by humans 80.3% of the\ntime over those from the base SD model while simulta-\nneously improving both the composition and diversity of\ngenerated samples. The project\u2019s website can be found at\nhttps://pinterest.github.io/atg-research/rl-diffusion/.\n1. Introduction\nDiffusion probabilistic models [24, 39, 43] have revolution-\nized generative modeling, particularly for producing creative\nand photorealistic imagery when combined with pre-trained\ntext encoders [37, 38]. However, the resulting image quality\nis highly dependent on the distribution of the pre-training\ndataset, which typically consists of web-scale text-image\npairs. Although pre-training on massive weakly supervised\ntasks of this form is effective in exposing the text-to-image\nmodel to a wide range of prompts, downstream applications\noften observe weaknesses around the following properties:\n\u2022 Fidelity and controllability [10, 22, 25]: failing to accu-\nrately depict the semantics of the text prompts (e.g. incor-\nrect composition and relationships between objects)\n\u2022 Human aesthetic mismatch [50, 51]: producing outputs\nthat humans do not perceive to be aesthetically pleasing\n\u2022 Bias and stereotypes [4, 32, 42]: presenting or exaggerat-\ning societal bias and stereotypes\nTo address these challenges, several works have explored\nclassic fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained diffusion mod-\nels with curated data, either to improve the aesthetic qual-\nity of the model outputs with human-selected high-quality\nimages [14], or to eliminate existing biases in the model\nwith synthetic dataset augmentation [17]. Another approach,\nwhich bypasses the labor-intensive dataset curation, involves\nintervention in the sampling process to achieve controllabil-\nity, by utilizing auxiliary input [20, 28, 29] or refining the\nintermediate representations [7, 8, 19]. However, this form\nof inference-time guidance results in an increase in the sam-\npling time without improving the inherent capability of the\nmodel. A recent direction, motivated by the success of re-\ninforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in the\nlanguage domain [2, 35, 36], proposes [13, 51] fine-tuning\ndiffusion models through full-sample gradient backpropoga-\ntion on human preference reward models, though these ap-\nproaches are memory intensive and only work for differ-\nentiable reward functions. Finally, RL-based optimization\n[5, 18] has enabled fine-tuning with arbitrary objective func-\ntions, but these methods have so far been limited in scope\nby focusing on a small set of prompts in a narrow domain,\nand lack the scale to improve model performance generally.\nIn this paper, we propose a generic RL-based framework\nfor fine-tuning diffusion models, which works at scale across\nmillions of prompts and with an arbitrary combination of\nobjective functions. Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We present an effective large-scale RL training algorithm\nfor diffusion models which allows training over millions\nof prompts across a diverse set of tasks.\n\u2022 We propose a distribution-based reward function for RL\nfine-tuning to improve the output diversity.\n\u2022 We demonstrate how to perform effective multi-objective\nRL-training and illustrate how we can improve a base\nmodel across all objectives, which can include human aes-\nthetic preference, fairness, and object composition.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments and analysis studies\ncomparing our approach with existing reward optimiza-\ntion methods across a suite of tasks.\n1\narXiv:2401.12244v1  [cs.CV]  20 Jan 2024\nA portrait of an anthropomorphic wolf wearing a black doublet, furry fursona, Victorian era masterwork, by Samuel Luke Fildes\nA portrait of a doctor, trending on Pinterest, art, highly detailed, illustration, sharp focus, intricate, smooth, elegant\u2026\nFairness and Diversity\nHuman Preference\nCompositionality \nAn avocado near an apple, trending on Pinterest, art, highly detailed, illustration, sharp focus, intricate, smooth, elegant\u2026\nFigure 1.

Related Work\nReward Fine-tuning for Diffusion Models. Existing re-\nward fine-tuning methods for diffusion models can be clas-\nsified into three categories: either supervised with reward-\nweighted data [15, 26, 50], optimized through gradient-\nbackpropogation on the reward function [13, 51] or through\nreinforcement learning [5, 18]. Our work builds on work\ntraining diffusion models with reinforcement learning, but\nwhile past work has focused on simple settings (DPOK uses\na training set of 1 prompt per model, and DDPO using sim-\nple set of 45 common animals and 3 activities), we illustrate\nhow we can use reinforcement learning training across the\nscale of millions of prompts and different objectives.\nCompositional Text-to-image Generation. Despite their\nremarkable capacity, current state-of-the-art text-to-image\nmodels still struggle to generate images that faithfully align\nwith the semantics of the text prompts due to their limited\ncompositional capabilities [10, 22, 25]. Existing work ad-\ndresses this by either modifying the inference procedure\n[7, 16, 19, 19, 30] or by using auxiliary conditioning inputs\nsuch as bounding boxes [8, 28] or spatial layouts [20, 29, 49].\nOur method instead focus on improving the fidelity of exist-\ning SD models without using additional layout guidance.\nInclusive Text-to-Image Generation. Text-to-image gener-\native models perpetuate and even amplify the societal bi-\nases present in the massive pretraining datasets of uncu-\nrated image-text pairs [6, 9, 10, 54]. Existing work addresses\nthis by either using balanced synthetic data [42], with tex-\ntual guidance during inference [21] or with reference im-\nages of a particular attribute [53]. Different from prior work,\nour method does not require synthetic data collection or\ninference-time intervention.\n3. Method\nIn this section, we describe our approach for applying large-\nscale RL training to diffusion models. Our goal is to fine-\ntune the parameters \u03b8 of an existing diffusion model to max-\nimize the reward signal r of the generated images from the\nsampling process:\nJ(\u03b8) = Ec\u223cp(c),x0\u223cp\u03b8(x0|c)[r(x0, c)],\n(1)\nwhere p(c) is the context distribution, p\u03b8(x0|c) is the sam-\nple distribution, and r(x0, c) is the reward function that is\napplied to the final sample image.\n2\n3.1. Policy Gradient with Multi-step MDP\nFollowing Black et al. [5], we reframe the iterative denois-\ning procedure of diffusion models as a multi-step Markov\ndecision process (MDP), where the policy, action, state and\nreward at each timestep t are defined as follows:\n\u03c0(at|st) \u225c p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt, c)\n(2)\nat \u225c xt\u22121\n(3)\nst \u225c (c, t, xt)\n(4)\nR(st, at) \u225c\n(\nr(x0, c)\nif t = 0\n0\notherwise\n(5)\nWe treat the reverse sampling process p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt, c) of the\ndiffusion model as the policy. Starting from a sampled initial\nstate xT , the policy\u2019s action at any timestep t is the update\nthat produces the sample for the next timestep xt\u22121. The\nreward is defined as r(x0, c) at the final timestep, and 0\notherwise.\nThe policy gradient estimates can be made using the like-\nlihood ratio method (also known as REINFORCE) [33, 48]:\n\u2207\u03b8J = E\n\"\nr(x0, c)\nT\nX\nt=0\n\u2207\u03b8 log p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt, c)\n#\n.\n(6)\nWe also apply importance sampling to enable collecting sam-\nples from the old policy for improved training efficiency, and\nincorporate a clipped trust region to ensure that the new pol-\nicy does not deviate too much from the old policy [41]. The\nfinal clipped surrogate objective function can be written as:\nJ(\u03b8) = E\nhPT\nt=0 min\nh\nw(\u03b8, \u03b8old) \u02c6A(x0, c), g(\u03f5, \u02c6A(x0, c))\nii\n(7)\nwhere\nw(\u03b8, \u03b8old) = p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt, c)\np\u03b8old(xt\u22121|xt, c),\ng(\u03f5, A) =\n(\n(1 + \u03f5)A\nif A \u2265 0\n(1 \u2212 \u03f5)A\nif A < 0 .\nHere \u03f5 is the hyper-parameter that determines the clip inter-\nval, and \u02c6A(x0, c) is the estimated advantage for the samples.\nTo further prevent over-optimization of the reward function,\nwe also incorporate the original diffusion model objective as\npart of the loss function. Our full training objective is thus\nL(\u03b8) = J(\u03b8) + \u03b2Lpre(\u03b8),\n(8)\nwhere\nLpre(\u03b8) = E\u03b5(x),\u03f5\u223cN (0,1),t\n\u0002\n\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(zt, t)\u22252\n2\n\u0003\n.\n(9)\nOne additional detail is that reward values are typically\nnormalized to zero mean and unit variance during gradient\nupdates to increase training stability. In policy-based RL, a\ngeneral approach is to subtract a baseline state value func-\ntion from the reward to obtain the advantage function [45]\n\u02c6A(x0, c) = r(x0, c) \u2212 \u00b5r\np\n\u03c32r + \u03f5\n.\n(10)\nIn the original implementation of DDPO, Black et al.\nnormalize the rewards on a per-context basis by keeping\ntrack of a running mean and standard deviation for each\nprompt independently [5]. However, this approach remains\nimpractical if the training set size is unbounded or unfixed.\nIn contrast to the limited size of their training prompts\n(up to 398 only), our large-scale fine-tuning experiments in-\nvolve millions of training prompts. We instead normalize the\nrewards on a per-batch basis using the mean and variance of\neach training batch.\n3.2. Distribution-based Reward Functions\nIn the previously outlined formulation of the diffusion MDP,\neach generation is considered independently, and thus re-\nwards incurred by generated samples are independent of\neach other. This formulation is a natural fit for reward func-\ntions that only care about the contents of a single image,\nsuch as image quality or text-image alignment. However,\nsometimes what we care about is not the contents of any par-\nticular image, but instead the output distribution of the diffu-\nsion model as a whole. For example, if our goal is to ensure\nour model generates diverse outputs, considering a single\ngeneration in isolation is insufficient\u2014we must consider the\nset of all outputs in order to understand these distributional\nproperties of our model.\nTo this end, we also investigate the use of distribution-\nlevel reward functions for reinforcement learning with diffu-\nsion models. However, it is intractable to construct the true\ngenerative distribution. Thus, we instead approximate the\nreward by computing it using empirical samples across mini-\nbatches during the reinforcement learning process. During\ntraining, the attained reward is computed on each minibatch,\nand the minibatch reward is then backpropagated across the\nsamples to perform model updates. In Section 4.2 we vali-\ndate this approach by learning via a distribution-level reward\nfunction that optimizes for fairness and diversity in gener-\nated samples.\n3.3. Multi-task Joint Training\nWe also perform multi-task joint training to optimize a sin-\ngle model for a diverse set of objectives simultaneously.\nAs detailed in the next section, we incorporate the reward\nfunctions from human preference, skintone diversity, ob-\nject composition and perform joint-optimization all at once.\nSince each task involves a different distribution of train-\ning prompts, in every training iteration, we sample multiple\nprompts from all the tasks and run the sampling process inde-\npendently.

Then the gradient step\nfrom equation 7 is executed for each task sequentially. We\noutline the training framework in Algorithm 1 with hyper-\nparameters available in Appendix A.\n4. Reward Functions and Experiments\nTo validate our method across a wide variety of settings, we\nperform experiments on three separate reward functions: hu-\nman preference, image composition, and diversity and fair-\nness. We begin with an introduction of the different reward\nfunctions we applied our method to.\nTo optimize diffusion models to adhere to human pref-\nerences, we use an open-source reward model, ImageRe-\nward (IR), trained on a large number of human preference\npairs [51]. ImageReward takes a pair consisting of a text cap-\ntion and a generated sample, then outputs a human prefer-\nence score, which is then used as the reward during training:\nr(x0, c) = IR(x0, c).\n(11)\nOur results with this human preference reward function are\ndetailed in Section 4.1.\nIn order to encourage fairness and diversity across\nthe samples generated by our model, following previous\nAlgorithm 1 Multi-reward diffusion policy optimization\nInput: A set of reward models and the training prompt dis-\ntribution S = {(ri, pi(c))}, pretrained diffusion model\nppre, current diffusion model p\u03b8, pretraining dataset Dpre\nInitialize p\u03b8 = ppre\nwhile \u03b8 not converged do\np\u03b8old = p\u03b8\nfor each training task (r, p(c)) \u2208 S do\nSample a prompt c \u223c p(c)\nSample generated images x0:T \u223c p\u03b8(x0:T |c)\nSample training timesteps t\nfor each selected timestep t do\nTake gradient step \u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8) (Eq. 7)\nend for\nend for\nSample a pretraining data pair (txt, img) \u2208 Dpre\nTake gradient step \u2207\u03b8Lpre(\u03b8) (Eq. 9)\nend while\nOutput: Fine-tuned diffusion model p\u03b8\nwork [11, 12, 46], we leverage statistical parity, a metric\ncommonly adopted for measuring biases in models, as a\ndistribution-level reward function for our fine-tuning exper-\niments. Given the generated distribution \u02c6P and a classifier\n4\nh : x \u2212\u2192 A that identifies a spurious attribute, we measure\nthe L2 norm between the empirical and uniform distribu-\ntions:\nsX\na\u2208A\n(Ex\u223c \u02c6\nP\n\u0002\n1h(x)=a\n\u0003\n\u2212 1/|A|)2\n(12)\nThe reward attained by the model is then simply the nega-\ntion of the statistical parity, so as to encourage the model\nto produce diverse samples. As explained in Section 3.2,\nit is intractable to compute the reward over the full output\ndistribution of the model, so we compute the reward over\nindividual minibatches. We present the results for this exper-\niment in Section 4.2.\nTo improve the compositional skills of diffusion models,\nwe devise a new reward function that uses an auxiliary ob-\nject detector. We construct a set of training prompts, each\ncontaining multiple different objects, and use an object de-\ntection model on the image to predict the confidence score\nfor each object class. The reward score is then defined as the\naverage confidence score of all the objects:\nr(x0, c) = 1\n|o|\nX\no\u2208c\nd(o, x0),\n(13)\nwhere d(o, x0) is the detection confidence score for the ob-\nject class o given input image x0. Our results on composi-\ntionality are detailed in Section 4.3.\nFinally, we also experiment with jointly optimizing over\nall three previously described reward functions, to train a\nmodel that satisfies all three criteria simultaneously. We\npresent the results of our joint optimization in Section 4.4.\nFor all our fine-tuning experiments, we use SDv2 [39] as\nour base model. The output resolution is 512x512, which\nwe consider as a good tradeoff between compute efficiency\nand image quality.\n4.1. Learning from human preference\nTo fine-tune a diffusion model with human preferences, we\nuse ImageReward [51], which was trained on large-scale hu-\nman assessments of text-image pairs. In total, the authors\ncollected 137k pairs of expert judgments on images gener-\nated from real-world user prompts from the DiffusionDB\ndataset [47]. Compared to other existing metrics such as\nCLIP [37], BLIP [27], or Aesthetic score [40], ImageReward\nis better aligned with human judgments, making it better\nsuited as a reward function.\nWe use a training set of 1.5 million unique real user\nprompts from DiffusionDB, among which 2,000 prompts\nwere split for testing. We use 128 A100 GPUs (80GB) for\nall experiments, including the baselines. Experimental de-\ntails, hyperparameters, and additional results are provided in\nAppendix A.\nBaseline Comparison.

We report the average ImageReward and Aesthetic\nscores for samples generated using prompts from both the Diffu-\nsionDB [47] dataset and the PartiPrompts [52] dataset.\nand backpropagation through the reward model [13, 51].\nWe compare against a variety of baseline methods, in-\ncluding ReFL [51], RAFT [15], DRaFT [13] and Reward-\nweighted [26], covering the three different methodologies.\nWe reimplement all methods and fine-tune them on SDv2 us-\ning the same training set of 1.5M prompts until convergence.\nWe show the qualitative and quantitative results of all\nbaseline methods in Figure 3 and Table 1. We also pro-\nvide training curves in Appendix E and note that, except for\nRAFT which diverged, all online-learning methods exhibit\nsteadily increasing sample rewards during training, eventu-\nally saturating at some maximum level, at which point we\nconsider the models converged. In contrast to the common\nbelief that RL training is inefficient and slow to converge,\nour approach converges in as few as \u223c1,000 steps, compared\nto DRaFT, the gradient-based reward optimization approach\nwhich takes \u223c4,000 steps to converge while only being able\nto optimize for differentiable rewards.

[51]. Since RAFT uses the model-generated im-\nages with the highest rewards for fine-tuning the model, it is\nconstrained by the diversity of the latest model\u2019s generation\nand thus prone to overfitting.

Next, we evaluate our trained\nmodel\u2019s ability to generalize to an out-of-domain test set,\nPartiPrompts [52]. PartiPrompts is a comprehensive bench-\nmark for text-to-image models, with over 1,600 challenging\nprompts across a variety of categories. We report the Im-\nageReward and Aesthetic scores in Table 1, along with hu-\nman evaluation results in Figure 2. When compared against\neach baseline model, our approach achieves the highest Aes-\nthetic score and human preference rate on both sets.\nWe also achieve the second highest result on ImageRe-\nward, but note that this metric alone is not a robust indicator\nof performance, since the model was directly trained against\nit. Reward hacking is a commonly observed phenomenon\nin which models optimizing for a single reward function\noften overoptimize for this single metric at the cost of over-\nall performance. We believe the high ImageReward scores\nachieved by ReFL are a result of this, and show example\ngenerations in Figure 4. The reward hacking problem of\nReFL was observed by Clark et al. [13] in their DRaFT ex-\nperiments as well, where their fine-tuned model optimizing\nfor Aesthetic score collapses to generate very similar, high-\nreward images. We hypothesize that gradient-based opti-\nmization methods (i.e. ReFL and DRaFT) are more prone to\nreward hacking due to their direct access to the gradients of\nthe reward model. In contrast, our wins on human preference\nrate indicate that our method is more robust to these effects.\n4.2. Optimizing Fairness and Diversity\nThe training of diffusion models is highly data-driven, re-\nlying on billion-sized datasets that are randomly scraped\nfrom internet. As a result, the trained models may con-\ntain significant social bias and stereotypes. For example, it\nhas been observed that text-to-image diffusion models com-\nmonly exhibit a tendency to generate humans with lighter\nskintones [9, 34]. We aim to mitigate this bias by explicitly\nguiding the model using a skintone diversity reward.\nFor fine-tuning, we collect a dataset of 240M human im-\nages from Pinterest and run BLIP [27] to generate captions\nfor each image. Only the text prompts are used during train-\n6\nA portrait of a dentist\nStable \nv2\nOurs\nA portrait of a judge\nFigure 5. Skintone Diversity Visualization. Qualitative comparison of SDv2 and our model fine tuned for skintone diversity reward. All\nimages are generated using the same random seeds.\ning, and the reward calculation is based on the generated\nsamples. We further filter out the captions containing terms\nrelating to ethnicity and race (e.g. African, Asian, Indian) to\nensure that the training prompts are race agnostic. In each\ntraining iteration, we load 128 prompts and generate a mini-\nbatch of 16 images for each prompt, then run a pre-trained\nskintone classifier on the generated samples and calculate\nthe statistical parity for each minibatch according to Equa-\ntion 12. Since the classifier has 4 skintone categories ranging\nfrom dark to light, the optimal reward is achieved when the\noutput distribution is entirely uniform (i.e. 4 samples in each\nskintone bucket).\nModel\nStatistical Parity (\u2193)\nOccupation\nHRS-Bench\nStable v1.5\n0.575\n0.578\nStable v2\n0.556\n0.576\nRAFT\n0.464\n0.527\nReward-weighted\n0.562\n0.527\nOurs\n0.453\n0.498\nTable 3. Fairness and Equity Evaluation. Statistical Parity scores\non out-of-domain test sets.\nWe show our qualitative results in Figures 1 and 5 and\nquantitative results in Table 3. We construct two test sets: a\nset of 100 randomly sampled occupations, for which we add\nthe prefix \u201ca portrait of\u201d to produce the final prompts (e.g.\u201ca\nportrait of a police officer\u201d), and another set of 200 prompts\nfrom HRSBench [3], which are descriptions of people with\nrandom objects. We note that both are out-of-domain test\nsets, as their distribution is different from that of the BLIP-\ngenerated training prompts.\nOur fine-tuned model greatly reduces the skintone bias\nembedded in the pretrained SDv2 model, especially for occu-\npations with more social stereotypes or biases inherent in the\npretraining dataset. For example, in Figure 5, we show that\nthe pretrained SDv2 model is biased towards light skintone\nfor portraits of dentists and judges, whereas our finetuned\nmodel generates a much more balanced distribution.\n4.3. Optimizing Compositionality\nWhile diffusion models are able to generate diverse images,\nthey often fail to accurately generate different compositions\nof objects in a scene [10, 22, 25, 30]. We further explore\nusing our RL framework in ensuring compositionality with\ndiffusion models. We collect a list of 532 common object\nclasses (e.g. apple, backpack, book, balloon, avocado; the\nfull list is available in Appendix H) and use 450 of them for\ntraining. The remaining classes are withheld for testing. We\nthen construct training prompts by combining two different\nobjects using one of five relationship terms: \u201cand,\u201d \u201cnext\nto,\u201d \u201cnear,\u201d \u201con side of\u201d and \u201cbeside,\u201d producing captions\nthat designate a spatial relationship between two objects, e.g.\n\u201can apple next to an avocado.\u201d In total we create a training\nset of over 1M prompts. In order to compute our object com-\nposition reward function (Eq. 13), we use UniDet [55], an\nobject detector trained on multiple large-scale datasets that\nsupports a wide range of object classes.\nModel\nObject Detection Score (\u2191)\nUnseen Objects\nSeen Objects\nStable v1.5\n0.072\n0.056\nStable v2\n0.102\n0.094\nRAFT\n0.094\n0.092\nReward-weighted\n0.136\n0.152\nOurs\n0.231\n0.221\nTable 4.

To evaluate generalizability, we also generate\nsamples with our fine-tuned model on 300 randomly sam-\npled prompts from both unseen and seen objects. Our trained\nmodel adheres better to compositional constraints in text\ncaptions when compared to SDv2, and the learned composi-\ntional abilities also generalize to unseen objects.\n7\nA pumpkin beside \na balloon\nA cherry on side of \na teddy bear\nAn avocado near a \ndonut\nStable \nv2\nOurs\nA rabbit next to a cat\nA bird beside a lemon\nA donkey on side of \na juice\nFigure 6.

Joint Optimization. We experiment with jointly optimizing a single model to satisfy three separate reward functions. Comparing\nwith the original baseline model, we see that our jointly optimized model is able to satisfy all three objectives, achieving over 80% (relative)\nperformance of the individually fine-tuned models across all three evaluation metrics simultaneously.\n4.4. Multi-reward Joint Optimization\nAs detailed in Algorithm 1, we also perform multi-reward\nRL with all three reward functions jointly, aiming to improve\nthe model performance on all three tasks simultaneously. We\ncompare the jointly-trained model with the base model and\nthe models fine-tuned for each individual task. The quan-\ntitative results are shown in Table 5, with more qualitative\nresults available in Appendix B. Following the same evalua-\ntion setting, we test the models on multiple datasets for each\nmetric and report the average scores.\nWhile the best score for each metric is achieved\nby the model fine-tuned specifically for that task, our\njointly-trained model is able to satisfy over 80% (relative)\nperformance of the individually fine-tuned models across\nall three metrics simultaneously. In addition, it significantly\noutperforms the original base model on all tasks.\nAlignment Tax. We observed degraded performance for in-\ndividually fine-tuned models on some of the tasks that the\nmodels were not fine-tuned for. For example, the model opti-\nmized for human preference exhibits a significant regression\non statistical parity, indicating a drastic drop in skintone di-\nversity. Similarly, the model optimized for skintone diversity\ndegrades in terms of human preference as compared to the\nbase model. This is akin to the \u201calignment tax\u201d issue that\nhas been observed during RLHF fine-tuning procedure of\nLLMs [1, 36]. Specifically, when models are trained with\na reward function that is only concerned with one aspect\nof images, it may learn to neglect sample quality or overall\ndiversity of outputs. Our jointly fine-tuned model, in con-\ntrast, is able to mitigate the alignment tax issue by incorpo-\nrating multiple diverse reward functions during fine-tuning,\nthereby maintaining performance on all tasks in question.\n5. Conclusion\nWe present a scalable RL training framework for directly op-\ntimizing diffusion models with arbitrary downstream objec-\ntives, including distribution-based reward functions. We con-\nducted large-scale multi-task fine-tuning to improve the gen-\neral performance of an SDv2 model in terms of human pref-\nerences, fairness, and object composition simultaneously,\nand found that joint training also mitigated the alignment tax\nissue common in RLHF. By evaluating our trained model\nagainst several baseline models on diverse out-of-domain\ntest sets, we demonstrated our method\u2019s generality and\nrobustness. We hope our work inspires future research on tar-\ngeted tuning of diffusion models, with potential future topics\nincluding addressing more complex compositional relation-\nships and mitigating bias along other social dimensions.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Amanda Askell, Yuntao Bai, Anna Chen, Dawn Drain, Deep\nGanguli, Tom Henighan, Andy Jones, Nicholas Joseph, Ben\nMann, Nova DasSarma, Nelson Elhage, Zac Hatfield-Dodds,\nDanny Hernandez, Jackson Kernion, Kamal Ndousse, Cather-\nine Olsson, Dario Amodei, Tom Brown, Jack Clark, Sam Mc-\nCandlish, Chris Olah, and Jared Kaplan.

Experiment Details and Hyperparameters\nAll our experiments including baseline methods training were conducted on 128 80GB A100 GPUs. If a pretraining dataset is\nrequired, all fine-tuning methods use the same 12M subset of LAION-5B [40] filtered by the aesthetic score predictor with a\nthreshold of 6. For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer [31] with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999, \u03f5 = 1e\u22128 and a weight decay\nof 1e \u2212 2 for all the experiments. For inference, we run the diffusion process with 50 steps for each image with DDIM [44]\nnoise scheduler. We use the default guidance scale of 7.0 for classifier-free guidance [23].\nImplementation Details. For our RL fine-tuning experiments, we collect 16x128 samples per training iteration, with 50\nsamplings steps using DDIM scheduler [44]. We randomly sample 5 training timesteps and perform a gradient update across\nall the samples in the batch for each of the timesteps, resulting in 5 gradient updates per iteration. We use a small clip range\nof 1e \u2212 4 for all the experiments.\nBaseline Details. For the baseline methods including ReFL [51], Reward-weighted [26], RAFT [15] and DRaFT [13], we\nrefer to the original implementation for the suggested hyperparameters and report our experiment details in Table 6. We use\nthe same training set for all the baseline models training and fine-tune them until convergence. Since the experiments involve\nmillion-sized training prompts, for reward-weighted approach, instead of pre-generating the samples and storing the dataset\noffline, we generate the samples on the fly during training using the original SDv2 model and re-weigh them according to the\nreward values for fine-tuning. Following Xu et al. [51], we also map the reward values to the range of [0, 1] using min-max\nnormalization.\nWe note that DRaFT imposes a high memory burden by directly back-propagating the gradient from the reward model\nthrough the sampling process of diffusion model, allowing for a much smaller batch size compared to other optimization\nmethods. We implement DRaFT-LV, which claimed to be the most efficient DRaFT variant.\nHyperparameter\nReFL\nReward-weighted\nRAFT\nDRaFT\nOurs\nLearning Rate\n1e-5\n1e-5\n3e-6\n5e-5\n2e-6\nBatch Size (Per GPU)\n12\n16\n32\n3\n16\nPretraining Batch Size (Per GPU)\n12\n16\n32\n-\n16\nSampling Scheduler\nDDIM\nDDIM\nDDIM\nDDIM\nDDIM\nSampling Steps\n40\n50\n50\n50\n50\nMethod Specific\n\u03d5 = ReLU\n[T1, T2] = [1, 10]\n\u03bb = 1e \u2212 3\n\u03b2 = 0.5\nAcceptance ratio: 1/24\nLoRA rank: 32\nttruncate=1\nclip range: 1e-4\nTraining timesteps: 5\nTable 6.

Additional Qualitative Results\nWe provide additional qualitative results in this section, including results from the models that were trained with single rewards\n(i.e., ImageReward [51], compositionality reward and skintone diversity reward), as well as the results from our model that\nwas jointly trained with all three rewards simultaneously.\n11\nB.1. Results on Human Preference Fine-tuning\nWe show the visual samples from our model fine-tuned with ImageReward [51] on real-user prompts in Figure 7. We also\nprovide more qualitative comparison of our model with other reward optimization methods in Figure 8. More results on the\nout-of-domain test set PartiPrompts [52] are availble in Figure 9. Our trained model generates more visually appealing images\ncompared to the base SDv2 model, and it generalizes well to out-of-domain test sets with unseen text prompts that have a\ndifferent distribution from that of the training prompts.\nA unicorn flying over a city on \nfire, matte painting, long shot, , \nconcept art, \u2026\nLittle big planet by Joel \nRobison\nWhen did the bright moon come \nto be?

Results on Optimizing Diversity\nWe provide more qualitative results of our model fine-tuned with skintone diversity reward in Figure 10.

We note that while RAFT also improves the skintone diversity of the output\nsamples, it is prone to overfitting and generates over-saturated samples with decreased realism (e.g. the portraits of police officers in the\nsecond example).\n15\nB.3. Results on Optimizing Compositionality\nWe provide more qualitative results of our model fine-tuned with object composition reward in Figure 11.

Results on Multi-reward Joint Optimization\nNext, we show more qualitative results from our jointly-fine-tuned model (with all three rewards simultaneously) on multiple\ntest sets: DiffusionDB [47] (Figure 12), object composition (Figure 13) and occupation prompts (Figure 14). We demonstrate\nthat our jointly-trained model has quite significant improvement over the base SDv2 model in terms of all three objectives:\nhuman preferences, skintone diversity and object composition. We further note that since joint training utilizes multiple\nreward signals (including ImageReward which reflects human preferences) during training, for portraits of occupations, we\nalso observe additional increase in the aesthetic quality of the samples compared to single-reward training which optimizes\nfor the skintone diversity only; see Figure 14.\n16\nStable \nv2\nOurs -\nSingle\nOurs -\nJoint\nbeautiful landscape \nphotography by marc \nadamus, dolomites, a \nlake, mist, reflections, \nsunset, dramatic sky\nsmall and dense \nintricate vines, moss, \nroots, colorful flowers, \nand tree branches take \nthe detailed form of an \nelk standing in a lush \nforest\u2026\nanime picture, black \nhair, girl, digital art, \noctane render, \ntrending on artstation\nbeautiful serene walk \nto the top of the hill to \nsee the wast horizon, \nhealing through \nmotion, life, \nminimalistic golden \nand ink airbrush\u2026\na woman with black \nhair and long pixie \nhaircut in shorts with \nsuspenders and white \nt-shirt drawn by \nfrederic leighton\u2026\na portrait of an \nanthropomorphic \nwolf wearing a black \ndoublet, furry \nfursona, victorian era \nmasterwork, \u2026\nFigure 12.

Compared to single-reward training, we also observe the additional\nincrease in the aesthetic quality of the samples from our jointly-trained model.\nC. Human Evaluation Templates\nWe provide the detailed human evaluation guidelines document that were used to train our hired human labelers in section C.1,\nincluding the judging criteria and concrete examples for making trade-offs in order to help the evaluators better understand\nthe task and make fair judgments. We use the annotation documents from ImageReward [51] as a reference. We also show\nour evaluation UI interface in section C.2.\n18\nC.1. Evaluation Criteria and Guidelines\nYou will be given a number of prompts/queries and there are several AI-generated images according to the prompt/query.\nYour annotation requirement is to evaluate these images in terms of Image Fidelity, Relevance to the Query, and Aesthetic\nQuality. Below are more details on each of the three mentioned factors.\nC.1.1\nImage Fidelity\nDefinition: The generated image should be true to the shape and characteristics of the object, and not generated haphazardly.\nSome examples of low-fidelity images are:\n\u2022 Dogs should have four legs and two eyes, generating an image with extra / fewer legs or eyes is considered low-fidelity.\n\u2022 \u201cSpider-Man\u201d\u201d (or human) should only have two arms and five fingers each. Generating extra arms / fingers is considered\nlow-fidelity.\n\u2022 \u201cUnicorn\u201d should only have one horn, generating an image with multiple horns is considered low-fidelity.\n\u2022 People eat noodles with utensils instead of grabbing them with their hands, generating an image of someone eating noodles\nwith their hands is considered low-fidelity.\nSee Figure 15 for examples of low-fidelity generation. Images of low fidelity should be ranked as low preference.\nFigure 15. Examples of Low-fidelity Generation. Note that these generated images have incorrect details with faces or body parts of\nhuman and animals, and would likely cause psychological discomfort. They should be ranked with lower-preference.\nC.1.2\nRelevance to the Query\nDefinition: the generated image should match the text in the query. Another term used for\u201cRelevance\u201d is \u201cText-alignment\u201d.\nSome examples of inconsistent image generation are:\n\u2022 The subject described in the text does not appear in the image generated, for example, \u201cA cat dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte\u201d\ngenerates an image without the word \u201ccat\u201d.\n\u2022 The object properties generated in the image are different from the text description, for example, generating an image of \u201ca\nlittle girl sitting in front of a sewing machine\u201d with a boy (or many little girls) is incorrect.\nSee Figure 16 for examples of low-relevance generation. Images of low relevance to the query should be ranked as low\npreference.\n19\n(a) \u201cA cucumber beside a peach \u201d\n(b) \u201cA box and a canoe\u201d\n(c) \u201cset of 2 canvas paintings\u201d\n(d) \u201csip and paint at home date night\u201d\n(e) \u201cMatching wallpaper for two best\nfriends\u201d\n(f) \u201cUnderwater congress art\u201d\n(g) \u201cShoe design sketches draw \u201d\n(h) \u201cBlack cat minimalist art \u201d\nFigure 16. Examples of Generation with Low-relevance to the Text Prompts. They should be ranked with lower-preference.\nC.1.3\nAesthetic Quality\nDefinition: the generated images should look visually appealing and beautiful. Examples are provided in Figure 17, where\ntwo images are generated given the same text prompt and the one with higher aesthetic quality is highlighted.\n(a) \u201cSubset by the sea \u201d\n(b) \u201cDog art\u201d\nFigure 17. Illustration of Aesthetic Quality. The two images are generated given the same text prompt, and the highlighted one on the left\nis considered to have higher aesthetic quality (i.e. more visually appealing) and should be ranked with higher-preference.\nC.1.4\nOverall Preference Ranking\nGuidelines for deciding boundary cases: which generated images would you prefer to receive from AI painters? Evaluating\nthe output of the model may involve making trade-offs between the criteria we discussed. These trade-offs will depend on the\ntask. When making these trade-offs, use the following guidelines to help choose between outputs.\n1. For most tasks, fidelity & aesthetic quality are more important than image-text alignment. So, in most cases, the image\nhaving higher fidelity and aesthetic quality is rated higher than an output that is more image-text aligned.\n2. However, if an output image:\n\u2022 clearly matches the text better than the other;\n20\n\u2022 is only slightly lacking in the requirements of fidelity;\n\u2022 the content does not have significant artifacts that would cause psychological discomfort\nthen the more consistent result is rated higher.\nWe provide more examples below to illustrate how to make trade-off between the different criteria when making judge-\nments.\nFigure 18. \u201cMatching wallpaper for two best friends\u201d\nIn the example above (Figure 18), image A and B are the ones that match the text description best, and they are also the\nmost aesthetically appealing (A is better than B in both regards). The animals in image C look unnatural and have artifacts,\nalso C does not align with the text very well. Image D does not match the text, and it has the lowest aesthetic quality too. Thus\nthe overall ranking should be A > B > C > D.\nFigure 19. \u201cAnime wallpapers\u201d\nIn the example above (Figure 19), image A and B both match the text (they are wallpapers of some anime style), and image\nB looks slightly more appealing, so we rank B > A. Note that Image C has a lots of noticeable artifacts in the body parts of\nthe anime character and it might cause psychological discomfort , so it should be ranked as the lowest. The overall ranking\nshould be B > A > D > C (D is better than C because of the significant artifacts in C).\nFigure 20. \u201cAstronaut on Mars during sunset\u201d\n21\nIn the example above (Figure 20), all four images are depiction of astronaut on mars during sunset, so they all match with\nthe text well. In this case we should mainly consider the fidelity and aesthetic quality of the images. Among the four images,\nImage A and C look the most beautiful (with C slightly better than A). Image D has the lowest aesthetic quality compared to\nothers. So the overall ranking should be C > A > B > D.\nFigure 21. \u201cForbidden city drawing\u201d\nIn the example above (Figure 21), image C is somehow a nonsense generation and does not match the text, so it is apparent\nthat C should be ranked the lowest. Image A, B and D all match with the text, and in terms of fidelity and aesthetic quality,\nthey should be ranked as B > A > D (B looks the most appealing, followed by A, while D only shows part of the palace and\nis not as beautiful as B). The overall ranking should be B > A > D > C.\nFigure 22. \u201cColorful art fire\u201d\nIn the example above (Figure 22), image A and C both have fire in it, and image A looks more visually appealing. Note that\nalthough C is more colorful, we think image A matches with the text well enough; since A is much more visually appealing\nthan C, we rank A > C. B and D both have lower image-text alignment and lower aesthetic quality, so we rank them as the\nlowest two. The overall ranking should be A > C > B > D.\nC.2. Evaluation Interface\nTo compare our fine-tuned model with the base SDv2 model and models tuned with other baseline approaches, we perform\nhead-to-head comparison of two images generated from different sources using the same text prompt. The two images are\ngenerated using the same random seed for fair comparison. The human evaluators were trained using the guidelines provided\nin section C.1. During evaluation, we show two generated images and the associated text query, and ask the evaluators to\nchoose the preferred one based on image fidelity and aesthetic quality, as well as image-text relevance. We show the evaluation\ninterface in Figure 23.\n22\nFigure 23. Human Evaluation Interface. We ask the hired evaluators to compare two generation from the same text prompt based on\nimage fidelity and quality, as well as image-text relevance.\nD. Additional Human Evaluation\nD.1. Additional Results\nFor a more thorough evaluation on the effectiveness of our method on improving compositionality and diversity, we also\nperform human evaluation on our models trained with compositionality reward and skintone diversity reward and provide the\nresults in Figure 24. For the compositionality evaluation, the annotators were asked to rate the samples based on image-text\nrelevance (how well the generated images match the text).\nOurs\nSD1_5\nOurs\nSD2\nOurs\nRAFT\nOurs\nReward-\nweighted\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n84.2\n68.5\n66.4\n61.3\n15.8\n31.5\n33.6\n38.7\nText-Image Relevance Eval\nOurs\nSD1_5\nOurs\nSD2\nOurs\nRAFT\nOurs\nReward-\nweighted\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n84.4\n57.0\n56.2\n56.1\n15.6\n43.0\n43.8\n43.9\nSkintone Diversity Eval\nFigure 24. Human evaluation results on our models fine-tuned with object composition reward and skintone diversity reward,\nrespectively. For the object composition evaluation, the human evaluators were asked to make judgements based on the relevance of the\ngenerated images to the text prompts; for the skintone diversity evaluation, the evaluators were shown two groups of images from different\nmodels and were asked to make judgements based on the overall skintone diversity. We provide the detailed evaluation guidelines and\ninterfaces for skintone diversity in section D.2.\n23\nD.2. Skintone Diversity Evaluation\nWe provide the guidelines we used to train the hired human evaluators on rating skintone diversity in section D.2.1 and the\nevaluation interface in section D.2.2.\nD.2.1\nGuidelines\nYou will be given a number of prompts and there are several AI-generated images according to the prompt. Your annotation\nrequirement is to evaluate these outputs in terms of skintone diversity. What we mean by \u201cskintone diversity\u201d is that AI model\nshould have minimum bias and stereotypes, so the generated images should have a diverse set of people with different skintone.\nFor example, \u201ca portrait of a police officer\u201d is not supposed to generate only light skintone or dark skintone; what we want\ninstead is a balanced distribution of light and dark skintone. For each prompt, there are two sets (set A and set B) of images,\neach with 6 images. Your job is to choose the one set with better skintone diversity. See the examples below:\nSet A\nSet B\na portrait of a chemist\nSet A\nSet B\na portrait of a builder\nFigure 25. Skintone Diversity Human Evaluation. We provide two groups of images for each prompt and ask the annotators to choose\nthe one with higher skintone diversity.\nNote that in Figure 25 Set B is more diverse for both examples of portraits of a chemist and a builder, because it has a\nbalanced distribution of light and dark skintone, while set A has mostly light skintone in it.\nD.2.2\nInterface\nFor evaluating skintone diversity, we perform head-to-head comparison of two groups of images generated from different\nsources using the same text prompt. The two groups are generated using the same random seed for fair comparison and the\nevaluators were asked to choose the one that has better diversity. The human evaluators were trained using the guidelines\nprovided in section D.2.1. We show the evaluation interface in Figure 26.\n24\nFigure 26. Skintone Diversity Human Evaluation Interface. We ask the hired evaluators to compare two groups of generation from the\nsame text prompt based on skintone diversity.\nE. Training Curve\nWe plot the training curves of our method and other online learning baseline methods in Figure 27 and note that, except for\nRAFT which diverged, all online-learning methods exhibit steadily increasing sample rewards during training, eventually\nsaturating at some maximum level, at which point we consider the models converged. Our method converged pretty quickly\nin as few as 1,000 steps.\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\nIteration\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\nTraining Reward\nReFL\nOurs\nDRaFT\nRAFT\nFigure 27. Training Curve of All Online-learning Methods. Y-axis shows the average reward of the samples from each training batch, and\nx-axis is the training iteration. In contrast to the common belief that RL training is sample inefficient and slow to converge, our approach\nconverges in as few as 1,000 steps, compared to DRaFT, the gradient-based reward optimiza-tion approach which takes 4,000 steps to\nconverge while only being able to optimize for differentiable rewards.

Specifically, since the reward model\ntrained from human annotation data is far from perfect, the imperfection can be exploited by the algorithms to chase for a\nhigh reward, leading to reward hacking [15].

Reward Hacking Examples from Different Iterations of ReFL-fine-tuned Models. While the reward fine-tuning method\nReFL quickly increases ImageReward(IM*) values during training by backpropagating the gradients from pretrained ImageReward model,\nit learnt to generate over-detailed images with high-frequency noise. This issue is also known as reward hacking, a well-known issue in\nRLHF [15, 36].\nG. Effect of Pretraining Dataset\nAs discussed in the paper, we incorporate the pretraining denoising loss Lpre to stabilize the training and to prevent reward\nover-optimization. In practice, we observe that the model is more prone to reward-hacking (i.e. producing unnatural artifacts\nand decreased photo-realism) without the pretraining loss. We experiment with removing Lpre and show the comparison in\nFigure 29 .\n26\nNo \nPretraining \nLoss\nWith \nPretraining \nLoss\nA portrait of a PR person\nFigure 29. Effect of pretraining loss. The images are sampled from the models trained with and without pretraining loss after the same\nnumber of iterations, using the same random seeds. Without pretraining loss, the model is prone to grainy artifacts and decreased realism.\nH.

However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation\nmodels is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we pro-\npose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the\ndeployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal\nhuman supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene\nunderstanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs)\nfor proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots.\nGuiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models en-\nables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while sig-\nnificantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT\nproposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collect-\ning 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies.\nWe experimentally show that such \u201cin-the-wild\u201d data collected by AutoRT is sig-\nnificantly more diverse, and that AutoRT\u2019s use of LLMs allows for instruction\nfollowing data collection robots that can align to human preferences.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nOne of the central goals of autonomous robotics research is to enable independent and broadly ca-\npable robotic agents: systems that can be tasked with some high-level goals (\u201ckeep the kitchen\nclean\u201d), formulate plans for addressing these goals, and then carry out those plans with the skills\nand resources available to them. While current robotic learning methods offer appealing solutions\nfor acquiring individual robotic skills, and large language models (LLMs), vision-language models\n(VLMs) and large multimodal models offer the ability to reason over such abstract tasks (Ahn et al.,\n2022; Rana et al., 2023), truly open-ended tasks still present major challenges. Performing innumer-\nable number of tasks in diverse settings requires a grounded and generalist agent that can robustly\nadapt to scenarios outside where robots are trained. The bottleneck for achieving these goals, how-\never, is the need for large amounts of robotic experience in the real world \u2013 much larger than robot\ndatasets collected in lab settings with well-defined environments.\nIn this paper, we study how we can design agents to gather robotic experience for themselves at\nscale. Central to our work is leveraging knowledge contained in foundation models to drive real-\nworld robots. We specifically focus on diverse robotic data acquisition: when a robot is placed in a\nnew environment, potentially with a user command to collect data around some theme (e.g. office\nAuthors in alphabetical order, contributions listed in Author Contributions\nWebsite: https://auto-rt.github.io/\nCorresponding emails: {keerthanapg, alexirpan}@google.com. Equal contribution.\n1\narXiv:2401.12963v1  [cs.RO]  23 Jan 2024\ntasks), the robot should determine which tasks can be performed, which of its own skills to trigger\nto attempt them, and when it should rely on human teleoperators. We view this from the perspective\nof controlling a fleet of robots, spread across multiple locations, where there are many more robots\nthan human supervisors, necessitating mixing expert demonstrations with suboptimal autonomous\npolicies in a safe and appropriate way. Our system for large-scale orchestration of robotic agents,\nwhich we call AutoRT, tackles this problem.\nAt the core of AutoRT is an large foundation model that acts as a robot orchestrator, prescribing\nappropriate tasks to one or more robots in an environment based on the user\u2019s prompt and environ-\nmental affordances (\u201ctask proposals\u201d) discovered from visual observations. The scene description\nstep perceive objects in the environment, the task proposal step suggests possible things the robot\ncould do with them, and then the affordance filtering step decides which tasks to attempt and how\nbased on these observations and prompt. This process takes into account constraints specified via\n\u201cconstitutional prompting\u201d, where rules about robot behaviour can be defined by the user. It ad-\nditionally accounts for the availability of human teleoperators, and handles working around the\ncapabilities of the robot (e.g., the robot can pick up a cup but not a table, it can approach the sink\nbut can\u2019t sit in a chair, etc.).\nWe describe the AutoRT system, instantiate it with a fleet of real-world mobile manipulators, and\npresent the results of an extensive real-world evaluation over 7 months, 4 different office buildings,\nand a fleet of over 20 robots, which resulted in the collection of 77,000 real-world robotic trials\nwith both teleoperation and autonomous execution. AutoRT is, to the best of our knowledge, the\nfirst system where LLM-controlled robots are allowed to drive autonomously in real world settings,\npropose their own goals, and take actions toward those goals. We show that AutoRT scales robot\ndeployment by allowing 1 human to supervise 3-5 mobile manipulators. Our evaluation studies how\nAutoRT can collect highly diverse data, be instructed to collect task appropriate data and shows such\ndata can be used to improve state-of-the-art robot learning models. AutoRT also introduces aligning\nrobot behavior to human preferences using prompting and critiquing with a robot constitution.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nReal robot data collection. Large scale real robot data collection for robotic manipulation falls\ninto mainly two categories: autonomous data collection and human assisted demonstrations. Au-\ntonomous data collection in prior works is often conducted in constrained robot lab environments,\non tasks like grasping (Pinto & Gupta, 2015; Levine et al., 2016; Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Platt,\n2022), pushing (Yu et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2018; Dasari et al., 2020), or pick and place (Kalash-\nnikov et al., 2021; Bousmalis et al., 2023). Our work focuses on tackling more varied environments,\nsimilar to Gupta et al. (2018), and tackling a wider set of tasks. Human demonstrated data collection\ncan be done in varied environments (Sharma et al., 2018; Mandlekar et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2021;\nBrohan et al., 2022), and teleoperated data can be far more diverse and valuable for skill learning\nthan autonomously collected data, but is bottlenecked by availability of humans when scaling to\nmany robots. This motivates hybrid approaches that mix teleoperation and autonomous policies,\nsuch as DAgger style methods (Ross et al., 2011; Kelly et al., 2019; Hoque et al., 2022). AutoRT is\nsuch a hybrid approach, collecting both teleoperated and autonomous episodes based on supply of\nhuman supervision, with a focus on collecting data on novel tasks in novel environments.\nLarge language models. Many recent works have studied using LLMs to generate agent-like be-\nhavior (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023), improve embodied reasoning (Driess\net al., 2023), and write robotics code (Vemprala et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022). Works like Ahn\net al. (2022) and Rana et al. (2023) use LLMs to generate language plans for robots to solve an\ninstruction given by a user. Our work self-generates instructions for the robot to perform, which\nwas proposed in Xian et al. (2023). Most similar is Voyager (Wang et al., 2023), an LLM-driven\nagent that autonomously explores a Minecraft environment. AutoRT runs on a real-world robot for\nextended periods of time, introducing challenges like reliability and safety that are less present in\nsimulated environments.\n3\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nIn this work, our goal is to build a system that enables large-scale, \u201cin-the-wild\u201d data collection to\ngenerate diverse, real-world robot data on new skills in new environments.\n2\nTo do so, we assume access to a large fleet of N robots, capable of navigating across multiple\nbuildings, and manipulating objects. The buildings are populated, where both robots and people are\nfree to move around the space. We do not make any assumptions about the layout of the buildings,\nor the objects available for manipulation. We assume a limited bandwidth of human supervision,\nmeaning there are more robots than human supervisors \u2013 that is, we cannot expect that a human will\nalways be in charge of teleoperating a single robot.\nOur goal is to have a single system that can handle any state s \u2208 S observed by a robot, and generate\ntasks t executable by one of k different collect policies \u03c0 \u2208 {\u03c01,...,\u03c0k} = \u03a0. For instance, \u03c0i can\nbe an autonomous policy \u03c0auto\ni\neither hand-designed or learned a priori, or a policy executed by\nquerying a human teleoperator, i.e., \u03c0teleop\ni\n. The goal of such a system: S \u2192 \u03a0 is to guide the data\ncollection of the fleet of N robots by observing the state s and use this information to identify a set\nof feasible language-specified tasks t that correspond to specific policies \u03c0. In addition, the system\nneeds to take into account other factors that impact throughput of data collection and safety. These\ninclude tradeoffs between autonomous and teleoperated policy primitives, generation of diverse and\nnovel tasks proposals while at the same time considering guardrails and safety criteria.\n4\nAUTORT: EXPLORING AND EXECUTING IN THE WILD\nIn this section, we describe each component of AutoRT, which is visualized in Fig. 5. At a high\nlevel, AutoRT gathers data via an open vocabulary object detector to first understand and describe\nthe scene, then an LLM parses this description and generates sensible and safe language goals given\nhigh-level objectives, and finally an LLM is used to determine how to execute these goals.\nThe robot platform used in AutoRT is a mobile manipulator with a camera, robot arm, and mobile\nbase. Herein, we only consider manipulation data collection, so navigation is only used to gather\ndiverse manipulation settings \u2013 however, we note that the system is general to other robotic embod-\niments and modes of collection. Further details on the robot platform and the implementation are\nin Appendix A.\n4.1\nEXPLORATION: NAVIGATING TO THE TARGET\nThe first stage of AutoRT is to explore the space and find interesting scenes for manipulation. To\nmap the environment, we use the natural language map approach proposed by Chen et al. (2023),\nwhich is built using a VLM to encode object detections into visual-language embeddings \u03c6i, with\ncorresponding position (xi,yi,zi) determined by the robot\u2019s depth sensor and SLAM. Thus, given\na textual target q like \u201csponge\u201d, we can direct the robot towards a sponge by querying for a \u03c6i\nthat is close to the text embedding for q. To determine navigation goals we sample this map for\nregions of interest via sampling states proportional to their latent distance to an average embedding\nof previously seen objects (see Appendix B for more details). For each environment, this map is\ngenerated once, then copied to all robots collecting in the space and loaded from cache to save time\nin future episodes.\n4.2\nROBOT CONSTITUTION\nKey to safe robot operation is breaking down high level objectives relevant to humans into tasks a\nrobot may perform. We specify this to robots using what we call a Robot Constitution, a list of rules\nan LLM is instructed to follow, inspired by methods like Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022). These\nrules are divided into three categories:\n\u2022 Foundational rules inspired by Asimov\u2019s three laws (Asimov, 1942) that govern robotics in gen-\neral and govern interactions with humans. We modify the exact text of these laws as described\nin Appendix D.\n\u2022 Safety rules describing what tasks are considered unsafe or undesired based on current capabilities\nin deployment. These discourage the collect policies from interacting with humans or animals.\nThey also discourage handling sharp and fragile objects or electrical equipment.\n\u2022 Embodiment rules describing limitations of the robot\u2019s embodiment, such as its maximum payload\nand its unimanual nature, to discourage attempting tasks with heavier objects or that which require\ntwo arms (e.g. \u201copening a fridge and picking up a drink\u201d).\n3\nAffordance Filter \n(LLM)\nSample \u03c0 \n+ Prompt\nMap env or load cache, sample \nand drive to target\nDescribe Scene + \nObjects (VLM)\nI see a counter \ntop with a sponge \nand cloth on it.\nObjects: soap, \nnapkin, snack, \ncloth, sponge\n1.

Each robot explores the environment, sampling a random navigation\ntarget close to objects. The scene and objects in it are described by a VLM to give text to an LLM, which\ngenerates manipulation tasks for the robot. Valid tasks are run by the robot, the episodes are scored, and the\nprocess repeats. No part of this requires advance knowledge of the layout of the environment or objects it\ncontains, making it easy to run on a fleet of 20+ robots that are each in novel settings. Green sections are\ncontributions of this work.\nA fourth category, the guidance rules, provides an input for an optional high-level human command:\n\u201cThe human command, which the robot should follow if given: {guidance}\u201d. The way the robot\nconstitution is used in task generation and affordance is explained below.\n4.3\nTASK GENERATION\nOnce a robot is in front of a manipulation scene si, it needs to generate a list of manipulation tasks\nto attempt. This is done via two steps:\n\u2022 Scene description: Given an image from the robot camera, a VLM outputs text describing the\nscene the robot observes, and 5 objects that exist in that scene. For example, as shown in Fig. 5,\nthe VLM lists soap, napkin, snack, cloth, sponge in the given scene.\n\u2022 Task proposal: In this step, AutoRT is prompted to generate a list of tasks. This prompt begins\nwith a system prompt, such as: \u201cI am a robot operating in an office environment\u201d, which describes\nthe role the LLM should play. It continues with a list of rules that should be followed for task\ngeneration, codified by the robot constitution. The prompt ends with a section, where we can\ninject the scene and object description from the prior VLM call. Given this prompt, an LLM\ngenerates a list of potential manipulation tasks (see Fig. 5). We note, the LLM is not fine-tuned to\nour specific use case to maintain the generality the underlying model.\nAn important detail of AutoRT is that we use multiple collect policies {\u03c01,\u03c02,...,\u03c0k}, sampling\none each episode. When the collect policy is sampled, and task generation must be modified to\nmatch the capabilities of that policy. Thus, for each policy \u03c0 j, we append a \u03c0 j-specific suffix to the\nend of the task generation prompt. See Appendix D for full text of the prompts.\n4\n4.4\nAFFORDANCE\nTasks generated by the LLM on the first pass may not fully follow the provided prompt and thus\nAutoRT uses an extra step of task filtering. This is done using another prompted LLM; one can\nview this as a self-reflection step where an LLM is prompted to critique its own output, inspired\nby approaches such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), and Constitutional\nAI (Bai et al., 2022).\nDuring the affordance step, in addition to the robot constitution, the LLM is further prompted with\nthe list of collect policies available and text summaries of what each collect policy can do. For each\ngenerated task, the LLM is asked to either output a collect policy or a reason to reject that task. A\nfew examples are provided to guide the LLM output into the desired format. This can be viewed as\na classifier between the k collect policies, with an extra category for unknown tasks. The final task\nis then selected by randomly sampling from the accepted tasks. For instance, as shown in Fig. 5,\nthe originally sampled policy is \u03c0teleop. The first two proposed tasks by the LLM are classified as\n\u03c0teleop, the second two tasks are classified as \u03c0rt2, an autonomous policy from (Brohan et al., 2023),\nand the last task is rejected as the embodiment of the robot does not allow for a bimanual task. The\nfinal task is sampled from the first two tasks. We found classifying between all collect policies was\nfine, even though for filtering it would be sufficient to classify between \u03c0i and not-\u03c0i per episode.\n4.5\nDATA COLLECTION\nAny number of collect policies could be used, but our instance of AutoRT uses three: teleoperation,\na scripted pick policy, and RT-2 (Brohan et al., 2023). The scripted pick policy pseudocode is\nprovided in Appendix H. Each \u03c0i has a different sampling probability pi that is adjusted during\ncollect primarily based on the number of robots supervised per person. For example, if 1 person is\nsupervising 3 robots, then the human teleoperation collect policy was sampled p < 1\n3 of the time to\nrespect available supervision. After manipulation, the episode\u2019s diversity is scored (see Section 5.1\nfor how), and the robot resets to start again. The human supervisor may occasionally reset the\nenvironment by hand.\nRecent works like Brohan et al. (2023) suggest Internet-scale visual-language data can drive gener-\nalization in downstream robotic models. Assuming these trends continue, the upcoming bottleneck\nwill be action diversity - collecting useful, diverse motions that make progress towards new tasks\nin novel environments. Teleoperated data is the most action diverse policy, so we focus on keeping\nthroughput of teleoperation high (no worse than a \u201c1 human 1 robot\u201d setup), potentially at the cost\nof assisting autonomous robots less frequently. We additionally prompt task generation for teleop to\ncollect varied tasks by including lines like \u201cnone of these tasks should be simple pick and place\u201d. For\na breakdown of throughput by collect policy, or visualization of action trajectories, see Appendix I.\n4.6\nGUARDRAILS\nAutoRT deploys foundation models in \u201cin the wild\u201d settings but foundation models, even if prompted\ncorrectly and with instruction finetuning have no guarantees on safety. We complement these with\ntraditional robot environment controls as an additional layer of safety. These measures are detailed\nin Appendix C.\n5\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nOur experimental evaluation studies the deployment of AutoRT in a variety of real-world environ-\nments, covering about 7 months, 4 different buildings, simultaneous operation of over 20 robots,\nand about 77,000 real-world robotic trials. We aim to evaluate the diversity of the data collected\nby AutoRT, the degree to which we can steer the tasks that AutoRT attempts by modifying the\nprompt, the semantic and functional appropriateness of the automatically generated task proposals,\nand an initial evaluation showing an example application of the AutoRT-collected data to improve\nthe RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022) model.\nAutoRT Environment Scaling Our collection environments for the robots include offices, kitchens,\nand cafeterias. The same code is used in every environment with the only per-environment change\nbeing the difference in driving bounds allowing AutoRT to start collecting in a new environment in\n\u00a1 1 day without too much set up. Some of these environments are shown in Fig. 2.\n5\nFigure 2: Examples of robot collect environments used. These environments have a variety of surfaces and\nsemantically different objects to practice manipulation on, along with freedom for the robot to move between\nmanipulation scenes.\nAutoRT Robot Deployment Scaling: Each human supervised between 3 to 5 robots at once, al-\nlowing to scale mobile manipulator deployment faster than number of humans employed. Some of\nAutoRT was run using stationary robots that skipped navigation, only running task generation and\nmanipulation in a loop. These robots were easier to supervise due to their smaller range of motion,\nand were run with 1 human watching up to 8 robots. Human availability dictated the sampling ratios\nfor collect policies.\nData statistics: In total, 53 robots were used to collect 77,000 new episodes over the course of 7\nmonths, with a peak load of over 20 simultaneous robots. Over 6,650 unique instructions appear\nin the dataset. More details can be found in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table 1. Interestingly, we find that\nRT-2 success rate is quite low during collection, because the complex environments, objects and\nrequirement for navigation differed significantly from RT-2\u2019s training set and inference capabilities.\nThis influenced our decision to run RT-2 less frequently.\nMar 2023\nApr 2023\nMay 2023\nJun 2023\nJul 2023\nAug 2023\nSep 2023\nDate\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nNumber\nRobots Simultaneously Controlled by AutoRT\nFigure 3: On the left is AutoRT robot usage and on the right is t-SNE visualization of tasks, colored by collect\npolicy used.

Evaluating this is challenging, because downstream methods for utilizing such data\nare still imperfect \u2013 despite considerable recent progress, RL methods present scalability challenges\nto such diverse environments (Cobbe et al., 2020), while imitation learning methods require near-\noptimal data. Thus, our measure of success for AutoRT is the diversity of the collected data.We\n6\nCollect Policy\n# Episodes\nSuccess Rate\nScripted Policy\n73293\n21%\nTeleop\n3060\n82%\nRT-2\n936\n4.7%\nTable 1: AutoRT data, split by collect policy\nused.

We additionally present an evaluation of the RT-1 model via filtered BC in Section 5.4,\nhowever we note our evaluation is preliminary, and we hope that future advances in low-level robotic\nlearning algorithms (e.g., RL and IL) will lead to better approaches for utilizing such data.\nLanguage diversity:\nTo measure language diversity, we use the L2 distance in a language embed-\nding space \u2013 specifically that of Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018) that are normalized\n512-d embeddings. We compare AutoRT\u2019s task generation approach with the hand-designed tasks\nfrom three previous works: tasks from Language Table (Lynch et al., 2023), tasks from BC-Z (Jang\net al., 2021), and tasks from RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022). Table 2 shows AutoRT has higher av-\nerage distance between language embeddings and generates more diverse language than all other\napproaches.\nWe additionally use the language diversity score to compare two VLMs for scene description without\ngenerating large amounts of robot data. We compare PaLI (Chen et al., 2022) and FlexCap (Review,\n2023). Keeping the LLM prompts fixed, we first sample 70 random scenes the robots saw so far.\nEach scene was described by each VLM, and their descriptions were passed to task generation. The\ndiversity of language embeddings after affordance filtering was then used to score the VLMs. We\nfound both VLMs led to better scores than our baselines. Qualitative examples of sampled tasks\nfrom the two VLMs are in Appendix G.\nVisual diversity: To measure visual diversity, we utilize a clustering method similar to a diversity\nmeasure used in Tirumala et al. (2023). Robot episodes are first embedded by a visual encoder, then\nk-means unsupervised clustering is done in the space. New episodes are scored based on the dis-\ntance from that episode\u2019s embedding to the nearest k-means centroid. This distance is the diversity\nscore, with larger distances indicating more novel data. We utilize a CLIP model as our embedder,\nfinetuned to contrast {first image, goal image} embeddings with natural language captions (Xiao\net al., 2023), and cluster with k = 1000. We found this was better at capturing semantic differences,\nalthough it does ignore intermediate images.\nFig. 5 shows the visual diversity across each of AutoRT\u2019s data collection policies, along with the\nRT-1 dataset as a baseline. We find that the visual diversity is larger for each type of AutoRT data,\nwith higher diversity in teleop than the scripted policy. Notably, RT-1\u2019s dataset is only teleop, yet\nAutoRT is more diverse across all categories. Sample images are shown in Fig. 6. We also did an\nexperiment where human supervisors directly optimized the visual diversity at collect time based on\nrobot feedback. Further details are in Appendix E.\n5.2\nTASK GENERATION\nIn this section we study the quality of task generation prior to filtering based on feasibility (is the\ntask possible) and relevance (does the task follow high-level guidance) and compare against two\nbaselines. First, a simple templated language approach that matches a random verb from a hard-\ncoded list with an object seen by the VLM, e.g. \"<verb> <object>\". This mirrors the language\ninstruction process used in RT-1. Second, to ablate how well AutoRT can be steered towards useful\ntasks, we consider a AutoRT (unguided) variant that removes the guidance rule from the prompt.\nTo evaluate, the robot is placed in front of 5 scenes. We generate 75 tasks in total, using guidance\nlike \u201ccollect gardening tasks\u201d or \u201chow would you clean this mess?\u201d for AutoRT (guided). Results\n7\nFigure 5: Visual diversity visualizations for AutoRT, as scored by distance to closest k-means centroid. Left:\nHistogram of 1000 random successes per collect policy (or all successes from RT-2 collect). Right: CDF of\ndistributions, median of distribution annotated. Higher distances (more weight on the right) are further from\nprior data, and thus better. We find all AutoRT data is more diverse due to running in more varied environments,\nwith teleop data from AutoRT scoring best.\nFigure 6: Example last-frame images (color corrected) from RT-1 (left) and AutoRT (right)\nare shown in Table 3. We find that AutoRT\u2019s tasks (guided and unguided) are 1.5x more likely\nto be feasible than templated language. The large increase in feasibility is because naively mix-\nand-matching verbs is likely to generate nonsense language like \u201copen keyboard\u201d, whereas LLMs\nwill tend to generate sensible language. We further find that we can guide task generation towards\ngardening, cleaning, etc., which is promising for allowing end-users to tell robots what data we\nwould like them to collect. Qualitative outputs are in Appendix G.\n5.3\nAFFORDANCE AND ROBOT CONSTITUTION\nIn this section we study the effect of constitutional prompting and LLM self-critiquing on identifying\nsafe and feasible tasks. Task generation and filtering are evaluated via two metrics: % Safe, the\nfraction of safe and feasible tasks proposed by AutoRT, and Recall, how often the self critiquing\nstep correctly rejects unsuitable tasks generated during task proposal step.\nAccuracy of AutoRT Task Generation: Across a sample of 64 scenes, we consider all 259 tasks\ngenerated and label whether each task is safe and feasible to collect. In this sample, we found 31\ntasks that outght to have been rejected, giving a base rate of 228/259 = 88% acceptable tasks. After\nthe LLM affordance filtering step we see the rate of acceptable tasks increase to 200/214 = 93%.\nWhen evaluating affordance, over-rejecting tasks is better than under-rejecting them, so we further\nevaluate the recall of rejected tasks. How often does the LLM reject (or fail to reject) tasks that\nshould be rejected? Of the 31 unsuitable tasks, the LLM rejected 17/31 = 55% of them. Aditionally\nwe find that all 14 errors occurred during teleop task sampling, attributable to forcing teleop task\nTable 3: Comparison of task generation methods at generating completable tasks and relevant tasks. Injecting\nthe high-level guidance into the LLM prompt improves the relevance of generated tasks. Using an LLM at all\nimproves both feasibility and relevance thanks to common-sense inherited from Internet-scale data.\nTask Generator\nRelevance\nFeasibility\nTemplated Language\n20/75 = 27%\n39/75 = 52%\nAutoRT (unguided)\n21/75 = 28%\n62/75 = 83%\nAutoRT (guided)\n46/75 = 61%\n58/75 = 77%\n8\ngeneration to remain highly diverse. These tasks were rejected by the teleoperator during collect\nindicating the importance of human-in-the-loop supervision, both as a safety mechanism and as a\nsource of intervention data to improve affordance of task generation.\nAdversarial Testing of Constitutional Prompting:\nTo measure the effect of constitutional\nprompting, we set up deliberately adversarial scenes, and ablate our rules from the task genera-\ntion prompt and affordance prompt. First, 5 test scenes were set up with objects that the robot\nshould not interact with, including lifelike toy animals, sharp items, and people. Three task gen-\neration prompts are used: an unsafe prompt (designed to propose unsafe tasks), a minimal prompt\n(describing task generation without rules or constitution), and the constitutional prompt. These tasks\nare then filtered via two affordance prompts: a minimal one (describing affordance classification)\nand a constitutional one. Full prompt texts are in Appendix D.1. We show in Table 4 that the rate\nof safe tasks is significantly increased when robot constitution is included at task generation time or\naffordance filtering time, with best results when included at both steps. Additionally constitutional\nprompting is able to achieve high recall when given unsafe tasks.\nTable 4: Effect of constitutional prompting on safety of proposed tasks\nTask Generation\nUnsafe prompting\nMinimal prompting\nConstitutional prompting\nFilter\n% Safe\nRecall\n% Safe\nRecall\n% Safe\nRecall\nNone\n13/49 = 27%\nN/A\n9/50 = 18%\nN/A\n35/50 = 70%\nN/A\nMinimal\n11/43 = 26%\n4/36 = 11%\n5/34 = 15%\n12/41 = 29%\n26/39 = 67%\n2/15 = 13%\nConstit.\n13/15 = 87%\n34/36 = 94%\n8/14 = 57%\n35/41 = 85%\n25/30 = 83%\n26/39 = 67%\n5.4\nMODEL TRAINING\nThe data generated by AutoRT covers a significantly wider range of language and visuals than in\ndatasets such as RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022). As a sanity check on the usefulness of the data, we run\na training comparison with the RT-1 model. A pretrained RT-1 model is co-fine-tuned on a 50-50\nmixture of the pretraining dataset described in Brohan et al. (2022) and AutoRT\u2019s dataset. RT-1 is\nused instead of RT-2 due to training more quickly and cheaply.\nThe co-fine-tuned model is evaluated on two tasks we find RT-1 generalizes poorly to: picking from\ndifferent heights, and wiping. Exact evaluation instructions and details are in Appendix F. When\nco-fine-tuned, RT-1\u2019s performance increases from 0% to 12.5% on picking from different height,\nand 10% to 30% on wiping. We additionally include an ablation where we train from only the\nteleoperated segment of AutoRT data. We find this model is no longer able to pick from different\nheights, indicating that non-teleoperated AutoRT can be useful. These increases are modest, but we\nnote that the focus of AutoRT was on collecting diverse data, not on achieving high success rates.\nRT-1 training was done to verify the data could improve the model, but the high diversity of tasks\nand scenarios leads to a challenging learning problem that is hard to perform well at.\nTable 5: Results from co-finetuning RT-1 on AutoRT data\nPicking (Height Generalization)\nWiping\nRT-1\n0/24 = 0%\n1/10 = 10%\nCo-fine-tuned RT-1 on AutoRT data\n3/24 = 12.5%\n3/10 = 30%\nCo-fine-tuned RT-1 on teleop segment of AutoRT data\n0/24 = 0%\n2/10 = 20%\n6\nCONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK\nWe presented AutoRT, an approach for directing fleets of robots to collect data in the real world,\nautonomously and with human help, supervised by large-scale vision and language models. We\ndemonstrated that this approach results in useful, diverse, and large-scale data \u2013 leading to 77k real-\nworld demonstrations collected by over 20 robots in 7 months in 4 buildings. We further introduced\na robot constitution \u2013 which defined foundational rules, outlined safety constraints, and detailed the\nrobot\u2019s embodiment, and ablated the system design to show its usefulness. Finally, by training a\n9\nmodel on this collected data we demonstrated novel capabilities and improved generalization over\nstate of the art models. We believe this work is a step towards scaling robot data collection to the\nbreadth of foundation models as well as embodying foundation models into robotic systems.\nDespite the promise of AutoRT, the current approach comes with a number of limitations.\n1. AutoRT relies in large part on scripted and learned policies to scale collection for fixed teleop-\neration budget. If these policies only handle simpler tasks or have lower success rates in unseen\nsettings, it lowers the throughput of successful episodes. Scaling the generation of higher quality\ndata requires more robust and diverse autonomous collect policies as in Arenas et al. (2023)\n2. Communication bandwidth between scene description and language model can introduce an in-\nformation bottleneck in AutoRT. Failures of perception such as hallucination of objects, lack of\ngeneralization to novel environments, and motion blur can introduce and propagate failures in the\nsystem. As noted by prior work (Ahn et al., 2022; Mees et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023), foundation\nmodels also face challenges in reasoning about task and embodiment specific information, such\nas physics of objects and capabilities of the robot. We ignored this for simplicity, but expect\nfuture efforts to require more accurate real-world reasoning.\n3. Thirdly, the type of data collected by AutoRT tends to be highly diverse, leading to fewer samples\nper task and lots of variety in scenes and object configurations. This \u201csparse\u201d data presents a\nharder learning problem than the datasets used in existing state of the art robot learning methods\nlike Brohan et al. (2022) and Brohan et al. (2023). AutoRT assumes data collection is decoupled\nfrom the control policy, but achieving the best policy improvement would likely require the two\nto evolve in tandem with each other.\n4. Lastly, though constitutional prompting improves safety of generated tasks, prompting an LLM\ndoes not guarantee that the prompt\u2019s instructions will be followed, and a small percentage of\nunsafe tasks generated by the LLM will pass the affordance filtering. This necessitates some\ndegree of human supervision.\nAs we explore future directions, a chief question is how a robot should autonomously act in the\nworld. What we call a robot constitution has historically been a topic reserved for science fic-\ntion (Asimov, 1942), but this work concretizes a real application where such rules could be helpful.\nWe also see future work in treating model improvement and data collection as a single goal, rather\nthan two separate areas, with an eye on identifying proximal skills and improving sample efficiency\nvia directed data collection.\n10\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAuthor\nModel\nTraining\n& Eval\nNavigation\n& Scene\nDescrip-\ntion\nTask\nGener-\nation\n&\nFiltering\nCollect\nMethods\nData\nLeadership Paper\nWriting\nMichael Ahn\n\u2713\nDebidatta\nDwibedi\n\u2713\nChelsea Finn\n\u2713\n\u2713\nMontse\nGon-\nzalez Arenas\n\u2713\nKeerthana\nGopalakrish-\nnan\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nKarol\nHaus-\nman\n\u2713\n\u2713\nBrian Ichter\n\u2713\nAlex Irpan\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nNikhil Joshi\n\u2713\nRyan Julian\n\u2713\nSean Kirmani\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nIsabel Leal\n\u2713\n\u2713\nEdward Lee\n\u2713\nSergey Levine\n\u2713\n\u2713\nYao Lu\n\u2713\n\u2713\nSharath\nMaddineni\n\u2713\nKanishka Rao\n\u2713\nDorsa Sadigh\n\u2713\n\u2713\nPannag\nSan-\nketi\n\u2713\nPierre\nSer-\nmanet\n\u2713\n\u2713\nQuan Vuong\n\u2713\n\u2713\nStefan Welker\n\u2713\nFei Xia\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nTed Xiao\n\u2713\n\u2713\nPeng Xu\n\u2713\nSteve Xu\n\u2713\nZhuo Xu\n\u2713\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Celeste Barajas, Joseph Dabis, Gavin Gonzalez, Tomas Jackson, Alex Luong, Utsav\nMalla, Emily Perez, Elio Prado, Jornell Quiambao, Sangeetha Ramesh, Jaspiar Singh, Clayton Tan,\n11\nJodexty Therlonge, Eric Tran, Steven Vega, and Samuel Wan for assistance on data collection, model\nevaluation, and AutoRT supervision.

More than a million ways to be\npushed: A high-fidelity experimental dataset of planar pushing, 2016.\n14\nAPPENDIX\nA\nROBOT AND SYSTEM SETUP\nEach robot is a 7 DoF robot arm attached to a mobile base, with a camera mounted on the head\nof the robot. The robot is capable of both navigation and manipulation. At collection time, the\nrobot is driven to a location which could be either a natural environment, such as an office area, a\nkitchen area, a lounge, or an artificially set up room with objects on different surfaces. The robots\nare given the bounding box of the region they should stay within for safety purposes, but are not\ngiven any information on object locations ahead of time, and must explore the area to find objects\nfor themselves.\nThe code is structured in a form we call the policy graph. Each node v \u2208 V of the policy graph is a\nsubpolicy \u03c0(a|s,data), where s is the robot state, a is the robot action, and data is information that\naccumulates as we go through the graph. The collect policies {\u03c01,...,\u03c0k} are themselves subpoli-\ncies in the policy graph, but the policy graph includes subpolicies for navigation, and subpolicies\nwhose focus is only querying the LLM. Subpolicies that do not move the robot simply output a\nno-op action a.\nAfter every timestep, we check the transition conditions \u03b2 defined for each node. Transition con-\nditions \u03b2 : S \u00d7Data \u2192 {0,1},V are functions that take the current state and accumulated data, and\ndecide if a subpolicy should yield control to the next node, and if so, which one. These conditions\nare similar to those in a finite-state machine. A given node can have multiple incoming and out-\ngoing transition conditions. When there are multiple outgoing conditions, only one should be true\nat a time. For example, in Fig. 5 the AffordanceFilter has k outgoing transition conditions, one for\neach of collect policies \u03c0i \u2208 {\u03c01,...,\u03c0k}, and the DiversityScoring node has k incoming transition\nconditions, one from each collect policies.\nOne property of AutoRT is that it only generates tasks based on what the robot sees, which can bias\ntask generation. For example, if run in an office environment, AutoRT will mostly see office supplies\nand generate office-based tasks. To get better coverage of task space, we gathered many (over 100)\nrandom objects, like plastic toys and soda cans, and scattered some of them in the environments\neach day, swapping the objects every day. This provides a greater variety of objects for AutoRT\u2019s\ntask generation.\nB\nNAVIGATION SAMPLING\nWe first define a fixed query embedding with the goal of biasing sampling towards easier tasks. A\nshort list of object names from previous works was gathered.\napple, basket, blue can, bottled tea, bowl, box of tea,\nbrown chip bag, can, cereal, chip bag, clipboard,\ncoffee machine, coffee_machine, compost, compost bin,\ncup, drawer, drinking machine, empty bottle,\nenergy bar, espresso machine, ficus, first aid station, fridge,\nfruit, green bag of chips, green can, green plant,\ngreen soda can, human, jar of white candy, landfill, light switch,\nmicrowave oven, mini fridge, multigrain chip, napkin box, orange,\npaper bowl, paper cup, pepsi, plastic bottle, poster, potted plant,\nred can, silver spoon, sink, slippery sign, snack jar,\nsnack jar of almonds, snack jar of dried fruits, snack jar of gums,\nsnack jar of nuts, socket, sponge, table, tap, trash can, tv,\nup side down mug, upside down paper cup, water bottle, water machine,\nwater_bottle, white bowl, white chair, white jar, white mug,\nwhite sign, woven basket, yellow sign\nThis list was gathered once, and not changed or ablated during the project.\nWe defined \u03c6q as the normalized average text embedding for these object names. Each navigation\ntarget \u03c6i was then scored from 0 to 1 by:\nscorei =\n\u03c6i \u00b7\u03c6q \u2212mini \u03c6i \u00b7\u03c6q\nmaxi \u03c6i \u00b7\u03c6q \u2212mini \u03c6i \u00b7\u03c6q\n15\nand sampled proportionally to score\u03b2\ni , where \u03b2 is a hyperparameter deciding the temperature of sam-\npling. We use \u03b2 = 1 in data collection to maintain higher variation during collection, but recommend\nusing larger \u03b2 when doing more targeted data collection.\nC\nGUARDRAILS\nThe following guardrails are put in place to ensure operational safety.\n\u2022 All robots will pause motion if detected force on joints exceeds a threshold. All robots can also\nbe immediately disengaged using a physical E-stop button.\n\u2022 Unless the robot workspace is barricaded, at least one human must supervise the robots in such a\nway that all robots are within line of sight.\n\u2022 During regular operation, we proactively remove objects from the environment that is unsafe for\na robot to handle. This is in addition to prompting the LLM to not interact with them.\n\u2022 Whenever we collect a human demonstration, the human expert sanity checks the generated task,\nsince they are already available to provide human feedback to the model.\nMany of these controls are standard practice in robot learning. As robot policies and LLMs improve,\nuser expectations of robots will increase, and we anticipate verification protocols to become more\ncomplex and important to get right.\nD\nPROMPTS\nAll prompts are based on Python string formatting. When doing teleop task generation, we use\nnum tasks=10. Task generation guidance is set to \u201cN/A\u201d unless specified otherwise.\nRobot constitution:\nAsimov\u2019s three laws of robotics are modified in two ways. The first law removes the \u201cthrough in-\naction\u201d part, as our robot\u2019s agency is limited and we do not want to bias towards in-action. The order\nof the second and third laws are swapped, since our robots are currently more in need of protection\nfrom humans asking for tasks which could endanger the robots, rather than the other way around.\nFOUNDATIONAL RULES =\nF1. A robot may not injure a human being.\nF2. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with F1.\nF3. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would\nconflict with F1 or F2.\nSAFETY RULES =\nS1. This robot shall not attempt tasks involving humans, animals or living things.\nS2. This robot shall not interact with objects that are sharp, such as a knife.\nS3. This robot shall not interact with objects that are electrical, such as a computer or tablet.\nEMBODIMENT RULES =\nE1. This robot shall not attempt to lift objects that are heavier than a book. For example, it\ncannot move a couch but it can push plastic chairs.\nE2. This robot only has one arm, and thus cannot perform tasks requiring two arms. For\nexample, it cannot open a bottle.\nGUIDANCE RULES =\nG1. The human command, which the robot should follow if given: {guidance}\nTask generation prompt for teleop policy:\n16\nRobot: Hi there, I\u2019m a robot operating in an office.

For\nexample you can open drawers and cabinets but not open an apple. Pick apple from counter\nand place in bowl is reasonable if apple is on counter and bowl exists in scene. Based on the\nobjects in the scene, propose 10 tasks the robot can do here. Robot: 1.\nTask generation prompts for scripted pick\nRobot: Hi there, I\u2019m a picking robot operating in an office.

We perform a pilot study where the robot speaks out loud the diversity score of\nthe episode it has collected. The human supervising the data collection pays attention to this score,\nand changed the scene between episodes to try to maximize the spoken score. The resulting scenes\nin Fig. 7 feature more distractor objects, askew tables, and unconventional object arrangements\nlike turned over recycling bins and objects on top of chairs. This demonstrates another benefit of\nquantifying data diversity - it can provide online feedback that allows for faster iteration loops during\ndata collection.\n(a) Before\n(b) After optimizing visual diversity\nFigure 7: Robot environments before and after adjusting scene based on visual diversity. Note the\nunconventional arrangement of objects, surfaces, and distractors.\nF\nMODEL IMPROVEMENT EVALUATION TASKS\nFor picking from different heights, pick attempts were done against 3 different heights: a desk, a\nshorter table, and the floor. For each height, we sampled 4 candidate tasks, giving 12 tasks in total.\nFor wiping evals, the scene was set up with a table, a sponge, and a cloth, and we sampled 5 wiping\ntasks, some of which required using the correct object, and some of which could use either the\nsponge or cloth. All tasks were attempted 2 times each. Exact task strings are in Appendix F.\n21\nTable 6: Tasks used to evaluate training ablations\nTask Group\nTasks\nPicking\npick utensil, pick office supplies, pick chips, pick bag, pick coffee\ncup, pick plastic, pick clip, pick snack, pick dice, pick cube, pick\nstationery, pick sponge\nWiping\nwipe the desk with the sponge, wipe the desk with the cloth, wipe\ntable, use the rag to wipe the table, wipe down the surface\nG\nQUALITATIVE EXAMPLES\nWe collect qualitative examples of LLM generations here.

To mitigate this ineffi-\nciency, we present Bi-directional Tuning for lossless\nAcceleration (BiTA), an innovative method expe-\nditing LLMs via streamlined semi-autoregressive\ngeneration and draft verification. Inspired by the\nconcept of prompt tuning, we enhance LLMs with a\nparameter-efficient design called bi-directional tun-\ning for the capability in semi-autoregressive gen-\neration. Employing efficient tree-based decoding,\nthe models perform draft candidate generation and\nverification in parallel, ensuring outputs identical to\ntheir autoregressive counterparts under greedy sam-\npling. BiTA serves as a lightweight plug-in module,\nseamlessly boosting the inference efficiency of ex-\nisting LLMs without requiring additional assistance\nmodels or incurring significant extra memory costs.\nApplying the proposed BiTA, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat\nachieves a 2.7\u00d7 speedup on the MT-Bench bench-\nmark. Extensive experiments confirm our method\nsurpasses state-of-the-art acceleration techniques.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent years have witnessed a rapid evolution in large lan-\nguage models (LLMs) grounded in transformer architectures.\nThe parameters of LLMs have swiftly burgeoned, spanning\nfrom several billions to tens of trillions, as exemplified by\nmodels like Chat-GPT [Brown et al., 2020], LLaMA-2 [Tou-\nvron et al., 2023], and others. While LLMs exhibit diverse and\npowerful generative capabilities, they encounter challenges in\ninference latency due to the substantial computational burden\narising from numerous parameters. As a result, accelerating\nthe inference process of LLMs has become a significant focus,\nparticularly in resource-limited scenarios such as edge devices\nand real-time applications like chatbots.\nThe prevalent decoder-only LLMs, highlighted in recent\nworks [Zhang et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Almazrouei\net al., 2023], adhere to a token-by-token generation manner.\nEach token generated necessitates a distinct inference execu-\ntion, reflecting their autoregressive (AR) generation nature and\n3.0\nLLaMA-2-7B\nLLaMA-2-70B\nVicuna-33B\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n2.38\u00d7\n1.94\u00d7\n2.47\u00d7\n1.22\u00d7\n1.53\u00d7\n1.79\u00d7\n2.72\u00d7\n1.70\u00d7\n1.11\u00d7\n1.15\u00d7\nVanilla\nSelf-SpecDec\nLookahead\nBiTA (ours)\nHF AssistGen\nSpecDec\nMedusa\n1.0\u00d7\n1.0\u00d7\n1.0\u00d7\nFigure 1: A comparison of LLM acceleration techniques, encom-\npassing both state-of-the-art methods and our approach, is presented\non MT-Bench using various base models. The speedup numbers are\neither sourced from the respective papers or reproduced using the\nreleased source codes in a standardized hardware environment by us,\nin cases where explicit disclosure is not provided.\nleading to a substantial number of transformer calls during\ninference. These calls frequently encounter constraints associ-\nated with memory bandwidth, causing reduced computational\nefficiency and prolonged wall-clock times [Hooper et al., 2023;\nZhang et al., 2023; Shazeer, 2019]. Thus, a key strategy to\nexpedite LLMs is to minimize the number of inference execu-\ntions.\nSemi-autoregressive (SAR) decoding, as introduced in ma-\nchine translation literature [Wang et al., 2018], mitigates the\nhigh demand for inference executions by producing multiple\ntokens in parallel with a single step of model inference. How-\never, the majority of current LLMs are AR models, lacking\nthe capability for SAR generation. Re-training for an SAR\nmodel appears challenging due to the misalignment between\nthe SAR objectives and AR pretraining. Additionally, train-\ning from scratch in an SAR fashion seems almost impractical\nconsidering the substantial resource consumption involved.\nFurthermore, SAR models often suffer from quality degrada-\ntion compared to their AR counterparts [Wang et al., 2018;\nGu and Kong, 2021; Huang et al., 2022].\nIs it feasible to empower an existing AR language model\nto function as an SAR one with minimal adaptation while\nensuring satisfactory model performance? We break down\narXiv:2401.12522v2  [cs.CL]  25 Jan 2024\nthe question into two aspects and address each separately.\nLeveraging advancements in parameter-efficient tuning (PET)\ntechniques, especially prompt tuning [Lester et al., 2021], we\nseamlessly enhance AR models with the capability of SAR\ngeneration. Simultaneously, drawing insights from speculative\ndecoding [Leviathan et al., 2023], which typically follows the\n\u201cdraft-then-verify\u201d paradigm, we perform verification on SAR\noutputs. This careful verification ensures that SAR outputs\nremain consistent when inferred in an AR manner, thereby\npreventing the typical degradation observed in standard SAR\nmodels.\nIn this paper, we propose Bi-directional Tuning for lossless\nAcceleration (BiTA), a novel acceleration scheme aimed at\nachieving lossless SAR decoding for AR language models by\nlearning very limited additional learnable parameters. Specifi-\ncally, BiTA comprises two components: SAR draft generation\nthrough the proposed bi-directional tuning and streamlined ver-\nification for generated draft candidates. Bi-directional tuning\ninvolves incorporating both prompt tokens and mask tokens to\nenable the prediction of future tokens, extending beyond the\nnext token for an AR model. This method is metaphorically\nreferred to as the learnable prefix and suffix embeddings in\ntoken sequence. Through an elaborate tree-based attention\nmechanism, generation and verification operate simultane-\nously in a single forward pass within the converted AR model.\nThe universal design eliminates the need for extra validation\nsteps or external verification models. Benefiting from the\nconcept of prompt tuning, the proposed method can func-\ntion as a plug-and-play module for expediting any publicly\navailable transformer-based LLMs, particularly those well-\ninstructed chatbots [Touvron et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023;\nAlmazrouei et al., 2023], without compromising their strong\ngenerative capabilities. Our primary contributions can be sum-\nmarized as follows:\n\u2022 To reduce transformer calls in AR generation, we adapt\nAR language models for SAR generation using the pro-\nposed bi-directional tuning, introducing as few as 0.01%\nadditional trainable parameters.\n\u2022 We introduce an efficient tree-based decoding for SAR\noutputs, enabling simultaneous draft generation and veri-\nfication, thereby eliminating the necessity for extra vali-\ndation steps or external models.\n\u2022 BiTA operates as a plug-and-play module, applicable\nto any publicly available transformer-based LLMs with-\nout altering the original outputs. With the aid of BiTA,\nLLaMA-2-70B-Chat achieves a 2.7\u00d7 speedup on the\nMT-Bench benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art tech-\nniques in extensive experiments (A brief comparison is\npresented in Figure 1).\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLLM Acceleration\nLLM acceleration can be approached through various dimen-\nsions, including model compression [Hinton et al., 2015;\nLiu et al., 2018], architecture simplification [Dao et al.,\n2022], quantization [Gholami et al., 2022], memory man-\nagement [Kwon et al., 2023], kernel optimization [Wang et\nal., 2021], inference scheduling [Kwon et al., 2023], efficient\ndecoding [Santilli et al., 2023], and more. These techniques\nspan from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to ground-\nbreaking changes in system designs, finding widespread appli-\ncations in practical scenarios [Miao et al., 2023a].\nIn this paper, a specific emphasis is placed on SAR de-\ncoding as one of the typical methods for efficient decoding.\nSAR decoding, derived from non-autoregressive (NAR) de-\ncoding [Gu et al., 2018], is initially introduced for machine\ntranslation [Stern et al., 2018]. It diverges from the conven-\ntional AR generation paradigm by decoding output tokens in\nparallel, with the goal of attaining AR output quality through\npost-processing strategies [Xiao et al., 2023].\n2.2\nSpeculative Decoding\nSpeculative decoding stands out as another typical efficient\ndecoding method, involving the anticipation of token distribu-\ntion of corresponding AR models in a speculative manner. An\nearly method [Stern et al., 2018] generates future predictions\nas drafts by auxiliary prediction heads, then validate them\nby a scoring model. Recent studies [Leviathan et al., 2023;\nChen et al., 2023] utilize external draft models for token dis-\ntribution sampling from large target models. SpecDec [Xia\net al., 2023] explores the designing principles for efficient\ndraft models. OSD [Liu et al., 2023b] enhances draft models\nthrough online retraining.\nWithout employing external draft models, SPEED [Hooper\net al., 2023] designs a faster speculative pipeline with cyclic\nparameter sharing. While Self-SpecDec [Zhang et al., 2023]\nexpedites drafting by selectively skipping specific intermedi-\nate layers. Medusa [Cai et al., 2023] adopts multiple addi-\ntional prediction heads, akin to literature [Stern et al., 2018].\nPaSS [Monea et al., 2023] obtains SAR drafts by means of\n\u201clook-ahead\u201d embeddings. REST [He et al., 2023] utilizes the\nknowledge retrieval. Lookahead [Fu et al., 2023] relies solely\non n-grams generated by LLMs as speculative draft candidates.\nOptimizing verification is another way. SpecInfer [Miao et al.,\n2023b] uses a draft candidate token tree for parallel verifica-\ntion. SSD [Spector and Re, 2023] restructures drafts into a\ntree and conducts batch decoding. SpecTr [Sun et al., 2023]\nseeks an optimal tradeoff between more draft candidates and\nthe associated cost.\nOur method belongs to speculative decoding that operates\nwithout external draft models. The recent study, Medusa [Cai\net al., 2023], shares similarities with BiTA in generating future\ntokens without altering original model parameters. However, a\nnotable distinction lies in structure: BiTA employs soft embed-\ndings, whereas Medusa utilizes multiple heads. Another recent\nstudy closely aligned with BiTA is PaSS [Monea et al., 2023],\nusing \u201clook-ahead\u201d embeddings (referred as \u201cmask tokens\u201d in\nBiTA) for future predictions, while BiTA incorporates addi-\ntional prompt tokens, which prove beneficial in experiments.\nMoreover, both works require calling the model a second time\nto validate draft candidates, while BiTA seamlessly conducts\nspeculative generation and verification.\n2.3\nPrompt Tuning\nAs a widely adopted parameter-efficient tuning (PET) tech-\nnique, Prompt Tuning [Lester et al., 2021], along with various\n<s>\nHow\nare\nyou\nInput Sequence\n \nHow\nare\nyou\n?\nFuture Predictions\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n?\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\nMask Tokens \n   Transformer Layer 1\n \n   Transformer Layer 2\n \n   Transformer Layer N\n \n \n \nI'm\ndoing\nwell\n!\nFrozen LLM\nPrompt Tokens\n \nFigure 2: A diagram of bi-directional tuning, orange blocks [M] for\ntrainable mask tokens, purple blocks [P] for trainable prompt tokens,\nand blue blocks for transformer layers in frozen LLM. The predicted\nSAR future tokens are generated with the joint influence of frozen\nLLM parameters, prompt tokens, and mask tokens. For illustration\npurposes, we set the count of prompt and mask tokens to be 3.\nsubsequent methods [Li and Liang, 2021; Liu et al., 2023a],\noptimizes pretrained transformers by updating a minimal set\nof prompt tokens, enhancing model customization for specific\ntasks, domains, or requirements. In this study, we leverage\nbenefits of prompt tuning, introducing deep soft prompting\nfrom prefix tuning [Li and Liang, 2021] to effectively adapt\nAR language models for SAR decoding without modifying\nthe original model parameters.\n3\nMethod\nIn this section, we introduce BiTA, an innovative method for\nlossless LLM acceleration. Incorporating the proposed bi-\ndirectional tuning, BiTA enables the seamless adaptation of\na transformer-based AR model to acquire an SAR generation\nstyle through efficient tuning. Additionally, we develop a\nstreamlined generation and verification strategy facilitated by\nan efficient tree-based attention mechanism for lossless infer-\nence. The intricate details of these two pivotal components\nare expounded upon in the subsequent subsections.\n3.1\nBi-directional Tuning\nThanks to the transformer architectures of LLMs, we leverage\nmultiple learnable placeholder tokens known as mask tokens,\nempowering language models to generate subsequent consecu-\ntive future tokens beyond the last input token. During training\nand inference, the mask tokens are tasked with producing the\nprobability of their next token in corresponding positions.\nTo maintain consistency with AR outputs, we choose to\nkeep the original model parameters unchanged. Drawing in-\nspiration from the idea of prompt tuning [Li and Liang, 2021],\nwe utilize prefix soft prompt tokens in the frozen LLMs, col-\nlaborating with the newly added mask tokens to achieve SAR\ngeneration (refer to Figure 2 for a schematic diagram). In stark\ncontrast, our design employs a distinct attention mechanism,\nspecifically for the mask tokens, separate from the conven-\ntional input tokens. As illustrated in Figure 3, the distinct\nattention allows prefix prompting to influence only the mask\ntokens rather than all tokens to their right, thereby avoiding\n<s>\nHow\nare\nyou\n?\n[M] [M]\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n[M]\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nFigure 3: An illustrative example of the attention mask employed\nin bi-directional tuning.

The shown example is\nderived from the sentence in Figure 2.\nalterations to the outputs of the original input tokens. To some\nextent, the prompt tokens serve as a specialized form of soft\nprompting, activating AR models to acquire the capability of\nSAR generation.\nDuring the training procedure, we perform bi-directional\ntuning in self-generated SFT-like instruction data, incorporat-\ning an SAR loss function. In the following, we describe how\nto produce the SAR training data and then introduce the used\nloss. Given a preprepared question token sequence X, we use\nthe LLM intended for acceleration to generate answer token\nsequence Y = {y0, y1, ... , yN} by greedy sampling. Thus,\na question and the corresponding self-generated answer con-\nstitute a training sample. In a detailed explanation of training,\nconsidering the number of mask tokens as M, we randomly\nsample an index k from the range of (0, N\u2212M). Subsequently,\nwe form the question token sequence X by appending it with\nY k\ninst = {yi, i \u2264 k} as a SAR task instruction. While the\nsubsequent Y k,M\ngt\n= {yi, k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k + M} serves as its\nground truth. Following the data production process above, we\neffortlessly manufacture a substantial amount of training data\nusing preprepared question sequences from multiple SFT train-\ning datasets. Based on the SAR training data, the formulation\nof the SAR loss is as follows:\nLSAR = \u2212\nk+M\nX\ni=k+1\nlogP(yi|X, Y k\ninst; \u03b8, \u03d5p, \u03d5m),\n(1)\nwhere yi is the label of the mask tokens, drawn from Y k,M\ngt\n, \u03b8\ndenotes the frozen model parameters, and \u03d5p, \u03d5m denotes the\nembeddings of prompt and mask tokens, respectively.\nIt is crucial to emphasize the use of self-generated train-\ning data, ensuring that the distribution of SAR output tokens\nclosely aligns with that of the original AR outputs of the ac-\ncelerated LLM. This simple yet effective strategy promotes\naccurate predictions, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to \u201cguess-\ning\u201d future tokens precisely.\n3.2\nStreamlined Generation & Verification\nBiTA simplifies SAR generation and verification in a single\nforward pass within a universal model. To illustrate, we first\nInput Sequence:  <s> Have you heard about LLMs?\n<s>       ?

If c draft tokens are accepted, the first c mask\ntokens would be discarded as they are no longer necessary. If a draft\ncandidate is rejected, its prediction, along with its subsequent tokens,\nis discarded (denoted as \u201c/\u201d). In these four forward passes, the model\nproduces 1, 4, 1, and 3 output tokens, respectively.\npresent a straightforward example of the streamlined genera-\ntion and verification process. We then enhance it with more\nefficient decoding incorporating a tree-based attention mecha-\nnism inspired by literature [Miao et al., 2023b].\nAn illustrative example of straightforward decoding is de-\npicted in Figure 4, and we describe the process as follows.\nGiven an input token sequence X0 = {x0, x1, ..., xN\u22121},\nin the first forward pass, the model simultaneously outputs\nthe prediction of the next token \u02c6yN and M future predictions\n\u02c6C1 = {\u02c6yN+1, \u02c6yN+2, ..., \u02c6yN+M}. As a reliable AR output\nbased on the context of X0, \u02c6yN is indubitably accepted, while\n\u02c6C1 serves as draft token candidates intended for verification\nin the next forward pass. Then, in the ith (i > 1) forward\npass, the input sequence comprises query tokens, previously\ngenerated tokens, draft token candidates \u02c6Ci\u22121 (enclosed in\norange dashed boxes in Figure 4), and mask tokens. The draft\ntoken candidates are sequentially verified based on the AR\nprediction of the last token. The accepted draft candidates are\nadded to the previously generated token sequence. If a draft\ncandidate is rejected, its prediction, along with its follow-ups,\nis discarded, and the prediction of the last accepted candi-\ndate serves as the AR output token which is accepted. For\ndraft generation, each mask token outputs the prediction of\nits next token in corresponding positions. Note that they do\nnot \u201cattend\u201d to the current draft token candidates, generating\nfuture predictions in the context of only both query tokens and\npreviously generated tokens. The predicted future tokens are\nused in the the next forward pass for verification.\nThe straightforward streamlined generation and verification\nmethod faces two tricky challenges. On one hand, the correct-\nness of draft token candidates is not always assured. As stated,\nthe draft token candidates are predicted based on the context\nof the output sequence until the last forward pass, rather than\nincorporating the currently accepted draft tokens. On the other\nhand, the number of draft token candidates may be very few,\nInput: <s>   Have   you   heard   about   LLMs\nYeah\nYes\nSure\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\n,\n!\n</s>\n?\n[M1]\n[M2]\n[M3]\n[M4]\nTop K\nFigure 5: The efficient draft candidate token tree. The configuration\nincludes 4 mask tokens, and for the prediction of each mask token,\nthe top 3 draft candidates are selected. As shown, only the top-1\nscoring word has subsequent words for verification.\nas some draft token candidates are no longer effective due\nto being accepted in the last forward pass, or even zero if\nall candidates are accepted in the last forward pass. These\ntwo inadequacies become significant obstacles for decoding\nefficiency. Moreover, while the draft token candidates are cur-\nrently drawn from the top-1 scoring word of future predictions,\nexploring additional likely words for each prediction could\npotentially increase the probability of acceptance, leading to a\nhigher inference speedup [Xia et al., 2023].\nTo overcome these identified inadequacies, we present an\nefficient tree-based decoding approach using an elaborate at-\ntention mechanism to ensure an adequate number and cor-\nrectness of draft token candidates. For each mask token, we\nselect the top-k predicted words as draft candidates in corre-\nsponding positions. All groups of top-k draft candidates can\nbe organized into a token tree, where each leaf node indicates\na possible generated sequence for verification. By exploring\nthe distribution of the output future tokens, we observe that\nthe top-1 scoring word plays the most important role in sub-\nsequent predictions: the most likely candidate has a higher\nchance of forming an effective sequence with the subsequent\nwords. Therefore, instead of building a fully tree to explore all\npossible candidate sequences, we construct an efficient token\ntree that is sufficiently representative, concentrating on those\nsequences whose non-leaf nodes in the token tree are the top-1\nscoring candidate, as illustrated in Figure 5.\nMoreover, we attach a group of mask tokens to each node\nin the efficient token tree. This ensures that regardless of\nthe number of currently accepted draft candidates, we can\nalways select the same number of mask tokens that follows the\nlast accepted candidate token. The selected mask tokens are\nutilized to organize the draft candidate token tree for the next\nstep. By having the selected mask tokens predict future tokens\nbased on the context of the accepted candidate tokens, there\nis a potential improvement in accuracy. This improvement\nis expected to result in higher efficiency for decoding, as\ndemonstrated in Section 4.3.\nTo obtain a sequential input, we flatten the draft candidate\ntoken tree, along with the attached mask tokens, into a to-\nken sequence. This sequence is then appended to the current\nresult token sequence which consists of query tokens and pre-\nviously generated tokens, to construct the model input. During\ninference, the draft candidate tokens and the attached mask\ntokens \u201cattend\u201d to both their \u201cancestors\u201d in the tree and the\ncurrent result tokens as well, while the mask tokens \u201cattend\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \nam\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\nLLMs\n?\nYeah\nYes\nSure\n,\n!\n</s>\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\nLLMs\n?\nYeah\nYes\nSure\n,\n!\n</s>\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\nLLMs\n?\nYeah\nYes\nSure\n,\n!\n</s>\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\nLLMs\n?\nYeah\nYes\nSure\n,\n!\n</s>\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\n[P]\n[P]\n[P]\nLLMs\n?\nYeah\nYes\nSure\n,\n!\n</s>\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\nprompt\nqueries\ndraft candidates\nmasks for  am \nFigure 6: Partial attention mask in efficient tree-based decoding.

Thanks to the tree-based at-\ntention, AR and SAR generation, as well as draft verification,\nare conducted in a single forward pass simultaneously. An\nincomplete yet sufficiently expressive illustration of the tree-\nbased attention is provided in Figure 6 (the shown example is\nderived from the token tree depicted in Figure 5).\nIn this subsection, we delineate the streamlined decoding\nmethod step by step. Beginning with a straightforward sim-\nplified toy example, we introduce the concept of streamlined\ngeneration and verification in parallel. In order to improve\nacceptance rate of drafts, we design an efficient top-k draft can-\ndidate token tree with candidate-wise mask token groups. Fi-\nnally, we employ a tree-based attention mechanism to achieve\nstreamlined generation and verification. Despite introducing\nadditional computational complexity with more tokens used\nin inference, this strategy still achieves an impressive speedup\nin LLMs. Because the bottleneck of LLM\u2019s inference is usu-\nally the memory-bandwidth cost [Shazeer, 2019] rather than\ncomputational cost. Additionally, we explore the size of the\ndraft candidate token tree, achieving a favorable acceptance-\ncomplexity tradeoff (detailed in Section 4.3).\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental setup\nDatasets\nAs described in Section 3.1, we utilize self-generated SFT-\nlike training data, which comprises preprepared questions\nand the answers generated by the LLM for acceleration. For\ndiversity, the preprepared questions are sourced from five SFT\ndatasets: LIMA [Zhou et al., 2023], Alpaca-GPT4 [Peng et al.,\n2023], CodeAlpaca [Chaudhary, 2023], OpenPlatypus [Lee\net al., 2023], and CIP [Palla, 2023]. Note that we use a 50k\nsample set from the CIP training set during training, resulting\nin approximately 150k training samples in total.\nFor evaluation, we employ four datasets: XSum [Narayan\net al., 2018], MT-Bench [Zheng et al., 2023a], the CIP test\nset, and HumanEval-X [Zheng et al., 2023b]. This evaluation\ncovers the acceleration capability across summarization, open-\nended questions, conversation, and code, respectively.\nImplementation Details\nExperiments are conducted on LLMs of various sizes, encom-\npassing the LLaMA-2 chat model series (7B, 13B, 70B) [Tou-\nvron et al., 2023], Vicuna series (7B, 13B, 33B) [Chiang et\nal., 2023], and Falcon-40B-Chat [Almazrouei et al., 2023],\nranging from 7B to 70B parameters. For optimization, a co-\nsine learning rate schedule is employed with an initial value\nof 3e-2 and a batch size of 128 for 4 epochs. The learnable\nembeddings are initialized with a normal distribution having a\nmean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.02. Unless spec-\nified otherwise, the count of prompt tokens is established at\n16, with mask tokens set to 3 for models having a parameter\nsize not exceeding 13B and adjusted to 4 otherwise. The train-\ning is conducted on a cluster of four servers, each equipped\nwith eight NVIDIA A800 (80GB) GPUs. For a base model\nwith a scale of 7B parameters, the training process takes ap-\nproximately 7 hours. In addition, for our efficient tree-based\ndecoding, the top 5 predictions in each mask token are selected\nas draft token candidates.\nEvaluation Settings\nWe conduct the evaluation of the proposed BiTA and compar-\native methods on NVIDIA A800 (80GB) GPUs. For models\nwith a parameter size no greater than 13B, a single A800\nGPU is used; otherwise, 8 A800 GPUs are used. The eval-\nuated models performed inference with a batch size of 1 to\nensure accurate assessment of response time. To facilitate\ncomparison, we use \u201cgreedy speedup\u201d as the metric [Cai et al.,\n2023], defined as the ratio of the evaluated model\u2019s speed us-\ning greedy sampling to the AR baseline, with speed measured\nin generated tokens per second. The AR baseline is imple-\nmented using the AR generation code in the Huggingface\nTransformers library [Wolf et al., 2020].\n4.2\nMain Results\nSpeedup Across Diverse LLMs and Tasks\nTable 1 presents the speedup of the proposed BiTA across\nfour datasets: XSum, MT-Bench, CIP, and HumanEval-X.\nWhen BiTA is applied, the expedited LLMs exhibit a speedup\nranging from 2.1\u00d7 to 3.3\u00d7 across various generation tasks,\nencompassing summarization, open-ended questions, conver-\nsation, and code. Notably, larger LLMs tend to exhibit more\nsubstantial speedup, possibly attributed to the intrinsic richer\ncontext encoded by the embeddings for each token, facili-\ntating improved future predictions. Another hypothesis is\nthat our prompting-based methods benefit from larger models,\naligning with similar observations in NLP tasks discussed in\nModel\nXSum\nMT-B\nCIP\nHE-X\nLLaMA-2-7B\n2.19\n2.38\n2.29\n2.73\nLLaMA-2-13B\n2.29\n2.41\n2.39\n2.88\nVicuna-33B\n2.20\n2.47\n2.10\n3.00\nFalcon-40B\n2.28\n2.75\n2.32\n3.07\nLLaMA-2-70B\n2.55\n2.72\n2.58\n3.31\nTable 1: The speedup of BiTA in various base models on XSum,\nMT-Bench, CIP, and HumanEval-X under greedy sampling setting.\nFor space conservation, MT-Bench is abbreviated as MT-B, and\nHumanEval-X is shortened to HE-X. The involved models are chat\nversions, which are not further explained in the rest of the paper.\nother works on parameter-efficient tuning [Lester et al., 2021;\nLiu et al., 2023a]. Additionally, it is noteworthy that BiTA\nattains particularly impressive speedup (2.7\u223c3.3\u00d7) in code\ngeneration compared to other tasks. Upon examining the test\nsamples, we hypothesize that the structured and logical content\nin code generation tasks may play a significant role in enhanc-\ning future predictions. In addition to the remarkable speedup\nperformance, we observe that for a 7B-scale base model, the\ncount of trainable parameters for prompt and mask embed-\ndings is approximately 0.06% of the total model parameters,\nwhile it is 10 times less for 70B-scale models.\nComparison with Speculative Decoding\nWe compare the speedup performance of our method with\nseveral state-of-the-art speculative decoding based methods in\nTable 2. The evaluation is conducted on MT-Bench, utilizing\nboth LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-70B. For a fair compari-\nson, we implement the four comparative approaches using\npublicly available source codes in the same hardware envi-\nronment environment as our BiTA. As these four comparative\napproaches do not require special training or finetuning, we\ncan easily re-implement them in our experimental environ-\nment. However, for HF AssistGen [Joao Gante, 2023] and\nSpecDec [Leviathan et al., 2023], we encountered challenges\nin acquiring a compact draft model with a similar output token\ndistribution to the target model, thus failing to meet the accel-\neration requirement for LLaMA-2-7B, and we cannot provide\nthe corresponding results. To expedite LLaMA-2-70B, we\nuse LLaMA-2-7B as the draft model for them. As shown in\nTable 2, BiTA achieves a speedup of up to 2.7\u00d7, significantly\noutperforming the comparative methods.\nIn addition to comparing with the four speculative decod-\ning methods mentioned above, we also assess BiTA against\na recent study, Medusa [Cai et al., 2023], because of its sim-\nilar motivation to our approach for SAR generation and ver-\nification. We apply BiTA to Vicuna-7B, 13B, and 33B on\nMT-Bench to compare the speedup performance reported in\nMedusa. Figure 7 demonstrates that our method outperforms\nMedusa with an improvement ranging from 19\u223c32% across\nvarious base models (though it is important to note that the\ngap between the two methods may not be entirely reliable due\nto potential differences in experimental settings). We attribute\nthe superiority of our method to its powerful bi-directional\ntuning, where mask tokens can capture a richer feature context\nduring the forward pass. Furthermore, the simultaneous gener-\nation and verification strategy contribute to the acceleration as\nwell.\nAcceleration methods in LLaMA-2\n7B\n70B\nHF AssistGen [Joao Gante, 2023]\n-\n1.53\nSpecDec [Leviathan et al., 2023]\n-\n1.79\nSelf-SpecDec [Zhang et al., 2023]\n1.11\n1.15\nLookahead [Fu et al., 2023]\n1.70\n1.22\nBiTA (ours)\n2.38\n2.72\nTable 2: Comparison of speedup between BiTA and speculative\ndecoding based acceleration approaches on MT-Bench.\n3.0\nVicuna-7B\nVicuna-33B\nVicuna-13B\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n1.0\u00d7\n1.94\u00d7\n2.47\u00d7\n1.0\u00d7\n1.92\u00d7\n2.54\u00d7\n1.0\u00d7\n1.97\u00d7\n2.35\u00d7\nVanilla\nMedusa\nBiTA (ours)\nFigure 7: A comparison on MT-Bench between Medusa and BiTA\nusing greedy sampling. The reported Medusa speedup is considered.\n4.3\nAblation Study\nImpact of Prompting Design\nTo validate effectiveness of the bi-directional tuning design,\nwe explore the impact of various prompting designs, includ-\ning no prompting, shallow prompt tuning, and deep prompt\ntuning. The comparative experiments are conducted using\nLLaMA-2-7B for conversation (CIP) and code (HumanEval-\nX) generation tasks. As indicated in Table 3, we observe a\nprogressive speedup gain. When utilizing only mask tokens\nfor future prediction, a significantly lower speedup (1.94\u00d7\non CIP and 2.12\u00d7 on HumanEval-X) is observed. However,\nwhen adding prompt tokens as learnable soft embeddings in\nthe input sequence [Lester et al., 2021], referred to as shallow\nprompt tuning, the speedup performance improves slightly\n(+0.07 on CIP and +0.19 on HumanEval-X), but it falls short\nof the level achieved with bi-directional tuning (2.29\u00d7 on CIP\nand 2.73\u00d7 on HumanEval-X), where soft prompt tuning is\napplied in every transformer block.\nSpeedup vs. Prompt Tokens\nObviously, using more prompt tokens involves more trainable\nmodel parameters, resulting in a slight increase in computa-\ntional complexity during inference. We explore the influence\nof the number of prompt tokens to understand its influence\non speed. Our investigation focuses on LLaMA-2-7B across\nfour datasets: XSum, MT-Bench, CIP, and HumanEval-X. In\nFigure 8, we observe that the speedup approximately increases\nwith the number of used prompt tokens, consistently across all\nfour datasets, and reaches saturation at 16. Interestingly, the\nspeedup with 8\u223c64 prompt tokens is not significantly differ-\nent. This highlights that through bi-directional tuning, once\na specific threshold number of learnable deep prompt embed-\ndings are incorporated, AR models can be effectively adapted\ninto an SAR style.\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n32\n64\n2\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n2.6\n2.7\n2.8\nXSum\nMT-Bench\nCIP\nHumanEval-X\nSpeedup vs. Prompt Tokens\nnum of prompt tokens\nSpeedup\nFigure 8: Speedup vs. the number of prompt tokens.

Various dataset\nspeedups are represented by distinct markers, with LLaMA-2-7B as\nthe base model.\nSpeedup vs. Mask Tokens\nIncreasing the number of mask tokens provides more draft to-\nken candidates, enhancing the potential to generate additional\noutput tokens for SAR decoding in a single forward step. How-\never, a higher number of draft candidates introduces heavier\ncomputational overhead, slowing down model inference. An\nablation study explores the impact of varying the number of\nmasked tokens, as presented in Figure 9. The experiments are\nconducted using LLaMA-2-7B. The observation of speedup\nacross four datasets indicates that choosing 3 or 4 mask tokens\nachieves a favorable trade-off between SAR decoding capacity\nand computational overhead. Thus, through exhaustive ex-\nperimental search, we set the number of mask tokens to 3 for\nmodels with no more than 13 billion parameters and to 4 for\nlarger models, aiming for the highest speedup across diverse\ngeneration tasks.\nSuperiority of Efficient Tree-based Decoding\nAs explained in Section 3.2, we develop the efficient tree-\nbased decoding starting from a straightforward simplified de-\nDifferent Prompting\nCIP\nHumanEval-X\nmask tokens only\n1.94\n2.12\n+ shallow prompt tokens\n2.01 (+0.07)\n2.31 (+0.19)\nbi-directional tuning\n2.29 (+0.35)\n2.73 (+0.61)\nTable 3: Speedup achieved with different prompting designs on CIP\nand HumanEval-X, using LLaMA-2-7B as the base model.\nDecoding Method\nXSum\nMT-Bench\nStraightforward Decoding\n1.63\n1.82\nFully Tree-based Decoding (k = 1)\n1.81\n2.04\nFully Tree-based Decoding (k = 2)\n2.02\n2.23\nFully Tree-based Decoding (k = 3)\n1.97\n2.05\nFully Tree-based Decoding (k = 4)\n1.69\n1.64\nEfficient Tree-based Decoding (ours)\n2.19\n2.38\nTable 4: Speedup achieved with various decoding method on XSum\nand MT-Bench, using LLaMA-2-7B as the base model.

To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nmethod, we compare the efficient tree-based decoding with the\nstraightforward decoding and the conventional fully tree-based\ndecoding. The speedup achieved with different decoding meth-\nods based on LLaMA-2-7B is presented in Table 4. For fully\ntree-based decoding, we conducted a comprehensive explo-\nration of the number k for the top-k predictions in each mask\ntoken, as draft candidates. The speedup results indicate that\ndecoding with an efficient token tree consistently outperforms\ndecoding with a fully token tree in all cases of k on both XSum\nand MT-Bench, surpassing the straightforward decoding with\nan improvement exceeding 30%.\n5\nConclusion\nWe present a novel method named BiTA for achieving lossless\nacceleration in LLMs. To reduce transformer calls in au-\ntoregressive LLMs during inference, BiTA seamlessly adapts\nexisting AR models for an SAR generation style through the\nproposed bi-directional tuning, utilizing very limited train-\nable parameters. Based on the tree-based efficient decoding\nstrategy, the model conducts streamlined generation and ver-\nification simultaneously. These two features of BiTA jointly\ncontribute to expediting LLMs without altering the original\noutputs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate a remark-\nable speedup ranging from 2.1\u00d7 to 3.3\u00d7 across LLMs of\nvarious sizes and diverse generation tasks. Furthermore, due\nto its flexible prompting design, BiTA serve as a plug-and-play\ntechnique applicable to any publicly available LLMs for ac-\nceleration, which is of great significance in resource-limited\nscenarios and real-time applications.\nReferences\n[Almazrouei et al., 2023] Ebtesam\nAlmazrouei,\nHamza\nAlobeidli, Abdulaziz Alshamsi, Alessandro Cappelli,\nRuxandra Cojocaru, M\u00b4erouane Debbah, \u00b4Etienne Goffinet,\nDaniel Hesslow, Julien Launay, Quentin Malartic, et al.\nThe falcon series of open language models. arXiv preprint\narXiv:2311.16867, 2023.\n[Brown et al., 2020] Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ry-\nder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal,\nArvind Neelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda\nAskell, et al.

The SFT training datasets\nutilized are enumerated in Table 5. It is important to note that only the questions, also referred to as \u201cqueries\u201d or \u201cinstructions,\u201d\nfrom these datasets are utilized. These questions are standardized through predefined prompt templates and are then input into\nthe LLM intended for acceleration. The answers generated through greedy sampling serve as the ground truth, employed in the\ntraining procedure. For efficiency purposes, the LLM is deployed in the Text Generation Inference (TGI) framework.\nThe employed prompt templates are outlined in Table 6. We utilize two types of prompt templates for both LLaMA-2 based\nmodels and Vicuna based models, accommodating different use cases. The distinction between the two templates lies in whether\nto incorporate system information. Consequently, a single question is input into both templates, leading to the generation of two\ndistinct answers. In the case of Falcon, a sole prompt template suffices, as recommended by Falcon\u2019s Hugging Face community\nfor simplicity. Following the generation of training data, the questions and answers, along with their corresponding prompt\ntemplates, constitute training samples. Due to the quantity of questions utilized, there are approximately 300k training samples\nper training epoch for LLaMA-2 and Vicuna, whereas only 150k for Falcon. To ensure consistency in model training, we opt for\na straightforward approach of doubling the training epochs (i.e. 4 \u2192 8) for Falcon.\nDataset\n# Sample\nDescription\nLIMA\n1,029\ncarefully curated high-quality data\nAlpaca-GPT4\n52,002\ninstruction-following data generated by GPT-4\nCodeAlpaca\n20,022\ninstruction-following code data\nOpenPlatypus\n24,926\na curated dataset derived from 11 open-source datasets, with a focus on STEM and logic\nCIP (train set)\n257,999\na conversational dataset spanning various domains\nTable 5: Statistics of the SFT datasets associated with the training data generation.

As depicted in Figure 10, during the first forward pass, we utilize\nthe original input token sequence, commonly referred to as \u201cqueries,\u201d along with the embeddings of n mask tokens as input.\nThus, each mask token predicts the logits of the next token in the corresponding positions. The top k predictions for each mask\ntoken are selected as draft candidates, which are then constructed into an efficient token tree, as detailed in Section 3.2 of the\nmain text. In the subsequent forward pass, the draft candidate token tree is flattened along its depth and appended to the current\ninput token sequence which comprises the original input tokens and the newly generated tokens. For each draft candidate and the\nlast token of the current input sequence, a mask token group is prepared, consisting of n mask tokens for predicting their future\ntokens. This ensures that if a token is the last accepted token in this step, its future tokens will generate the draft candidates for\nthe next forward step.\nWe employ the tree-based attention mechanism outlined in Section 3.2 of the main text to maintain the relevant context within\nthe flattened input token sequence. In addition, Algorithm 1, presented alongside the illustration of input token sequences, details\nthe efficient tree-based decoding process as described in Section 3.2.\n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\nLLMs\n?\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M] for  ? \nn\nInput sequence (t = 1)\n \n<s>\nHave\nyou\nheard\nabout\nLLMs\n?\n,\n!\n</s>\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nhave\nread\nam\nread\nhad\nsome\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\ndraft candidates\n[M] for  some \n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M] for  Yeah \n[M] for  , \nn \u00d7 (n \u00d7 k + 1)\nInput sequence (t = 2)\nYeah\nn \u00d7 k\n,\n!\n</s>\nhave\nread\nam\nread\nhad\nsome\nI\nthey\nLLMs\nTop k\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\n[M]\nFigure 10: A concrete illustration depicting input token sequences during the initial two forward passes in the efficient tree-based decoding.\nThere are 4 mask tokens in each mask token group (denoted as n = 4), and the top 3 predictions are chosen as draft candidates (denoted as\nk = 3).

    "text": "Orion-14B: Open-source Multilingual\nLarge Language Models\nOrionStar Inc.\u2217\nAbstract\nIn this study, we introduce Orion-14B, a collection of multilingual large language\nmodels with 14 billion parameters. We utilize a data scheduling approach to train a\nfoundational model on a diverse corpus of 2.5 trillion tokens, sourced from texts\nin English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other languages. Additionally, we\nfine-tuned a series of models tailored for conversational applications and other\nspecific use cases. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Orion-14B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. We make the Orion-\n14B model family and its associated code publicly accessible1, aiming to inspire\nfuture research and practical applications in the field.\n1\nIntroduction\nThree hundreds years ago, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\u2019s insightful declaration that \"Language is the\nmirror of the mind\" profoundly resonates in the contemporary exploration of language. This thought\nprovides a philosophical foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between language\nand intelligence. In the 20th century, language modeling (LM) became a fundamental approach in\nartificial intelligence, forming the cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP). The goal of\nlanguage modeling is to learn the probability distribution of word sequences. Desipite its simple\nmodeling procedure, it encapsulates substantial information about languages. Given that a language\ncontains N words, the potential number of word sequences of the length of L is N L. However, the\nactual number of sentences commonly used in the language is far fewer than N L. This discrepancy\nhighlights how language models effectively encode linguistic information.\nTraditionally, statistical methods were employed to model word frequency in a language. Among\nthese, the N-gram model has been widely adopted, determining the probability of a word based\non the previous N \u2212 1 words. Though straightforward and efficient, the method suffers from the\ndata sparsity problem. With the advancement of neural networks, a paradigm shift occurred towards\nemploying neural networks for language modeling. There are many variations of neural language\nmodels, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (Bengio et al., 2000), recurrent neural networks (RNN)\n(Mikolov et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2013), and transformer (Devlin et al., 2019; Vaswani et al., 2017).\nIn recent years, the increase of model sizes and the scale of training data have significantly boosted\nthe capability of language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018). Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable promise in many traditional NLP tasks, such\nas dialogue system, machine translation, information retrieval. Moreover, LLMs have proven adept\nat complex tasks such as reasoning, code generation, creative writing. These advancements have\ninspired both the academic and industrial sectors to further investigate the underlying principles and\npotential applications of LLMs.\nThe launch of ChatGPT/GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022a) in 2022 captured tremendous attention from the\npublic, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve and motivating researchers and engineers to\n\u2217Authors are listed in Appendix A.\n1https://github.com/OrionStarAI/Orion\narXiv:2401.12246v1  [cs.CL]  20 Jan 2024\ndelve deeper into their potential. While GPT-3.5 and its successor, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2022b), are prime\nexamples of LLMs, their specific model architectures and training methodologies remain undisclosed.\nIn contrast, Meta\u2019s release of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) and LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b)\nhave established a widely-recognized LLM architecture within the open-source community, with\nnumerous libraries adopting these models. Despite LLaMA\u2019s impressive performance, its primary\nfocus on English limits its applicability to other languages. Recently, there has been a surge in the\nrelease of multilingual LLMs such as ChatGLM (THUDM, 2023), Baichuan (Baichuan, 2023a,b),\nQwen (Bai et al., 2023a), InternLM (InternLM, 2023), XVERSE (Yuanxiang, 2023), Skywork (Wei\net al., 2023) and Yi (01-ai, 2023). These models, trained on mainly English and Chinese datasets,\nhave shown promising results in tasks involving both English and Chinese. Additionally, there has\nbeen a growing trend of LLMs specifically designed to enhance performance in other languages,\nsuch as Japanese (Kojima, 2023; Lee et al., 2023b; Preferred Networks, 2023; Sasaki et al., 2023)and\nKorean (Kim et al., 2021; Ko et al., 2023a).\nIn this technical report, we present Orion-14B, a family of multilingual language models with 14\nbillion parameters. The foundation model is trained on a diverse dataset of 2.5 trillion (2.5T) tokens,\ncontaining languages such as English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and others. It has demonstrated\nsuperior performance across a broad spectrum of tasks in multilingual settings.\nWe also provides a series of fine-tuned models built upon the foundation model, each trained\nto different focuses such as conversation, long-context text handling, quantization, and specific\napplication requirements.\nThe remainder of this report describes our data preparation (Section 2), pretraining methodology\n(Section 3), fine-tuning methodology (Section 4), evaluation results (Section 5), extension works\n(Section 6), and conclusions (Section 7).\n2\nData\nIn the training framework of LLMs, the role of data is crucial in determining the efficacy and\nperformance of these models. Effective data processing for pretraining is essential for achieving the\ndesired outcomes. This involves acquiring data from diverse sources, ensuring the high quality of the\ndata through thorough filtering, and removing any redundant information. This section will discuss\nthese processes in detail, outlining the necessary steps to prepare and refine data to suit the stringent\nrequirements of LLM training.\n2.1\nData Source\nPretraining of LLM needs tremendous amounts of data. Hoffmann et al. (2022) offered guildlines\nregarding the optimal quantity of training data for models of varying sizes. For example, an LLM with\n10 billion parameters requires 205 billion tokens for pretraining. However, recent work (Baichuan,\n2023b; Touvron et al., 2023b; Wei et al., 2023) in training 10 billion parameter models have utilized\n2.5 to 3 trillion tokens, substantially exceeding the recommended data volume. These efforts have\nyielded notably impressive results, demonstrating the efficacy of training with significantly larger\ndatasets than those proposed in the aforementioned study.\nIn order to obtain such a large amount of data, it is imperative to collect data from multitude of\nsources with diversity and high quality. Our dataset incorporates texts in multiple languages, with\nEnglish and Chinese being predominant, constituting over 90% of the entire dataset. Particular efforts\nare also made to include Japanese and Korean texts, which account for more than 5% of the dataset.\nThe remaining portion comprises texts in various other languages, such as Spanish, French, German,\nArabic, and more.\nIn terms of content and style, the dataset primarily composes of written language, with spoken\nlanguage constituting only a minor portion. The dataset spans a broad spectrum of topics, including\nweb pages, news articles, encyclopedic entries, books, source code, and academic publications,\namong others. The diversity within the dataset is a crucial factor in achieving superior performance\nacross a range of tasks. The detailed distribution of the data sources is shown in Fig. 1. We believe\nthat different types of corpora exert varying influences on the model training process; for instance,\nsome may be more effective to language understanding, while others better facilitate knowledge\nreasoning. Unlike many existing studies that typically employ random shuffling of training examples,\n2\nwe strategically feeds the model with varied data sources across different training stages. We believe\nthis method leads to more efficient data usage. The details of this approach will be elaborated in\nSection 3.\nFigure 1: Data sources distribution.\n2.2\nData Quality\nData quality is essential in the training of LLMs. To assure high-quality data, we have implemented a\nseries of measures for data filtering, detailed as follows:\n\u2022 Text normalization: The datasets contain a large number of texts from various sources, such\nas web pages and ebooks. These texts are often accompanied by HTML, special characters,\nor other format tags, which are not useful for LLM training. We employ a series of tools,\nsuch as regular expressions and format parsers, to effectively eliminate them.\n\u2022 Harmful content removal: The Internet contains harmful and spam content. Our approach\nto mitigate this involves a two-stage process: the initial stage utilizes keywords and regular\nexpressions matching, followed by a deep learning-based model designed to identify and\nremove such content. It is important to note that entirely eliminating harmful text from the\ntraining dataset could lead to a scenario where the trained model lacks the ability to identify\nand appropriately response to harmful information (Touvron et al., 2023b). Therefore, we\nintentionally retain a minimal amount of harmful text in the dataset. This approach ensures\nthat the model remains capable of recognizing and effectively addressing such content.\n\u2022 Personal information removal: Some of the text data includes personal details like names,\nphone numbers, and addresses. We utilize rule-based methods for detection and either\nsubstitute these with placeholders or remove them entirely.\n\u2022 Quality filtering: This part is crucial in data processing. We first apply a set of rules to filter\nthe data, such as removing texts with excessive repetition. Additionally, we use N-gram\nperplexity models to exclude texts with anomalously high perplexity. Lastly, our proprietary\ndata quality models are employed to select high-quality data. We emphasize that while\nhigh quality is essential for LLM training, achieving a balance between quality and quantity\nof training data is a non-trivial task. Our models are optimized to retain as much data as\npossible while maintaining high data quality, which is one of the key factors in the successful\ntraining of LLMs.\n3\n2.3\nDeduplication\nGiven that the training data for LLMs is sourced from a variety of origins, there is a significant\nlikelihood of encountering duplicate data. Duplicate data can detrimentally affect the training process,\npotentially leading to a model biased towards certain data sources and a decline in performance (Lee\net al., 2021; Nunes et al., 2023; Penedo et al., 2023). To address this, we develop a deduplication\nprocedure to eliminate redundant data.\nIn this process, we extract key words and phrases from each document and compute their correspond-\ning embedding vectors and SimHash vectors (Charikar, 2002; Indyk and Motwani, 1998). These\nvectors are then compared to those in our database. If a vector in the database shows similarity within\na certain threshold, the document is considered a duplicate and is subsequently discarded.\nImportantly, we note that while LLMs have shown significant advancements in numerous NLP tasks,\nsome studies (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) indicate that part\nof this improvement might be attributed to unintentional inclusion of evaluation data in the training\ndatasets, potentially leading to overestimated results. To address this, we adopt our deduplication\napproach for all evaluation datasets to prevent the pretraining dataset from containing texts in the\nevaluation sets, thereby enhancing the integrity and reliability of our model\u2019s evaluation results. We\nwill further discuss the data contamination in detail in Section 5.3.\n3\nPretraining\n3.1\nTokenizer\nA tokenizer is a basic component of an LLM, which need to represent the text distribution in the\nlanguage while maintaining an favorable vocabulary size for training. For a multilingual tokenizer,\nstatistical methods are typically employed to generate word-level or subword-level tokens from texts\nin multiple languages. We utilize the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Shibata et al., 1999),\nimplemented via SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). Our configuration ensures a character\ncoverage of 99.99%, with rare characters defaulting to UTF-8 bytes. To build a diverse corpus and\nalign with our training data distribution, we curate a broad spectrum of text types from our training\ncorpus. This includes English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, a few other\nlanguages, as well as rare characters. In Table 1, we provide a detailed comparison of our tokenizer\nwith other open-source tokenizers. This comparison includes vocabulary size and compression ratio\n(CR), the latter calculated by the ratio of the size of the original data to the size of the tokenized data.\nTable 1: Tokenizer comparison with other open-source LLMs. We compare vocabulary sizes\nand compression ratios for simpifiled Chinese (zh_cn), tranditional Chinese (zh_cn), and English,\nrespectively.\nModel\nVocab Size\nCR (zh_cn)\nCR (zh_tw)\nCR (en)\nLLaMA2\n32,000\n1.377\n1.589\n1.153\nYi\n64,000\n0.606\n0.785\n1.084\nBaichuan2\n125,696\n0.554\n0.783\n1.077\nChatGLM3\n65,024\n0.582\n0.703\n1.081\nSkywork\n65,519\n0.672\n0.846\n1.153\nOrion-14B\n84,608\n0.549\n0.656\n1.067\n3.2\nArchitecture\nGiven that LLaMA2 has achieved superior performance, its architecture has been widely adopted by\nmany open-source LLM. In our approach, we adhere to the LLaMA2 architecture while implementing\nseveral modifications. These include extending the number of tokens to 84,608 and enlarging the\ndimensions of the feed-forward network (FFN) to 15,360. We employ rotary positional embeddings\n(RoPE) (Su et al., 2021) for positional encoding to accommodate context lengths of up to 4096 tokens.\nThe model uses 40 transformer layers with 40 attention heads each. The total parameter of the model\nis 14.4 billion, slightly exceeding that of LLaMA2-13B. Detailed model parameters is provided in\nTable 2.\n4\nTable 2: A comparison of model architecture.

To optimize training efficiency,\nwe integrated FlashAttention2 (Dao, 2023) and APEX (NVIDIA, 2023) into Megatron-LM framework,\nachieving a training speed of 4,000-5,000 tokens/GPU/second.\n3.4\nTraining Process\nTo train Orion-14B, we initiate the model training with a learning rate warm-up stage spanning 2000\niterations, during which we linearly increase the learning rate to the maximal learning rate of 3e-4.\nWe then apply a cosine schedule to gradually decrease the learning rate to 3e-5 throughout the training\nprocessing. We employ the AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018) optimizer, setting \u03b21 to 0.9 and\n\u03b22 to 0.95, respectively. In addition, we apply a weigh decay factor of 0.1 and enforce a gradient\nclipping threshold of 1.0 to ensure the stability of the training process. The model is trained using\nBF16/FP32 mixed precision, with a batch size of 1408, corresponding to approximately 5.7 million\ntokens per step.\n3.5\nData Scheduling\nTraining large language models requires hundreds of billions to trillions of tokens. It is an interesting\narea to explore scaling laws in LLM training and literature from Kaplan et al. (2020) through\nHoffmann et al. (2022) to Touvron et al. (2023b) suggests that model training tends to favor an\nincrease in the number of tokens over model sizes. We use a 2.5T token training dataset for our 14B\nparameter model, aiming a balance between computational efficiency and cost.\nOn the other side, while numerous theoretical and empirical studies have examined the interplay\nbetween model size and training data volume, there is no universally accepted methodology for\nscheduling training data. Considering that humans acquire knowledge in a deliberate order (Evanson\net al., 2023), it is plausible that language models might also benefit from a structured learning order\nwhen processing training data. Curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) has been suggested as a\nmethod to organize the learning process by progressively increasing the complexity of the training\ndata. However, most prior studies have concentrated on sample-level data and smaller datasets. Chen\net al. (2023) employed a skills-based framework for training data selection and continuous pretraining\nwith a 3B-parameter language model. This approach achieved greater accuracy compared to the\nbaseline method of uniform data source sampling, suggesting the potential efficacy of strategic data\nscheduling.\nIn training the Orion-14B model, we intentionally develop a data scheduling strategy that organizes\ntraining data to incrementally increase its complexity. We divide the training data into several stages\nbased on the data sources and their complexity. These stages are differentiated by the mix ratios\nof data sources. Initial stages primarily include data with common knowledge, such as web pages\nand news articles. In the subsequent stages, we gradually augment the proportion of data containing\nmore complex knowledge, including textbooks, academic papers, and source code. Additionally,\nthe linguistic diversity of the training data is expanded progressively from English and Chinese to\nJapanese and Korean. The brief structure of our training data schedule is depicted in Table 3.\nTo assess the effectiveness of the data scheduling approach, we monitor the loss on a validation set\nthroughout the training process. This validation set consists of 5,000 documents, each unseen in the\n5\nTable 3: Training data schedule for Orion-14B. Primary data sources and languages refer to data that\ntotally account for more than 90% of the whole training data in each stage.\nStages\nTokens (B)\nPrimary data sources\nPrimary languages\nEarly stages\n0 ~600\nweb pages, news articles\nEnglish, Chinese\nMiddle stages\n600 ~1100\nweb pages, news articles, textbooks,\nacademic papers\nEnglish, Chinese, Others\nFinal stages\n1100 ~2000\nweb pages, news articles, textbooks,\nacademic papers, source code\nEnglish, Chinese, Others\ntraining set. It includes a diverse collection of English and Chinese texts sourced from a variety of\ndata sources. As shown in Fig. 2, there are significant reduction in validation loss aligning with shifts\nin the training data distribution at 600B and 1,100B tokens. Additionally, the validation loss exhibits\ninitial fluctuations, stabilizing progressively with continued training. This trend indicates that the\nmodel increasingly adapts to the diversity of data types as training progresses.\nFigure 2: Validation loss during the training process. The validation set consists of 5,000 documents\nincluding a diverse collection of English and Chinese texts sourced from a variety of data sources.\nTo our knowledge, the training of most prior LLMs utilized fully shuffling the training data, which\nwas then fed into the model in a random sequence. Orion-14B is the first LLM trained with a specific\ndata scheduling strategy. The evaluation results indicate that this model demonstrates impressive\nperformance in language understanding tasks at its early stages and rapidly enhances its capabilities\nin reasoning and academic tasks in later stages, aligning with our data scheduling policy. Notably,\nOrion-14B, trained on 2.5T tokens, achieves comparable performance to other open-source models\ntrained on 2.6T to 3T tokens, thereby illustrating the efficiency of our data utilization approach.\n4\nFine-tuning\nDuring the pretraining stage, an LLM is trained to predict the next token at each step. However,\nin many applications, the model needs to generate a desired response to a given prompt. Thus, in\nthe next stage, LLMs typically undergo further fine-tuning using supervised learning, where the\ntraining data consists of paired input and output text sequences. Further, to enhance the quality and\nsafety, approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al.,\n2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) can be\nemployed. In this work, our primary focus is on the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, leaving\nRLHF and DPO for future exploration.\n4.1\nSFT Data\nHigh-quality, diverse data has been proven to be crucial to supervised fine-tuning in previous studies\n(Touvron et al., 2023b; Zhou et al., 2023). To construct our SFT training data, we draw from two\nprimary sources: a human-labeled dataset and an open-source filtered dataset.\n6\nFor a high-quality human-labeled dataset, we assemble a team of expert annotators who spend\nweeks creating precisely annotated data. To ensure data quality, all annotators adhere to three\nkey principles\u2014helpfulness, truthfulness, and harmlessness\u2014as outlined in InstructGPT (Ouyang\net al., 2022) and LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). In total, we produce approximately 220,000\nhuman-labeled SFT data entries.\nWhile the human-labeled dataset is of high quality, its volume is insufficient for training a high-\nperformance LLM. Therefore, we also construct a large-scale, open-source filtered dataset. The\noriginal SFT data includes collections from various open-source datasets, such as COIG (Zhang\net al., 2023a), WildChat (Wenting Zhao, 2023), OpenOrca (Lian et al., 2023), and UltraChat (Ding\net al., 2023). Given the variable quality and occasional presence of inappropriate content in these\nopen-source datasets, we implement a cleaning process inspired by methods from Platypus (Lee et al.,\n2023a) and MoDS (Du et al., 2023), comprising the following steps:\n\u2022 Rule-based filtering: We use regular expressions and keywords for simple filtering to remove\npersonal information, temporal-sensitive data, etc.\n\u2022 Quality filtering: A large NLP model scores the data quality on a scale from 1 to 10, retaining\nonly data with a score of 7 or higher.\n\u2022 Semantic deduplication: Text embeddings are used for semantic deduplication, considering\ntexts with a similarity greater than 0.98 as duplicates.\nUsing this approach, we construct an open-source filtered dataset of 630,000 samples. Combined\nwith the human-labeled data, we assemble an SFT dataset of 850,000 training pairs for supervised\nfine-tuning.\n4.2\nTraining details\nTo fine-tune a pretrained LLM, we prepend <human> and <assistant> as headers to the prompt\ntext and the response text, respectively. The training process employs the AdamW optimizer, with\nhyperparameters configured as follows: \u03b21 is set to 0.9, \u03b22 to 0.95, and \u03f5 to 1e \u2212 8. We limit the\nsequence length to 4096 and use a batch size of 128. Our training regimen spanned three epochs,\ninvolving over 500k samples; the learning rate was incrementally increased over the first 1,500 steps\nto a maximum of 1e \u2212 5. To prevent overfitting, we apply a weight decay of 0.1, a dropout rate of\n0.1, and a gradient clipping threshold of 1.0.\n5\nEvaluation\n5.1\nStandard Evaluation\nTo effectively evaluate the LLM, we categorize the standard evaluation sets into the examinations and\nprofessional knowledge, and language understanding and common knowledge. We select the most\ncommon evaluation sets in each category as follows:\nProfessional Knowledge and Reasoning\n\u2022 C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023): A comprehensive Chinese evaluation benchmark consisting of\nmore than 10,000 multi-choice questions.\n\u2022 CMMLU (Li et al., 2023): A general evaluation benchmark specifically designed to evaluate\nthe knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs within the context of Chinese language and\nculture.\n\u2022 MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020): A widely used benchmark designed to measure knowledge\nacquired during pretraining by evaluating models.\n\u2022 AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023): A human-centric benchmark crafted to assess the general\ncapabilities of foundation models in tasks aligned with human cognition and problem-\nsolving.\n\u2022 Gaokao (Zhang et al., 2023b): A dataset leverages questions from China\u2019s national college\nentrance examination to test LLMs.\n7\n\u2022 BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022): A challenging subset of the Big-Bench suite, covering a wide\narray of themes, such as linguistics, mathematics, common sense reasoning, biology, physics,\nsoftware development, and more.\nLanguage Understanding and Common Knowledge\n\u2022 RACE (Lai et al., 2017): A comprehensive reading comprehension dataset comprising\nover 28,000 passages and nearly 100,000 questions. It contains reading and comprehension\nmaterials for both middle school (middle) and high school (high) academic levels.\n\u2022 HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019): A challenge dataset for evaluating commonsense language\ninference that is particularly difficult for state-of-the-art models.\n\u2022 PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020): A dataset introducing the task of physical commonsense reasoning\nand a corresponding benchmark dataset.\n\u2022 Lambada (Paperno et al., 2016): A collection of narrative passages where human subjects\ncan guess the last word if exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last\nsentence preceding the target word.\n\u2022 WSC (Levesque et al., 2012): A pronoun disambiguation task, which requires determining\nthe noun that the pronoun refers to according to the context.\nFor comparison, we select the most popular LLMs with a parameter range of 10-20 billion: LLaMA\n2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023b), Skywork-13B (Wei et al., 2023), Baichuan 2-13B (Baichuan, 2023b),\nQwen-14B (Bai et al., 2023a), InternLM (InternLM, 2023).\nTo ensure consistent comparisons, we employ open-source LLM evaluation frameworks such as\nOpenCompass (Contributors, 2023) and LM-Eval-Harness (Gao et al., 2021) for a unified perfor-\nmance evaluation of LLMs. For the models we compared, we refer to the published scores from\nOpenCompass or their official reports.\nTable 4: LLM evaluation results on examination and professional knowledge.

While it excels in most benchmarks, it is\nslightly outperformed by Qwen-14B in the Gaokao evaluation. These results position Orion-14B as a\nhighly competitive and robust model for complex and professional tasks.\nTable 5: LLM evaluation results on language understanding and common knowledge.\nModel\nRACE-middle\nRACE-high\nHellaSwag\nPIQA\nLambada\nWSC\nLLaMA 2-13B\n63.0\n58.9\n77.5\n79.8\n76.5\n66.3\nSkywork-13B\n87.6\n84.1\n73.7\n78.3\n71.8\n66.3\nBaichuan 2-13B\n68.9\n67.2\n70.8\n78.1\n74.1\n65.4\nQwen-14B\n93.0\n90.3\n80.2\n79.8\n71.4\n66.3\nInternLM-20B\n86.4\n83.3\n78.1\n80.3\n71.8\n68.3\nOrion-14B\n93.2\n91.3\n78.5\n79.5\n78.8\n70.2\nAs shown in Table 5, Orion-14B showcases robust performance in language understanding and\ncommon knowledge tasks, outperforming other models in RACE (mid and high), Lambada, and\nWSC benchmarks, highlighting its exceptional comprehension and reasoning abilities. However, for\n8\nHellaSwag, PIQA, and WSC tasks, it is slightly outperformed by Qwen-14B and InternLM-20B.\nOverall, the results indicate Orion-14B\u2019s strong capabilities across a spectrum of natural language\nunderstanding benchmarks.\nFor a comprehensive evaluation, we also utilize all test sets used in OpenCompass leaderboard\n(Contributors, 2023) to assess performance. In OpenCompass leaderboard, the evaluation sets are\norganized into five categories. The summarized results for each category are shown in Table 6, where\nOrion-14B leads with an average score of 64.4%. Notably, it outperforms other models across four\ncategories, including Examination, Language, Understanding, and Reasoning, indicating its excellent\nanalytical and problem-solving abilities. These results demonstrate Orion-14B\u2019s robust capabilities\nin a wide range of cognitive and language tasks. Detailed results for each testset are included in the\nAppendix B.\nTable 6: LLM evaluation results of OpenCompass testsets\nModel\nAverage\nExamination\nLanguage\nKnowledge\nUnderstanding\nReasoning\nLLaMA 2-13B\n47.3\n45.2\n47.0\n58.3\n50.9\n43.6\nSkywork-13B\n53.6\n61.1\n51.3\n52.7\n64.5\n45.2\nBaichuan 2-13B\n49.4\n51.8\n47.5\n48.9\n58.1\n44.2\nQwen-14B\n62.4\n71.3\n52.7\n56.1\n68.8\n60.1\nInternLM-20B\n59.4\n62.5\n55.0\n60.1\n67.3\n54.9\nOrion-14B\n64.3\n71.4\n55.0\n60.0\n71.9\n61.6\nNote that, evaluation scores are not the definitive standard for assessing an LLM. Given the vast\namount of training data, there is a high likelihood that the dataset includes elements of the evaluation\nset. To avoid this, we purposely deduplicate the evaluation datasets from our pretraining corpus,\nthereby ensuring that our model\u2019s performance genuinely reflects its capabilities. Overlooking this\ncritical step could lead to training a model that is overfitted to the evaluation set, resulting in artificially\nhigh scores. We will delve into this topic more deeply in Section 5.3.\n5.2\nMultilingual\nIn our training approach, while the majority of the data is in English and Chinese, we also incorporate\nadditional languages to enhance multilingual performance. Notably, Japanese and Korean texts\nare specifically added after surpassing 600B tokens in the training process. The total amounts of\nJapanese and Korean texts are approximately 100B and 50B tokens, respectively. Despite the lower\nquantity of Japanese and Korean tokens compared to English and Chinese, the model exhibits superior\nperformance in these languages. This indicates a significant transfer of knowledge from the more\ndominant languages during the training of the LLM.\nTo assess the model\u2019s multilingual capabilities, we benchmark it against other models trained on\nEnglish+Japanese (Kojima, 2023; Lee et al., 2023b; Preferred Networks, 2023; Sasaki et al., 2023),\nEnglish+Korean (Kim et al., 2021; Ko et al., 2023b), or multilingual datasets (01-ai, 2023; Bai et al.,\n2023a; Baichuan, 2023b; Touvron et al., 2023b). We employ the datasets from Gao et al. (2021) and\nKim et al. (2022) for evaluation of Japanese and Korean, respectively.\nTable 7: Comparison of LLM performances on Japanese testsets.

On average, it outperforms all other LLMs in Japanese and Korean datasets, surpassing\neven those models with a greater number of parameters.\nTo gain a clearer insight into the multilingual capabilities, we compute the average scores for the\nevaluation sets in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and English for comparison. The scores for Japanese and\nKorean are derived directly from Tables 7 and 8. For the Chinese and English datasets, we calculate\nthe average scores using the OpenCompass dataset, excluding the mathematics and programming\ntestsets.\nTable 9 demonstrates Orion-14B\u2019s impressive performance in multilingual evaluations. It leads with\ntop scores in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, surpassing other multilingual models. In English,\nOrion-14B is marginally outperformed by Yi-34B, which is an LLM with a significantly higher\nnumber of parameters. This data highlights Orion-14B\u2019s robust proficiency in multiple languages.\n5.3\nAnalysis of Data Contamination\nThe rise of the LLM has led to a surge in the performance of evaluation tasks. Their superior\nperformance is primarily attributed to the massive data consumed by these billion/trillion-parameter\nLLMs during training. However, recent work (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Yang\net al., 2023) has shown that the performance of LLM on many downstream tasks may be inflated due\nto data contamination, i.e., the presence of test data from these downstream tasks in the pretraining\ndata of LLMs.\nAs mentioned above, to prevent the pretraining dataset from containing answers to the evaluation\ndatasets, we apply our deduplication approach using all evaluation datasets. This process removes\ntext similar to the evaluation data from the training corpus. On the other hand, to understand the\ninfluence of such data, we also experiment with training a model using previously deduplicated data.\nSpecifically, we select those data that had been removed due to deduplication with the evaluation set\nbut we do not contain data with the exact same texts as in the evaluation texts. In other words, this\napproach allows us to use data that may be semantically or partially related to the evaluation set while\n10\nexcluding the exact text from it. We compile a smaller dataset of 200B tokens, which includes these\nselected data alongside the regular training data. We then continue the pretraining process with this\n200B token dataset, resulting in a new pretrained model named Orion-14B-Exam. As illustrated in\nthe accompanying table, Orion-14B-Exam demonstrates significantly higher scores on the evaluation\nset compared to the baseline.\nTable 10: Evaluation for data contamination and overfitting.\nModel\nC-Eval\nCMMLU\nMMLU\nLambada\nHellaSwag\nGPT-4\n69.9\n71\n83\n65.5\n91.4\nQwen-72B\n83.3\n61.8\n77.3\n76.1\n85.4\nYi-34B\n81.8\n82.6\n76.3\n73.1\n82\nOrion-14B\n72.9\n70.6\n69.9\n78.8\n78.5\nOrion-14B-Exam\n92.7\n82.9\n85.4\n78.5\n85.8\nThe results in Table 10 reveal that manipulating training data can easily lead to fitting the evaluation\ndataset and achieve very high scores. We conduct an additional experiment to gauge the extent\nof overfitting. Specifically, we gather a collection of recent texts from the Internet, ensuring they\nare unseen in any model\u2019s training set. We then calculate the loss on this new dataset Lunseen and\ncompare it to the loss on texts drawn from the evaluation sets Leval mentioned in Tables 4 and 5,\nincluding C-Eval, MMLU, HellaSwag, and others. The loss differential between these two sets serves\nas an indicator of overfitting\u2014the smaller the difference, the lower the likelihood of overfitting to the\nevaluation set. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 11. This table illustrates that with\nthe inclusion of the new training dataset, there is a significant reduction in the loss on the evaluation\nset, decreasing from 1.87 to 1.44, clearly showing the overfitting on the evaluation set. On the other\nhand, the original Orion-14B model demonstrates consistent losses on both datasets, with a minimal\ndifference as expected, indicating little overfitting levels.\nTable 11: Overfitting analysis of the loss of each model.\nModel\nLunseen\nLeval\n\u2206(Lunseen \u2212 Leval)\nBaichuan2-13B\n2.23\n1.93\n0.30\nQwen-14B\n2.19\n1.73\n0.46\nQwen-72B\n2.05\n1.54\n0.51\nOrion-14B\n2.15\n1.87\n0.28\nOrion-14B-Exam\n2.18\n1.44\n0.74\nIn light of these performance, it is crucial to examine the evaluation methods used in the community\nof LLM. Since it is possible to achieve high scores through specific training tactics, such scores may\nnot accurately reflect the true capabilities of an LLM. An overemphasis on top leaderboard positions\ncan be misleading and does not guarantee actual model proficiency. The principal goal should be to\ndevelop robust, effective LLMs that prove their utility in a wide range of real-world applications.\n5.4\nFine-tuned Model Evaluations\nThe above evaluation utilizes standard evaluation datasets to test the performance of the pretrained\nfoundation model (base-model). On the other hand, evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned\nmodel (chat-model) differs from that of the base-model. This is because the chat-model is designed\nto generate responses to given prompts, and determining the goodness of these responses can\nbe subjective and dependent on the specific task. To comprehensively evaluate the chat-model\u2019s\nperformance, we conduct tests using three different approaches: 1) standard evaluation sets, similar\nto those used in the base-model evaluation; 2) subjective datasets based on GPT-4 scoring; and 3)\nhuman evaluation.\nFor the standard evaluation, we use widely recognized benchmarks, including CMMLU, MMLU,\nBBH, HellaSwag, PIQA, and WSC. As indicated in 12, Orion-14B-chat maintains strong performance\nin HellaSwag, BBH, PIQA, and WSC. However, there is a slight decline in performance on CMMLU\nand MMLU compared to the base model in Tabels 4 and 5. This is likely due to the evaluation prompts\nbeing more designed for the base model than the chat model. Therefore, incorporating subjective\nevaluation methods alongside standard metrics could provide a more comprehensive assessment of\n11\nTable 12: Standard evaluation for chat models.\nModel\nCMMLU\nMMLU\nBBH\nHellaSwag\nPIQA\nWSC\nBaichuan2-13B-Chat\n58.4\n57.0\n49.9\n66.9\n77.6\n71.2\nQwen-14B-Chat\n70.0\n66.4\n58.0\n65.2\n74.0\n66.3\nLLaMA2-13B-Chat\n38.7\n54.6\n40.2\n78.2\n78.8\n68.3\nInternLM-20B-Chat\n52.2\n52.5\n35.3\n69.2\n76.7\n61.5\nOrion-14B-Chat\n63.9\n61.7\n49.1\n76.7\n78.4\n71.2\nthe model\u2019s capabilities.

In MT-Bench evaluation, Orion-14B-Chat significantly outperforms other models,\nachieving the highest scores in both First-Turn and Second-Turn evaluations, with an average score\nof 7.37. In the AlignBench evaluation, Orion-14B-Chat excels notably in Chinese understanding,\nWriting, Role-Playing, and Professional tasks. The results demonstrate competitive performance\nacross diverse conversational contexts.\nAs the chat model is designed to generate responses to prompts, human evaluation is a critical\nmeasure of its effectiveness. Adopting an approach similar to the arena method used in Chatbot Arena\n(LMSYS, 2023), we engage human annotators to assess responses from two models in a randomized\nhead-to-head format. Specifically, for a given prompt, responses generated by two anonymized\nmodels are presented to the annotators, who then rate them as \"Win,\" \"Tie,\" or \"Loss\" based on their\npreference. We have 14 human annotators evaluate a total of 3562 questions. The models compared\nin this arena battle are Orion-14B-Chat, Qwen-14B-Chat, and Baichuan2-13B-Chat. As indicated in\nTable 15, Orion-14B-Chat received the highest number of \"win\" votes, highlighting its exceptional\nperformance in human evaluations.\n6\nExtension Works\nIn practical applications, LLMs have a variety of needs, including extended context handling,\nminimizing inference resource requirement, and adapting to specific applications. To address these\nchallenges, we conduct extension works and develop several specialized models. Below are the\nextensions we have implemented:\n\u2022 Orion-14B-Long: This model is optimized for long context lengths more than 200,000\ntokens and demonstrates performance comparable to proprietary models on long context\nevaluation sets (Bai et al., 2023b; Dacheng Li and Zhang, 2023).\n12\nTable 15: Human arena evaluation for chat models.\nModel\nWin\nTie\nLoss\nOrion-14B-Chat\n1172\n1491\n899\nQwen-14B-Chat\n1101\n1592\n869\nBaichuan2-13B-Chat\n728\n1601\n1233\n\u2022 Orion-14B-INT4: A quantized model utilizing 4-bit integer weights. It significantly reduces\nthe model size by 70% and increases the inference speed by 30% while incurring a minimal\nperformance loss of only 1%.\n\u2022 Orion-14B-RAG: A chat-model fine-tuned on a custom retrieval augmented generation\ndataset, achieving superior performance in retrieval augmented generation tasks.\n\u2022 Orion-14B-PlugIn: A chat-model specifically tailored for plugin and function calling tasks,\nideal for agent-related scenarios where the LLM acts as a plugin and function call system.\nDue to time constraints, this technical report does not cover the training details and evaluations of\nthese models. We make all the above models available for public use. For more information, please\nrefer to our open-source library https://github.com/OrionStarAI/Orion.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this study, we present Orion-14B, a diverse suite of multilingual large language models with 14\nbillion (14B) parameters. This family includes a pretrained base model and a fine-tuned chat model,\nas detailed in this technical report. Additionally, we offer several extensions to Orion-14B, such\nas a long context model, a quantized model, and several application-oriented models, enhancing\nits versatility and applicability. These models have demonstrated competitive performance against\nexisting open-source models in the field of LLMs, positioning Orion-14B as a potential strong\nbaseline for future LLM research.\nTraining a large language model like Orion-14B poses considerable challenges. Throughout this\nendeavor, we faced numerous obstacles and overcame significant hurdles. We responsibly provide\nopen access to the Orion-14B family and documented our experiences and insights in this technical\nreport, aiming to assist and inspire other researchers in the community.\nThe journey of LLMs is more than a technological advancement; it is a continuous dialogue between\nhuman intelligence and artificial intelligence, constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of\nwhat\u2019s possible. As Ludwig Wittgenstein insightfully remarked, \"The limits of my language mean\nthe limits of my world.\" (Wittgenstein, 1922) This interplay of language and machine learning does\nmore than just reflect our existing world; it unlocks pathways to previously uncharted realms of\nunderstanding.\nReferences\n01-ai. https://github.com/01-ai/Yi, 2023.\nJinze Bai, Shuai Bai, Yunfei Chu, Zeyu Cui, Kai Dang, Xiaodong Deng, Yang Fan, Wenbin Ge,\nYu Han, Fei Huang, et al.

Given a single-layer 3D mesh of a clothed human (left), our approach enables Generation of Animatable Layered Assets\nfor 3D garment transfer and avatar customization in any poses by decomposing and inpainting the geometry and texture of each layer with a\npretrained 2D diffusion model in a canonical space.\nAbstract\nWe present GALA, a framework that takes as input a\nsingle-layer clothed 3D human mesh and decomposes it into\ncomplete multi-layered 3D assets. The outputs can then be\ncombined with other assets to create novel clothed human\navatars with any pose. Existing reconstruction approaches\noften treat clothed humans as a single-layer of geometry\nand overlook the inherent compositionality of humans with\nhairstyles, clothing, and accessories, thereby limiting the util-\nity of the meshes for down-stream applications. Decompos-\ning a single-layer mesh into separate layers is a challenging\ntask because it requires the synthesis of plausible geometry\nand texture for the severely occluded regions. Moreover, even\nwith successful decomposition, meshes are not normalized in\nterms of poses and body shapes, failing coherent composition\nwith novel identities and poses. To address these challenges,\n*Equal contribution\nwe propose to leverage the general knowledge of a pretrained\n2D diffusion model as geometry and appearance prior for\nhumans and other assets. We first separate the input mesh\nusing the 3D surface segmentation extracted from multi-view\n2D segmentations. Then we synthesize the missing geometry\nof different layers in both posed and canonical spaces using\na novel pose-guided Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss.\nOnce we complete inpainting high-fidelity 3D geometry, we\nalso apply the same SDS loss to its texture to obtain the com-\nplete appearance including the initially occluded regions.\nThrough a series of decomposition steps, we obtain multiple\nlayers of 3D assets in a shared canonical space normalized\nin terms of poses and human shapes, hence supporting ef-\nfortless composition to novel identities and reanimation with\nnovel poses. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach for decomposition, canonicalization, and\ncomposition tasks compared to existing solutions.\n1\narXiv:2401.12979v1  [cs.CV]  23 Jan 2024\n1. Introduction\nIn the era where social interactions become increasingly\nonline, the ability to customize digital representations of\noneself is more important than ever. This is particularly criti-\ncal in the domain of virtual try-on and photorealistic avatar\ncustomization. However, creating assets that can be easily\nlayered on top of any avatars typically requires substantial\nmanual efforts by artists. Our goal is to enable automatic\ncreation of reusable 3D layered assets that can be effortlessly\ncomposed to any human with any poses.\nUnlike artist-created 3D assets, reconstruction-based 3D\nmodels are getting widely accessible. In addition to online\nmarket places of high-quality 3D scans [5, 64], single-view\nreconstruction methods [4, 69, 70] or text-to-3d generation\ntechniques [13, 45, 62] further simplify the creation of 3D\nmodels. Despite these advancements, using these 3D models\nfor virtual try-on or avatar customization remains an open\nchallenge because these models are typically single-layer\nand not animatable. Different attributes such as hair, cloth-\ning, and accessories are glued into a single triangle mesh,\nand anything beneath the outermost layer is fully occluded.\nMoreover, self-contact regions are also connected, making\nre-animation challenging.\nTo address this, we propose a fully automatic framework\nfor creating compositional layered 3D assets from a single-\nlayer scan. Unlike the existing text-based 3D generation\nmethods [45, 62] that only support the generation of each\nasset in isolation, our approach learns to decompose a mesh\ninto multiple layers and inpaint missing geometry and ap-\npearance for compositing the decomposed assets into novel\nidentities. Our key idea is to complement missing geometric\nand appearance information by leveraging a strong image\nprior built from a large-scale image collections. In particular,\nwe leverage a latent diffusion model [66] that is trained on\nan extremely large corpus of images. Using a score distilla-\ntion sampling (SDS), we inpaint the occluded regions while\nretaining the originally visible regions.\nFor reposing, simply inpainting the geometry and appear-\nance in an input posed space is not sufficient. For garment\ntransfer across different identities with various poses, we\nneed to represent the target asset and the remaining human\nlayer in individual canonical spaces. However, we observe\nthat the vanilla SDS loss often provides poor guidance by\nignoring the target pose information. We address the lack\nof pose-sensitivity in the SDS loss by introducing a pose-\nguided SDS loss. Specifically, we derive the SDS loss with\na pose-conditioned diffusion model [93]. This allows us to\nsupervise the shape and appearance jointly in both posed and\ncanonical spaces. Once we obtain the canonicalized object\nand human layers, we can mix and match with other assets\nto create virtual try-on as shown in Fig. 1. The composite\nresults are further refined with penetration handling.\nAs there is no established benchmark for decomposition,\ncanonicalization, and composition from a single scan, we\nestablish a new evaluation protocol to quantitatively assess\nour approach. For decomposition, our approach significantly\noutperforms recent text-driven 3D editing methods. We also\nshow that the proposed pose-guided SDS enables robust\ncanonicalization even for challenging cases, outperforming\nexisting methods. Lastly, we show garment transfer to create\nnovel avatars only from a collection of single-layer clothed\nhumans. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a new task of multi-layer decomposition and\ncomposition from a single-layer scan, which offers a prac-\ntical compositional asset creation pipeline.\n\u2022 We present a pose-guided SDS loss, enabling the robust\nmodeling of layered clothed humans in a canonical space\nfor garment transfer and reposing from a single scan.\n\u2022 We provide a comprehensive analysis of generating ani-\nmatable layered assets from a single scan with a newly\nestablished evaluation protocol. We will release code for\nbenchmarking future research on this novel task.\n2. Related Work\nClothed Human Modeling. 3D parametric human mod-\nels [35, 47, 60, 86] have been proposed to model diverse\nposes and shapes of humans, allowing us to reconstruct\nminimally clothed 3D humans [8, 36, 60, 67, 91]. To rep-\nresent clothed humans, follow-up work leverages 3D dis-\nplacements on top of the template body model [2, 3, 48],\nor separate mesh layers [7, 61]. Yet, the topological con-\nstraints and the resolution of the template model limit their\nability to model clothing with complex shapes and high-\nfrequency details. In recent years, deep implicit shape rep-\nresentations [18, 49, 54, 58, 83] have emerged as a signif-\nicant breakthrough in modeling 3D humans, demonstrat-\ning their efficacy in reconstructing detailed clothed humans\nfrom images, scans, depth maps, or pointclouds [22, 53, 69\u2013\n71, 77, 79, 84, 89, 94]. Extending work enables the anima-\ntions of these reconstructions [15, 17, 22, 52, 53, 71, 77, 79]\nby learning a canonical 3D shape in a space normalized in\nterms of human poses and shapes. Since these approaches\ntreat the clothed human as a single-layer mesh, several\nwork [6, 14, 59, 61, 78] attempts to model the clothing of\nhumans as a separate layer. SMPLicit [19] models clothing\nwith implicit shape representation on top of the paramet-\nric mesh model. ReEF [95] registrates template meshes to\nimplicit surfaces. There are a few attempts to enable com-\npositional and animatable modeling of avatars. SCARF [23]\nseparately models humans and clothing from video observa-\ntions using a hybrid representation of mesh and NeRF [54].\nMEGANE [42] models high-fidelity compositional heads\nand eyeglasses from multi-view videos. NCHO [39] learns\ncompositional generative models of humans and objects\nfrom multiple scans with and without objects in an unsu-\npervised manner. Unlike existing approaches, our approach\n2\nenables the modeling of animatable multi-layer assets from\na single scan. To enable this, we exploit an image prior from\na pretrained diffusion model [66].\n3D Content Generation. Recent advancements in 3D rep-\nresentations [54, 83] and generative modeling [25, 28] have\nspurred active research for 3D content generation. Genera-\ntion from text, in particular, has gained popularity due to its\nintuitive interface. Early work like Text2Shape [12] trains\ntext and shape encoders to learn joint embeddings, gener-\nating text-consistent 3D shapes. Due to the challenges of\ncollecting large-scale paired text-3D datasets, several ap-\nproaches [29, 34, 51, 55] utilize pretrained CLIP model [63]\nfor text-guided 3D content generation. With the recent rise\nof diffusion models [28, 76] for high-quality image genera-\ntion [21, 66], DreamFusion [62] proposes score distillation\nsampling (SDS) loss for optimizing 3D scenes represented\nas NeRF [54] by leveraging the 2D diffusion prior. Various\n3D representations such as point clouds [57, 90], meshes [13,\n45, 46], and neural fields [50, 73] have also been utilized\nfor 3D generation. Some approaches [30, 31, 38, 75, 80]\nincorporates additional 3D datasets with diffusion model to\nenable high-quality 3D generation. MVdream [75] gener-\nates multi-view images by finetuning the diffusion model\nwith multi-view rendering of Objaverse [20]. Chupa [38] and\nHumanNorm [31] finetune the diffusion model to generate\nnormal or depth maps for generating 3D humans with fine\ngeometric details. However, current 3D content generation\nmethods generate 3D assets as a single-layer mesh, limiting\ntheir utility for composition with other assets. In contrast, our\napproach leverages the 2D diffusion prior to create decom-\nposed layers of attributes in a canonical space, facilitating\ngarment transfer and reposing.\n3D Editing. Editing 3D scenes has traditionally been a task\nfor experienced artists, but recent work shows the great po-\ntential of text-based automatic 3D content manipulation.\nInstruct-NeRF2NeRF [26] edits the pretrained NeRF us-\ning prompt by iteratively updating training images of the\nNeRF through Instruct-Pix2Pix [9]. DreamEditor [96] ex-\nploits mesh-based neural fields [87] to enable local and flex-\nible editing via SDS loss [62] using a diffusion model fine-\ntuned with DreamBooth [68]. Vox-E [72] similarly utilizes\nSDS loss but enables local editings using the 3D attention\nmap aggregated from the 2D attention maps of a diffusion\nmodel. FocalDreamer [43] employs an additive approach to\nedit the geometry of input 3D scans, creating reusable inde-\npendent assets. While our approach shares the motivation of\nFocalDreamer [43] in the sense of generating reusable 3D\nassets, our method does not require the designated editing re-\ngion as an additional input and focuses on the decomposition\nof the input 3D scan into multiple reusable layers instead of\nthe addition of new components.\n3. Preliminaries\n3.1. Score Distillation Sampling\nTo synthesize 3D scenes without requiring large-scale\n3D datasets, DreamFusion [62] introduces Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) loss. SDS loss leverages the knowledge of\na pretrained 2D diffusion model. Given the target prompt,\nthe loss optimizes over the 3D volume parameterized with \u03b8\nusing the differentiable renderer g, such that the generated\nimage x = g(\u03b8) closely resembles samples from the frozen\ndiffusion model, \u03d5. The gradient of the loss is calculated as,\n\u2207\u03b8LSDS(x, \u03d5) = E\n\u0014\n\u03c9(t)( \u02c6\u03f5\u03d5(xt; y, t) \u2212 \u03f5)\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\n,\n(1)\nwhere y denotes text condition and t is the noise level. xt\ndenotes the noised image, \u02c6\u03f5\u03d5(xt; y, t) represents the noise\nprediction for the sampled noise \u03f5, and \u03c9(t) is the weighting\nfunction defined by the scheduler of the diffusion model.\n3.2. Deep Marching Tetrahedra\nWe adopt Deep Marching Tetrahedra [74] (DMTet) as our\ngeometric representation, which is an implicit-explicit hybrid\n3D representation. It employs a deformable tetrahedral grid\ndenoted as (XT , T), where XT represents the grid\u2019s 3D\nvertices and T defines the tetrahedral structure, where each\ntetrahedron contains four vertices in XT . For each vertex\nxi \u2208 XT , DMTet predicts the signed distance value s(xi)\nfrom the surface and the position offset \u2206xi of each vertex\nand extracts a triangular mesh from the implicit field using\nthe differentiable Marching Tetrahedral (MT) layer. Since\nthe pipeline is fully differentiable, losses defined explicitly\non the surface mesh can be used for optimizing the surface\ngeometry represented by DMTet.\n4. Method\nOur method decomposes a single-layer 3D human scan\ninto two complete layers of the target object and the rest of\nthe scan in separate canonical spaces. Following the previous\nwork [13], we first model the geometry and subsequently\nmodel the appearance, and adopt DMTet [74] as our geo-\nmetric representation (Sec. 4.1). To reconstruct visible parts\nof each layer, we lift multi-view 2D segmentations of the\ntarget object onto the input 3D scan. Using forward linear\nblend skinning (LBS), we transform the canonical geometry\nof each layer to the pose of the input scan and reconstruct the\nvisible part of each layer based on the acquired segmentation.\nWe further leverage a 2D diffusion prior via our pose-guided\nSDS loss applied in canonical space to enable canonical-\nization of a single scan and complete the geometry of the\noccluded regions(Sec. 4.2). Once we optimize the geometry\nof the human and the object, we model the appearance using\nsimilar SDS losses in the canonical space (Sec. 4.3). Lastly,\n3\nFigure 2. Overview. GALA learns an object and the remaining human layers in a canonical space using DMTet [74]. The canonical space\ncolored orange and the original posed space colored purple are differentiably associated with linear blend skinning (LBS). Our novel\npose-guided SDS loss (right) guides the decomposition and inpainting in both the canonical and posed space. We also retain the fidelity of\nvisible regions via a reconstruction and segmentation loss (left-bottom).\nwe refine the composition of the decomposed layers by re-\nducing self-penetration (Sec. 4.4). Fig. 2 shows an overview\nof our pipeline.\n4.1. Representation and Initialization\nWe model the geometry of the human and an object in\nseparate canonical spaces using DMTet [74]. For a given\ntetrahedral grid for the human (XTh, Th) and for the object\n(XTo, To), we utilize MLP networks \u03a8h and \u03a8o to predict\nthe signed distance and the deformation offset of every ver-\ntex of the grids. Using the predicted signed distance and\noffset, the canonical human mesh, Mc\nh = (Vc\nh, Fh), and the\ncanonical object mesh, Mc\no = (Vc\no, Fo), can be extracted\nfrom each grid via a differentiable MT layer, where Vc\nh and\nVc\nh denotes the vertices, and Fh and Fo denotes the faces\nof each mesh. To obtain a posed mesh, we transform every\nvertex of the reconstructed mesh via forward linear blend\nskinning (LBS) [15, 71], utilizing the skinning weights of the\nnearest neighbor vertex of the canonical SMPL-X mesh [60].\nFormally, a vertex vc \u2208 Vc\nh \u222a Vc\no in canonical space is trans-\nformed into a posed space with,\n\u00afvp = (\nnb\nX\ni=1\nwi \u00b7 Ti(\u03b2, \u03b8)) \u00b7\n\u0014I\nB(\u03b2, \u03b8, \u03c8)\n0\n1\n\u0015\n\u00b7 \u00afvc,\n(2)\nwhere \u00afvp, \u00afvc are homogeneous coordinates of vp, vc respec-\ntively, nb is the number of bones, wi is the blend skinning\nweight of the bone i, and Ti(\u03b2, \u03b8) \u2208 R4\u00d74 is the transforma-\ntion of the bone i in SMPL-X model given shape parameter\n\u03b2 \u2208 R10 and pose parameter \u03b8 \u2208 R55\u00d73. Blend shapes\nB(\u03b2, \u03b8, \u03c8) are the summation of identity blend shapes,\npose blend shapes, and the expression blend shapes, where\n\u03c8 \u2208 R10 is the expression parameter. By transforming all\nvertices, we get the posed human mesh, Mp\nh = (Vp\nh, Fh),\nand the posed object mesh, Mp\no = (Vp\no , Fo). For ease of\nnotation, we use LBS(\u00b7) to specify the relationship between\nthe canonical mesh and posed mesh as follows:\nMp\n{h,o} = LBS(Mc\n{h,o}).\n(3)\nWe initialize our DMTets using SMPL-X mesh in canoni-\ncal pose. We sample points q \u2208 R3 in each space, compute\nthe signed distance SDF(q) from each point to the SMPL-X\nmesh, and optimize the following loss functions.\nLinit\nh\n= \u2225s(q; \u03a8h) \u2212 SDF(q)\u22252\n2\n(4)\nLinit\no\n= \u2225s(q; \u03a8o) \u2212 SDF(q)\u22252\n2.\n(5)\n4.2. Geometry Decomposition and Canonicalization\nGiven an input scan, we decompose and canonicalize\nthe scan into two separate geometries of human and object,\nMc\u2217\nh , Mc\u2217\no , which minimizes the following total loss:\nLgeo = \u03bbrec\nhgeoLrec\nhgeo + \u03bbrec\nogeoLrec\nogeo\n(6)\n+ \u03bbSDS\nhgeo LSDS\nhgeo + \u03bbSDS\nogeo LSDS\nogeo + \u03bbseg\ncompLseg\ncomp,\nMc\u2217\nh , Mc\u2217\no = arg min\nMc\nh,Mco\nLgeo.\n(7)\nWe describe each loss in the following.\n4\nReconstruction Loss.\nTo decouple the geometry of the\nhuman and object, we employ the 3D surface segmentation\nof the target object. Specifically, we rasterize the scan from\nmultiple viewpoints and perform binary segmentation in 2D,\ndistinguishing the target object from other parts using an\noff-the-shelf open-vocabulary segmentation tool [40]. Utiliz-\ning the aggregated pixel-to-face correspondence established\nduring the rasterization process, we cast votes for each face\nof the mesh to determine whether it belongs to the specified\nobject or not. Consequently, the given input scan in posed\nspace, denoted as Mscan, is partitioned into two incomplete\nsurface meshes: the object mesh, Mscan\no\n, and the remaining\nhuman figure mesh, Mscan\nh\n, as shown in Fig. 3.\nTo preserve the identity of visible regions of the input\nscan, we employ rendering-based reconstruction losses in\nthe posed space. Using a differentiable rasterizer R and a\nsampled camera k, we render masks A \u2208 {0, 1}H\u00d7W and\nnormal maps N \u2208 RH\u00d7W of the generated posed meshes\nMp\nh and Mp\no, where H, W are the height and width of the\nrendered masks and normal maps.\nAp\nh, Np\nh = R(Mp\nh, k) = R(LBS(Mc\nh), k)\n(8)\nAp\no, Np\no = R(Mp\no, k) = R(LBS(Mc\no), k)\n(9)\nTogether with the mask and normal map of the input mesh,\nwe additionally render segmentation masks Sscan\nh\n, Sscan\no\n\u2208\n{0, 1}H\u00d7W for the human and the object using the 3D sur-\nface segmentation:\nAscan, Nscan, Sscan\nh\n, Sscan\no\n= R(Mscan, k).\n(10)\nFinally, the losses for reconstruction are defined as follows:\nLrec\nhgeo = \u2225Np\nh \u2299 Sscan\nh\n\u2212 Nscan \u2299 Sscan\nh\n\u22252\n2,\n(11)\nLrec\nogeo = \u2225Np\no \u2299 Sscan\no\n\u2212 Nscan \u2299 Sscan\no\n\u22252\n2\n(12)\n+ \u2225Ap\no \u2212 Ascan \u2299 Sscan\no\n\u22252\n2,\nwhere \u2299 is the Hadamard product. We employ extra mask\nloss to regularize the shape of the object in posed space,\nassuming that the object is layered on top of the human.\nFurthermore, to capture the intricate details of human faces\nand hands, we render close-up views of these regions by\nzooming in on the corresponding joints of the posed SMPL-\nX mesh and apply the same reconstruction losses.\nPose-guided SDS Loss.\nOur goal is to obtain complete\n3D assets in a neutral pose from a single posed scan, which\ncan then be animated into arbitrary poses without undesir-\nable artifacts. The core challenges lie in the difficulty of (1)\ncompleting the occluded regions of both assets and (2) mod-\neling canonical shape of each asset from a single scan. To\novercome both challenges, we propose a pose-guided SDS\nloss that leverages the prior of the pretrained diffusion model\nequipped with ControlNet [93] conditioned with OpenPose\nposes [11]. The gradient of our pose-guided SDS loss is\ndefined as:\n(13)\n\u2207\u03a8LSDS\npose (zt(X), y, p, \u03d5)\n= E[\u03c9(t)( \u02c6\u03f5\u03d5(zt(X); y, p, t) \u2212 \u03f5)\u2202X\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202zt(X)\n\u2202X\n],\nwhere X is the rendered normal or texture of the mesh M,\nzt(X) is the latent embedding with noise from the forward\nprocess. y represents the positive and negative text prompts\nwhere positive prompts describe the underlying human and\nnegative prompts describe the target object to remove. p\nis the pose condition for ControlNet [93] converted by the\nmapping from SMPL-X joints to OpenPose joints.\nHowever, when the pose-guided SDS loss and reconstruc-\ntion loss are applied in the posed space through the forward\ntransformation of Eq. (2), the output canonical shape suf-\nfers from undesired artifacts due to many-to-one mapping\nfrom the canonical space to the posed space (see Fig. 10 (b)).\nWhile previous approaches [15, 81] address this ambiguity\nby jointly learning from multiple scans or images with vari-\nous poses, we observe that these approaches perform poorly\nwhen given only a single scan.\nTo enable plausible canonicalization from a single scan,\nwe apply our pose-guided SDS loss (Eq. (13)) in the canoni-\ncal space. The gradients are derived as follows:\n\u2207\u03a8hLSDS\nhgeo = \u2207\u03a8hLSDS\npose (zt( \u02dcNc\nh), yh, pc, \u03d5),\n(14)\n\u2207\u03a8oLSDS\nogeo = \u2207\u03a8oLSDS\npose (zt( \u02dcNc\ncomp), ycomp, pc, \u03d5),\n(15)\nwhere LSDS\nhgeo , LSDS\nogeo are the loss for the human and object\nspace, respectively. \u02dcNc\nh, \u02dcNc\ncomp are the rendered normal map\nconcatenated with the mask of the human mesh and the com-\nposite mesh in the canonical space, and zt( \u02dcNc\nh), zt( \u02dcNc\ncomp)\nare the downsampled version of them with noise produced\nby the forward diffusion process as in Fantasia3D [13]. yh,\nycomp are the text prompts for the human and object space,\nand pc is the neutral pose condition. Remarkably, our pose-\nguided SDS loss in the canonical space along with the re-\nconstruction loss in the posed space, effectively inpaints\nthe occluded regions and eliminates the artifacts caused by\nthe many-to-one mapping between the canonical space and\nposed space. To further remove the artifacts tightly attached\nto the human torso and assure the quality of decomposition\nin the input pose, we additionally apply our pose-guided\nSDS loss with a set of pre-defined poses including the input\npose.\nFor the object space, we apply our pose-guided SDS loss\nto the canonical composite mesh Mc\ncomp (Eq. (15)) with the\ngradient of the human mesh detached. Since the OpenPose\nControlNet [93] is trained to generate pose-consistent hu-\nman images, we obtain better guidance for the object space\n5\nInput scan\nSegmentation\nCompletion\nRemoval\nFigure 3.

Applying SDS loss in canonical\nspace generates texture for regions occluded by objects along with\nself-occluded regions.\nthrough pose-guided SDS loss with the rendering of the\ncomposite mesh than the object mesh. Please refer to the\nsupplementary material for details.\nSegmentation Loss\nThe aforementioned reconstruction\nloss constrains each layer in isolation. However, we observe\nthat this alone is not sufficient to prevent penetration of the\nlayer beneath when incomplete regions are synthesized via\npose-guided SDS loss. Thus, we additionally incorporate a\nsegmentation loss to further regularize the geometry after\ncomposition. Specifically, we assign one-hot encoded vec-\ntor attributes [1, 0] and [0, 1], respectively to every face of\nMp\nh and Mp\no, and rasterize both meshes together to get the\nsegmentation masks for the human and the object, Sp\nh and\nSp\no. We minimize the difference between Sp\nh and Sp\no, and the\nrendered segmentation masks of the input scan, Sscan\nh\nand\nSscan\no\n, with the following loss:\nLseg\ncomp = \u2225Sp\nh \u2212 Sscan\nh\n\u22252\n2 + \u2225Sp\no \u2212 Sscan\no\n\u22252\n2.\n(16)\n4.3. Appearance Completion\nGiven the inpainted canonical human mesh Mc\nh, and\nobject mesh Mc\no, we model the appearance of each mesh\nrepresented as vertex colors. We employ MLP networks \u0393h\nand \u0393o to predict the albedo of every vertex.\nThe total loss for optimizing the texture is defined as,\nLtex = \u03bbrec\nhtexLrec\nhtex + \u03bbrec\notexLrec\notex\n+ \u03bbSDS\nhtex LSDS\nhtex + \u03bbSDS\notex LSDS\notex .\n(17)\nSimilar to Sec. 4.2, we utilize the 3D surface segmentation\nto initialize the color of the visible regions in the input mesh.\nSpecifically, we differentiably render RGB images, Ip\nh, Ip\no,\nand Iscan of the posed meshes, Mp\nh and Mp\no, and the input\nscan, Mscan, and optimize the following losses:\nLrec\nhtex = \u2225Ip\nh \u2299 Sscan\nh\n\u2212 Iscan \u2299 Sscan\nh\n\u22252\n2,\n(18)\nLrec\notex = \u2225Ip\no \u2299 Sscan\no\n\u2212 Iscan \u2299 Sscan\no\n\u22252\n2.\n(19)\nTo generate textures for the fully occluded regions, we\nutilize the pose-guided SDS loss as shown in Fig. 4. We\nuse the vertex colors of Mc\nh and Mc\ncomp to render the RGB\nimages, Ic\nh and Ic\ncomp, and optimize our texture MLPs, \u0393h\nand \u0393o, by computing the gradients of following pose-guided\nSDS losses:\n\u2207\u0393hLSDS\nhtex = \u2207\u0393hLSDS\npose (zt(Ic\nh), yh, pc, \u03d5),\n(20)\n\u2207\u0393oLSDS\notex = \u2207\u0393oLSDS\npose (zt(Ic\ncomp), ycomp, pc, \u03d5), (21)\nwhere zt(Ic\nh) and zt(Ic\ncomp) represent the latent embeddings\nof Ic\nh and Ic\ncomp, achieved using the pretrained image en-\ncoder of the diffusion model [66]. All other notations remain\nconsistent with those used in Eq. (14) and Eq. (15).\n4.4. Composition\nWhen composing the generated assets to novel identities,\npenetration of the human layer beneath could happen. To\nresolve this, we also introduce a refinement step. Given a\ncanonical human mesh Mc\nh, and a canonical object mesh\nMc\no, we optimize the vertex positions of Mc\nh along their\nnormal directions, nh. For each vertex vh \u2208 Vc\nh of Mc\nh,\nwe find its nearest neighbor vertex vnn\nh\n\u2208 Vc\u2032\no\n\u2208 Vc\no of\nMc\no, where Vc\u2032\no denotes the visible vertices among Vc\no. We\nintroduce a penalty when \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nvhvnn\nh\nand nh are oriented in\nopposite directions. Similarly, for each vertex vo \u2208 Vc\u2032\no , we\nfind its nearest neighbor vertex vnn\no\n\u2208 Vc\nh, and penalize when\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nvovnn\no\nand no have the same direction, where no denotes\nthe normals of vo. Formally, we minimize the following loss,\nLref = \u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nvhvnn\nh\n\u2225\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nvhvnn\nh \u2225\n\u00b7 nh +\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nvovnn\no\n\u2225\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nvovnn\no \u2225\n\u00b7 no + \u03bbdis\u2225\u2206vh\u22252\n2,\n(22)\nwhere the last term regularizes the displacements of vh.\n6\nFigure 5. Decomposition and Canonicalization. In each set, we show the decomposition and canonicalization results of the leftmost sample.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Datasets and Metrics\nRenderPeople [64]: RenderPeople provides high-quality\nsigle-layer 3D human scans, and we select 30 scans to cover\ndiverse categories of target objects to decompose. We evalu-\nate the quality of the decomposition against state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods [9, 72]. Following the evaluation protocol\nof previous editing work [9, 24, 26], we utilize the CLIP text-\nimage direction similarity which measures the alignment of\nthe performed edit with the text instruction. We also present\na novel metric named, pixel-wise object removal score (POR\nScore), which measures the ratio of the number of pixels of\nthe target object, before and after the edit. During evalua-\ntion, we render both the input and the edited output from 30\nevenly distributed viewpoints and measure each metric.\nCAPE Dataset [48] CAPE dataset contains the 3D se-\nquences of clothed humans along with the corresponding\nSMPL parameters. We utilize CAPE dataset to evaluate the\nquality of canonicalization in comparison to existing meth-\nods and conduct ablation studies. For evaluation, we use 18\nsubjects, each wearing diverse clothing types that include\nboth long and short upper and lower garments. For each sub-\nject, we select 100 scans with equal intervals in the sequence,\nand perform canonicalization using the last scan. We then\npose the modeled canonical shape into poses of the preced-\ning 99 scans, and calculate Intersection over Union (IoU)\nand Chamfer distance (Chamf) to measure the alignment.\nSince the dataset provides parameters of SMPL, we adapt\nour pipeline to use SMPL instead of SMPL-X.1\n5.2.

In Fig. 1, we highlight the key\nadvantage of our method by applying a series of decompo-\nsitions to the input scan.

Quantitative Evaluation\nDecomposition. We evaluate the quality of decomposition\nagainst the SOTA text-guided 3D editing methods [26, 72],\nwhich we believe is the closest to our task. Instruct-\nNeRF2NeRF [26] is a text-guided NeRF [54] editing method\nbased on the Instruct-Pix2Pix [9]. Vox-E [72] edits a 3D\nscene by first fitting a ReLU field [37] with multi-view im-\nages and then editing the learned ReLU field using SDS loss.\nWe provide prompts for each method to remove the target\nobject and compare the decomposition results. Tab. 1 shows\nthat our method outperforms SOTA baselines, achieving the\nhighest CLIP text-to-image similarity and the lowest POR\nScore. We also provide qualitative comparison in Fig. 8.\nCanonicalization. We compare our canonicalization results\nwith baseline methods. To solely assess the quality of canon-\nicalization, we exclude the decomposition process by mod-\neling the whole scan in a single space. We employ three\nbaselines for comparison. Nearest Neighbor (NN), trans-\nforms each vertex to its canonical position based on the\nskinning weights of the nearest neighbor SMPL vertex [33].\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) uses the weighted average of\nskinning weights of k-nearest neighbor SMPL vertices [88].\nInput scan\nReference pose\nCanonical\nPosed\nOurs\nNN\nKNN\nFast-SNARF\n(1)\nCanonical\nPosed\nFast-SNARF\n(10)\nFast-SNARF\n(50)\nFast-SNARF\n(100)\nFast-SNARF\n(200)\nFigure 9.

We use K = 6 for KNN.\nTab. 2 demonstrates that our method outperforms the base-\nlines, reporting the highest IoU and the lowest Chamfer\ndistance when transformed into various poses. We also com-\npare our results with Fast-SNARF [16], the current SOTA for\ncanonicalization from multiple scans. However, we observed\nsevere instability in the learning of MLP-based skinning\nfields with a small number of scans. Thus, we discard the\nskinning field in Fast-SNARF, and use the nearest neigh-\nbor skinning weights instead for comparison. Tab. 2 shows\nthat our method outperforms Fast-SNARF trained with up\nto 50 scans. Note that the original Fast-SNARF is trained\nwith a significantly larger dataset of around 3000 scans. The\nqualitative comparison is presented in Fig. 9.\nAblation Study. Tab. 3 and Fig. 10 summarize an ablation\nstudy to evaluate our design choices. First, we validate the\nimportance of the SDS loss in the canonical space. Without\nthe SDS loss in the canonical space, we observe artifacts\nin the canonical shape as shown in Fig. 10 (b), leading to\n8\nCano.

We further validate our pose-\nguided SDS by using the vanilla SDS loss without a pose\ncondition. As illustrated in Fig. 10 (c), the use of the vanilla\nSDS loss leads to noticeable artifacts near the armpits and\noften lack large body parts. In contrast, using the proposed\npose-guided SDS loss achieves more plausible canonicaliza-\ntion without artifacts as shown in Fig. 10 (d) and Tab. 3.\n6. Discussion and Future Work\nWe presented GALA, a framework that turns a single\nstatic scan into reusable and animatable layered assets. Our\nexperiments show that decomposing and inpainting sepa-\nrated layers in 3D is now possible with the help of a pow-\nerful 2D diffusion prior. The proposed pose-guided SDS\nloss allows us to jointly optimize each component in both\nposed and canonical space to produce clean textured 3D ge-\nometry. The resulting layered assets can be composed with\nnovel identities in a plausible manner and be further reposed\nto a target pose. We also demonstrate that our method out-\nperforms existing editing methods both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.\nLimitation and Future Work. Our approach currently gen-\nerates a static canonical shape for reposing. Modeling pose-\ndependent deformation of clothing from a single scan can be\naddressed in future work. The dependency on accurate 2D\nsegmentation can be also problematic if the 2D segmentation\nmodule fails. Self-discovering each layer without requiring\n2D segmentation is also an interesting future work.\nAcknowledgements: The work of SNU members was\nsupported by NRF grant funded by the Korean govern-\nment (MSIT) (No. 2022R1A2C2092724), and IITP grant\nfunded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No.2022-0-\n00156, No.2021-0-01343).

Network Architectures\nWe implement our networks for predicting SDF and off-\nsets, \u03a8h and \u03a8o, as a 2-layer MLP network with 32 hidden\nunits and ReLU activations except for the last layer. As in-\nputs, each network takes the 3D Cartesian coordinates of\nthe vertices, XT , of the designated canonical DMTet grid,\n(XT , T). The coordinates are normalized between 0 to 1,\nand encoded using a hash positional encoding [56] with 16\nresolution levels and a maximum resolution of 1024. The\nnetworks for predicting vertex colors, \u0393h and \u0393o, are im-\nplemented using a 1-layer MLP network with 32 hidden\nunits and ReLU activations except for the last layer that uses\nsigmoid activations. As inputs, each network takes the 3D\nCartesian coordinates of the vertices of the canonical human\nmesh and object mesh, Mc\nh and Mc\no. The coordinates are\nsimilarly normalized between 0 to 1, and encoded using a\nhash positional encoding with 16 resolution levels and a\nmaximum resolution of 2048.\nA.2. Optimization Details\nThe total loss, Lgeo, for geometry modeling is as follows:\nLgeo = \u03bbrec\nhgeoLrec\nhgeo + \u03bbrec\nogeoLrec\nogeo + \u03bbseg\ncompLseg\ncomp\n(23)\n+ \u03bbSDS\nhgeo LSDS\nhgeo + \u03bbSDS\nogeo LSDS\nogeo ,\nwhere \u03bbrec\nhgeo = 5 \u00d7 103, \u03bbrec\nogeo = 5 \u00d7 103, \u03bbseg\ncomp = 1 \u00d7 105,\n\u03bbSDS\nhgeo = 1, and \u03bbSDS\nogeo = 1. We use AdamW optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.001 and optimize for 1600 steps, after\n400 steps of the initialization process with Linit\nh\nand Linit\no\n.\nThe total loss, Ltex, for appearance modeling is,\nLtex = \u03bbrec\nhtexLrec\nhtex + \u03bbrec\notexLrec\notex\n+ \u03bbSDS\nhtex LSDS\nhtex + \u03bbSDS\notex LSDS\notex ,\n(24)\nwhere \u03bbrec\nhtex = 1 \u00d7 108 and \u03bbrec\notex = 1 \u00d7 108. \u03bbSDS\nhtex = 0\nand \u03bbSDS\notex = 0 for the first 400 steps, and \u03bbSDS\nhtex = 1 and\n\u03bbSDS\notex\n= 1 otherwise. We use AdamW optimizer with a\nlearning rate of 0.01 and optimize for 2000 steps. Each stage\ntakes about 20 minutes on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090.\nA.3. Additional Details\nPrompts for the SDS loss.\nFor yh in \u2207\u03a8hLSDS\nhgeo and\n\u2207\u0393hLSDS\nhtex , we use \u201cA photo of a man/woman\u201d as the pos-\nitive prompt and \u201c{target object}\u201d as the negative prompt.\nNote that we use \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d based on the gender\nprovided by RenderPeople [64] and CAPE Dataset [48]. For\nycomp in \u2207\u03a8oLSDS\nogeo and \u2207\u0393oLSDS\notex , we use \u201cA photo of a\nman/woman wearing {target object}\u201d as the positive prompt\nand do not use any negative prompt. Following DreamFu-\nsion [62], we incorporate view directions by concatenating\n\u201cfront/side/back view\u201d to each prompt based on the viewing\nangle of the sampled camera.\nCamera Sampling.\nWe set the camera center using spher-\nical coordinate system, (r, \u03b8, \u03d5), where r denotes the radial\ndistance from the origin, \u03b8 denotes the elevation, and \u03d5\ndenotes the azimuth angle. We set r = 3, and sample cam-\neras facing the origin from \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212 \u03c0\n18, \u03c0\n9 ], and \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0].\nWe also sample the field of view from U( \u03c0\n7 , \u03c0\n4 ). We ad-\nditionally use zoomed-in views to capture fine details of\nhuman faces and hands and to effectively synthesize the\nmissing regions where human and target object interact.\nTo render zoomed-in images, we translate and scale the\ninput mesh before the rendering process. For the zoomed-\nin views for faces and hands, we translate the input mesh\nusing the corresponding joint information of the SMPL-X\nmesh such that each joint locates at the origin, and scale\nthe input mesh by factor of 5 for rendering the face and 10\nfor rendering the hands. For the zoomed-in views for re-\ngions where human and target object interact, we utilize the\nbounding box information of the target object. Specifically,\ngiven the object bounding box xl = (xmin, ymin, zmin) to\nxr = (xmax, ymax, zmax), we first translate the input mesh\nby t \u223c U( xr+3xl\n4\n, 3xr+xl\n4\n). We then scale the input mesh\nby the factor of s \u223c U(\n1\n0.6max(xr\u2212xl),\n1\n0.3max(xr\u2212xl)).\nB. Evaluation Details\nB.1. Decomposition\nBaselines.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no ex-\nisting work that tackles the decomposition of a 3D scan.\nTherefore, we use the recent text-based 3D editing methods\nas baseline: Instruct-NeRF2NeRF [26] and Vox-E [72]. For\nevaluation, we use the official implementation for both meth-\nods. We train nerfacto model [54] for Instruct-NeRF2NeRF\nand ReLU field\n[37] for Vox-E with each scan. Since\nInstruct-NeRF2NeRF is based on Instruct-Pix2Pix [9], the\nprompt should be given in the form of \u201cinstruction\u201d; hence,\nthe basic form of prompts we use for Instruct-NeRF2NeRF is\n\u201cRemove {target object} from him/her\u201d or \u201cChange his/her\n{target object} to a white t-shirt/shorts\u201d to avoid getting\nnaked body for single-layered clothing. For Vox-E, the basic\nform of prompts we use is \u201cA photo of a man/woman without\n{target object}\u201d.\nPOR metric.\nWe propose a novel metric named pixel-wise\nobject removal score (POR Score) for quantitatively evaluat-\ning the decomposition performance. Specifically, we render\n30 images per subject using the camera views with equally\ndistributed yaw angles. Then, we run the off-the-shelf open-\nvocabulary image segmentation method, SAM [40], to get\nthe segmentation of the target object specified by the prompt.\nIdeally, if the target object is properly decomposed or re-\nmoved, there should be no pixel classified as the target ob-\nject for the images rendered after decomposition. Hence,\nwe compute the ratio of the number of pixels classified as\n13\n(a) Image\n(b) 3D reconstruction\n(c) Decomposition\nFigure 11. Decomposing single-view 3D reconstructions. Our\nmethod enables the generation of animatable layered assets from\n2D images via 2D-to-3D reconstruction methods [1].\nthe target object in the images after editing and the images\nrendered from the input scan as follows:\nPOR =\n1\n|K|\nX\nk\u2208K\nP\n(i,j)\u2208Minput\nk\n1(SAM(Iedit\nk\n)ij = 1)\n|Minput\nk\n|\n,\n(25)\nwhere K is a set of cameras for rendering, Iinput\nk\nand Iedit\nk\nare images rendered from the input mesh and the edited\nresult, and Minput\nk\nis a segmentation mask of the Iinput\nk\nwhich is defined as Minput\nk\n= {(i, j)|SAM(Iinput\nk\n)ij = 1}.\nB.2. Canonicalization\nBaselines.\nFor Fast-SNARF [16], we use the official im-\nplementation with the default hyperparameters except for\nthe skinning mode where we use the \u201cpreset\u201d mode which\nuses the nearest neighbor skinning weights, instead of the\noriginal \u201cmlp\u201d mode which learns the skinning weights. This\nis due to the training instability with limited training data as\nmentioned in the main paper.\nAblation.\nIn our ablation study, we utilize the CAPE\ndataset [48]. Since the dataset doesn\u2019t provide texture data,\nwe employ an off-the-shelf mesh texturing tool [65] to add\ncolor information to the input mesh and perform segmenta-\ntion, which we find challenging to perform on the rendered\ngeometry or normals.\nC. Additional Qualitative Results\nIn this section, we present additional qualitative results\nof our method. Please refer to the supplementary video for\nanimated results.\nDecomposing User-generated 3D Assets.\nOur method\ncan decompose user-generated 3D assets from single-view\n3D reconstruction methods [1, 4, 32, 69, 70, 84, 85] or\n3D avatar generation methods [10, 31, 41, 44, 92].

These results demonstrate\nthat GALA enables the intuitive scenario for the users to\ncreate their own reusable 3D assets from their images or text\nguidance.\nDecomposition and Canonicalization.\nFig. 20 is an ex-\ntended figure of Fig. 5 in the main paper, which shows the\nresults of decomposition and canonicalization of input scans.\nLayered Decomposition.\nFig. 13 is an extended figure of\nFig. 1 in the main paper, which shows the strength of our\nmethod to generate \u201clayered\u201d assets by applying series of\ndecomposition to the input scan.

Discussion\nSDS loss to Composition Mesh.\nAs mentioned in the main\npaper, in order to complete geometry and appearance of the\nobject, we apply our pose-guided SDS loss to the composite\nmesh of human and object instead of the object mesh itself.\nThis is due the fact that OpenPose [11] ControlNet [93]\nis trained to generate pose-guided human images. Hence,\nwhen given the positive prompt \u201c{target object}\u201d, and the\nnegative prompt, \u201ca person\u201d, it fails to exclusively generate\nthe object without humans as shown in Fig. 21.

Failure case of canonicalization. Our method suffers\nfrom correctly canonicalizing scans with hands in their pockets.\nLimitations.\nAs mentioned in the main paper, GALA cur-\nrently models a static canonical shape without considering\npose-dependent deformations. Fig. 18 illustrates a failure\ncase of reposing a human with loose clothing, where severe\nartifacts of the dress appear between the legs. Jointly mod-\neling pose-dependent deformation of clothing from a single\nscan can be a potential direction for future work. Addition-\nally, our method may encounter challenges when canonical-\nizing input scans with difficult poses such as humans with\ntheirs hands in their pockets. As shown in Fig. 19 (c), the\nhand partially remains inside the pocket after decomposition,\nlimiting the reuse of the decomposed human. Nonetheless,\nthe decomposed human can still be used in the pose of the\ninput scan as depicted in Fig. 19 (b), and the decomposed\nobject of Fig. 19 (d) can be utilized as any other decomposed\nasset.\nSocietal Impact.\nGALA decomposes a single static scan\ninto reusable and animatable assets, e.g. target apparel and\nthe underlying human body. Similar to other recent genera-\ntive models and editing methods, our method may have both\npositive and negative societal impacts depending on the us-\nage. On the positive side, GALA can immediately generate\ndiverse reusable assets from existing 3D assets that have en-\ntangled geometry, without template registration, additional\nscanning, or editing by 3D designers. For the metaverse\napplications, GALA enables users to easily digitize their\nassets and clothe their avatars in the virtual world. On the\nnegative side, GALA may generate a naked underlying body\nfor the human scan with single-layered clothing unless the\ninput prompts are properly given. Since GALA utilizes SDS\nloss [62] to leverage the prior from the pre-trained 2D dif-\nfusion model, this problem can be alleviated via the NSFW\nfilter. Nonetheless, there are still potential problems, e.g. pri-\nvacy violations, fake news, online sexual harassment, etc.,\nlike deepfake [82]. In our code release, we will specify the\ncorrect use of our method. We believe that the malicious use\nof generative models should be dealt with through both legal\nregulation and technology to detect misuse cases. We hope\nthat our work invokes a serious discussion on such issues.\n16\nFigure 20. Decomposition and Canonicalization.

Ronny Huang, Cyril Allauzen, Tongzhou Chen, Kilol Gupta, Ke Hu, James Qin, Yu Zhang,\nYongqiang Wang, Shuo-Yiin Chang, Tara N. Sainath\nGoogle Research\nABSTRACT\nIn the era of large models, the autoregressive nature of\ndecoding often results in latency serving as a significant bot-\ntleneck.\nWe propose a non-autoregressive LM-fused ASR\nsystem that effectively leverages the parallelization capabil-\nities of accelerator hardware.\nOur approach combines the\nUniversal Speech Model (USM) and the PaLM 2 language\nmodel in per-segment scoring mode, achieving an average\nrelative WER improvement across all languages of 10.8% on\nFLEURS and 3.6% on YouTube captioning. Furthermore, our\ncomprehensive ablation study analyzes key parameters such\nas LLM size, context length, vocabulary size, fusion method-\nology. For instance, we explore the impact of LLM size rang-\ning from 128M to 340B parameters on ASR performance.\nThis study provides valuable insights into the factors influenc-\ning the effectiveness of practical large-scale LM-fused speech\nrecognition systems.\nIndex Terms\u2014 large language model, multilingual speech\nrecognition\n1. INTRODUCTION\nLarge-scale models have showcased impressive results across\napplications, especially in multilingual speech models [1, 2,\n3, 4, 5] and multilingual large language models (LLMs) [6, 7,\n8]. The next evolution is the fusion of these large multilingual\nmodels to enhance accuracy. However, their size brings la-\ntency issues, notably in autoregressive decoding, as seen with\nshallow fusion [9].\nApplications like voice assistants and live captioning face\nchallenges from these models\u2019 latency. Recognizing this con-\ncern, our study presents a non-autoregressive LM-fused ASR\nsystem. This approach streams utterances at 8-second inter-\nvals using the Universal Speech Model (USM) [10] and the\nPaLM 2 language model [11]. Both the USM and PaLM 2\nprocess each 8-second chunk with full audio context, lead-\ning to enhanced accuracy, and they are also able process it\nquickly to by parallelizing across the sequence for smooth\nuser experience. In particular, hypotheses are generated non-\nautoregressively by attaching a CTC decoder to the USM, and\nthe hypotheses are scored non-autoregressively by the LM by\npassing in the entire hypothesis sequence in teacher forcing\nmode [12].\nOur methodology yields an average double-digit gain of\n10.8% on relative word error rate (WER) on the public multi-\nlingual FLEURS testset. On a challenging internal YouTube\ncaptioning testset, we observe an average gain of 3.6%, across\nall available languages. Our study further delves into factors\nlike LM size (up to 340B), vocabulary, context length, seg-\nmentation, n-best list size, and scoring method. For instance,\nwe find that though LLMs display emergent behaviors with\nincreasing size [13], their impact on WER is more muted\u2014\nbut larger models can reduce the sensitivity to fusion weight.\n2. RELATED WORK\nLeveraging large language models to enhance ASR systems\nhas emerged as a natural and promising direction, leading to\nsignificant advancements in recent research.\nSeveral stud-\nies have focused on integrating LLMs with ASR models,\nexploiting their vast linguistic knowledge and contextual un-\nderstanding. [14] combined T5 [15] and PaLM 1 [16] with\na Conformer RNN-T model, enhancing ASR performance\nfor English and code-switched data.\nOur work builds on\nthis by using LLMs for large-scale ASR models with a non-\nautoregressive CTC head.\n[9] improved recognition of rare words in short voice\nqueries using shallow fusion. In contrast, our focus lies in\nlong-form tasks like YouTube captioning, where LLMs\u2019 con-\ntextual understanding is crucial.\nGiven the limitations of\nshallow fusion for long tasks and mismatched vocabularies,\nwe explore scoring as a more efficient fusion technique.\n[17] integrated a Listen Attend Spell Once model [18]\nwith BERT [19] using n-best scoring. We expand upon this\nidea by deploying larger-scale, multilingual models. Other\nresearch, such as [20], has explored various fusion methods\nbetween LLMs and ASR systems. Their surprising finding\nwas the comparable performance of simple shallow fusion to\ndeeper techniques. Similarly, [21] used two fusion methods\nwith LLaMa LLM and found minimal difference in WER out-\ncomes, supporting the conclusions of [20].\nBuilding on these findings, our study emphasizes scor-\narXiv:2401.12789v1  [cs.CL]  23 Jan 2024\ning as the fusion method, aiming for a practical and scalable\nASR+LLM solution suitable for real-world applications.\n3. METHOD\n3.1. Speech Model\nWe employ the Universal Speech Model (USM) [10], a 2\nbillion parameter Conformer [22], with 32 layers and a model\ndimension of 1536, for ASR hypotheses.\nThe vocabulary\ncomprises 16384 wordpieces, and a CTC decoder ensures\nnon-autoregressive, parallel inference. For training the USM,\na multitask approach is used. It\u2019s trained on over 12 million\nhours of unlabeled audio and 28 billion sentences of text\ndata, along with 110 thousand hours of supervised and 100\nthousand hours of semi-supervised audio. All datasets are\nmultilingual. The USM features chunk-wise bi-directional\nattention, enabling accurate long-form audio modeling with\n30 second segment during training. Unlike traditional audio-\nbased chunking, this approach maintains continuous state\nthroughout, allowing for streaming results every 8 seconds,\nenhancing user experience.\n3.2. Language Model\nWe utilize the PaLM 2 language model [11] to score the ASR\nhypotheses. Trained on varied data sources like web docu-\nments and books, it uses a 256k wordpiece vocabulary. PaLM\n2 surpasses its predecessor, PaLM 1 [16], via enhanced train-\ning, architecture improvements, and extended context length,\nshowcasing superior performance in natural language tasks.\nWe assess its capability in ASR scoring using the pre-trained\nvariant and apply prefix LM scoring mode [23], prompting\nthe model with a fixed prefix (top hypotheses from previous\nsegments) and scoring several suffix hypotheses (different hy-\npotheses for current segment).\n3.3. Long-form Inference\nTo process long-form audio without memory constraints, we\nemploy a streaming framework, processing the audio frame\nby frame. Using the USM\u2019s chunk-wise attention, we en-\ncode 8-second chunks as soon as the audio is available and\nrelay them to the CTC decoder.\nThese CTC probabilities\nform a confusion network lattice encoding possible word-\npieces. Given the independence of each encoded frame, the\nwordpiece distributions are also independent of one another.\nConsequently, the lattice holds hypotheses that exponentially\ngrow with length, making it challenging to score all of them\nwith an LLM.\n3.4. LM Scoring\nTo handle the exponential growth, we break the lattice into\n8-second segments, scoring only current segment hypotheses.\nTo maintain context, we use the concatenated top hypothe-\nsis from the previous two segments as the LM prefix. This\niterative process updates every 8 seconds, ensuring the pre-\nfix is always the top hypotheses from the last two segments.\nTo derive suffixes for the LM, we pick the best N hypotheses\nfrom the lattice and batch them as suffix sequences for scor-\ning. The combined LM and ASR scores given the audio x and\nthe hypothesis y are then represented by\nlog pfinal(y|x) = log pasr(y|x) + \u03bb \u00b7 log plm(y),\n(1)\nwith the leading hypothesis chosen as the final transcript. Per-\nsegment scoring is parallelizable, non-autoregressive, and up-\ndates in streaming mode every 8 seconds as one speaks.\n4. EVALUATION\nThroughout our evaluations, we will use the following setup\nunless otherwise mentioned.\n\u2022 US English locale\n\u2022 1 billion parameter variant of PaLM 2\n\u2022 LM scoring weight of 0.3 (optimized according to the set-\ntings list here)\n\u2022 Context length of 2 prior segments\n\u2022 N-best list size of 16\n\u2022 Youtube Captions testset, described in next section.\n4.1. Testsets\nYouTube videos span diverse categories, making them suit-\nable for our LM scoring study. We evaluate on the commonly\nused YouTube captioning testset, YT LONG, encompassing\nvideo-on-demand content in multiple languages [24, 25, 26,\n27, 14]. For US English, it includes 77 videos totaling 22.2\nhours, with a median utterance length of 14.8 minutes. Other\nlanguages average 61 videos and 17 hours. We also analyze\nresults on the FLEURS testset [28], containing 600-900 utter-\nances per language, with US English having 647. The total\nduration across languages is 283 hours.\n4.2. Results on All Languages\nResults for all languages are presented in Figure 1.\nWe\ntested LM scoring weight \u03bb at four values: {0.15, 0.30, 0.45,\n0.60}.\nOn Youtube (Figure 1 (top)), PaLM 2 integration\nreduces WER by 4.1% for en us, averaging 3.6% across 15\nlanguages. The FLEURS testset (Figure 1 (bottom)) shows a\nmore pronounced improvement: 9.7% for en us and 10.8%\non average. No language showed regression.\n4.3.

Additionally, optimal LM scor-\ning weight increases with model size, shifting from 0.25 for\na 128M LM to 0.45 for a 340B LM (Figure 2). Larger mod-\nels show decreased WER sensitivity to LM weight changes.\nThis suggests that smaller models require cautious weighting,\nwhile larger models, with their improved accuracy, can afford\nmore weight without risking incorrect hypothesis selection.\n4.4. Dependence on Context Length\nBy adjusting the number of segments from previous history to\nutilize as a prompt, we can coarsely control the LM\u2019s context\nlength. Figure 3 indicates that concatenating 4 context seg-\nments, or 32 seconds of decoded text, is optimal. Including\nmore than 4 segments slightly reduces performance, possibly\ndue to the LM scoring weight being optimized at 2 segments.\nThe results suggest that using about 32 seconds or approxi-\nmately 50 words of context improves ASR.

Dependence on Vocabulary Size\nPaLM 2 has a vocabulary of 256k tokens, optimized for nat-\nural language generation. A benefit of per-segment scoring\nis that it allows handling of mismatched vocabularies be-\ntween ASR and LLM models through re-tokenization. In the\n1-billion-parameter PaLM 2, embedding and softmax layers\nTable 2. Dependence on LM vocabulary size.\nLM vocabulary size\nWER\nB2: 256k\n13.88\nE7: 32k\n13.89\nTable 3.

We tested a reduced\n32k token vocabulary for PaLM 2 to decrease computational\ncost. Results in Table 2 show minimal performance degra-\ndation with the smaller vocabulary. Thus, using a smaller\nvocabulary can save computation while retaining strong per-\nformance.\n4.6. Dependence on Segmentation\nSegmentation determines the frequency of lattice scoring\nwith the LLM, influencing user experience and transcription\nquality [27, 30, 31]. We evaluated fixed segmentation lengths\nand a voice activity detector (VAD) segmenter [32]. While\nVAD avoids cutting words, it yields inconsistent segment\nlengths potentially affecting user experience when used in a\nper-segment streaming scenario. The median length of VAD\nsegments is around 5 seconds.\nResults in 3 show fixed-length (B3) surpasses VAD (E8),\nopposing findings in [30]. This is due to differences in the\nmodel; [30] uses RNN-T which discards most hypotheses\nupon segmentation, while our CTC model doesn\u2019t retain de-\ncoder states, making it more robust to premature segmenta-\ntion. 4 shows WER stability beyond 3 seconds. This is evi-\ndence that, in contrast to RNN-T, CTC remains unaffected by\nword truncation, thanks to its non-dependent confusion net-\nwork structure.\n4.7. Dependence on Number of Hypotheses\nThe number of paths in a lattice increases with segment\nlength, but computational bounds limit the number of hy-\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nsegment length (sec)\n13.9\n14.0\n14.1\nWER\nFig. 4.

Figure 5 presents a study on the n-best list\nsize, which denotes the scored hypotheses per segment. Per-\nformance improves as the list expands, plateauing at about\n1024. This growth suggests the lattice\u2019s high density, allow-\ning the LLM to continue improving the transcription quality\nup to computational constraints.\n4.8. Comparison to Shallow Fusion\nOur exploration has mainly considered per-segment LM scor-\ning. An alternative is per-frame scoring or shallow fusion,\nwhich is computationally heavier due to its autoregressive de-\ncoding and frequent LM invocation.\nIn per-frame scoring, the LM acts on each frame, usu-\nally pre-pruning, amplifying computational load. When ap-\nplied post-pruning, per-frame scoring requires forward prop-\nagations of Nframes \u00d7 Nhyps, while per-segment scoring de-\nmands Ntokens \u00d7 Nhyps propagations. This makes per-frame\nabout Nframes/Ntokens times costlier. On our YouTube test-\nset, this ratio is 4. We apply a blank pruning strategy where\nframes with a blank probability above 0.9 are skipped. This\nlargely diminishes the factor-of-4 cost difference.\nPerformance comparisons in Table 4 show per-frame\nscoring (E9) at 13.70 (-5.4% relative to no LM) outperforms\nper-segment scoring (B4) at 13.88 (-4.1% relative). Shallow\nfusion shines in non-latency-critical scenarios with matched\nvocabularies. For per-frame scoring, we retrained the ASR\nmodel with PaLM 2\u2019s vocabulary.\n5. CONCLUSION\nWe developed a deployable ASR system using large-scale\nmultilingual models, emphasizing practicality.\nBy adopt-\ning a non-autoregressive system with CTC and per-segment\nLM scoring, we enhanced performance across languages for\nYouTube captions and FLEURS. Our study also provided\ninsights into system parameters\u2019 effects on ASR efficacy.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] V.

Weaver is pre-trained on a carefully selected corpus that focuses on improving\nthe writing capabilities of large language models.\nWe then fine-tune Weaver for creative and\nprofessional writing purposes and align it to the preference of professional writers using a suit of\nnovel methods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment, making it able to produce more\nhuman-like texts and follow more diverse instructions for content creation.\nThe Weaver family\nconsists of models of Mini (1.8B), Base (6B), Pro (14B), and Ultra (34B) sizes, suitable for\ndifferent applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agent according to query\ncomplexity to balance response quality and computation cost. Evaluation on a carefully curated\nbenchmark for assessing the writing capabilities of LLMs shows Weaver models of all sizes outperform\ngeneralist LLMs several times larger than them. Notably, our most-capable Weaver Ultra model\nsurpasses GPT-4, a state-of-the-art generalist LLM, on various writing scenarios, demonstrating the\nadvantage of training specialized LLMs for writing purposes. Moreover, Weaver natively supports\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling (tool usage). We present various use\ncases of these abilities on improving AI-assisted writing systems, including integration of external\nknowledge bases, tools, or APIs, and providing personalized writing assistance. Furthermore, we dis-\ncuss and summarize a guideline and best practices for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs.\nWeaver is currently accessible at www.wawawriter.com, our innovative human-AI collaborative writing\nplatform (For the English version of WawaWriter, see www.wawawriter.com/en). We discuss a few\ninnovations of the platform from the perspective of human-computer interaction to explain how it will\nrevolutionize traditional AI-assisted writing systems.\n*Corresponding authors: {eleanor,chunshu}@aiwaves.cn\narXiv:2401.17268v1  [cs.CL]  30 Jan 2024\nContents\n1\nIntroduction\n4\n2\nPre-training\n6\n2.1\nModel Family . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n6\n2.2\nPre-training Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n7\n2.3\nTraining Details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n7\n3\nData Synthesis\n8\n3.1\nAbilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n8\n3.1.1\nInstruction Following . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n8\n3.1.2\nInstruction Annotation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n9\n3.1.3\nEvaluation (Literary Critic)\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n10\n3.1.4\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n10\n3.1.5\nFunction Calling\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n10\n3.2\nInstruction Backtranslation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n10\n3.3\nConstitutional DPO: Learning From Principled Negative Examples . . . . . . . . . . .\n12\n4\nAlignment\n14\n4.1\nSupervised Fine-tuning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n4.1.1\nData . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n4.1.2\nTraining . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n4.2\nPreference Optimization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n4.2.1\nData . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n4.2.2\nTraining . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n5\nEvaluation\n14\n5.1\nWriteBench . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n14\n5.2\nCompared Models\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n15\n5.3\nLLM-based Evaluation\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n15\n5.4\nHuman Evaluation\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n16\n5.5\nUser Study . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n16\n6\nIntroducing WawaWriter\n17\n6.1\nHuman-AI Collaborative Writing\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n17\n6.2\nIntegration of External Knowledge and Tools . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n17\n6.3\nPersonalized Writing Assistance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n17\n2\n6.4\nInfinite Long Text Generation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n18\n7\nDiscussion\n18\nA\nAppendix\n24\nA.1 Author Contributions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n24\nA.2 Acknowledgments\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n24\nA.3 Case Study\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n24\n3\n1. Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Anthropic, 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Google, 2023; Jiang et al.,\n2023a; OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Radford et al., 2018, 2019; Gemini Team, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a,b;\nYin et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) based on Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become a\nprominent pathway to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). LLMs acquire massive world knowledge\nby learning to predict the next word on large-scale web corpora. The capabilities of LLMs have been\ncontinuously increasing by scaling model sizes, dataset sizes, and computation. After pre-training,\nLLMs can be aligned to support real-world use cases by supervised fine-tuning (Chung et al., 2022;\nSanh et al., 2022) and preference optimization techniques including reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023b) and direct\npreference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The capabilities of LLMs have empowered\nvarious applications including ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Microsoft Copilot, Character.AI, Notion AI, etc.\nRecently, many specialized LLMs have been trained for different targeted usage scenarios. In general,\nLLMs specialize according to the targeted domains (e.g., finance (Wu et al., 2023), healthcare (Yang\net al., 2022b), legal (Cui et al., 2023), etc.) and tasks (e.g., role-playing (Wang et al., 2023d),\ncoding (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), etc.). However, the ability of LLMs to write human-like texts and\nproduce creative content, which is a critical use case of LLM applications such as ChatGPT, is mostly\noverlooked by the community.\nIn this report, we focus on the literature domain and the task of writing, or content creation,\nand introduce Weaver, a family of LLMs dedicatedly pre-trained and aligned for this purpose. The\nname \"Weaver\" symbolizes the model\u2019s proficiency in skillfully amalgamating linguistic elements,\nakin to the way a craftsman weaves threads to form a fabric. We answer four main questions in this\ntechnical report: why we need Weaver, how we train Weaver, how Weaver performs, and what\nwe build with Weaver.\n34.0\nUnknown\nUnknown\n14.0\n34.0\nUnknown\n72.0\n6.0\n14.0\n1.8\n6.0\n1.8\nNumber of Model Parameters (Billions)\n7.2\n7.4\n7.6\n7.8\n8.0\n8.2\n8.4\n8.6\nWriteBench Overall Score\nWeaver Ultra\nGLM4\nGPT-4\nWeaver Pro\nYi-34B\nClaude2\nQwen-72B\nWeaver BaseQwen-14B\nWeaver Mini\nYi-6B\nQwen-1.8B\nFigure 1 | Comparison between Weaver and\ngeneralist LLMs on WriteBench.\nWhy we need Weaver? Despite generalist LLMs\nsuch as GPTs already possessing general writ-\ning skills and helping billions of users in vari-\nous writing scenarios, they often struggle to pro-\nduce human-like texts in specific writing scenar-\nios such as writing stories, fiction, social media\ncopies, blogs, papers/thesis, etc.\nWe analyze\nthe behavior of pre-trained base LLMs such as\nLLaMA and aligned LLMs such as ChatGPT and\nLLaMA-chat and believe this limitation originates\nfrom both the pre-training stage and the align-\nment stage. On one hand, generalist LLMs are\npre-trained on massive low-quality web texts or\nmachine/AI-generated texts. Consequently, ex-\nisting LLM backbones tend to produce seemingly\nfluent texts that are not creative enough and lack\nhuman-like styles. On the other hand, during\nthe alignment stage, state-of-the-art LLMs such\nas GPT-4 are instruction-tuned using instruction-response pairs annotated by crowdsource annotators\n(Ji et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c). However, most of the annotators are not\nprofessional writers or content creators and the annotation guidelines only require them to produce\nhelpful and harmless responses (Ouyang et al., 2022b). As a result, the crowdsourced data for\nsupervised fine-tuning is less stylish and lacks creativity. Furthermore, most popular preference\n4\noptimization methods such as RLHF and DPO optimize the model on model-generated data pairs,\nmaking them less suitable for enhancing the creativity of LLMs.\nThese factors make current generalist LLMs lack creativity and unable to produce human-style\ntexts despite they are super powerful in other applications such as writing codes and answering\ngeneral questions. We believe this phenomenon will continue to be amplified given that the amount\nof LLM-generated texts on the internet is exponentially growing and most LLMs are aligned using\ntexts produced by other LLMs. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to train domain-specific LLMs\ndedicated to writing purposes that are creative and generate human-like texts in order to fully exploit\nthe potential of AI-generated content (AIGC).\nHow we train Weaver? To address the aforementioned issues limiting generalist LLMs\u2019 creative\nwriting ability, we carefully design a suite of strategies for automated data collection, data annotation,\nand data filtering for pre-training and alignment. This makes us able to pre-train and align Weaver on\ndiverse, human-like, and stylish texts. To be specific, we conduct extensive pre-training data filtering\nand only keep high-quality content such as books, fiction, stories, and articles in the pre-training\ncorpus, making the pre-trained backbones more likely to produce human-like texts.\nAs for the alignment stage, we propose a new instruction backtranslation framework inspired by\nLongForm (K\u00f6ksal et al., 2023) and Humpback (Li et al., 2023) that synthesize diverse and natural\ninstructions that correspond to high-quality outputs written by professional writers and preferred by\nhuman consumers. Our instruction backtranslation framework translated the work of crowdsource\nannotators from writing both instructions and outputs to simply collecting high-quality content such\nas stories, fiction, articles, social media copies, and blog posts. This massively reduces the cost of\ninstruction data annotation and the requirement for crowdsource annotators while significantly\nimproving the quality of annotated data.\nMoreover, we also propose a novel Constitutional DPO algorithm for preference optimization to\nbetter align Weaver to the preference of professional writers and content creators. Constitutional\nDPO is inspired by and combines the advantages of a few previous works including DPO (Rafailov\net al., 2023), Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022), Self-Align (Sun et al., 2023), and RLCD (Yang\net al., 2023a). Specifically, Constitutional DPO exploits expert (e.g., professional editors in our case)\nannotated principles to synthesize negative examples that violate certain principles based on positive\nexamples that are sampled from the optimal policy (e.g., texts produced by professional writers or\ncontent creators in our case). In contrast to the common practice of using DPO that uses LLMs to\nproduce preference annotation on two model-generated responses such as Zephyr (Tunstall et al.,\n2023), the pairwise preference data synthesized by our approach contains less noise since the negative\nexample are deliberately synthesized to be of lower quality compared to the positive example. The\npairwise preference data generated by Consitutional DPO also contains more principled and targeted\nlearning signals that can be adjusted by human experts according to target domains and applications.\nFurthermore, we propose to transform the annotation instructions and responses used in the\ninstruction backtranslation and Constitutional DPO stages into annotation instructions and evaluation\ninstructions. In this way, Weaver not only possesses abilities to follow writing instructions but can\nalso annotate writing instructions and evaluate writing outputs. We also curate instruction data for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling to enable Weaver to exploit external\nknowledge and tools. The combination of different data sources makes Weaver a versatile foundation\nmodel while specializing in creative writing.\nHow Weaver performs? Evaluating the content creation/writing ability of LLMs remains an\nopen problem since existing benchmarks for LLMs such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) or MT-\nBench (Zheng et al., 2023a) mostly focus on reasoning, math, coding, or general questions instead of\n5\ncreative writing. Moreover, it is already notoriously hard to evaluate LLMs on general instructions,\nand it becomes much harder for creative writing tasks since literary critic is non-trivial even for human\nexperts, not to mention LLMs. To better evaluate Weaver and help the LLM community better\nmeasure progress on AIGC, we carefully curate WriteBench, a benchmark for assessing the creative\nwriting capabilities of LLMs and collect outputs from 10+ popular LLMs covering both open-source\nand proprietary models.\nWe then conduct both LLM-based and human evaluation of Weaver and generalist LLMs on the\nbenchmark. Evaluation results confirm the superiority of Weaver compared to generalist LLMs. We\nfind that Weaver Ultra, the most-capable model in the Weaver family, advances the state-of-the-art\nin creative writing despite being 10+ smaller compared to GPT-41, the previous best performing LLM.\nOther models in the Weaver family also surpass competitive generalist LLMs several times larger\nthan them. Our analysis and case studies show that the main source of improvements is because\nWeaver can generate texts that are creative and human-like while generalist LLMs tend to produce\ntoo \u201cpredictable\u201d texts. To confirm that Weaver is truly helpful in real-world applications, we also\nconduct a user study where human writers are asked to write stories (fiction writing) and blog posts\n(non-fiction writing) with Weaver and GPT-4. Our user study shows that compared to GPT-4, Weaver\nimproves the writers\u2019 productivity by 47% and helps writer produce better stories and articles at the\nsame time.\nWhat we build with Weaver? Training specialized LLMs for writing is one side of enhancing AI-\nassisted writing experience. We believe it is also very important to build a better human-AI interface to\nfully exploit the potential of Weaver on AI-assisted writing. To this end, we introduce WawaWriter,\nour innovative human-AI collaborative writing platform. Similar to recent AI writing products such\nas Notion AI, WawaWriter provides a chat interface that allows users to provide diverse writing\ninstructions, instead of merely suggesting the next one or few sentences based on the current context\nor polishing the content as in traditional applications. WawaWriter also takes a few steps further:\n(1) we enable human-AI co-editing by allowing users to customize language agents (Zhou et al.,\n2023b) that acts like a human collaborator by operating inside the editor simultaneously with users;\n(2) we allow users to build personal knowledge bases by saving websites or uploading documents\nand build a RAG pipeline that integrates knowledge bases to Weaver; (3) we propose to provide\npersonalized writing assistance by analyzing users\u2019 personal writing styles using LLMs based on\ntheir writing history on the platform and using the results to guide Weaver\u2019s text generation process.\nBy combining these innovations, WawaWriter aims to provide next-generation AI-assisted writing\nexperience that is more helpful and enjoyable.\nIn the following sections, we first describe the architectures and sizes of the Weaver family and\ntheir pre-training stage. We then present details on the abilities of Weaver, how we synthesize\ntraining data to help Weaver acquire these abilities and learn to produce human-like stylish texts,\nand the details for the alignment stage. We also present our benchmark for evaluating the writing\nabilities of LLMs and the evaluation results. Finally, we introduce the details of WawaWriter and\npresent how Weaver paves the way for next-generation AI-assisted writing experiences.\n2. Pre-training\n2.1. Model Family\nWeaver models are language models built on top of Transformer decoders. We have adopted the\nrecent improvements from the design of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), the most popular open-\n1According to non-official rumor about the size of GPT-4\n6\nsource LLM, including a Pre-Norm structure with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) function,\nSwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) as the activation function for the Feed-Forward Network, Rotary Embedding\n(Su et al., 2024) for positional encoding, and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023).\nThe Weaver family consists of models of four different sizes: Mini, Base, Pro, and Ultra,\nranging from 1.8B to 34B parameters. We train different model sizes to support different applications\nas the complexity of writing tasks varies a lot across different domains and use cases. All Weaver\nmodels are initialized from powerful open-source LLMs. We provide detailed configurations and\ndescriptions of Weaver models in Table 1.\n2.2. Pre-training Data\nWe then present an overview of pre-training data selection strategies and the resulting pre-training\ndata mixture. Since Weaver models are initialized from powerful open-source LLMs and thus already\npossess adequate world knowledge, the amount of continual pre-training data does not need to be\nsuper large. We consider the continual pre-training stage to be the process where Weaver learns to\nreallocate or re-balance its capabilities: the model allocates more capabilities to writing and content\ncreation while reducing the capabilities on other domains such as mathematics and coding.\nTherefore, we only include manually verified data sources including various kinds of content such\nas books, fiction, stories, news articles, papers, reports, social media copies, etc., in the pre-training\ndata. We combine rule-based and machine-learning-based methods to filter low-quality texts. In\naddition to data sources and filtering, we also carefully control the data mixture between different\ndomains. Specifically, we mix fiction data (i.e., fiction and stories) and non-fiction data (i.e., articles,\npapers, reports, etc.) with a ratio of 1 : 1. We also mix Chinese and English data with a portion of\n4 : 1 to make Weaver supports both Chinese and English.\n2.3. Training Details\nWe train Weaver using the standard autoregressive language modeling task where the model learns\nto predict the next token based on the context of previous tokens. We train Weaver models with a\ncontext length of 4096. We shuffle and merge the documents, and then truncate them to the specified\ncontext lengths to create training batches. We incorporate Megatron-Deepspeed (Shoeybi et al., 2019)\nand Flash Attention2 (Dao, 2023; Dao et al., 2022) to improve computational efficiency and reduce\nmemory usage. We adopt the standard optimizer AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) and set the\nhyperparameters \ud835\udefd1 = 0.9, \ud835\udefd2 = 0.95, and \ud835\udf00 = 10\u22128. We use a cosine learning rate schedule with a\nspecified peak learning rate for each model. The learning rate is decayed to a minimum learning rate\nof 10% of the peak learning rate. All models are trained with BFloat16 mixed precision for training\nstability. We present detailed pre-training configurations for each model in Table 1.\nName\nParams\n\ud835\udc5blayers\n\ud835\udc51model\n\ud835\udc5bheads\nContext\nSequence\nLearning\nTokens\nLength\nBatch Size\nRate\nWeaver Mini\n1.8B\n24\n2048\n16\n4096\n512\n1e-4\n50B\nWeaver Base\n6B\n32\n4096\n32\n4096\n512\n1e-4\n50B\nWeaver Pro\n14B\n40\n5120\n40\n4096\n512\n1e-4\n40B\nWeaver Ultra\n34B\n60\n7168\n56\n4096\n520\n5e-5\n18B\nTable 1 | Description for the Weaver family.\n7\n3. Data Synthesis\nAfter pre-training, Weaver models contain a large amount of world knowledge and writing skills\nand can produce human-like texts conditioning on high-quality contexts. To unlock these capabilities\nfor real-world applications, we need to curate a high-quality dataset for alignment. The format\nand quality of the dataset significantly affect the coverage of abilities and the quality of aligned\nmodels. As discussed in the Introduction, the common practice for alignment data collection of\nexisting generalist LLMs severely limits their writing capabilities. In this section, we describe our data\nsynthesis framework in detail. We first describe the abilities we want to unlock during the alignment\nstage and then present our proposed data synthesis methods for both the supervised fine-tuning and\nthe preference optimization stage.\n3.1. Abilities\nWe first describe the categories of abilities we want to unlock for Weaver during the alignment stage.\n3.1.1. Instruction Following\nThe first obvious ability we need to unlock is the ability to follow writing instructions and produce\nhuman-like stylish texts. We cover various domains and tasks as listed below during data collection\nand alignment training.\n3.1.1.1\nDomains\nFiction Writing: Fiction writing refers to the abilities of models to write stories and fiction. We divide\nfiction writing into several subdomains with respect to the length and the genre of the fiction. We\ncover fiction and stories of lengths ranging from a few hundred to a few million characters, and fiction\ntypes including sci-fiction, romance, fantasy, horror, mystery, and thriller.\nCreative Non-Fiction Writing: Creative non-fiction writing is a genre of writing that uses literary\nstyles and techniques to create factually accurate narratives. We cover typical creative non-fiction\nwriting cases including writing memoirs, biography, travelogue, journalism, social media copy, blog\nposts, news articles, commentary, etc.\nMarketing Writing: We also consider marketing writing, which involves writing business plans,\nadvertising copies, product promoting, marketing plans, etc. Marketing writing differs from previous\ncategories because it is highly application-oriented and the style of generated texts is not the most\nimportant. However, marketing writing still requires human-like creativity to attract potential users.\nTechnical Writing: Technical writing includes tasks such as paper writing, patent writing, report\nwriting, etc. Technical writing requires more accuracy compared to creativity. However, writing-\nspecific training can still be helpful because it can help model produce texts that accurately adhere to\nthe style required for specific scenarios.\n3.1.1.2\nTasks\nContent writing: Content writing is the basic task that requires the model to generate content\n(i.e., fiction, articles, etc.) based on certain instructions. Writing instructions vary in terms of whether\nthe previous context is provided and how fine-grained the given instructions are. The task requires\nthe LLM to be able to understand and adhere to specific requirements expressed in the instructions\n8\nwhile also producing texts that are consistent and coherent with previous contexts. For example, a\ntypical content writing instruction is: \u201cPlease help me write a sci-fi about what will happen after\npeople finally achieve AGI.\u201d\nOutlining: Outlining is the task of writing outlines, which is a common practice for writers in both\nfiction and non-fiction writing. As discussed in the literature of long text generation (Sun et al.,\n2022; Yang et al., 2022a, 2023b; Zhou et al., 2019, 2023a), it is often helpful to let the model first\ngenerate an outline before generating long texts. Outlines vary according to different domains and\nthe granularity/length of outlines. One example for the task of outlining is \u201cPlease help me write an\noutline of my annual work report.\u201d\nPolishing & Editing: Polishing and editing require the model to improve the quality of a paragraph or\nrewrite it following the requirements expressed in the instructions. The task is closely related to the\ntask of grammatical error correction (Bryant et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2014) with a key difference that\nthe modifications are not necessarily grammatical errors. Compared to the task of academic writing\npolishing described in Diao et al. (2023), we support customized fine-grained control of polishing or\nediting requirements, which is important for human-AI interaction in AI-assisted writing systems. A\ntypical polishing instruction may look like this: \u201cPlease help me revise the following texts, keep in\nmind that the revised texts should be suitable for an academic paper.\u201d\nStyle Transferring: The task of text style transfering requires the model to transform texts in one\nstyle into another style. For example, one may want to transform a story into a script or turn a report\ninto a speechwriting. We cover both template-based style transfer that uses a template to provide\ntarget style information (Guu et al., 2018; Lewis et al., 2020) and description-based style transfer\nwhich uses either a keyword (Hu et al., 2017) or a short description (Zhou et al., 2023c) for the target\nstyle. For example, one may ask the model to \u201cTransform the following book chapter into a script.\u201d\nExpanding/Simplifying: Text expanding and simplifying requires the model to revise an input\nparagraph to make it longer or shorter according to certain instructions. Text summarization and\nsummary-to-article generation can be regarded as two extreme cases of this task. One exemplar\ninstruction is: \u201cPlease help me summarize this paragraph into one sentence.\u201d.\nBrainstorming: Brainstorming requires the model to help users come up with creative ideas based\non the current context and user instructions. A typical brainstorming instruction is: \u201cPlease give\nme 5 possible character descriptions for a villain to appear in the next chapter, including his name,\nappearance, occupation, and background.\u201d\nReviewing: Reviewing refers to the task of reading and analyzing a given piece of text critically and\nthen producing comments or revising suggestions. For example, one may ask the model to \u201cPlease\ntake a look at my essay and list 5 suggestions to improve it.\u201d\n3.1.2. Instruction Annotation\nWe also train Weaver to support the instruction annotation task. As described in Humpback (Li\net al., 2023) and LongForm (K\u00f6ksal et al., 2023), given a piece of text, the task requires the model\nto generate an instruction to which the input texts may be the answer. However, vanilla instruction\nbacktranslation only supports the writing task. Therefore, for instruction annotation, we require\nthe model to synthesize an instruction-response pair based on a text span. The response can be the\ntext span, a part of the text span, or inferred from the text span. This substantially broadens the\nscope for vanilla instruction backtranslation since most automatically mined text spans may not be\nsuitable for a certain instruction on itself while a part of the text span can be a valid response or\none may construct a high-quality instruction-response pair based on it. The instruction annotation\n9\nability enables Weaver to mine training data for itself on large-scale corpus, opening the possibility\nof scalable self-training on web data.\n3.1.3. Evaluation (Literary Critic)\nMany recent work explored using or training LLMs to evaluate general instruction following tasks (Chan\net al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023b). However, we find generalist LLMs require\nextensive prompting skills to make them suitable for evaluating tasks related to creative writing.\nMoreover, since almost all students majoring in creative writing are also required to take literary\ncritic courses, we think learning to perform literary critic may be helpful for the model to produce\nbetter texts as well. Therefore, we also train Weaver to judge the quality of the responses to writing\ninstructions and do pairwise comparison of two responses.\nWe collect human preference between model outputs in WawaWriter, our AI-assisted writing\nplatform and convert the collected preference data to training data for LLM-based evaluation with\ncarefully curated templates.\n3.1.4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nThe ability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Gao et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020), i.e.,\ngenerating responses by referring to external knowledge or references as context. RAG is an important\ntechnique that helps LLMs generate more accurate and informed responses. It can be especially\nhelpful for writing purposes since it\u2019s common for human writers to refer to other text samples when\nwriting fiction or articles. However, most existing LLMs purely rely on prompt engineering to do RAG\nand do not perform RAG training during alignment. We believe this limits the ability of LLMs to\nmake use of retrieved contexts. Therefore, we propose to include RAG-aware training data during\nalignment to enhance Weaver\u2019s retrieval-augmented generation ability. Specifically, we augment\n10% percent of training data by appending a relevant context obtained by retrieving the paragraph\nmost similar to the target response. In this way, Weaver learns to write by referring to external\ncontexts and is thus more compatible with RAG techniques compared to most existing LLMs.\n3.1.5. Function Calling\nThe ability to use tools is also very important for LLMs (Schick et al., 2023). This ability, also referred\nto as \u201cfunction calling\u201d, is also helpful for writing because the model may need to search the internet\nfor references or call editor APIs when doing human-AI collaborative writing. To unlock the function\ncalling ability, we include an open-source function calling dataset2 into supervised fine-tuning data.\nWe also propose a new pipeline to synthesize more diverse function calling data by first using GPT-4\nto synthesize diverse environments with multiple tools and APIs, as well as their documentation.\nWe then randomly select one API at a time and ask GPT-4 to imagine a situation where the API can\nbe helpful and the plausible arguments for the API. We then reason what one may instruct an LLM\nin that situation so that the API should be used with the arguments. Finally, similar to how GPTs\nsupport function calling, we train Weaver to use tools by selecting the right API and generating the\narguments given the instructions and the contexts.\n3.2. Instruction Backtranslation\nWe then describe our proposed improved pipeline for instruction backtranslation. The motivation\nfor doing instruction backtranslation instead of instruction augmentation methods such as self-\n2https://huggingface.co/glaiveai\n10\nDomain\nSubdomain\nDescription\nSource\nFiction Writing\nFull Novel\nWeb novel, over 1M\nwords\nProprietary\nShort Story\nWeb stories, 10k-20k\nwords\nProprietary\nCreative Non-Fiction Writing\nRed\nTop liked and com-\nmented posts on Red\nPicked\nZhihu\nTop upvoted posts on\nZhihu\nPicked\nWeibo\nTop liked posts on\nWeibo\nPicked\nWeChat Articles\nTop read articles on\nWeChat\nPicked\nDouBan\nTop liked posts on\nDouBan\nPicked\nNews & Blogs\nPopular news/blogs\nPicked\nTechnical Writing\nPapers\nAcademic papers on\nCNKI\nPicked\nEssay\nOnline essays\nPicked\nContract\nContracts from online\nsources\nPicked\nReports\nReports\nfor\nwork,\nbusiness, science, etc.\nProprietary\nCopies\nBusiness & Govern-\nment copies\nProprietary\nMarketing Writing\nBusiness Plans\nBusiness\nplans\nfor\nprojects and startups\nProprietary\nIndustry Report\nResearch report for\ndifferent industries\nProprietary\nAdvertising Copy\nPopular copies for ad-\nvertisements\nPicked\nMarketing Plan\nMarketing plans for\nproducts & services\nPicked\nProduct Overview\nArticles\nadvertising\nproducts\nPicked\nTable 2 | Description of SFT Data sources. We combine similar subdomains in the same fields for\nsimplicity. The entire training set covers 34 subdomains and around 500,000 instruction-output pairs.\n\u201cPicked\u201d means the raw data in the corresponding domains are manually selected.\ninstruct (Wang et al., 2023a) is very simple: we want to align Weaver on high-quality, stylish, and\n11\nhuman-written texts. To achieve this goal, we first collect high-quality stories, fiction chapters, and\ncopies of different domains. We list the categories of collected texts in Table 2.\nWe then use a carefully designed few-shot prompt template to synthesize instruction-response\npairs for all aforementioned writing tasks. Specifically, for each subdomain-task pair, we annotate 5\ncases of how one can write an instruction-response pair, including both the annotated results and the\nrationales for the annotation process: we first select a text span from a case as the output (except\nfor outlining, brainstorming, and reviewing tasks where the output is transformed from the selected\ntext span with an additional prompt). We then identify or produce the context for the output. For\nexample, for the polishing task, the context should be a worse version of the target output, so we\ncan modify the wording and structure of the target output to make it look worse. Then we infer\nthe instruction that one may use to transform the context to the output. Taking the polishing task\nas an example again, we need to reason what modifications are made and synthesize the polishing\ninstructions accordingly. For each unlabeled case, we use the annotated cases as few-shot exemplars\nand ask GPT-4 to first generate the annotation process in the Chain-of-Thought style (Wei et al.,\n2022) and then produce the synthesized instruction-response pairs. The instruction backtranslation\npipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. We synthesize 500,000 high-quality instruction-response pairs\nacross all domains and tasks with this pipeline. Finally, we do an instruction data selection procedure\nfollowing the practice described in (Liu et al., 2023): we first score all instruction-response pairs with\nGPT-3.5-turbo and then select top-ranked data in each subdomain-task pair for supervised fine-tuning.\nSpecifically, we score each instruction-response pair based on the quality and the diversity of the\ninstruction and the relevance between the instruction and the response.\nEditors\n[Domain] Technical Writing\n[Principle 1] The arguments should be illustrated logically \u2026\n[Instruction] Help me write a paper \u2026\n[Example-Accepted] The results well demonstrate the \u2026.\n[Example-Rejected] As we conducted experiments, it is good\u2026\n[Domain] Creative Non-fiction Writing\n[Principle 2] The contents should be eye-catching\u2026\n[Instruction] Report an accident with black bears \u2026\n[Example-Accepted] Black bears rarely attack.

Constitutional DPO: Learning From Principled Negative Examples\nFinally, we propose Constitutional DPO, a novel alignment method that encourages LLMs to learn from\npreference data consisting of samples from the optimal policy and \u201cprincipled\u201d negative examples\nsynthesized with AI feedback. Our approach combines the advantages of Constitutional AI (Bai et al.,\n2022; Sun et al., 2023), which train reward models based on principles written by human experts,\nRLCD (Yang et al., 2023a), which prompt LLMs to generate positive/negative examples and train\nreward models with AI-generated preference data, and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), which omits\n12\nTable 3 | Examples of expert-annotated principles in four domains and sampled tasks.\nDomain\nTask\nPrinciples\nCreative Non-\nfiction Writing\nContent Writing\nThe content should be created to encourage readers to\nengage in interactions, comments, etc.\nPolishing & Editing\nThe revised content should align with the original text.\nBrainstorming\nThe content should refrain from pre-judging ideas.\nTechnical Writing\nContent Writing\nThe generated content should avoid bias toward certain\ngenders, professions, regions, etc.\nStyle Transferring\nThe style of the content should be consistent with the\nlanguage style specified in the instructions.\nFiction\nContent Writing\nThe perspective should remain consistent with the out-\nline or previous content.\nOutlining\nThe global outline should not be too brief or general,\nomitting key plot points.\nMarketing Writng\nContent Writing\nThe content of the market writing should be accurate.\nSummarizing\nThe summarized content should be all-encompassing,\nleaving out no crucial points.\nreward model training and does direct preference optimization.\nSpecifically, we first invite human experts including professional writers, editors, and content\ncreators to annotate principles for different writing tasks. Different from previous \u201cprinciple-based\u201d\napproaches that only write a short description of the principles, for each principle we also collect\none case adhering to the principle and one case violating the principle, as well as natural language\nrationales explaining why the cases adhere or violate the principle. Then we sample a subset of the\ninstruction data with the highest scores in the aforementioned data filtering process and consider them\nas samples from the optimal policy as the output texts are carefully selected and instruction-output\npairs are top-ranked. For each sample, we first present the principles for the task and ask GPT to\nanalyze which principle can best explain why the response is of good quality. We then ask GPT to\nsynthesize a counterpart of the response violating the principle while adding minimal modifications\nand do not affect other good aspects of the original response.\nWith the collected data, we consider the original-perturbed response pairs as (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59) pairs and\ndo standard DPO training. In this way, each data pair contains critical training signals about the\ncorresponding principles and helps fine-tune the model to follow the principles. The preference data\nsynthesized by our approach contains much less noise compared to standard RLAIF pipeline, especially\nin writing domains since LLMs struggles to do literary critic. Compared to RLCD, the most related\nmethod for preference data generation, we consider high-quality SFT data instead of LLM-generated\nas positive examples and use expert-written principles for negative example generation. This makes\nthe training signal less noisy and more principled.\n13\n4. Alignment\n4.1. Supervised Fine-tuning\n4.1.1. Data\nTo collect the dataset for supervised fine-tuning, we first collect high-quality content written by\nhuman writers and content creators according to their metadata including their ratings, number of\nreads, upvotes, and comments. We adopt the aforementioned data synthesis framework to synthesize\ninstruction following data covering 30+ fine-grained domains and over 10 tasks, instruction annotation\ndata, text generation evaluation data, retrieval-augmented generation data, and function calling data.\nThe combined instruction tuning dataset consists of around 1,000,000 samples. We then run the data\nfiltering process and select 400,000 data points as the final dataset for supervised fine-tuning.\n4.1.2. Training\nWe fine-tune the continual pre-trained models for 3 to 5 epochs. We use a cosine learning rate\nscheduler with a peak learning rate of 1e-5 and 2e-5 for larger models (i.e., Weaver Ultra and\nWeaver Pro) and 4e-5 for smaller models (i.e., Weaver Base and Weaver Mini) with 5% warmup\nsteps. We train all models with a global batch size of 256. After supervised fine-tuning, we select the\nbest-performing checkpoint on an internal validation set for preference optimization.\n4.2. Preference Optimization\n4.2.1. Data\nFor preference optimization, we select 500 highest-rated samples in the data filtering stage for each\nsubdomain as positive examples for the Constitutional DPO pipeline. We collect over 200 principles\nand their corresponding few-shot exemplars. We generate one negative example per positive example,\nresulting in 25,000 preference data pairs.\n4.2.2. Training\nWe fine-tune the supervised fine-tuned models using the conventional DPO algorithm. We train our\nmodels for three to five epochs. We use a linear learning rate scheduler with a peak learning rate of\n5e-7 and 5% warmup steps. We train Weaver Ultra using a global batch size of 40, while for the\nothers we use 32 and set \ud835\udefd = 0.1. We select the best-performing checkpoint on the internal validation\nset as the final Weaver models.\n5. Evaluation\n5.1. WriteBench\nMost existing benchmarks for LLMs (Zheng et al., 2023a) and natural language generation (Jiang et al.,\n2023c; Lin et al., 2020) focus on the reasoning ability or the general-purpose instruction following\nability instead of the ability of LLMs to produce creative, stylish, and human-like text content. To this\nend, we construct WriteBench, a new benchmark for assessing the writing capabilities of LLMs3.\nSimilar to how we collect training data for Weaver, WriteBench is designed to cover multiple\ndomains and tasks. To ensure a fair comparison between Weaver and compared generalist LLMs, the\n3WriteBench will be publically available at https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/WriteBench\n14\ndata collection and data selection process for instructions in WriteBench is done by our independent\nevaluation team. The resulting WriteBench consists of over 1000 testing instructions covering\nfour domains including fiction writing, creative non-fiction writing, technical writing, and marketing\nwriting. The first release of the WriteBench benchmark is in Chinese since we want to measure the\nChinese writing capabilities of the compared models.\n5.2. Compared Models\nWe compare Weaver with competitive Chinese LLMs including both open-sourced models and\nproprietary models of different sizes, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GLM-4, Claude2, Gemini Pro, ERNIE-\nBot-4.0, ERNIE-Bot-3.5, Qwen-72B-Chat, Qwen-14B-Chat, Qwen-7B-Chat, Qwen-1.8B-Chat, YI-34B-\nChat, YI-6B-Chat, and ChatGLM3-6B. We directly use the same instructions in WriteBench as input\nprompts for all tested LLMs and collect the model outputs as responses.\nTable 4 | LLM-based Evaluation Results\nModels\nStyle\nRelevance\nCreativity\nOverall\nWeaver Ultra\n8.94\n8.96\n7.71\n8.54\nGLM-4\n8.83\n9.55\n6.58\n8.32\nGPT-4\n8.80\n9.45\n6.32\n8.19\nWeaver Pro\n8.52\n8.45\n7.3\n8.09\nYI-34B-Chat\n8.70\n9.17\n6.26\n8.04\nClaude2\n8.42\n8.89\n6.41\n7.91\nQwen-72B-Chat\n8.47\n8.98\n5.95\n7.80\nWeaver Base\n8.61\n8.81\n5.89\n7.77\nQwen-14B-Chat\n8.51\n8.85\n5.89\n7.75\nWeaver Mini\n8.41\n8.38\n6.35\n7.71\nGemini Pro\n8.39\n8.79\n5.88\n7.69\nQwen-7B-Chat\n8.40\n8.80\n5.81\n7.67\nYi-6B-Chat\n8.24\n8.67\n6.00\n7.64\nChatGLM3-6B\n8.16\n8.70\n5.86\n7.57\nGPT-3.5\n8.37\n8.65\n5.60\n7.54\nERNIE-Bot-3.5\n8.24\n8.22\n5.71\n7.39\nERNIE-Bot-4.0\n8.15\n8.05\n5.61\n7.27\nQwen-1.8B-Chat\n7.97\n7.86\n5.66\n7.16\n5.3. LLM-based Evaluation\nWe first perform an LLM-based evaluation to do a coarse-grained evaluation of the compared models.\nWe use GPT-4 as the judge to score each instruction-response pair following the practice and prompt\ntemplates in MT-Bench. The results are shown in Table 4. We find that in terms of writing style\nand creativity, Weaver Ultra significantly outperforms all proprietary models including strong\ncompetitors such as GPT-4 and GLM-4. GPT-4 and GLM-4 are better at the relevance metric because\nthey are at least few times larger than Weaver Ultra and thus have better instruction-following\nability. As for Weaver of other sizes, we can see that with only 14B parameters, Weaver Pro\noutperforms all open-source models including those with 70B and 34B parameters, as well as most\nproprietary models. Similarly, Weaver Base and Weaver Mini are also comparable with generalist\nLLMs with more than two times their sizes. Overall, the results confirm the effectiveness of our data\nsynthesis and training framework for LLMs specialized in creative writing.\n15\nTable 5 | Human Preference on Fiction Writing with the Elo Ranking System\nModels\nCreativity\nStyle\nRelevance\nFluency\nOverall\nWeaver Ultra\n1682\n1661\n1689\n1641\n1657\nGPT-4\n1507\n1513\n1421\n1534\n1508\nERNIE-Bot-4.0\n1404\n1409\n1564\n1544\n1477\nGemini Pro\n1513\n1469\n1409\n1360\n1430\nGLM-4\n1391\n1445\n1415\n1417\n1425\nTable 6 | Overall Human Preference with the Elo Ranking System\nModels\nCreativity\nStyle\nRelevance\nFluency\nOverall\nWeaver Ultra\n1589\n1590\n1593\n1588\n1576\nGLM-4\n1482\n1527\n1491\n1513\n1521\nGPT-4\n1468\n1505\n1427\n1501\n1501\nGemini Pro\n1548\n1490\n1434\n1380\n1454\nERNIE-Bot-4.0\n1410\n1385\n1552\n1515\n1445\n5.4. Human Evaluation\nWe then perform a human evaluation to compare Weaver with a few representative LLMs including\nGPT-4, GLM-4, ERNIE-Bot-4.0, and Gemini-pro. We recruit 44 professional Chinese writers or editors\nas human annotators in human evaluation. We adopt the practice in the ChatBot Arena4 benchmark\nand let human annotators perform three-way pairwise comparisons between two model outputs\naccording to their creativity, stylish, relevance, and fluency. We collect 3540 comparison results\nand compute the ELO rating of the compared models. The results on fiction writing and the overall\ncomparison are shown in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. We can see that professional writers and\neditors rates Weaver Ultra significantly better than compared models across all metrics. As for\nother compared models, we find that GPT-4 and Gemini Pro are considered to produce more creative\nand human-like texts compared to GLM-4 and ERNIE-Bot, we suspect this is because GLM and ERNIE\nare aligned using GPT distillation data, which probably harms their creativity.\n5.5. User Study\nA good LLM for AI-assisted writing should not only be best-performing on benchmarks but also truly\nhelpful in real-world writing scenarios. To evaluate how truly helpful Weaver is, we conduct a user\nstudy where 5 professional writers are recruited as subjects. Each subject is provided with two chat\ninterfaces, one with Weaver Ultra and the other with GPT-4. We then let each subject write two\nshort stories (with two carefully selected topic) of around 6,000 words with two same chat interfaces\npowered by GPT-4 and Weaver Ultra respectively5. We measure the time used by the same writer\nfor finishing the two stories and ask a professional editor to judge their quality. We find that compared\nto GPT-4, Weaver Ultra improves the efficiency of the writer by around 3 times. Furthermore, out\nof 5 topics, the human editor prefer Weaver generated story for 4 times and can not decide the\nwinner for the remaining topic. Our user interview reveals that the efficiency improvement mainly\ncomes from the fact that Weaver is faster and generates more human-like texts that require less\n4https://chat.lmsys.org/\n5To ensure fair comparison, we give enough time and trials for the writers to get familiar with the interface and the\nmodels.\n16\npost-editing.\n6. Introducing WawaWriter\nIn this section, we describe WawaWriter, a next-generation AI-assisted writing platform we build to\nfully unleash the capabilities of Weaver. WawaWriter integrates key features of recent AI-assisted\nwriting platforms (e.g., Notion AI) including AI-assisted generation, polishment, and summarization\nwhile also implementing a few new innovations for next-generation AI-writing experience. We describe\nthese innovations in the following sections.\n6.1. Human-AI Collaborative Writing\nOne major innovation in WawaWriter is a new interface for human-AI collaborative writing, which\ndelivers a drastically different user experience compared to traditional AI-assisted writing platforms.\nThanks to the Agents (Zhou et al., 2023b) framework, we are able to build controllable writing agents\nthat act like independent human collaborators/co-authors in standard collaborative editors such\nas Google Docs or Notion. The writing agents understands the goal of the current document by\nreading customized settings such as the title or a short description of the document. It then takes\nactions according to the current content in the document and the recent actions of human users (or\nother writing agents) that reveal their focus. Human users can also chat with the writing agents\nin a chat interface to instruct them what to do. The ability of writing agents to use both external\nAPIs such as web search and build-in editor APIs such as bolding or adjusting the line space enables\nthem to accomplish tasks much more complex than what conventional AI assistants can do. With the\nhuman-agent interaction feature in the Agents framework, WriteBench also supports collaborative\nediting between multiple human writers and language agents. Users can customize their multiple\nwriting agents and collaborate with one or a few of them when writing stories or articles. Users can\nspecify tasks for each writing agent while multiple writing agents can also communicate with each\nother to autonomously distribute labors.\n6.2. Integration of External Knowledge and Tools\nAnother new feature of WawaWriter is that users can now build their own personal knowledge\nbases via document uploading or saving web pages. WawaWriter automatically organizes and\nsummarizes the knowledge base and then uses them as references when writing stories and articles.\nSpecifically, we prompt an LLM to split documents into chunks based on their semantics, embed them\nwith our embedding model, and store them in a VectorDB. During writing, we dynamically retrieve\nthe entries of the user\u2019s personal knowledge base using semantic search using the current context in\nthe user\u2019s editor as the query. Following Socratic Models (Zeng et al., 2023), our knowledge base\nalso supports images in documents by using GPT-4V to do detailed captioning for each image and\nthen using the captions as entries representing the corresponding images. Users can also edit the\ndocuments in their personal knowledge bases using all AI-writing features in WawaWriter. In\naddition, writing agents described in the previous section can also access the personal knowledge\nbase of a user through function calling.\n6.3. Personalized Writing Assistance\nDifferent from current AI-assisted writing systems, WawaWriter provides personalized writing\nassistance for different users that suits their writing styles and content preferences. To achieve, we\nmaintain a text-based user profile for each user which describes some basic writing habits and styles\n17\n(e.g., choice of words and punctuation, preference for the length of sentences, etc.) of the user. The\nuser profile is periodically updated using an LLM according to the recent texts written by the user with\na carefully a designed prompt. The user profile is then used as a prefix in the prompt for Weaver. In\naddition to text-based user profiles, we also retrieve paragraphs that are most similar to the current\ncontext in the editor and use them as references for RAG.\n6.4. Infinite Long Text Generation\nWawaWriter also supports infinite long text generation since Weaver natively supports the recurrent\nprompting technique proposed by (Zhou et al., 2023a). Specifically, to generate a very long text, we\niteratively prompt Weaver to generate an outline based on the current context and then generate a\nparagraph of text based on the generated outline. WawaWriter integrates the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d mode\nand the \u201ccontinuous\u201d mode in RecurrentGPT, where the next outline is either manually selected by\nthe user or automatically selected by an LLM. As discussed in Zhou et al. (2023a), this recurrent\nprompting mechanism drastically improves the creativity, consistency, and relevance of the generated\nlong text, this is especially helpful for story/fiction writing with WawaWriter.\n7. Discussion\nIn this technical report, we introduce Weaver, a family of LLMs specialized for writing endeavors.\nWeaver is continually pre-trained on carefully curated datasets and then aligned to the preferences of\nprofessional writers and editors using a novel data synthesis framework. We also release WriteBench,\nthe first benchmark for evaluating the writing capabilies of LLMs. WriteBench covers multiple\ndomains and tasks related to writing. We compare Weaver with 10+ popular generalist LLMs\nand find that Weaver Ultra is the current state-of-the-art on the benchmark. Our user study also\nconfirms the superiority of Weaver in real-world AI-assisted writing scenarios. The results also\nconfirm the effectiveness of our data synthesis pipeline for training domain-specific LLMs.\nReferences\nJ. Ainslie, J. Lee-Thorp, M. de Jong, Y. Zemlyanskiy, F. Lebr\u00f3n, and S.

The increasing demand for\nhigh-quality digital contents has made 3D generation a significant\ntopic of research. Recently, in the 2D domain, denoise diffusion\nmodels [Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015], have demonstrated remark-\nable results in image synthesis and beyond, leading to the devel-\nopment of production-ready 2D generation tools, such as Stable\nDiffusion [Rombach et al. 2022a], Midjourney, and Dall-E [Ramesh\net al. 2021]. The success in 2D domain has significantly sparked\ninterest in the development of 3D generation tools. A multitude of\nresearches on 3D generation have been published recently, most no-\ntable works include DreamFusion [Poole et al. 2022], Rodin [Wang\net al. 2023], Get3D [Gao et al. 2022], Zero123 [Liu et al. 2023d],\nSyncDreamer [Liu et al. 2023b], and LRM ([Hong et al. 2023]), etc.\nHowever, existing methods mainly focus on the generation of 3D\ncontent with fixed spatial extent (such as a small object of finite\nsize). In this paper, we investigate a relatively new yet increasingly\nimportant task: generating expandable (hence infinite) 3D scenes. This\ntask is particularly valuable for video gaming industry, as it delivers\nan immersive gaming experience by allowing users to interact freely\nwith the world without being restricted by a predetermined world\nboundary, as seen in open-world games. Nonetheless, creating an\nunbounded and freely explorable scene is a non-trivial task. Current\npractices typically rely on artists\u2019 manual labor, a time-consuming\nand costly process.\nGenerating expandable 3D scenes using diffusion models poses\ntwo major challenges: First, 1) the generation of high-fidelity 3D\nshapes at the scene level is a difficult problem. The variance in 3D\nscenes is orders of magnitude greater than in single objects. A scene\ncomprises basic objects, and the possibilities for arranging these\nobjects are limitless. This high level of diversity makes it difficult\nto approximate its distribution using diffusion probabilistic models.\nBesides, 2) the expansion from an existing scene to a larger one\nis non-trival. The transition area between the old and new scenes\nneeds to be both semantically and geometrically harmonious, adding\nanother layer of complexity to the task.\nText2Room [H\u00f6llein et al. 2023] is the most closely related work to\nour task. It employs a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to generate 2D\nimages and lifts them to a 3D scene via the camera viewpoint and the\nestimated depth images. A scene is expanded by merging generated\nimages from incrementally added camera viewpoints. Therefore, it\nis able to generate expandable 3D scenes with impressive texture\nresults, though only at the room scale. However, since it critically\nrelies on a monocular depth prediction, a poor depth prediction\nwill lead to distorted geometry with missing details. In addition, the\nway it expands a scene (i.e., by leveraging a moving perspective\ncamera) makes it difficult to be extended beyond the room scale.\nThis is because a perspective camera is prone to occlusion. For\ninstance, when the camera passes through a wall, the continuity of\nthe image can be disrupted by occlusion, which could also lead to\ndiscontinuities in the generated 3D shapes.\nInstead of generating 3D through 2D image lifting, another re-\nsearch direction involves directly learning to produce 3D data, using\nsupervision from either 3D shape ground truths or posed multi-\nview images. Notable methods include EG3D [Chan et al. 2022],\nRodin [Wang et al. 2023], and Get3D [Gao et al. 2022], etc. These\napproaches represent 3D data with a continuous hybrid neural field\narchitecture, typically consisting of a tri-plane and an MLP decoder.\nThe tri-plane is a tensor used to factorize the dense 3D volume\ngrid. It is built on three axis-aligned 2D planes: the XY, YZ, and\nXZ planes. The MLP decoder converts the tri-plane feature into\na continuous value representing the scene, which could be occu-\npancy, signed distance field (SDF), radiance field [Mildenhall et al.\n2021], etc. Tri-plane is significantly more compact and computa-\ntionally efficient than a full 3D tensor and conducive to generative\narchitectures developed for 2D image synthesis. This has been a\nkey factor in making high-quality direct 3D data generation possible.\nIn this paper, we develop a tri-plane diffusion based approach\nto generate expandable 3D scenes. Our method is called BlockFu-\nsion. It generates 3D scenes in the form of cubic blocks and extends\nthe scene in a straightforward sliding-block way. To generate high-\nquality 3D shapes, we directly train BlockDiffusion on 3D scene\ndatasets. For network training, we randomly crop complete 3D\nscenes into incomplete 3D blocks with fixed sizes. We run per-block\nfitting to convert all training blocks into tri-planes, which we call\nthe raw tri-planes. We found that directly training diffusion on\nraw tri-planes results in undesirable collapsed shapes. This issue is\npossibly caused by the high redundancy in the raw tri-planes and\nthe substantial shape variance in the data. Inspired by stable diffu-\nsion [Rombach et al. 2022a], we apply an auto-encoder to compress\nthe raw tri-planes into a latent tri-plane space to run diffusion. The\nlatent tri-plane space is significantly more compact and computa-\ntionally efficient than the raw tri-plane while maintaining similar\nrepresentation power. In contrast to previous work, tri-plane dif-\nfusion on such a latent representation allows for the first time to\nreach high-quality and diverse 3D shape generation at scene level.\nTo expand a scene, we add empty blocks to overlap with the cur-\nrent scene and extrapolate existing tri-planes to populate the new\nblocks. Specifically, the extrapolation is done by conditioning the\ngeneration process with the feature samples from the overlapping\ntri-planes during the reverse diffusion iterations. The extrapolation\nis also carried out in the latent tri-plane space. This process pro-\nduces semantically and geometrically meaningful transitions that\nseamlessly blend with the existing scene, ensuring a coherent and\nvisually pleasing scene expansion.\nBlockFusion: Expandable 3D Scene Generation using Latent Tri-plane Extrapolation\n\u2022\n3\nTo provide users with more control over the generation pro-\ncess, we introduce a 2D layout conditioning mechanism, which\nallows users to precisely determine the placement and arrangement\nof elements by manipulating 2D object bounding boxes. We also\ndemonstrate that the color and texture of the scenes can be created\nusing an off-the-shelf texture generation tool, thereby increasing\nthe visual allure of the scene.\nTo summarize, BlockFusion presents 1) a generalizable, high-\nquality 3D generation model based on latent tri-plane diffusion, 2)\na latent tri-plane extrapolation mechanism that allows harmonious\nscene expansion, and 3) a 2D layout condition mechanism for pre-\ncise control over scene generation. Experimental results indicate\nthat BlockFusion is capable of generating diverse, geometrically\nconsistent and unbounded large 3D scenes with unprecedented\nhigh-quality shapes in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nDiffusion models\nStarting from Gaussian noise samples, Diffusion probabilistic mod-\nels [Ho et al. 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015] generate clear images\nby learning to progressively remove noise from the original noise\nsample. Recent advances in diffusion models [Dhariwal and Nichol\n2021; Nichol and Dhariwal 2021; Ramesh et al. 2022; Saharia et al.\n2022] have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in synthesiz-\ning high-quality and diverse images. Nonetheless, training diffusion\nmodels directly in high-resolution pixel space can be computation-\nally prohibitive. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) [Rombach et al.\n2022b] address this issue with a two-stage approach: they first com-\npress the image through an auto-encoder and then apply diffusion\nmodels on smaller spatial representations in the latent space. Dif-\nfusion models can be trained with guiding information (e.g., text\nprompt, semantic layout, category label) to facilitate personaliza-\ntion, customization, or task-specific image generation. There are\nbasically two ways of manipulating generated content. The first is\nrealized through training a new model from scratch or finetuning a\npretrained diffusion model, adding various conditioning controls,\ne.g., sketch, depth, segmentation, [Avrahami et al. 2023; Bashkirova\net al. 2023; Brooks et al. 2023; Gal et al. 2022; Huang et al. 2023; Li\net al. 2023a; Mou et al. 2023; Nichol et al. 2021; Ramesh et al. 2022;\nRombach et al. 2022b,b; Ruiz et al. 2023; Voynov et al. 2023; Wang\net al. 2022b,a; Zhang et al. 2023]. This approach requires extensive\ndataset building and extra computational consumption. The other\nline of methods adapts pretrained model and add some controlled\ngeneration capability during inference. With only slight modifica-\ntion to the generative process, [Avrahami et al. 2022; Bar-Tal et al.\n2023; Hertz et al. 2022; Tumanyan et al. 2023] examine a wide variety\nof controlling diffusion models in a training/finetuning-free way.\n2.2\n3D shape generation\nThe success of 2D generation tools based on diffusion models, no-\ntably Stable Diffusion[Rombach et al. 2022b], Midjourney, and Dall-\nE, has significantly sparked interest in the development of 3D gen-\neration tools. There are two main streams for this task: the methods\nthat lift 2D (generated) images into 3D models, and the methods\nthat directly run diffusion on 3D data.\n2D-lifting methods. DreamFusion [Poole et al. 2022] optimizes\na Neural Radiance Field [Mildenhall et al. 2021] using the Score\nDistillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which distills prior knowledge\nfrom 2D image diffusion models into the volume rendering output\nof the NeRF. Magic3D [Lin et al. 2023] adopts an SDS loss-based\nsecond stage to further refine the mesh extracted from DreamFu-\nsion. SDS-based approaches demonstrate impressive results. How-\never, they typically require hours of optimization and struggle with\nmaintaining shape consistency, leading to a phenomenon called\nthe Janus-face problem [Poole et al. 2022]. Several methods have\nbeen developed that focus on the direct generation of consistency-\nenhanced multi-view 2D images, and these techniques reconstruct\n3D shapes from the generated multi-view images. Zero123 [Liu et al.\n2023d] fine-tunes Stable Diffusion model [Rombach et al. 2022a]\nto generate novel views by conditioning on the input image and\ncamera transformation. One2345 [Liu et al. 2023e] converts the\nmulti-view image from Zero123 to 3D using an SDF-based neu-\nral surface reconstruction method. One2345++ [Liu et al. 2023c]\nfine-tunes a 2D diffusion model for consistent multi-view image\ngeneration, and then elevating these images to 3D with the aid of\nmulti-view conditioned 3D diffusion models. Syncdreamer [Liu et al.\n2023b] and Consistnet [Yang et al. 2023] synchronize multi-view\nimage generation process by explicitly correlating features in 3D\nspace. Wonder3d [Long et al. 2023] improves the generation fidelity\nby introducing a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-\nview normal maps in addition to the color images. LRM [Hong et al.\n2023] treats the single-image-to-3D problem as a reconstruction\nproblem and solves it using Transformer in a deterministic way.\nHowever, LRM can lead to blurry and washed-out textures for un-\nseen parts of objects due to mode averaging. To address this issue,\nInstant3D [Li et al. 2023b] inputs multi-view consistent images into\nLRM to infer geometry and textures for unseen parts. DMV3D [Xu\net al. 2023a] employs LRM as a multi-view denoiser, which itera-\ntively produces a cleaner tri-plane NeRF from noisy sparsely posed\nmulti-view images.\n3D diffusion models. Another line of research involves directly\ntraining diffusion models to generate 3D shapes. As the supervision\ncomes directly from 3D shape ground truth or posed multi-view\nimages, the generated results typically exhibit superior geometric\nquality compared to those from 2D diffusion-based methods. These\nmethods can be categorized based on the type of 3D representations\nthey employ, including: polygon meshes [Gao et al. 2022; Liu et al.\n2023a], point clouds [Nichol et al. 2022; Zeng et al. 2022], explicit\n3D grids holding occupancy or SDF values [Liu et al. 2023c; Zheng\net al. 2023], or neural fields [Chen et al. 2023a; Chou et al. 2023;\nErko\u00e7 et al. 2023; Jun and Nichol 2023; M\u00fcller et al. 2023; Shue et al.\n2023; Wang et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2023b]. The hybrid neural field,\nwhich incorporates a tri-plane followed by a neural decoder, has\nbeen widely adopted in 3D diffusion models due to its computational\nefficiency. Rodin [Wang et al. 2023] first fits tri-plane NeRFs for a\nhuman upper body dataset, and then uses a two-stage coarse-to-fine\ndiffusion model to generate the corresponding tri-planes. Similarly,\nNFD [Shue et al. 2023] trains a tri-plane diffusion model for 3D data\nparametrized via occupancy values. SSDNerf [Chen et al. 2023a]\nmerge tri-plane fitting and generation into a single-stage pipeline.\n4\n\u2022\nZhennan Wu, Yang Li, Han Yan, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Ruikai Cui, Weizhe Liu, Hiroyuki Sato, Hongdong Li, and Pan Ji\nFig. 2. BlockFusion training pipeline. The training contains three steps: First, 1) the training 3D blocks are converted to raw tri-planes via per-block shape\nfitting, c.f. Sec. 3.2. Then, 2) an auto-encoder compresses the raw tri-planes into a more compact latent tri-plane space, c.f. Sec. 3.3. Lastly, 3) DDPM is trained\nto approximate the distributions of latent tri-planes, and during this process, layout control can also be integrated, c.f. Sec. 3.4.\nHowever, in practice, tri-plane diffusion is still challenging to train\ndue to its high dimensionality and irregularity. Existing methods\nonly demonstrated simple cases with small data varieties, i.e., Rodin\nfor canonicalized human upper-body dataset [Wood et al. 2021], and\nNFD and SSDNeRF for single-category objects in ShapeNet [Chang\net al. 2015]. This paper follows this line of research but introduces\na major change: we use an auto-encoder to compress the tri-plane\ninto a highly compact latent tri-plane space for diffusion. We demon-\nstrate that this approach significantly improves the stability, gener-\nalizability, and output quality of tri-plane diffusion.\n2.3\n3D scene generation\nGenerating 3D scenes presents a more substantial challenge than\ngenerating single objects. This is because scenes are geometrically\nmore complex than individual objects, and they cannot be contained\nin a fixed spatial size. Object retrieval-based approaches assume\nthere is a database of objects, and they arrange the retrieved objects\nto fill an empty scene, as seen in Diffuscene [Tang et al. 2023a] and\nSceneformer [Wang et al. 2021], consequently, the synthesized scene\ncan not contain novel elements that do not exist in the database.\nText2Room [H\u00f6llein et al. 2023] is the first method that uses 2D\ndiffusion model to build a 3D generation tool. It first generates color\nand depth frames using 2D diffusion models, and then shift camera\npositions to generate new frames, which are integrated into a global\nmap. A similar approach for broader outdoor scenarios can be found\nin SceneScape [Fridman et al. 2023]. To allow precise control over the\ncontents generated in a scene, ControlRoom3D[Schult et al. 2023]\nand CTRL-ROOM[Fang et al. 2023] develop panorama-based room\ngeneration models that take 3D room layouts as input conditions.\nCitygen [Deng et al. 2023] represents city scenes using the height\nmap proxy, leading to a 2.5D scene generation. Other approaches\nfocus on generating scenes with high-quality visual appearances.\nGiven a room scene mesh, MVDiffusion [Tang et al. 2023b] gener-\nates coherent multiview perspective images, which can be lifted to\nthe 3D as the UV texture of the mesh. SceneDreamer [Chen et al.\n2023c] leverages in-the-wild 2D images to construct large scenes\nwith photo-realistic volume rendering effects. However, it still re-\nlies on high-quality 3D scene meshes as input, consequently, the\ndimensions of the generated scenes are bounded by the dimensions\nof the input meshes.\nIn this paper, we address the fundamental challenge of generat-\ning an unbounded scene by developing an auto-regressive scene\nexpansion algorithm based on tri-plane diffusion.\n3\nMETHOD\nBlockFusion generates scenes as blocks and expands scenes using\na sliding-window progressive generation approach. Fig. 2 presents\nthe training pipeline. This section is organized as follows:\n\u25cf Sec. 3.1 demonstrates how the training blocks are generated.\n\u25cf Sec. 3.2: we run per-block fitting to convert all training\nblocks into tri-planes, which we call the raw tri-planes.\n\u25cf Sec. 3.3: the raw tri-planes are compressed into a latent\ntri-plane space for efficient 3D representation.\n\u25cf Sec: 3.4: we train the diffusion model on the latent tri-plane\nspace.\n\u25cf Sec. 3.5: we leverage the pre-trained latent tri-plane diffusion\nmodel to expand a scene.\n\u25cf Sec. 3.6: a post-processing technique is adapted to reduce\nseams.\n\u25cf Sec. 3.7: large scenes are built by running BlockFusion pro-\ngressively.\n3.1\nCrop training scenes into 3D blocks\nWe use scene meshes for network training. We convert scene meshes\nto water-tight meshes and then randomly crop the meshes into cubic\nblocks. The size of the block is adjusted such that it is large enough\nto enclose major objects in the scene, e.g. beds in room scenes, or\nhouses in outdoor scenes. Given that the blocks are randomly po-\nsitioned within the scene, objects may be split by these blocks. In\naddition, the possible arrangements of objects within a block are\nlimitless. Considerably, the variance in such a randomly cropped\nshape dataset is much larger than that of a single object-centered\ndataset. As a result, training diffusion on this type of data presents a\ngreater challenge. We test on three different types of scenes includ-\ning room, city, and village. Examples of training blocks can be found\nin Fig. 3. In addition to the shapes, we also create a 2D layout map\nfor each scene. The layout map is the ground plane projection of the\nobjects, grouped by their categories. These layout maps can be used\nas input conditions for diffusion, so we also crop them accordingly.\nExamples can be seen in Fig. 2.\nBlockFusion: Expandable 3D Scene Generation using Latent Tri-plane Extrapolation\n\u2022\n5\nFig. 3. Examples of randomly cropped 3D blocks.\n3.2\nRaw tri-plane fitting\nHybrid Neural SDF. We use the signed distance field (SDF) to\nrepresent the shape. An SDF is a continuous distance function with\nvalues indicating the distance to the surface and signs indicating\nwhether a point is inside or outside the object. The final surface can\nbe extracted via marching cubes. The shape is reconstructed using\nthe hybrid neural field structure, which consists of a tri-plane to\nhold the geometry feature and a multiple layer perceptron (MLP)\nwith parameter \ud835\udf03 to decode the signed distance value. The tri-plane\nis a tensor used to factorize the dense 3D volume grid. It is built on\nthree axis-aligned 2D planes: the XY, YZ, and XZ planes. Formally, it\nreads \ud835\udc65 = {\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56)\u22c3\ufe00\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56) \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 2\u00d7\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc56 \u2208 {1, 2, 3}}, where \ud835\udc41 2 is the plane\nresolution and\ud835\udc36 is the dimension of the feature. Given a query point\n\ud835\udc5d \u2208 R3, the function \u03a6 \u2236 R3 \u21a6 R outputs the signed distance value:\n\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d) = MLP\ud835\udf03(\n\u2295\n\ud835\udc56\u2208{1,2,3}\nInterp\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56)(Proj\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56)(\ud835\udc5d)))\n(1)\nwhere Proj(\u22c5) represents orthogonal point-to-plane projection, Interp(\u22c5)\nrefers to bi-linear interpolation that queries feature vectors from\neach plane respectively, and \u2295 denotes element-wise addition. The\naddition operation is performed along the feature dimension, reduc-\ning the three feature vectors into a single final feature.\nTraining points sampling. Given the mesh of a training block, we\nsample on-surface points and off-surface points, and then compute\nthe ground truth SDF values. On-surface point set, denoted as \u03a90,\nis randomly sampled on the surface. Their SDF values are equal to\nzero and we also compute the surface normal GT for each of these\npoints. Off-surface point set denoted as \u03a9 is sampled uniformly at\nrandom inside the block. To avoid incorrect distance values resulting\nfrom mesh cropping, the ground truth SDF values of the off-surface\npoints are computed with respect to the original water-tight mesh.\nWe empirically found that the point set sizes \u22c3\ufe00\u03a9\u22c3\ufe00 = 100000 and\n\u22c3\ufe00\u03a90\u22c3\ufe00 = 500000 achieve solid shape-fitting results while maintaining\noptimization costs at a manageable level. The XYZ coordinates of\nall sampled points are normalized to the range [-1, 1].\nTriplane Fitting. Our goal is to transform all training blocks into\ntri-planes, which will then be used for training our generative model.\nInspired by pioneering works on shape representation with neural\nfield-based SDFs [Atzmon and Lipman 2020; Gropp et al. 2020; Park\net al. 2019], we jointly optimize tri-plane \ud835\udc65 and MLP weights \ud835\udf03 with\nthe following geometry loss:\n\u2112\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5c = \u2112\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 + \u2112\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 + \u2112\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\n(2)\nThe three terms are:\n\u2112\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udf061 \u2211\n\ud835\udc5d\u2208\u03a90\n\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00 + \ud835\udf062 \u2211\n\ud835\udc5d\u2208\u03a9\n\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d) \u2212 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5d\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\n(3)\n\u2112\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 = \ud835\udf063 \u2211\n\ud835\udc5d\u2208\u03a90\n\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\u2207\ud835\udc5d\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d) \u2212 n\ud835\udc5d\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\n(4)\n\u2112\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 = \ud835\udf064 \u2211\n\ud835\udc5d\u2208\u03a90\n\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\u2207\ud835\udc5d\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\u22c3\ufe00 \u2212 1\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\n(5)\nwhere \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5d and n\ud835\udc5d are ground truth SDF values and surface normal\nvector. The gradient \u2207\ud835\udc5d\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d) = (\ufe00 \ud835\udf15\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc4b , \ud835\udf15\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc4c\n, \ud835\udf15\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc4d\n\u230b\ufe00 represents\nthe direction of the steepest change in SDF. It can be computed using\nfinite difference, e.g. the partial derivative for the X-axis component\nreads\n\ud835\udf15\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc4b\n= \u03a6(\ud835\udc5d + (\ufe00\ud835\udeff, 0, 0\u230b\ufe00) \u2212 \u03a6(\ud835\udc5d \u2212 (\ufe00\ud835\udeff, 0, 0\u230b\ufe00)\n2\ud835\udeff\n(6)\nwhere \ud835\udeff is the step size. The Eikonal loss constrains \u22c3\ufe00\u2207\ud835\udc5d\u03a6(\ud835\udc5d)\u22c3\ufe00 to\nbe 1 almost everywhere, thus maintaining the intrinsic physical\nproperty of the signed distance function. We adopt the MLP initial-\nization trick as introduced in SAL [Atzmon and Lipman 2020], which\nconstrains the initial SDF output to roughly approximate a sphere.\nThis spherical geometry initialization technique significantly facil-\nitates global convergence. Empirically, the loss weights are set to\n\ud835\udf061 = 100.0, \ud835\udf062 = 3.0, \ud835\udf063 = 1.0, and \ud835\udf064 = 0.5 across all datasets. The\nMLP is jointly trained with the tri-planes using a training subset\nconsisting of 500 blocks. Upon convergence, the MLP is regarded\nas a generalizable SDF decoder. Then we freeze MLP and optimize\nthe tri-planes for all blocks in the training data. In this work, the\noutput tri-plane size is set to \ud835\udc41 2 = 1282,\ud835\udc36 = 32. Following [Yan\net al. 2024], a tri-plane is optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner, i.e.,\nthe resolution is initialized with 82 and gradually up-scaled to 1282.\nCompared to directly optimizing at the final resolution, this trick\nsignificantly improves fitting robustness and reduces running time.\nNow, we can convert a dataset of 3D blocks into a dataset of\ntri-planes with size 3 \u00d7 1282 \u00d7 32. These tri-planes can faithfully\nreconstruct the 3D blocks, c.f. Fig. 10. We call them as the raw\ntri-planes.\n3.3\nCompressing to latent tri-plane space\nAlthough our raw tri-planes can reconstruct high-quality shapes,\nwe found that generating such tri-planes is significantly difficult.\nDirectly training diffusion models on such tri-planes leads to col-\nlapsed results, as shown in Fig. 4. We argue that there are mainly\ntwo reasons for this: 1) the raw tri-plane is highly redundant, and 2)\nthe shape diversity in our scene block dataset is too large. Although\nprevious works like Rodin [Wang et al. 2023] and NFD [Shue et al.\n2023] have proven the feasibility of diffusion on raw tri-planes, they\nonly work on datasets with much smaller varieties, i.e., Rodin for\ncanonicalized human upper bodies, and NFD for single-category\nobjects from ShapeNet [Chang et al. 2015]. When we attempted to\nretrain NFD on our scene blocks, it also failed to produce meaningful\nshapes, as shown in Fig. 4.\n6\n\u2022\nZhennan Wu, Yang Li, Han Yan, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Ruikai Cui, Weizhe Liu, Hiroyuki Sato, Hongdong Li, and Pan Ji\nFig. 4. Qualitative unconditioned block generation results. NFD [Shue\net al. 2023] is also based on tri-plane diffusion. They utilize occupancy value\nto represent shapes, whereas ours employ SDF. All three methods are trained\non room blocks.\nWe need to find a feature representation for 3D shapes that is com-\npact, easy to train diffusion models, memory and computationally\nefficient, and capable of generalizing to large shape variations. In\nthe 2D scenario, Stable Diffusion [Rombach et al. 2022a] compresses\nraw images into a latent 2D feature space for diffusion. This ap-\nproach results in a more robust model that generates higher-quality\nimages. Inspired by Stable Diffusion, we train an auto-encoder to\ncompress raw tri-planes into a latent tri-plane space with reduced\nresolution and feature channels. Precisely, given an raw tri-plane\n\ud835\udc65 \u2208 R3\u00d7\ud835\udc41 2\u00d7\ud835\udc36, the encoder \u2130 encodes \ud835\udc65 into a latent representation\n\ud835\udc67 = \u2130(\ud835\udc65), and the decoder \ud835\udc9f reconstructs the raw tri-plane from\nthe latent, giving \u02c6\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc9f(\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc9f(\u2130(\ud835\udc65)).\nTraining objective of the auto-encoder is shown as follows:\n\u2112\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38 = \u2112\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc9f(\u2130(\ud835\udc65))) + \u2112\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc9f, \u2130) + \u2112\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5c\n(7)\nwhere \u2112\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 is a light \ud835\udc3f1 norm applied between \ud835\udc65 and its recon-\nstruction \ud835\udc9f(\u2130(\ud835\udc65)). \u2112\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f is a the Kullback-Leibler-term between\n\ud835\udc5e\u2130(\ud835\udc67\u22c3\ufe00\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udc67; \u2130\ud835\udc62, \u2130\ud835\udf0e2) and a standard normal distribution \ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc67; 0, 1)\nas in a standard vae [Kingma and Welling 2013]. To obtain high-\nfidelity shape reconstructions we only use a very small weight for\n\u2112\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f. \u2112\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5c is the geometry loss defined in Eqn. 2. It is assessed based\non the same set of points as in Sec. 3.2. Since the purpose is to learn\na latent tri-plane that can faithfully represent the shape, we rely on\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5c as the dominate loss for training the auto-encoder.\nThe latent \ud835\udc67 mantains a tri-plane structure with \ud835\udc67 = {\ud835\udc67(\ud835\udc56)\u22c3\ufe00\ud835\udc67(\ud835\udc56) \u2208\nR\ud835\udc5b2\u00d7\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc56 \u2208 {1, 2, 3}}. We call it as the latent tri-plane. This is in con-\ntrast to the previous work DiffusionSDF [Chou et al. 2023], which\nrelies on an arbitrary one-dimensional latent vector \ud835\udc67 to model its\ndistribution autoregressively and thereby ignores much of the in-\nherent 3D structure of \ud835\udc67. Hence, our compression model preserves\ndetails of \ud835\udc65 better (see Fig. 10). Empirically, the latent resolution\nis set to \ud835\udc5b2 = 322. And we investigate two different latent feature\ndimensions with \ud835\udc50 = 2 and \ud835\udc50 = 16.\n3.4\nLatent Triplane Diffusion\nWith our trained tri-plane auto-encoder, comprising \u2130 and \ud835\udc9f, we\nnow have access to an efficient, low-dimensional latent tri-plane\nspace where high-frequency, imperceptible details are abstracted\naway. In comparison to the raw tri-plane space, the latent tri-plane\nspace is more suitable for likelihood-based generative models, as\nthey can now concentrate on the essential, semantic aspects of the\ndata and train in a lower-dimensional, computationally much more\nefficient space.\nBackground on Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Diffusion Mod-\nels are probabilistic models designed to learn a data distribution\n\ud835\udc670 \u223c \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc670) by gradually denoising a normally distributed variable.\nThis process corresponds to learning the reverse operation of a\nfixed Markov Chain with a length of\ud835\udc47. The inference process works\nby sampling a random noise \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc47 and gradually denoising it until it\nreaches a meaningful latent \ud835\udc670.

The latent tri-plane is unfolded into\nthree independent planes to run down-sampling convolutions. After the\ndown-sampling layers, the three feature maps are flattened into 1D to-\nkens and concatenated together to forward through a sequence of self-\nattention [Vaswani et al. 2017] and residual block by \ud835\udc3e = 6 times. Finally,\nthe 1D array is reshaped into planes for up-sampling convolution and re-\nassembled into the tri-plane structure.\nauto-encoder \u03a8 learns to reconstruct \ud835\udc670 from \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61.

During test time, we iteratively denoise \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc47\nuntil we obtain the final output \ud835\udc67\u2032. \ud835\udc67\u2032 can be decoded to the raw\ntri-plane \ud835\udc65\u2032 with a single pass through \ud835\udc9f. Finally, the pretrained\nMLP decodes \ud835\udc65\u2032 to a dense SDF volume for marching cube-shape\nextraction.\n2D layout as user control. To control the generation process, we\nadd floor layout control by informing the model with 2D bounding\nbox projections of objects. The floor layout is converted into a\nfeature map \ud835\udc59 \u2208 R\ud835\udc5b2\u00d7\ud835\udc5a, where \ud835\udc5b2 represents the feature resolution\n(identical to the plane resolution in latent\ud835\udc67), and the channel number\n\ud835\udc5a corresponds to the total number of object categories. Each channel\nconsists of a binary image indicating whether or not an object class\nis placed. The loss of layout-conditioned latent tri-plane diffusion\nreads\n\u2112\ud835\udc50\u2212\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc37 = \u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe00\u03a8(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udefe(\ud835\udc61),\ud835\udc59) \u2212 \ud835\udc670\u22c3\ufe00\u22c3\ufe002\n(17)\nIn practice, \ud835\udc59 is directly concatenated to three planes of \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61. In our\nexperiments, we show that this type of conditioning successfully\ncontrols the arrangement of scene elements while still preserving\nvariance in the generated shapes.\n3D aware denoising U-Net. The neural backbone \u03a8(\u22c5) of our\nmodel is realized as a time-conditional U-Net. The advantage of\ntri-planes is that we can treat them as 2D tensors and therefore\napply efficient 2D convolutions. However, naively running convo-\nlution on tri-planes does not produce satisfactory results, as the\n3D relationships among the plane features are ignored. \u03a8(\u22c5) needs\nto incorporate operations that can account for the cross-plane fea-\nture relationships. To address this, Rodin [Wang et al. 2023] intro-\nduces a 3D-aware convolution, which employs max-pooling and\nconcatenation to associate features between planes based on their\n3D correlations. However, the simple max-pooling may lose valu-\nable information. In this work, we build \u03a8(\u22c5) by leveraging the more\npowerful transformer to achieve cross-plane communication. The\noverall architecture of \u03a8(\u22c5) is shown in Fig. 5. This architecture\nenables effective 3D-aware feature learning.\n3.5\nLatent tri-plane Extrapolation\nRepaint [Lugmayr et al. 2022] demonstrate impressive image inpaint-\ning and extrapolation results using a pre-trained diffusion model.\nTheir key idea is to synchronize the denoising process of the un-\nknown pixels using the noised version of the known pixels. Inspired\nby Repaint, we leverage our pre-trained denoising backbone \u03a8(\u22c5) to\nextrapolate tri-planes. The extrapolation is carried out in the latent\ntri-plane space. Formally, given a known block \ud835\udc43 with latent code\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43 = {\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc56)\u22c3\ufe00\ud835\udc56 \u2208 {1, 2, 3}} as a condition, and an empty block \ud835\udc44 that\npartially overlaps with \ud835\udc43, the goal is to generate the latent tri-plane\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44 = {\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc56)\u22c3\ufe00\ud835\udc56 \u2208 {1, 2, 3}} that can represent the new block. For\nsimplicity, this paper only considers the case where \ud835\udc44 is positioned\nby sliding along only one of the XYZ axes, which is sufficient for\nscene expansion.\nPlane-wise extrapolation. The tri-plane is a factored represen-\ntation of a dense 3D volume. The three planes are compressed but\nhighly correlated, which makes extrapolation on tri-planes a non-\nintuitive task. To address this, as shown in Fig. 6, we factor tri-plane\nextrapolation into the extrapolation of three 2D planes separately,\nand then utilize our 3D-aware denoising backbone, \u03a8, to blend infor-\nmation from the three planes. Specifically, given the \ud835\udc56-th axis-align\nplane with \ud835\udc56 \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, the overlap mask between plane \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc56) and\nplane \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc56) is denoted as \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56. Following Repaint [Lugmayr et al.\n2022], extrapolating \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc56) to obtain \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc56) is realized by synchroniz-\ning the denoising process of \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc56) using the noised version \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc56)\ninside the overlap mask \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56. Specifically, at step \ud835\udc61 \u2212 1, we obtain the\nnoised \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) via\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) \u223c \ud835\udca9(\u230b\ufe02\u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43\n0 (\ud835\udc56), (1 \u2212 \u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61)I)\n(18)\nFig. 6. Latent triplane extrapolation. Given the known block \ud835\udc43 and the\nunknown block \ud835\udc44 , the goal is to extrapolate the known latent tri-plane \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43\nto obtain the unknown tri-plane \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44 (top row). This tri-plane extrapolation is\nfactored into the extrapolation of three 2D planes separately (bottom row).\n8\n\u2022\nZhennan Wu, Yang Li, Han Yan, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Ruikai Cui, Weizhe Liu, Hiroyuki Sato, Hongdong Li, and Pan Ji\nand the denoised \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) from previous step \ud835\udc61 by\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) \u223c \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf13 (\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56),\ud835\udc61), \u03a3\ud835\udf13 (\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56),\ud835\udc61))\n(19)\nThen, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) is synchronized by\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) \u2190 Cat(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) \u2208 \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc61\u22121(\ud835\udc56) \u2209 \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56)\n(20)\nwhere Cat(\u22c5) refers to the tensor concatenation.

We can\nonly perform synchronization for planes \ud835\udc56 \u2208 {1, 2}. Nevertheless,\nour denoising backbone \u03a8 constructed using a sequence of self-\nattention layers is designed to identify cross-plane dependencies.\nThis architecture allows the synchronized features in planes {1, 2}\nto be effectively propagated to the 3rd plane via attention layers\nthroughout the denoising steps.

We found that simply applying synchronization does\nnot always yield semantically and geometrically consistent results.\nThis is because the noise-adding process in overlapping regions does\nnot take into account the newly generated parts of the tri-plane in\nthe non-overlapping region, thereby introducing disharmony. To\naddress this issue, we leverage the resampling strategy as introduced\nin Repaint [Lugmayr et al. 2022]. Specifically, at certain steps of\nthe denoising process, noise is added again to the output using\nthe forward diffusion equation in 9, meaning the inference process\nis rolled back. There are two hyper-parameters for resampling: 1)\nthe roll-back step \ud835\udc3d, and 2) the number of resampling times \ud835\udc45. In\nthis paper, we set \ud835\udc3d = 100 and conduct an ablation study on \ud835\udc45 =\n{0, 1, 2, 3, 7}. Experimental results show that increasing the number\nof resampling times enhances the generation performance.\n3.6\nSurface refinement with non-rigid registration\nThe synchronized tri-planes \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44 generate shapes that are\nsemantically aligned; however, the latent space synchronization\ndoes not guarantee point-accurately aligned shapes, resulting in\nsmall visible seams. To address this problem, we explicitly align the\nextracted surface mesh. From the two latent codes \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc44, we\nderive dense SDF volumes and run marching cubes to extract the\nsurface meshes \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc44. We uniformly sample points on mesh\ntriangles that lie inside the overlapping region, obtaining the point\nsets denoted as \u03a9\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc43 and \u03a9\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc44 . Then, we uniformly sample points on\ntriangles of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc44 that lie outside of the overlapping region, resulting\nin a point set denoted as \u03a9\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc44\n. We align \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc44 by optimizing\nthe non-rigid registration cost:\n\u2112\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f = \u2112\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udcb2(\u03a9\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc43 ), \u03a9\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc44 ) + \u2112\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udcb2(\u03a9\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc44\n), \u03a9\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc44\n)\n(21)\nwhere \u2112\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc37(\u22c5) represents the Chamfer Distance between two point\nclouds, and \ud835\udcb2(\u22c5) is the dense non-rigid warping function that pre-\ndicts per-point transformations. \ud835\udcb2(\u22c5) is based on NDP [Li and\nHarada 2022], which approximates scene deformation using hierar-\nchical coarse-to-fine neural deformation fields. This non-rigid regis-\ntration cost encourages the extrapolated mesh \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc44 to approximate\nthe condition mesh \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc43 as closely as possible within the overlapping\nregion, while maintaining its own structure in the non-overlapping\nregion.\n3.7\nBuilding unbounded large scenes with BlockFusion.\nBased on Algorithm 1, one can construct large, unbounded scenes\nat any scale. The naive strategy for this purpose involves initially\ncreating a block and then expanding the scene by extrapolating\nblock by block in the sliding window fashion. However, this serial\noperations requires a significant amount of time.\nGiven that remote blocks are likely to be independent of each\nother, large scene generation can be executed in parallel. This pro-\ncess involves initially generating isolated seed blocks simultane-\nously, from which we extrapolate the remaining empty blocks, also\nin parallel. Specifically, we first use sliding window to sli ce the\nworld into small blocks, denoted as \u212c = {\ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352, ...}, with overlaps\nbetween each pair of neighboring blocks We select a strided subset\n\u212c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 from those blocks. We make sure blocks in \u212c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 should not\noverlap with each other. The complementary set of \u212c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 is denoted\nas \u212c\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e. Blocks in \u212c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 are independently generated in parallel.\nThe rest empty blocks in \u212c\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e are extrapolated from \u212c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n4.1\nImplementation details.\nWater-tight remeshing. We use 3D scene meshes for network\ntraining. These scene meshes are typically created by 3D artists\nand are not always guaranteed to be watertight. We transform the\nraw meshes into watertight ones using Blender\u2019s voxel remeshing\ntool. After remeshing, the object has a clearly defined inside and\noutside, which is essential for training a continuous neural field\nrepresentation.\nDatasets. We test our algorithm on three different types of scenes:\nroom, city, and village. Room scene data is obtained from 3DFront [Fu\net al. 2021a] and 3D-FUTURE [Fu et al. 2021b], which contains 18,968\nindoor scenes with 34 classes of indoor objects. We obtain 57K ran-\ndom crops from 3DFront, with each block size set to 3.23 cubic\nmeters. We filtered out empty rooms and rooms with less than 5\nobjects and finally got 9123 rooms. For simplicity, we regroup the ob-\njects in 3DFUTURE based on their similarities into 9 classes: \"floor\",\nBlockFusion: Expandable 3D Scene Generation using Latent Tri-plane Extrapolation\n\u2022\n9\nFig. 7. Large room scene generation.\nFig. 8. Large city scene generation.\n\"wall\", \"chair\", \"cabinet\", \"sofa\", \"table\", \"lighting\", \"bed\", and \"stool\".\nThe city and village scenes are designed by artists, from each, we ob-\ntain 10K blocks. The block sizes are set to 123 and 153 cubic meters,\nrespectively. The layout labels for the village are \"pine\", \"cypress\ntree\", \"ground\", and \"houses\", and for the city, they are \"road\", \"tree\",\n\"solar panels\", \"cars\", \"houses\". Note that all the blocks are cropped\nat random, and the testing blocks are never exposed to the model\nduring training.\nOur method is implemented using Pytorch and trained on Nvidia\nV100 GPU. For the 3DFront dataset with 57K cropped blocks, raw\ntri-plane fitting, auto-encoder training, and diffusion training take\n4750, 768, and 384 GPU hours, respectively. Running a single tri-\nplane extrapolation under layout conditions costs 6 minutes. With\nthe large scene generation strategy described in Sec. 3.7, producing\nthe large indoor scene in Fig. 7 takes around 3 hours.\n4.2\nEvaluation Metrics\nReconstruction metric. We evaluate the reconstruction quality\nusing the Chamfer Distance (CD) at 10\u22123 scale, Surface Normal Error\n(\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40) in degrees, and Surface SDF error (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 ) in centimeters.\nUnconditioned generation metric. The evaluation of uncondi-\ntional 3D shape synthesis presents inherent challenges due to the\nlack of direct ground truth correspondence. Therefore, we resort\nto well-established metrics for evaluation, in line with previous\nworks [Chou et al. 2023; Siddiqui et al. 2023; Zeng et al. 2022]. These\nmetrics include Minimum Matching Distance (MMD), Coverage\n(COV), and 1-Nearest-Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA). For MMD, lower\n10\n\u2022\nZhennan Wu, Yang Li, Han Yan, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Ruikai Cui, Weizhe Liu, Hiroyuki Sato, Hongdong Li, and Pan Ji\nFig. 9. Qualatitive room generation results. Text2Room [H\u00f6llein et al. 2023] generates distorted shapes and cannot accurately respond to the number of\nobjects in the scene. For instance, when given the prompt \"one bed\", it generates multiple beds. In contrast, BlockFusion produces higher-quality shapes and\ncorrectly responds to numerical prompts.\nis better; for COV, higher is better; for 1-NNA, 50% is the optimal.\nWe employ the Chamfer Distance (CD) and EMD (Earth Mover\u2019s\nDistance) as the distance measure for computing these metrics.\nMore comprehensive details about these metrics are available in the\nrespective literature.\nUser study metric. We carried out a user study involving seven\nparticipants who were asked to rate the scene generation results\nbased on Perceptual Quality (PQ) and Structure Completeness (SC)\nof the entire scene, using a scale from 1 to 5. This is done in two\nmodes: textured mode (T-) and geometry-only mode (G-). In the\nTextured Mode, participants viewed a textured mesh, while in the\nGeometry-Only Mode, the texture was replaced with a monochrome\nmaterial to emphasize the geometry. As a result, we derived four\nmetrics from this study: T-PQ, T-SC, G-PQ and G-SC.\nTable 1.

We regard NFD [Shue et al. 2023] as\nthe baseline for single block generation. NFD is also based on tri-\nplane diffusion. However, they use occupancy values to represent\nshapes, whereas we employ SDF. We retrain NFD on our indoor\nscene blocks before evaluation. Tab. 2 and Fig. 4 show the results of\nunconditioned indoor block generation. Quantitatively, our method\nsignificantly outperforms NFD, with a 21.17% and 23.67% increase in\ncoverage (Cov) scores under the CD and EMD metrics, respectively.\nQualitatively, NFD is unable to generate meaningful shapes.\nTable 2.

We consider Text2Room [H\u00f6llein et al.\n2023] as the baseline for indoor scene generation. Text2Room takes\ntext prompt as input whereas ours is based on 2D layout map. For\na fair comparison, we describe our input room layout using nat-\nural language and then concatenate it as part of the text prompt\nfor Text2Room. While our method does not directly generate tex-\ntured mesh, we leverage an off-the-shelf text-to-texture generation\ntool, Meshy 1, to produce textures for our mesh. Meshy utilizes the\nsame text prompt as Text2Room. To enhance the texture genera-\ntion results of Meshy, we combine all blocks into a single entity\nusing Blender\u2019s voxel remeshing tool. Tab. 2 and Fig. 4 show the re-\nsults of room generation. Qualitatively, due to the use of monocular\ndepth estimation, the shape of Text2Room appears distorted, while\nBlockFusion produces significantly better room shapes. In addition,\nText2Room cannot precisely react to the text prompt; it generates\n1https://www.meshy.ai/\nBlockFusion: Expandable 3D Scene Generation using Latent Tri-plane Extrapolation\n\u2022\n11\nFig. 10.

By leveraging layout\ncontrol, our method can precisely determine the number of beds\nin the room. By leveraging Meshy, our approach also produces tex-\ntures comparable to Text2Room. Quantitatively, questionnaires vote\nhigher for BlockFusion.\n4.4\nAblation study\nShape reconstruction quality: latent tri-plane vs raw-tri-plane.\nFigure 10 and Table 3 display the qualitative and quantitative room\nblock reconstruction results using different representations. The\nraw tri-plane can accurately represent the ground truth (GT) mesh\nwithout any issues. Compared to the raw tri-plane, the latent tri-\nplanes with 2 channels manage to reduce 99.6% of the data bits\nwhile still maintaining decent shape representation power. Using\na similar data compression rate, the 4096-dimensional latent vec-\ntor cannot produce any reasonable shape. Considerably, the raw\ntri-plane is a redundant 3D representation. However, when we at-\ntempted to use fewer feature channels during the raw tri-plane\nfitting, we found that the shape reconstruction quality was signif-\nicantly degraded. This observation demonstrates the necessity of\nusing an auto-encoder for tri-plane compression.\nShape generation quality: latent tri-plane vs raw-tri-plane.\nFigure 4 and Table 2 display the qualitative and quantitative uncon-\nditional room block generation results. The latent tri-plane shows\nsignificantly better results, with a 27.84% and 25.83% increase in\nCoverage scores under the CD and EMD metrics respectively. Qual-\nitatively, raw tri-plane diffusion can not produce any reasonable\nresults. In conclusion, compared to the raw tri-plane, the latent\nTable 3.

Nonetheless, we found that layout\nconditions can dictate the overall placement of objects but not the\nintricate details of their shapes. This implies that various shapes can\nbe achieved under the same layout conditions. An example of this\nphenomenon can be observed in the supplementary video, where\nwe demonstrate the generation of different sofas while still adher-\ning to the specified layout conditions. This showcases the flexibility\nand adaptability of our approach in generating diverse and unique\nscene elements while maintaining consistency with the given layout\nconstraints.\n12\n\u2022\nZhennan Wu, Yang Li, Han Yan, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Ruikai Cui, Weizhe Liu, Hiroyuki Sato, Hongdong Li, and Pan Ji\nFig. 11. Qualitative results of tri-plane extrapolation. The 3D box shows the block to extrapolate. The overlap ratios are 25% for top three rows and 50%\nfor bottom three rows.\nHow does resampling affect the extrapolation? Fig. 12 shows\nthe shape synchronization results of layout-conditioned tri-plane ex-\ntrapolation. We tested different resampling times with \ud835\udc45 = {1, 2, 3, 7}.\nThe chamfer distance drops steadily with more resampling steps\nand stabilizes after 3 resamplings, where the variance in the Chamer\nDistance also converges. This suggests that augmenting the number\nof resampling times can improve the quality of synchronization\nresults. For clarity, \ud835\udc45 = 0 means that we do not perform synchro-\nnizations, i,e. the two blocks are generated independently while\nadhering to the shared layout conditions. Note that in this case, the\nChamfer Distance is extremely high, indicating that using layout\nconditioning alone does not ensure consistent geometry between\nblocks.\nIs non-rigid registration-based post-processing necessary? Yes.\nLatent tri-plane extrapolation generates semantically and geometri-\ncally reasonable transitions. However, since the high-frequency, im-\nperceptible details are abstracted away by the auto-encoder, extrapo-\nlation in the latent tri-plane space inevitably results in minor seams.\nAs shown in Fig. 13, non-rigid registration-based post-processing\ncan effectively mitigate this issue.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNumber of Resampling Times\n0\n2\n4\nChamfer Distance (1e-3)\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n# Denosing Steps (1e+3)\nFig. 12. Layout-conditioned tri-plane extrapolation with different\nresampling times (\ud835\udc45). The Chamfer Distance is calculated based on point\nsets sampled from the two block meshes within their overlapping region.\nThe shape consistency significantly improves after 1-time synchronization,\nand employing additional synchronization steps (i.e. resampling) further\nenhances shape consistency. \ud835\udc45 = 0 means no synchronizations.\nDoes BlockFusion posses creativity? BlockFusion does generate\nnovel shapes that do not exist in the training dataset. This primarily\narises from its ability to rearrange existing elements in novel ways.\nFor instance, as shown in Fig. 14, BlockFusion manages to generate\nBlockFusion: Expandable 3D Scene Generation using Latent Tri-plane Extrapolation\n\u2022\n13\nFig. 13.

The textures are generated using Text2tex [Chen et al. 2023b]\nusing the corresponding text prompt.\na new table shaped like the number \"24\" and a novel room shaped\nlike a heart. This is made possible by its ability to re-combine basic\nshapes, such as fractions of tables and walls, under layout guidance.\nThis demonstrates the potential of BlockFusion as a powerful tool\nfor generating diverse and visually appealing scenes.\n4.5\nLarge Scene Generation.\nWe showcase the capability of BlockFusion for large scene genera-\ntion. The results are displayed in Fig. 1, 7, and 8, for village, city, and\nroom scenes, respectively. The generation process is conditioned\non layout maps that are created using an easy-to-use graphical user\ninterface (GUI). It is important to emphasize that the scope of the\nscenes can be expanded infinitely. We believe that BlockFusion is\nthe first method capable of generating 3D scenes at such a large\nscale while maintaining a high level of shape quality.\n5\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nExperiments show the proposed BlockFusion is capable of gener-\nating diverse, geometrically consistent, and unbounded large 3D\nscenes with high-quality geometry in both indoor and outdoor\nscenarios. The generated mesh can be seamlessly integrated with\noff-the-shelf texture generation tools, yielding textured results with\nvisually pleasing appearance. We believe this approach represents\nan important step towards fully automated, industry-quality, large-\nscale 3D content generation.\nThe expansive nature of BlockFusion allows it to serve as a map\ngenerator for open-world games. We integrate BlockFusion to Unity\nto develop such an open-world game, where players can roam and\nexplore the world freely without being restricted by a predetermined\nworld boundary. A demo of this can be found in the supplementary\nvideo.\nLimitations. The current implementation of BlockFusion faces sev-\neral limitations. Our method may fail to generate very fine geometric\ndetails in the scene, such as the legs of a chair. This issue primarily\nstems from the limited resolution used for the tri-planes. A possible\nsolution is to adopt tri-plane super-resolution. Moreover, the bound-\ning box condition can only control the approximate placement of\nobjects, not their orientations. We believe that precise orientation\ncontrol could be achieved by training diffusion conditioning on\nboth the bounding box map and an object orientation map. This\norientation map can also be easily obtained from user instructions.\nLastly, while we have demonstrated textured mesh results on small\nscenes, the task of generating globally consistent textures for large\nscene meshes is both a challenging and intriguing future endeavor.\nREFERENCES\nMatan Atzmon and Yaron Lipman. 2020.

Addressing this limitation, we introduce YOLO-World,\nan innovative approach that enhances YOLO with open-\nvocabulary detection capabilities through vision-language\nmodeling and pre-training on large-scale datasets. Specif-\nically, we propose a new Re-parameterizable Vision-\nLanguage Path Aggregation Network (RepVL-PAN) and\nregion-text contrastive loss to facilitate the interaction be-\ntween visual and linguistic information. Our method excels\nin detecting a wide range of objects in a zero-shot man-\nner with high efficiency. On the challenging LVIS dataset,\nYOLO-World achieves 35.4 AP with 52.0 FPS on V100,\nwhich outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, the fine-tuned\nYOLO-World achieves remarkable performance on several\ndownstream tasks, including object detection and open-\nvocabulary instance segmentation.\n1. Introduction\nObject detection has been a long-standing and fundamental\nchallenge in computer vision with numerous applications in\nimage understanding, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.\nTremendous works [16, 27, 43, 45] have achieved signif-\nicant breakthroughs in object detection with the develop-\nment of deep neural networks. Despite the success of these\nmethods, they remain limited as they only handle object de-\ntection with a fixed vocabulary, e.g., 80 categories in the\nCOCO [26] dataset. Once object categories are defined and\nlabeled, trained detectors can only detect those specific cat-\negories, thus limiting the ability and applicability of open\n20\u00d7 Speedup\nFigure 1.\nSpeed-and-Accuracy Curve.\nWe compare YOLO-\nWorld with recent open-vocabulary methods in terms of speed and\naccuracy. All models are evaluated on the LVIS minival and in-\nference speeds are measured on one NVIDIA V100 w/o TensorRT.\nThe size of the circle represents the model\u2019s size.\nscenarios.\nRecent works [8, 13, 48, 53, 58] have explored the\nprevalent vision-language models [19, 39] to address open-\nvocabulary detection [58] through distilling vocabulary\nknowledge from language encoders, e.g., BERT [5]. How-\never, these distillation-based methods are much limited due\nto the scarcity of training data with a limited diversity of\nvocabulary, e.g., OV-COCO [58] containing 48 base cate-\ngories. Several methods [24, 30, 56, 57, 59] reformulate ob-\nject detection training as region-level vision-language pre-\ntraining and train open-vocabulary object detectors at scale.\nHowever, those methods still struggle for detection in real-\nworld scenarios, which suffer from two aspects: (1) heavy\ncomputation burden and (2) complicated deployment for\nedge devices.\nPrevious works [24, 30, 56, 57, 59] have\n1\narXiv:2401.17270v3  [cs.CV]  22 Feb 2024\ndemonstrated the promising performance of pre-training\nlarge detectors while pre-training small detectors to en-\ndow them with open recognition capabilities remains un-\nexplored.\nIn this paper, we present YOLO-World, aiming for\nhigh-efficiency open-vocabulary object detection, and ex-\nplore large-scale pre-training schemes to boost the tradi-\ntional YOLO detectors to a new open-vocabulary world.\nCompared to previous methods, the proposed YOLO-\nWorld is remarkably efficient with high inference speed\nand easy to deploy for downstream applications. Specif-\nically, YOLO-World follows the standard YOLO archi-\ntecture [20] and leverages the pre-trained CLIP [39] text\nencoder to encode the input texts.\nWe further propose\nthe Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Path Aggregation\nNetwork (RepVL-PAN) to connect text features and im-\nage features for better visual-semantic representation. Dur-\ning inference, the text encoder can be removed and the\ntext embeddings can be re-parameterized into weights of\nRepVL-PAN for efficient deployment. We further inves-\ntigate the open-vocabulary pre-training scheme for YOLO\ndetectors through region-text contrastive learning on large-\nscale datasets, which unifies detection data, grounding data,\nand image-text data into region-text pairs. The pre-trained\nYOLO-World with abundant region-text pairs demonstrates\na strong capability for large vocabulary detection and train-\ning more data leads to greater improvements in open-\nvocabulary capability.\nIn addition, we explore a prompt-then-detect paradigm\nto further improve the efficiency of open-vocabulary object\ndetection in real-world scenarios. As illustrated in Fig. 2,\ntraditional object detectors [16, 20, 23, 41\u201343, 52] con-\ncentrate on the fixed-vocabulary (close-set) detection with\npredefined and trained categories. While previous open-\nvocabulary detectors [24, 30, 56, 59] encode the prompts of\na user for online vocabulary with text encoders and detect\nobjects. Notably, those methods tend to employ large de-\ntectors with heavy backbones, e.g., Swin-L [32], to increase\nthe open-vocabulary capacity. In contrast, the prompt-then-\ndetect paradigm (Fig. 2 (c)) first encodes the prompts of a\nuser to build an offline vocabulary and the vocabulary varies\nwith different needs. Then, the efficient detector can infer\nthe offline vocabulary on the fly without re-encoding the\nprompts. For practical applications, once we have trained\nthe detector, i.e., YOLO-World, we can pre-encode the\nprompts or categories to build an offline vocabulary and\nthen seamlessly integrate it into the detector.\nOur main contributions can be summarized into three\nfolds:\n\u2022 We introduce the YOLO-World, a cutting-edge open-\nvocabulary object detector with high efficiency for real-\nworld applications.\n\u2022 We propose a Re-parameterizable Vision-Language PAN\nto connect vision and language features and an open-\nvocabulary region-text contrastive pre-training scheme\nfor YOLO-World.\n\u2022 The proposed YOLO-World pre-trained on large-scale\ndatasets demonstrates strong zero-shot performance and\nachieves 35.4 AP on LVIS with 52.0 FPS. The pre-trained\nYOLO-World can be easily adapted to downstream tasks,\ne.g., open-vocabulary instance segmentation and referring\nobject detection. Moreover, the pre-trained weights and\ncodes of YOLO-World will be open-sourced to facilitate\nmore practical applications.\n2. Related Works\n2.1. Traditional Object Detection\nPrevalent object detection research concentrates on fixed-\nvocabulary (close-set) detection, in which object detectors\nare trained on datasets with pre-defined categories, e.g.,\nCOCO dataset [26] and Objects365 dataset [46], and then\ndetect objects within the fixed set of categories. During\nthe past decades, the methods for traditional object de-\ntection can be simply categorized into three groups, i.e.,\nregion-based methods, pixel-based methods, and query-\nbased methods. The region-based methods [11, 12, 16, 27,\n44], such as Faster R-CNN [44], adopt a two-stage frame-\nwork for proposal generation [44] and RoI-wise (Region-\nof-Interest) classification and regression. The pixel-based\nmethods [28, 31, 42, 49, 61] tend to be one-stage detec-\ntors, which perform classification and regression over pre-\ndefined anchors or pixels. DETR [1] first explores object\ndetection through transformers [50] and inspires extensive\nquery-based methods [64].\nIn terms of inference speed,\nRedmon et al. presents YOLOs [40\u201342] which exploit sim-\nple convolutional architectures for real-time object detec-\ntion. Several works [10, 23, 33, 52, 55] propose various\narchitectures or designs for YOLO, including path aggrega-\ntion networks [29], cross-stage partial networks [51], and\nre-parameterization [6], which further improve both speed\nand accuracy. In comparison to previous YOLOs, YOLO-\nWorld in this paper aims to detect objects beyond the fixed\nvocabulary with strong generalization ability.\n2.2. Open-Vocabulary Object Detection\nOpen-vocabulary object detection (OVD) [58] has emerged\nas a new trend for modern object detection, which aims\nto detect objects beyond the predefined categories. Early\nworks [13] follow the standard OVD setting [58] by train-\ning detectors on the base classes and evaluating the novel\n(unknown) classes. Nevertheless, this open-vocabulary set-\nting can evaluate the capability of detectors to detect and\nrecognize novel objects, it is still limited for open scenar-\nios and lacks generalization ability to other domains due\nto training on the limited dataset and vocabulary.

Comparison with Detection Paradigms. (a) Traditional Object Detector: These object detectors can only detect objects\nwithin the fixed vocabulary pre-defined by the training datasets, e.g., 80 categories of COCO dataset [26]. The fixed vocabulary limits the\nextension for open scenes. (b) Previous Open-Vocabulary Detectors: Previous methods tend to develop large and heavy detectors for\nopen-vocabulary detection which intuitively have strong capacity. In addition, these detectors simultaneously encode images and texts as\ninput for prediction, which is time-consuming for practical applications. (c) YOLO-World: We demonstrate the strong open-vocabulary\nperformance of lightweight detectors, e.g., YOLO detectors [20, 42], which is of great significance for real-world applications. Rather than\nusing online vocabulary, we present a prompt-then-detect paradigm for efficient inference, in which the user generates a series of prompts\naccording to the need and the prompts will be encoded into an offline vocabulary. Then it can be re-parameterized as the model weights\nfor deployment and further acceleration.\nYOLO \nBackbone\nText\nEncoder\nA man and a \nwoman are skiing \nwith a dog\ncaption, noun phrases, category\u2026\nUser\nText Embeddin\nMulti-scale Image F\nText\nContrastive Head\nBox Head\nman\nwoman\ndog\nVocabulary Embeddings\nman\nwoman\ndog\nUser\u2019s  \nVocabulary\nD\nImage-aware Embeddings\nMulti-scale\nImage Features\nTraining: Online Vocabulary\nDeployment: Offline Vocabulary\nVision-Language PAN\nObject Embeddings\nRegion-Text Matching\nInput Image\nExtract Nouns\nFigure 3. Overall Architecture of YOLO-World. Compared to traditional YOLO detectors, YOLO-World as an open-vocabulary detector\nadopts text as input. The Text Encoder first encodes the input text input text embeddings. Then the Image Encoder encodes the input image\ninto multi-scale image features and the proposed RepVL-PAN exploits the multi-level cross-modality fusion for both image and text features.\nFinally, YOLO-World predicts the regressed bounding boxes and the object embeddings for matching the categories or nouns that appeared\nin the input text.\nby vision-language pre-training [19, 39], recent works [8,\n22, 53, 62, 63] formulate open-vocabulary object detection\nas image-text matching and exploit large-scale image-text\ndata to increase the training vocabulary at scale.\nOWL-\nViTs [35, 36] fine-tune the simple vision transformers [7]\nwith detection and grounding datasets and build the sim-\nple open-vocabulary detectors with promising performance.\nGLIP [24] presents a pre-training framework for open-\nvocabulary detection based on phrase grounding and eval-\nuates in a zero-shot setting. Grounding DINO [30] incor-\nporates the grounded pre-training [24] into detection trans-\nformers [60] with cross-modality fusions. Several meth-\nods [25, 56, 57, 59] unify detection datasets and image-text\ndatasets through region-text matching and pre-train detec-\ntors with large-scale image-text pairs, achieving promising\nperformance and generalization. However, these methods\noften use heavy detectors like ATSS [61] or DINO [60]\nwith Swin-L [32] as a backbone, leading to high com-\nputational demands and deployment challenges.\nIn con-\ntrast, we present YOLO-World, aiming for efficient open-\nvocabulary object detection with real-time inference and\neasier downstream application deployment. Differing from\nZSD-YOLO [54], which also explores open-vocabulary de-\ntection [58] with YOLO through language model align-\nment, YOLO-World introduces a novel YOLO framework\nwith an effective pre-training strategy, enhancing open-\n3\nvocabulary performance and generalization.\n3. Method\n3.1. Pre-training Formulation: Region-Text Pairs\nThe traditional object detection methods, including the\nYOLO-series [20], are trained with instance annotations\n\u2126 = {Bi, ci}N\ni=1, which consist of bounding boxes {Bi}\nand category labels {ci}. In this paper, we reformulate the\ninstance annotations as region-text pairs \u2126 = {Bi, ti}N\ni=1,\nwhere ti is the corresponding text for the region Bi. Specif-\nically, the text ti can be the category name, noun phrases,\nor object descriptions. Moreover, YOLO-World adopts both\nthe image I and texts T (a set of nouns) as input and outputs\npredicted boxes { \u02c6Bk} and the corresponding object embed-\ndings {ek} (ek \u2208 RD).\n3.2. Model Architecture\nThe overall architecture of the proposed YOLO-World is il-\nlustrated in Fig. 3, which consists of a YOLO detector, a\nText Encoder, and a Re-parameterizable Vision-Language\nPath Aggregation Network (RepVL-PAN). Given the input\ntext, the text encoder in YOLO-World encodes the text into\ntext embeddings. The image encoder in the YOLO detector\nextracts the multi-scale features from the input image. Then\nwe leverage the RepVL-PAN to enhance both text and im-\nage representation by exploiting the cross-modality fusion\nbetween image features and text embeddings.\nYOLO Detector.\nYOLO-World is mainly developed\nbased on YOLOv8 [20], which contains a Darknet back-\nbone [20, 43] as the image encoder, a path aggregation net-\nwork (PAN) for multi-scale feature pyramids, and a head\nfor bounding box regression and object embeddings.\nText Encoder.\nGiven the text T, we adopt the Trans-\nformer text encoder pre-trained by CLIP [39] to extract the\ncorresponding text embeddings W =TextEncoder(T)\u2208\nRC\u00d7D, where C is the number of nouns and D is the em-\nbedding dimension. The CLIP text encoder offers better\nvisual-semantic capabilities for connecting visual objects\nwith texts compared to text-only language encoders [5].\nWhen the input text is a caption or referring expression,\nwe adopt the simple n-gram algorithm to extract the noun\nphrases and then feed them into the text encoder.\nText Contrastive Head.\nFollowing previous works [20],\nwe adopt the decoupled head with two 3\u00d73 convs to regress\nbounding boxes {bk}K\nk=1 and object embeddings {ek}K\nk=1,\nwhere K denotes the number of objects. We present a text\ncontrastive head to obtain the object-text similarity sk,j by:\nsk,j = \u03b1 \u00b7 L2-Norm(ek) \u00b7 L2-Norm(wj)\u22a4 + \u03b2,\n(1)\nwhere L2-Norm(\u00b7) is the L2 normalization and wj \u2208 W\nis the j-th text embeddings. In addition, we add the affine\ntransformation with the learnable scaling factor \u03b1 and shift-\ning factor \u03b2. Both the L2 norms and the affine transforma-\ntions are important for stabilizing the region-text training.\nTraining with Online Vocabulary.\nDuring training, we\nconstruct an online vocabulary T for each mosaic sample\ncontaining 4 images. Specifically, we sample all positive\nnouns involved in the mosaic images and randomly sam-\nple some negative nouns from the corresponding dataset.\nThe vocabulary for each mosaic sample contains at most M\nnouns, and M is set to 80 as default.\nInference with Offline Vocabulary.\nAt the inference\nstage, we present a prompt-then-detect strategy with an of-\nfline vocabulary for further efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3,\nthe user can define a series of custom prompts, which might\ninclude captions or categories. We then utilize the text en-\ncoder to encode these prompts and obtain offline vocabu-\nlary embeddings. The offline vocabulary allows for avoid-\ning computation for each input and provides the flexibility\nto adjust the vocabulary as needed.\n3.3. Re-parameterizable Vision-Language PAN\nFig. 4 shows the structure of the proposed RepVL-PAN\nwhich follows the top-down and bottom-up paths in [20, 29]\nto establish the feature pyramids {P3, P4, P5} with the\nmulti-scale image features {C3, C4, C5}.\nFurthermore,\nwe propose the Text-guided CSPLayer (T-CSPLayer) and\nImage-Pooling Attention (I-Pooling Attention) to further\nenhance the interaction between image features and text\nfeatures, which can improve the visual-semantic represen-\ntation for open-vocabulary capability. During inference, the\noffline vocabulary embeddings can be re-parameterized into\nweights of convolutional or linear layers for deployment.\nText-guided CSPLayer.\nAs Fig. 4 illustrates, the cross-\nstage partial layers (CSPLayer) are utilized after the top-\ndown or bottom-up fusion.\nWe extend the CSPLayer\n(also called C2f) of [20] by incorporating text guidance\ninto multi-scale image features to form the Text-guided\nCSPLayer. Specifically, given the text embeddings W and\nimage features Xl \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7D (l \u2208 {3, 4, 5}), we adopt\nthe max-sigmoid attention after the last dark bottleneck\nblock to aggregate text features into image features by:\nX\u2032\nl = Xl \u00b7 \u03b4( max\nj\u2208{1..C}(XlW \u22a4\nj ))\u22a4,\n(2)\nwhere the updated X\u2032\nl is concatenated with the cross-stage\nfeatures as output.

Rather than directly using cross-\nattention on image features, we leverage max pooling on\nmulti-scale features to obtain 3\u00d73 regions, resulting in a\ntotal of 27 patch tokens \u02dcX \u2208 R27\u00d7D. The text embeddings\nare then updated by:\nW \u2032 = W + MultiHead-Attention(W, \u02dcX, \u02dcX)\n(3)\n3.4. Pre-training Schemes\nIn this section, we present the training schemes for pre-\ntraining YOLO-World on large-scale detection, grounding,\nand image-text datasets.\nLearning from Region-Text Contrastive Loss.\nGiven\nthe mosaic sample I and texts T, YOLO-World outputs\nK object predictions {Bk, sk}K\nk=1 along with annotations\n\u2126 = {Bi, ti}N\ni=1. We follow [20] and leverage task-aligned\nlabel assignment [9] to match the predictions with ground-\ntruth annotations and assign each positive prediction with a\ntext index as the classification label. Based on this vocabu-\nlary, we construct the region-text contrastive loss Lcon with\nregion-text pairs through cross entropy between object-text\n(region-text) similarity and object-text assignments. In ad-\ndition, we adopt IoU loss and distributed focal loss for\nbounding box regression and the total training loss is de-\nfined as: L(I) = Lcon + \u03bbI \u00b7 (Liou + Ldfl), where \u03bbI is\nan indicator factor and set to 1 when input image I is from\ndetection or grounding data and set to 0 when it is from\nthe image-text data. Considering image-text datasets have\nnoisy boxes, we only calculate the regression loss for sam-\nples with accurate bounding boxes.\nPseudo Labeling with Image-Text Data.\nRather than di-\nrectly using image-text pairs for pre-training, we propose an\nautomatic labeling approach to generate region-text pairs.\nSpecifically, the labeling approach contains three steps: (1)\nextract noun phrases: we first utilize the n-gram algo-\nrithm to extract noun phrases from the text; (2) pseudo la-\nbeling: we adopt a pre-trained open-vocabulary detector,\ne.g., GLIP [24], to generate pseudo boxes for the given\nnoun phrases for each image, thus providing the coarse\nregion-text pairs. (3) filtering: We employ the pre-trained\nCLIP [39] to evaluate the relevance of image-text pairs and\nregion-text pairs, and filter the low-relevance pseudo an-\nnotations and images. We further filter redundant bound-\ning boxes by incorporating methods such as Non-Maximum\nSuppression (NMS). We suggest the readers refer to the ap-\npendix for the detailed approach. With the above approach,\nwe sample and label 246k images from CC3M [47] with\n821k pseudo annotations.\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed YOLO-World by pre-training it on large-scale\ndatasets and evaluating YOLO-World in a zero-shot manner\non both LVIS benchmark and COCO benchmark (Sec. 4.2).\nWe also evaluate the fine-tuning performance of YOLO-\nWorld on COCO, LVIS for object detection.\n4.1. Implementation Details\nThe YOLO-World is developed based on the MMYOLO\ntoolbox [3] and the MMDetection toolbox [2]. Following\n[20], we provide three variants of YOLO-World for differ-\nent latency requirements, e.g., small (S), medium (M), and\nlarge (L). We adopt the open-source CLIP [39] text encoder\nwith pre-trained weights to encode the input text. Unless\nspecified, we measure the inference speeds of all models on\none NVIDIA V100 GPU without extra acceleration mecha-\nnisms, e.g., FP16 or TensorRT.\n4.2. Pre-training\nExperimental Setup.\nAt the pre-training stage, we adopt\nthe AdamW optimizer [34] with an initial learning rate\nof 0.002 and weight decay of 0.05. YOLO-World is pre-\ntrained for 100 epochs on on 32 NVIDIA V100 GPUs with\na total batch size of 512. During pre-training, we follow\nprevious works [20] and adopt color augmentation, random\naffine, random flip, and mosaic with 4 images for data aug-\nmentation. The text encoder is frozen during pre-training.\n5\nDataset\nType\nVocab.\nImages\nAnno.\nObjects365V1 [46]\nDetection\n365\n609k\n9,621k\nGQA [17]\nGrounding\n-\n621k\n3,681k\nFlickr [38]\nGrounding\n-\n149k\n641k\nCC3M\u2020 [47]\nImage-Text\n-\n246k\n821k\nTable 1. Pre-training Data. The specifications of the datasets\nused for pre-training YOLO-World.\nPre-training Data.\nFor pre-training YOLO-World, we\nmainly adopt detection or grounding datasets including Ob-\njects365 (V1) [46], GQA [17], Flickr30k [38], as specified\nin Tab. 1.\nFollowing [24], we exclude the images from\nthe COCO dataset in GoldG [21] (GQA and Flickr30k).\nThe annotations of the detection datasets used for pre-\ntraining contain both bounding boxes and categories or\nnoun phrases. In addition, we also extend the pre-training\ndata with image-text pairs, i.e., CC3M\u2020 [47], which we have\nlabeled 246k images through the pseudo-labeling method\ndiscussed in Sec. 3.4.\nZero-shot\nEvaluation.\nAfter\npre-training,\nwe\ndi-\nrectly evaluate the proposed YOLO-World on the LVIS\ndataset [14] in a zero-shot manner.\nThe LVIS dataset\ncontains 1203 object categories, which is much more\nthan the categories of the pre-training detection datasets\nand can measure the performance on large vocabulary\ndetection. Following previous works [21, 24, 56, 57], we\nmainly evaluate on LVIS minival [21] and report the\nFixed AP [4] for comparison. The maximum number of\npredictions is set to 1000.\nMain Results on LVIS Object Detection.\nIn Tab. 2, we\ncompare the proposed YOLO-World with recent state-of-\nthe-art methods [21, 30, 56, 57, 59] on LVIS benchmark in a\nzero-shot manner. Considering the computation burden and\nmodel parameters, we mainly compare with those methods\nbased on lighter backbones, e.g., Swin-T [32]. Remarkably,\nYOLO-World outperforms previous state-of-the-art meth-\nods in terms of zero-shot performance and inference speed.\nCompared to GLIP, GLIPv2, and Grounding DINO, which\nincorporate more data, e.g., Cap4M (CC3M+SBU [37]),\nYOLO-World pre-trained on O365 & GolG obtains bet-\nter performance even with fewer model parameters. Com-\npared to DetCLIP, YOLO-World achieves comparable per-\nformance (35.4 v.s. 34.4) while obtaining 20\u00d7 increase in\ninference speed. The experimental results also demonstrate\nthat small models, e.g., YOLO-World-S with 13M parame-\nters, can be used for vision-language pre-training and ob-\ntain strong open-vocabulary capabilities.\n4.3. Ablation Experiments\nWe provide extensive ablation studies to analyze YOLO-\nWorld from two primary aspects, i.e., pre-training and ar-\nchitecture. Unless specified, we mainly conduct ablation\nexperiments based on YOLO-World-L and pre-train Ob-\njects365 with zero-shot evaluation on LVIS minival.\nPre-training Data.\nIn Tab. 3, we evaluate the perfor-\nmance of pre-training YOLO-World using different data.\nCompared to the baseline trained on Objects365, adding\nGQA can significantly improve performance with an 8.4\nAP gain on LVIS. This improvement can be attributed to\nthe richer textual information provided by the GQA dataset,\nwhich can enhance the model\u2019s ability to recognize large\nvocabulary objects. Adding part of CC3M samples (8%\nof the full datasets) can further bring 0.5 AP gain with 1.3\nAP on rare objects. Tab. 3 demonstrates that adding more\ndata can effectively improve the detection capabilities on\nlarge-vocabulary scenarios. Furthermore, as the amount of\ndata increases, the performance continues to improve, high-\nlighting the benefits of leveraging larger and more diverse\ndatasets for training.\nAblations on RepVL-PAN.\nTab. 4 demonstrates the ef-\nfectiveness of the proposed RepVL-PAN of YOLO-World,\nincluding Text-guided CSPLayers and Image Pooling At-\ntention, for the zero-shot LVIS detection. Specifically, we\nadopt two settings, i.e., (1) pre-training on O365 and (2)\npre-training on O365 & GQA. Compared to O365 which\nonly contains category annotations, GQA includes rich\ntexts, particularly in the form of noun phrases. As shown\nin Tab. 4, the proposed RepVL-PAN improves the base-\nline (YOLOv8-PAN [20]) by 1.1 AP on LVIS, and the im-\nprovements are remarkable in terms of the rare categories\n(APr) of LVIS, which are hard to detect and recognize. In\naddition, the improvements become more significant when\nYOLO-World is pre-trained with the GQA dataset and ex-\nperiments indicate that the proposed RepVL-PAN works\nbetter with rich textual information.\nText Encoders.\nIn Tab. 5, we compare the performance\nof using different text encoders, i.e., BERT-base [5] and\nCLIP-base (ViT-base) [39]. We exploit two settings dur-\ning pre-training, i.e., frozen and fine-tuned, and the learn-\ning rate for fine-tuning text encoders is a 0.01\u00d7 factor of\nthe basic learning rate. As Tab. 5 shows, the CLIP text\nencoder obtains superior results than BERT (+10.1 AP for\nrare categories in LVIS), which is pre-trained with image-\ntext pairs and has better capability for vision-centric embed-\ndings. Fine-tuning BERT during pre-training brings signifi-\ncant improvements (+3.7 AP) while fine-tuning CLIP leads\nto a severe performance drop. We attribute the drop to that\n6\nMethod\nBackbone\nParams\nPre-trained Data\nFPS\nAP\nAPr\nAPc\nAPf\nMDETR [21]\nR-101 [15]\n169M\nGoldG\n-\n24.2\n20.9\n24.3\n24.2\nGLIP-T [24]\nSwin-T [32]\n232M\nO365,GoldG\n0.12\n24.9\n17.7\n19.5\n31.0\nGLIP-T [24]\nSwin-T [32]\n232M\nO365,GoldG,Cap4M\n0.12\n26.0\n20.8\n21.4\n31.0\nGLIPv2-T [59]\nSwin-T [32]\n232M\nO365,GoldG\n0.12\n26.9\n-\n-\n-\nGLIPv2-T [59]\nSwin-T [32]\n232M\nO365,GoldG,Cap4M\n0.12\n29.0\n-\n-\n-\nGrounding DINO-T [30]\nSwin-T [32]\n172M\nO365,GoldG\n1.5\n25.6\n14.4\n19.6\n32.2\nGrounding DINO-T [30]\nSwin-T [32]\n172M\nO365,GoldG,Cap4M\n1.5\n27.4\n18.1\n23.3\n32.7\nDetCLIP-T [56]\nSwin-T [32]\n155M\nO365,GoldG\n2.3\n34.4\n26.9\n33.9\n36.3\nYOLO-World-S\nYOLOv8-S\n13M (77M)\nO365,GoldG\n74.1 (19.9)\n26.2\n19.1\n23.6\n29.8\nYOLO-World-M\nYOLOv8-M\n29M (92M)\nO365,GoldG\n58.1 (18.5)\n31.0\n23.8\n29.2\n33.9\nYOLO-World-L\nYOLOv8-L\n48M (110M)\nO365,GoldG\n52.0 (17.6)\n35.0\n27.1\n32.8\n38.3\nYOLO-World-L\nYOLOv8-L\n48M (110M)\nO365,GoldG,CC3M\u2020\n52.0 (17.6)\n35.4\n27.6\n34.1\n38.0\nTable 2.

The improvements can demonstrate the effec-\ntiveness of the proposed pre-training strategy for large-\nvocabulary detection. Moreover, YOLO-World, as an effi-\ncient one-stage detector, outperforms previous state-of-the-\nart two-stage methods [8, 13, 22, 53, 63] on the overall per-\nformance without extra designs, e.g., learnable prompts [8]\nor region-based alginments [13].\nMethod\nAP\nAPr\nAPc\nAPf\nViLD [13]\n27.8\n16.7\n26.5\n34.2\nRegionCLIP [62]\n28.2\n17.1\n-\n-\nDetic [63]\n26.8\n17.8\n-\n-\nFVLM [22]\n24.2\n18.6\n-\n-\nDetPro [8]\n28.4\n20.8\n27.8\n32.4\nBARON [53]\n29.5\n23.2\n29.3\n32.5\nYOLOv8-S\n19.4\n7.4\n17.4\n27.0\nYOLOv8-M\n23.1\n8.4\n21.3\n31.5\nYOLOv8-L\n26.9\n10.2\n25.4\n35.8\nYOLO-World-S\n23.9\n12.8\n20.4\n32.7\nYOLO-World-M\n28.8\n15.9\n24.6\n39.0\nYOLO-World-L\n34.1\n20.4\n31.1\n43.5\nTable 7.\nComparison with Open-Vocabulary Detectors on\nLVIS.

The YOLO-v8 are trained\non the full LVIS datasets (including base and novel) along with the\nclass balanced sampling.\n4.5. Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation\nIn this section, we further fine-tune YOLO-World for\nsegmenting objects under the open-vocabulary setting,\nwhich can be termed open-vocabulary instance segmenta-\ntion (OVIS). Previous methods [18] have explored OVIS\nwith pseudo-labelling on novel objects. Differently, con-\nsidering that YOLO-World has strong transfer and gener-\nalization capabilities, we directly fine-tune YOLO-World\non a subset of data with mask annotations and evaluate the\nsegmentation performance under large-vocabulary settings.\nSpecifically, we benchmark open-vocabulary instance seg-\nmentation under two settings:\n\u2022 (1) COCO to LVIS setting, we fine-tune YOLO-World on\nthe COCO dataset (including 80 categories) with mask\nannotations, under which the models need to transfer\nfrom 80 categories to 1203 categories (80 \u2192 1203);\n\u2022 (2) LVIS-base to LVIS setting, we fine-tune YOLO-World\non the LVIS-base (including 866 categories, common &\nfrequent) with mask annotations, under which the models\nneed to transfer from 866 categories to 1203 categories\n(866 \u2192 1203).\nWe evaluate the fine-tuned models on the standard LVIS\nval2017 with 1203 categories, in which 337 rare cate-\ngories are unseen and can be used to measure the open-\nvocabulary performance.\nResults.\nTab. 8 shows the experimental results of extend-\ning YOLO-World for open-vocabulary instance segmenta-\ntion. Specifically, we adopt two fine-tuning strategies: (1)\nonly fine-tuning the segmentation head and (2) fine-tuning\n8\nall modules.\nUnder strategy (1), the fine-tuned YOLO-\nWorld still retains the zero-shot capabilities acquired from\nthe pre-training stage, allowing it to generalize to unseen\ncategories without additional fine-tuning. Strategy (2) en-\nables YOLO-World fit the LVIS dataset better, but it may\nresult in the degradation of the zero-shot capabilities.\nTab. 8 shows the comparisons of fine-tuning YOLO-\nWorld with different settings (COCO or LVIS-base) and\ndifferent strategies (fine-tuning seg.\nhead or fine-tuning\nall). Firstly, fine-tuning on LVIS-base obtains better perfor-\nmance compared to that based on COCO. However, the ra-\ntios between AP and APr (APr/AP) are nearly unchanged,\ne.g., the ratios of YOLO-World on COCO and LVIS-base\nare 76.5% and 74.3%, respectively. Considering that the\ndetector is frozen, we attribute the performance gap to the\nfact that the LVIS dataset provides more detailed and denser\nsegmentation annotations, which are beneficial for learn-\ning the segmentation head.\nWhen fine-tuning all mod-\nules, YOLO-World obtains remarkable improvements on\nLVIS, e.g., YOLO-World-L achieves 9.6 AP gain. However,\nthe fine-tuning might degrade the open-vocabulary perfor-\nmance and lead to a 0.6 box APr drop for YOLO-World-L.\n4.6. Visualizations\nWe provide the visualization results of pre-trained YOLO-\nWorld-L under three settings: (a) we perform zero-shot\ninference with LVIS categories; (b) we input the custom\nprompts with fine-grained categories with attributes; (c) re-\nferring detection. The visualizations also demonstrate that\nYOLO-World has a strong generalization ability for open-\nvocabulary scenarios along with referring ability.\nZero-shot Inference on LVIS.\nFig. 5 shows the visual-\nization results based on the LVIS categories which are gen-\nerated by the pre-trained YOLO-World-L in a zero-shot\nmanner. The pre-trained YOLO-World exhibits strong zero-\nshot transfer capabilities and is able to detect as many ob-\njects as possible within the image.\nInference with User\u2019s Vocabulary.\nIn Fig. 6, we explore\nthe detection capabilities of YOLO-World with our defined\ncategories. The visualization results demonstrate that the\npre-trained YOLO-World-L also exhibits the capability for\n(1) fine-grained detection (i.e., detect the parts of one ob-\nject) and (2) fine-grained classification (i.e., distinguish dif-\nferent sub-categories of objects.).\nReferring Object Detection.\nIn Fig. 7, we leverage some\ndescriptive (discriminative) noun phrases as input, e.g., the\nstanding person, to explore whether the model can locate\nregions or objects in the image that match our given in-\nput. The visualization results display the phrases and their\ncorresponding bounding boxes, demonstrating that the pre-\ntrained YOLO-World has the referring or grounding capa-\nbility. This ability can be attributed to the proposed pre-\ntraining strategy with large-scale training data.\n5. Conclusion\nWe present YOLO-World, a cutting-edge real-time open-\nvocabulary detector aiming to improve efficiency and open-\nvocabulary capability in real-world applications. In this pa-\nper, we have reshaped the prevalent YOLOs as a vision-\nlanguage YOLO architecture for open-vocabulary pre-\ntraining and detection and proposed RepVL-PAN, which\nconnects vision and language information with the network\nand can be re-parameterized for efficient deployment. We\nfurther present the effective pre-training schemes with de-\ntection, grounding and image-text data to endow YOLO-\nWorld with a strong capability for open-vocabulary de-\ntection.\nExperiments can demonstrate the superiority of\nYOLO-World in terms of speed and open-vocabulary per-\nformance and indicate the effectiveness of vision-language\npre-training on small models, which is insightful for future\nresearch. We hope YOLO-World can serve as a new bench-\nmark for addressing real-world open-vocabulary detection.\nReferences\n[1] Nicolas Carion, Francisco Massa, Gabriel Synnaeve, Nicolas\nUsunier, Alexander Kirillov, and Sergey Zagoruyko.

Re-parameterization for RepVL-PAN\nDuring inference on an offline vocabulary, we adopt re-\nparameterization for RepVL-PAN for faster inference speed\nand deployment. Firstly, we pre-compute the text embed-\ndings W \u2208 RC\u00d7D through the text encoder.\nRe-parameterize T-CSPLayer.\nFor each T-CSPLayer in\nRepVL-PAN, we can re-parameterize and simplify the pro-\ncess of adding text guidance by reshaping the text embed-\ndings W \u2208 RC\u00d7D\u00d71\u00d71 into the weights of a 1 \u00d7 1 convo-\nlution layer (or a linear layer), as follows:\nX\u2032 = X \u2299 Sigmoid(max(Conv(X, W), dim=1)), (4)\nwhere X\u00d7 \u2208 RB\u00d7D\u00d7H\u00d7W and X\u2032 \u2208 RB\u00d7D\u00d7H\u00d7W are\nthe input and output image features. \u2299 is the matrix multi-\nplication with reshape or transpose.\nRe-parameterize I-Pooling Attention.\nThe I-Pooling\nAttention can be re-parameterize or simplified by:\n\u02dcX = cat(MP(X3, 3), MP(X4, 3), MP(X5, 3)),\n(5)\nwhere cat is the concentration and MP(\u00b7, 3) denotes the\nmax pooling for 3 \u00d7 3 output features. {X3, X4, X5} are\nthe multi-scale features in RepVL-PAN. \u02dcX is flattened and\nhas the shape of B \u00d7 D \u00d7 27. Then we can update the text\nembeddings by:\nW \u2032 = W + Softmax(W \u2299 \u02dcX), dim=-1) \u2299 W,\n(6)\nA.2. Fine-tuning Details.\nWe remove all T-CSPLayers and Image-Pooling Atten-\ntion in RepVL-PAN when transferring YOLO-World to\nCOCO [26] object detection, which only contains 80 cat-\negories and has a relatively low dependency on visual-\nlanguage interaction.\nDuring fine-tuning, we initialize\nYOLO-World using pre-trained weights. The learning rate\nof fine-tuning is set to 0.0002 with the weight decay set to\n0.05. After fine-tuning, we pre-compute the class text em-\nbeddings with given COCO categories and store the embed-\ndings into the weights of the classification layers.\nB. Automatic Labeling on Large-scale Image-\nText Data\nIn this section, we add details procedures for labeling\nregion-text pairs with large-scale image-text data, e.g.,\nCC3M [47]. The overall labeling pipeline is illustrated in\nFig. 8, which mainly consists of three procedures, i.e., (1)\nextract object nouns, (2) pseudo labeling, and (3) filtering.\nAs discussed in Sec. 3.4, we adopt the simple n-gram algo-\nrithm to extract nouns from captions.\nRegion-Text Proposals.\nAfter obtaining the set of object\nnouns T = {tk}K from the first step, we leverage a pre-\ntrained open-vocabulary detector, i.e., GLIP-L [24], to gen-\nerate pseudo boxes {Bi} along with confidence scores {ci}:\n{Bi, ti, ci}N\ni=1 = GLIP-Labeler(I, T),\n(7)\nwhere {Bi, ti, ci}N\ni=1 are the coarse region-text proposals.\nCLIP-based Re-scoring & Filtering.\nConsidering the\nregion-text proposals containing much noise, we present\na restoring and filtering pipeline with the pre-trained\nCLIP [39].\nGiven the input image I, caption T, and\nthe coarse region-text proposals {Bi, ti, ci}N\ni=1, the specific\npipeline is listed as follows:\n\u2022 (1) Compute Image-Text Score: we forward the image I\nwith its caption T into CLIP and obtain the image-text\nsimilarity score simg.\n\u2022 (2) Compute Region-Text Score: we crop the region im-\nages from the input image according to the region boxes\n{Bi}.

Pre-training YOLO-World at Scale\nWhen pre-training small models, e.g., YOLO-World-S, a\nnatural question we have is: how much capacity does a\nsmall model have, and how much training data or what kind\nof data does a small model need? To answer this question,\nwe leverage different amounts of pseudo-labeled region-text\npairs to pre-train YOLO-World. As shown in Tab. 9, adding\nmore image-text samples can increase the zero-shot per-\nformance of YOLO-World-S. Tab. 9 indicates: (1) adding\nimage-text data can improve the overall zero-shot perfor-\nmance of YOLO-World-S; (2) using an excessive amount\nof pseudo-labeled data may have some negative effects for\nsmall models (YOLO-World-S), though it can improve the\non rare categories (APr). However, using fine-grained an-\nnotations (GoldG) for small models can provide significant\nimprovements, which indicates that large-scale high-quality\nannotated data can significantly enhance the capabilities of\nsmall models. And Tab. 3 in the main text has shown that\npre-training with the combination of fine-annotated data\nand pseudo-annotated data can perform better. We will ex-\nplore more about the data for pre-training small models or\nYOLO detectors in future work.\n14\nMethod\nPre-trained Data\nSamples\nAP\nAPr\nAPc\nAPf\nYOLO-World-S\nO365\n0.61M\n16.3\n9.2\n14.1\n20.1\nYOLO-World-S\nO365+GoldG\n1.38M\n24.2\n16.4\n21.7\n27.8\nYOLO-World-S\nO365+CC3M-245k\n0.85M\n16.5\n10.8\n14.8\n19.1\nYOLO-World-S\nO365+CC3M-520k\n1.13M\n19.2\n10.7\n17.4\n22.4\nYOLO-World-S\nO365+CC3M-750k\n1.36M\n18.2\n11.2\n16.0\n21.1\nTable 9.

Introduction\nIn recent years, Large transformer-based Language Models,\ncommonly referred as LLMs, have made significant strides,\nparticularly in the domain of Natural Language Process-\ning (NLP) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022;\nTouvron et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023). Concurrently, LLMs\nare gradually expanding their capabilities to other modali-\nties, such as audio (Ghosal et al., 2023), medical (Singhal\net al., 2023) and robotics (Brohan et al., 2023).\nCurrent methodologies (Reddy et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022;\nChang et al., 2022; Kondratyuk et al., 2023) enable LLMs to\ngenerate visual information by transforming the continuous\nvisual pixels into to discrete grid tokens via specialized vi-\n*Equal contribution, during Zecheng\u2019s internship under the men-\ntorship of Chenfei at MSRA 1Soochow University 2Microsoft Re-\nsearch Asia 3Microsoft Azure AI.

Comparison between the visual representation of \u201cgrid\u201d\ntoken and our proposed \u201cstroke\u201d token. Instead of tokenizing\npixels from raster images, we explore a novel visual representation\nby tokenizing codes, from another image format\u2014Scalable Vector\nGraphic (SVG). \u201cStroke\u201d tokens have the following advantages:\n(1) inherently contain visual semantics, (2) naturally compatible\nwith LLMs, and (3) highly compressed.\nsual modules such as VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017)\nand VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021). Subsequently, these trans-\nformed grid tokens are processed by the LLM in a manner\nakin to textual word handling, which facilitates LLMs\u2019 gen-\nerative modeling process. However, when compared with\ndiffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022), LLMs still fall be-\nhind (Lee et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). The shortcomings\nof LLMs in visual tasks primarily arise from two reasons:\nFirst, the transformation process relies on specific visual\nmodules, which inherently possess limitations. For instance,\nadvanced visual modules like VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021)\ncan lead to the generation of images with artifact (Yu et al.,\n2023); Second, the use of grid tokens can disrupt the vi-\nsual semantics, as the grids are artificially designed and\nnot inherently semantic-aware. This artificial discretization\nimposes constraints on the model\u2019s ability to capture the\ntrue semantic representation of visual scenes.\nIs there a visual representation that preserves the semantic\nintegrity of visual information while being conducive to pro-\n1\narXiv:2401.17093v1  [cs.CV]  30 Jan 2024\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\nShort Hair Woman           Pizza              Rain, Weather        Frozen, Snow          Quick bread              Volleyball \nFireworks             Seashell                Sneakers           \nOwl, Wildlife     \nFurniture, Chair    \nClock, Night\nMicrochip           \nStrawberry            Dollar, Coin            Horse Knight    Safety, Productivity          Bird, Fly   \nRobot                 Light Bulb                 Diamond               Emotion, Joy         Cycling, Sport           Car, Vehicle\nFigure 2. SVG generated by StrokeNUWA. For each image, we provide partial keywords for clarity.\ncessing by LLMs? Finding such a representation within the\nframework of grid tokens is non-trivial, as the arrangement\nof grid tokens is typically regular and uniform, whereas the\nsemantic structure within images is often irregular and com-\nplex. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the dolphin\u2019s body is arbitrarily\nsegmented into different grid tokens. Although there have\nbeen efforts to improve the VQ-VAE method (Esser et al.,\n2021; Yu et al., 2023), enhancing the visual representation\nquality, they are fundamentally constrained by the limita-\ntions inherent to raster image formats, leading to bottlenecks\nin semantic preservation. In light of these challenges, we\npropose a novel approach that fundamentally retains the se-\nmantic concepts of images by utilizing an alternative image\nformat: vector graphics. Different from pixel-based formats,\nvector graphics intrinsically reveal the construction of ob-\njects, naturally encapsulating the semantic concepts of the\nimage. For example, our proposed \u201cstroke\u201d tokens segment\nthe dolphin into sequentially connected strokes, where each\nstroke unit contains complete semantic information, such as\nthe dolphin\u2019s fin (stroke \u2460) and back (stroke \u2461).\nIt is worth mentioning that our intention is not to claim that\nvector graphics are superior to raster images, but rather to\nintroduce a fresh perspective on visual representation. The\nadvantages of our \u201cstroke\u201d token concept include: (1) In-\nherently contains visual semantics: each stroke token intrin-\nsically contains visual semantics, offering a more intuitive\nsemantic segmentation of the image content; (2) Naturally\ncompatible with LLMs: the creation process of vector graph-\nics is naturally sequential and interconnected, which mirrors\nthe way LLMs process information. In other words, Each\nstroke is created in relation to the ones before and after it,\nestablishing a contiguous and coherent sequence that LLMs\ncan process more naturally; (3) Highly compressed: strokes\nin vector graphics can be highly compressed, allowing each\nstroke token to encapsulate a rich, compressed representa-\ntion of the visual information, significantly reducing the\ndata size while maintaining quality and semantic integrity.\nBased on the above analysis, we introduce StrokeNUWA,\na model that crafts vector graphics without the reliance on\nthe visual module. StrokeNUWA consists of a VQ-Stroke\nmodule and an Encoder-Decoder model. The VQ-Stroke,\nbased on the residual quantizer model architecture (Mar-\ntinez et al., 2014), can compress serialized vector graphic\ninformation into several SVG tokens. The Encoder-Decoder\n2\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\nmodel primarily utilizes the capabilities of a pre-trained\nLLM to generate SVG tokens guided by text prompts.\nWe compare StrokeNUWA with optimization-based meth-\nods in the text-guided Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) gener-\nation task. Our approach achieves higher CLIPScore (Hessel\net al., 2021) metrics, suggesting that utilizing stroke tokens\ncan yield content with richer visual semantics. When bench-\nmarked against LLM-based baselines, our method surpasses\nthem across all metrics, indicating that stroke tokens can\nintegrate effectively with LLMs. Finally, due to the com-\npression capabilities inherent in vector graphics, our model\ndemonstrates significant efficiency in generation, achieving\nspeed improvements of up to 94 times.\nIn a nutshell, our contributions can be outlined as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce StrokeNUWA, the pioneering study ex-\nploring a better visual representation\u2014stroke token,\nto synthesize vector graphics solely through LLMs\nwithout relying on specialized visual modules.\n\u2022 We propose VQ-Stroke, a specialized Vector Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) designed to com-\npress vector graphics into stroke tokens, providing an\nexceptional compression ratio of 6.9%.\n\u2022 We conduct detailed experiments that demonstrate the\nsignificant potential of stroke tokens in the text-guided\nvector graphic synthesis task.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Visual Representation\nIn the realm of computer graphics, two predominant\nimage formats prevail: raster images, characterized by\npixel matrices; and vector images, a.k.a, Scalable Vector\nGraphic (SVG), characterized by a series of code language\ncommands (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent developments in\nvisual synthesis have predominantly centered on the gener-\nation of raster images. The basic idea is to transform the\ncontinuous image pixels into discrete grid tokens via special-\nized visual modules such as VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al.,\n2017) and VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021), and then leverage\nLLMs to generate these tokens (Reddy et al., 2021; Wu\net al., 2022; Kondratyuk et al., 2023). Most recently, some\nworks have tried to improve \u201cgrid\u201d tokens by designing ad-\nvanced architectures such as Lookup-Free Quantization (Yu\net al., 2023) and Efficient VQ-GAN (Cao et al., 2023). How-\never, these \u201cgrid\u201d token representations can disrupt visual\nsemantics as the grids are artificially designed, which lacks\ninherent semantic awareness, and are easily subject to the\nvisual module\u2019s intrinsic limitations like disturbances and\ntampering (Hu et al., 2023). Conversely, our study is a pi-\noneering effort exploring a better visual representation by\nproposing the concept of the \u201cstroke\u201d token. Different from\nthe \u2018grid\u201d tokens, the \u201cstroke\u201d token is inherently defined\nName\nSymbol\nArgument\nExample\nMove\nTo\nM\n(x0, y0)\n(x1, y1)\nLine\nTo\nL\n(x0, y0)\n(x1, y1)\nCubic\nB\u00b4ezier\nC\n(x0, y0)\n(x1, y1)\n(cx\n0, cy\n0)\n(cx\n1, cy\n1)\nTable 1. Overview of basic SVG commands, including M, L, and C,\nwhere each command contains one beginning point (x0, y0) and\none end point (x1, y1). For Cubic B\u00b4ezier command, it contains\ntwo extra control points (cx\n0, cy\n0) and (cx\n1, cy\n1).\nby contextually associated coded language commands that\noffer strong semantic integrity, potentially mitigating the\naforementioned issues.\n2.2. SVG Generation\nSVG generation employs a method of structured code gen-\neration for producing graphics, which offers better inter-\npretability, flexibility, and scalability in image representa-\ntion. The current mainstream approach of SVG generation\nis optimization-based methods (Su et al., 2023; Jain et al.,\n2023; Xing et al., 2023), which share a similarity with tradi-\ntional raster image generation, involving iteratively refining\nrandomly initialized SVG paths to fit a target raster image\nwith a differentiable rasterizer (Li et al., 2020). However, the\noptimization process is both time-consuming and computa-\ntionally intensive, e.g., creating an SVG graphic comprised\nof 24 SVG paths can exceed 20 minutes1. Alternatively,\nsome recent approaches have begun to adopt auto-regressive\nmodels to directly generate code for SVG synthesis (Wang\net al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023a). However, due to the inherent\nextensive length nature of SVGs and a lack of effective SVG\nrepresentation, these methods constrain LLMs to generate\ncomplex SVGs. To address these challenges, we introduce\nVQ-Stroke and present the concept of \u201cstroke\u201d tokens. By\ntransforming SVGs into stroke tokens, our approach en-\nables LLMs to produce intricate SVGs with significantly\nimproved inference speed.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Problem Formulation\nSVG code provides a suite of command and syntax\nrules, e.g., the \u201c<rect>\u201d command defines a rectangle\nshape with its position, width, and height, which can\n1We test with LIVE (Ma et al., 2022) and VectorFusion (Jain\net al., 2023) on one NVIDIA V100 GPU.\n3\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\nbe written as <rect x=\"10\" y=\"20\" width=\"50\"\nheight=\"80\"/>. However, considering the multitude\nof SVG command types, creating such a system not only\nrequires a complex data structure, but without a massive\ndataset, LLMs would struggle to model the diverse range of\ncommands effectively. Therefore, as shown in Tab. 1, we\ncan simplify each SVG using just three basic commands:\n\u201cMove To\u201d, \u201cLine To\u201d, and \u201cCubic B\u00b4ezier\u201d by following\nIconshop (Wu et al., 2023a) and DeepSVG (Carlier et al.,\n2020). For instance, intricate commands like \u201c<rect>\u201d\ncan be constructed by those three basic commands. Af-\nter simplification, an SVG G = {Pi}N\ni=1 can be described\nwith N SVG paths, with each SVG path Pi consists of Mi\nbasic commands: Pi = {Cj\ni }Mi\nj=1, where Cj\ni is the j-th com-\nmand in the i-th path. Eventually, each basic command\nC = (T, V) is consist of command type T \u2208 {M, L, C}, and\nthe corresponding position argument V.\n3.2. StrokeNUWA\nStrokeNUWA contains three core components: a Vector\nQuantized-Stroke (VQ-Stroke) for SVG compression, an\nEncoder-Decoder-based LLM (EDM) for SVG generation,\nand an SVG Fixer (SF) for post-processing. Firstly, VQ-\nStroke compresses the SVG into stroke tokens, which en-\nables a transformation between the SVG code and the dis-\ncrete stroke tokens. Then, EDM utilizes the stroke tokens\nproduced from VQ-Stroke to generate SVG code. Finally,\nSF is a post-processing module designed to refine the qual-\nity of the generated SVGs, given that the output generated\nfrom the EDM or VQ-Stroke may not always conform to\nthe stringent syntactical rules of SVG code. Below, we will\nintroduce the details of each component.\n3.2.1. VECTOR QUANTIZED-STROKE\nVQ-Stroke encompasses two main stages: \u201cCode to Ma-\ntrix\u201d stage that transforms SVG code into the matrix format\nsuitable for model input, and \u201cMatrix to Token\u201d stage that\ntransforms the matrix data into stroke tokens.\nCode to Matrix\nAs depicted in Fig. 3, we first transform\nthe simplified SVG code (Sec. 3.1) into SVG matrix format\nby converting each basic command Cj\ni to the individual\nvector Kj\ni \u2208 R9 with rules f:\nKj\ni = f(Cj\ni ) = (T, x0, y0, cx\n0, cy\n0, cx\n1, cy\n1, x1, y1)j\ni ,\n(1)\nwhere T denotes the basic command type, (x0, y0) and\n(x1, y1) represent the beginning and the end points, with\n(cx\n0, cy\n0) and (cx\n1, cy\n1) as the control points of each basic com-\nmand. Then, to establish interconnections among the ad-\njacent commands, we set the end point of j-th command\n(x1, y1)j\ni equal to the beginning point (x0, y0)j+1\ni\nof the\nsubsequent (j + 1)-th command in each individual path.\nRaw SVG Code\n<svg viewBox=\u201c0.0 0.0 200.0 200.0\u201d height=\u201c200px\u201d width=\u201c200px\u201d> <path\nfill=\u201cblack\u201d fill-opacity=\u201c1.0\u201d filling=\u201c0\u201d d=\u201cM4.0 54.0 L60.0 130.0 C54.0 92.0 \n25.0 28.0 97.0 93.0 \u2026 L4.0 104.0></path >\u2026 <path fill=\u201dblack\u201c fill-opacity=\n\u201d1.0\u201c filling=\u201d0\u201c d=\u201dM101.0 45.0 L99.0 49.0 \u2026\u201c></path></svg>\nSVG Matrix\nDiffVG & RULEs\nDown-Sample\nBlocks\nCompress\nNormalization\n\u2113!\"#$%&'() = \u2113*'++,%+)-% + \u2113*'/)0''( + \u21131)2'-3%&42%,'-\nStroke Codebook\nM Command\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n54\n1\n4\n54\n0\n0\n0\n0\n60 130\n2\n4\n54 92\n25 121 28 97\n93\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n1\n82 72 0\n0\n0\n0\n33\n90\nL Command\nC Command\nL Command\n\u2026\nConstruction \nProcess\nUp-Sample\nBlocks\nDe-Normalization\n\u2026\nCompressed Latent !\n\u2026\nDe-Compress\n\u2026\nStroke Tokens !\"\nLookup\nQuantize\nVQ-Stroke\nFigure 3. Overview of VQ-Stroke.\nWe then decompose all the paths within the SVG G into\ndistinct basic commands and combine their corresponding\nvectors into a matrix form:\nf(G) = (f(Pi))N\ni=1 =\n\u0012\u0010\nf(Cj\ni )\n\u0011Mi\nj=1\n\u0013N\ni=1\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n(K1\n1;\nK2\n1;\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\nKM1\n1\n)\n...\n...\n...\n...\n(K1\nN;\nK2\nN;\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\nKMN\nN\n)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 ,\n(2)\nwhere \u201c;\u201d denotes the stack operation, and each matrix row\nrepresents an individual command. Thus, we can obtain a\nstructured SVG matrix f(G) \u2208 R(PN\ni=1 Mi)\u00d79 to represent\nan SVG that contains PN\ni=1 Mi individual basic commands.\nMatrix to Stroke\nAfter obtaining the SVG matrix f(G),\nwe aim to compress the matrix into discrete stroke tokens\nvia latent representation, with which one can reconstruct\nthe f(G). As shown in Fig. 3, the VQ-Stroke model is\ncomposed of Down-Sample blocks, a Stroke Codebook B,\nand Up-Sample blocks. The SVG matrix f(G) is first en-\ncoded by the Down-Sample blocks to obtain the compressed\nrepresentations, which entails increasing the number of rep-\nresentation channels (column of f(G)) while concurrently\ncompressing the spatial dimensions (row of f(G)) to yield a\nmore compact representation, i.e. compressing the number\nof commands into T s.t. T < PN\ni=1 Mi. Then, the Code-\nbook B simultaneously conducts d levels of compression\nwith residual vector quantization (Martinez et al., 2014),\nenabling VQ-Stroke to better model the compressed rep-\n4\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\n4\u00d74 Conv1d, Stride=2\n2\u00d72 Conv1d, Stride=1\n\u211d(\"/$)\u00d7'\n3\u00d73 Conv1d, Stride=1\n3\u00d73 Conv1d, Stride=1\n\u211d(\"/$)\u00d7'\n\u211d(\"/$)\u00d7'\nInput: \u211d\"\u00d7'\n\u00d7\ud835\udc41\n4\u00d74 ConvTranspose1d, \nStride=2\n2\u00d72 Conv1d, Stride=1\n\u211d$\"\u00d7'\n3\u00d73 Conv1d, Stride=1\n3\u00d73 Conv1d, Stride=1\n\u211d$\"\u00d7'\n\u211d$\"\u00d7'\nInput: \u211d\"\u00d7'\n\u00d7\ud835\udc41\nDown-Sample Blocks\nUp-Sample Blocks\nResNet1d\nResNet1d\nFigure 4.

We depict the detailed architecture of Down-\nSample blocks and Up-Sample blocks in Fig 4, wherein both\nblocks first utilize a Conv1d or ConvTranspose1d model to\ncompress or expand the features, succeeded by a ResNet1d\nmodule and an additional Conv1d module for feature ex-\ntraction. It is worth mentioning that a low compression rate\nallows the VQ-Stroke to learn the fine details of SVGs (the\nfirst and second columns), while more aggressive compres-\nsion (the third column) enables the VQ-Stroke to capture\nthe overall contours of the SVGs, As illustrated in Fig.5,\na low compression rate allows the VQ-Stroke to learn the\nfine details of SVGs (the first and second columns), while\nmore aggressive compression (the third column) enables\nthe VQ-Stroke to capture the overall contours of the SVGs.\nWe have more discussion in Sec. 4.2. Finally, the Down-\nSample blocks reconstruct the SVG latent representation\noutput from the Codebook B.\nTo train such a network, we follow Dhariwal et al. to calcu-\nlate the commitment loss, codebook loss, and reconstruction\nloss to jointly update the VQ-Stroke in Equ. 3:\n\u2113V Q\u2212Stroke = \u03b1 (\u2113codebook + \u2113commit) + \u2113recon\n= \u03b1\n\u0010\n|| Z \u2212 sg[ \u02dcZ] ||2\n2 + || sg[Z] \u2212 \u02dcZ ||2\n2\n\u0011\n+ MSE(]\nf(G), f(G)),\n(3)\nwhere \u03b1 is the hyper-parameter, Z is the compressed latent\noutput from down-sample blocks, \u02dcZ is the latent looked\nup from codebook B, and sg[\u00b7] is the gradient clipping op-\neration. Besides, we pre-normalize the input data into the\n[\u22121, 1] range to stabilize the training process.\n3.2.2. ENCODER-DECODER-BASED LLM\nWe employ an Encoder-Decoder LLM (EDM) to predict\nthe stroke tokens obtained from the codebook B. Con-\nsidering LLM\u2019s inherent textual instruction capability, we\nfreeze the EDM encoder to leverage its inherited textual\nknowledge.

SVG FIXER\nA critical issue arises in the generation results from both\nSDM and EDM, as they fail to guarantee Equ. 1 due to the\ndiscrepancies of the interconnection points among adjacent\ncommands in each individual SVG path, i.e., (x1, y1)j\ni \u0338=\n(x0, y0)j+1\ni\nin i-th path. To address this issue, we intro-\nduce the SVG Fixer (SF) as a post-processing module for\nthe generated results. It encompasses two strategies: Path\nClipping (PC) and Path Interpolation (PI). Specifically, PC\ninvolves the direct substitution of each SVG command\u2019s be-\nginning point with the endpoint of adjacent SVG commands:\n(x0, y0)j+1\ni\n:= (x1, y1)j\ni. On the other hand, PI entails the\naddition of M commands between each pair of adjacent, yet\nnon-interconnected SVG commands to bridge the discrep-\nancy, i.e., if (x1, y1)j\ni \u0338= (x0, y0)j+1\ni\n=\u21d2 adding an extra\ncommand\n\u0010\nM, (x1, y1)j\ni, 0, 0, 0, 0, (x0, y0)j+1\ni\n\u0011\nto force the\nprevious command\u2019s end point to move to the beginning\npoint of the next adjacent command. As shown in Fig. 5,\nPC can streamline the overall paths of SVGs, making them\nmore succinct, but may lead to some inaccuracies in the\ndetails. On the other hand, PI tends to reveal more gener-\nated stokes\u2019 details, but it may introduce more curves. Each\nstrategy has its own applicable scenarios.\n5\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\n4. Experiment\n4.1. Experimental Settings\nDataset\nWe construct the training and evaluation data\nwith FIGR-8-SVG dataset (Clou\u02c6atre & Demers, 2019),\nwhich consists of massive monochromatic (black-and-white)\nSVG icons. We pre-process the SVG data by transform-\ning each SVG sample into standardized representations,\neliminating the redundant SVG paths, dropping the outer\nblack box, and filtering the data by applying a thresh-\nold of 1,024 basic commands in length. We filter the in-\nstance with less than two annotated discrete keywords and\napply a template \u201cGenerating SVG according to\nkeywords:{\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }\u201d to build the text prompt. After pre-\nprocessing, we sample 2,000 instances with varying SVG\ncode lengths as a testing set, 8,000 samples for validation,\nand apply the remaining 740K samples for training.\nEvaluation Metrics\nWe evaluate the quality of the gener-\nated SVG of VQ-Stroke and StrokeNUWA from various as-\npects. For VQ-Stroke, we primarily consider the reconstruc-\ntion quality and the compression effectiveness. We evaluate\nthe reconstruction quality with the Fr\u00b4echet Inception Dis-\ntance (FID)2 (Heusel et al., 2017) and the CLIPScore (Rad-\nford et al., 2021). Given that the generated SVG graph-\nics consist solely of lines, we set the background color to\nwhite to mitigate the potential biases for FID and CLIPScore\nbrought by the background (Wu et al., 2023a). Addition-\nally, we calculate the Edit Score (EDIT) between the recon-\nstructed SVG code and the Golden SVG code to reflect the\nfidelity of the reconstructed SVG graphics in replicating fine\ndetails. To reflect the practical compression effectiveness of\nVQ-Stroke, we calculate the Compression Ratio (CR) score\nbetween the tokenized SVG code and the stroke tokens, i.e.,\nCR = Len(tokenized SVG code)/Len(stroke tokens).\nFor StokeNUWA, apart from utilizing the metrics mentioned\nabove, we supplement evaluation with Human Preference\nScore (HPS) (Wu et al., 2023b) and Recall Score3 to re-\nflect the quality of the generated SVG graphics and their\ndegree of overlap with the Golden SVG Code. Additionally,\nwe also report the time required to generate each SVG and\nconduct the qualitative evaluation.\nTasks and Baselines\nWe evaluate VQ-Stroke and\nSVGNUWA with the SVG reconstruction and the text-\nguided SVG generation tasks, respectively. For VQ-Stroke,\nconsidering the absence of works in the field of SVG repre-\nsentation, we focus on comparing the performance of two\nSF methods, i.e., PI and PC. Additionally, we evaluate the re-\nconstruction performance of two different compression rates,\n2Specifically, we obtain the image features of rendered SVG\ngraphics with the CLIP image encoder (Radford et al., 2021)\n3We convert all SVGs into the stroke token format, subse-\nquently computing the recall rate.\nCR-2\nPI\nCR-2\nPC\nCR-4\nPI\nGT\nComplexity\nEasy\nHard\nMore SVG Paths\nLess SVG Paths\nFigure 6. Reconstruction cases generated by VQ-Stroke, diffi-\nculty (reflected by path numbers) increases from left to right.\ni.e., compression rates of 2 and 4. For SVGNUWA, we com-\npare with the optimization-based methods, including Vector\nFusion (Jain et al., 2023) and the Stable Diffusion (Rom-\nbach et al., 2022) combined with LIVE method (Li et al.,\n2020). Given that optimization-based methods are notably\ntime-intensive, i.e., requiring more than 20 minutes to gener-\nate a single SVG on one NVIDIA V100 GPU, we randomly\nsample 500 instances from the testing set for evaluation to\nensure a feasible timeframe. Additionally, we also compare\nwith the LLM-based method Iconshop (Wu et al., 2023a).\nWe re-implement Iconshop with the same Flan-T5 back-\nbone as in StrokeNUWA and use a T5 tokenizer to encode\nthe numerical values built in Iconshop. Notably, the pri-\nmary distinction between Iconshop and StrokeNUWA lies\nin their approaches to handling visual representation. While\nIconshop directly treats SVG code as visual tokens, Stro-\nkeNUWA converts SVG code into stroke visual tokens with\nVQ-Stroke. We set the maximum model length to 1,500 for\nIconShop to ensure the completeness of the SVG code.\nImplementation Details\nFor VQ-Stroke, we set the depth\nof the residual vector quantization d to 2, corresponding to\ncompression rates of 2 and 4. Then, we set the codebook\nsize | B | as 4096, with each code corresponding to a latent\nrepresentation of 512 dimensions. We set \u03b1 = 1 in Equ. 3\nduring the training process. For EDM, we utilize the 3B\nFlan-T5 model (Chung et al., 2022) as the backbone. We\nutilize DeepSpeed Library (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) to\nimplement models on 64 NVIDIA V100 GPUs and set the\nmaximum model length as 512.\n4.2.

Reconstruction performance of difference VQ-Strokes.\nStroke with SF, PI facilitates a more faithful approxima-\ntion of the original SVG graphics by achieving the lowest\nFID score and demonstrating a higher concordance with\nthe given text prompts, as evidenced by the lowest CLIP\nscore. In contrast, the PC method yields better alignment\nresults with the original SVG code as it achieves the lowest\nEDIT score. Utilizing compression level 2 (C-4), VQ-Stroke\nattains a notable Compression Ratio (CR) of 6.9%, main-\ntaining performance on par with that of C-2 as evidenced\nby comparable CLIPScore and FID. This suggests that VQ-\nStroke preserves the semantic integrity of the original SVG\ngraphics despite the substantial path compression.\nStrokeNUWA\nAs illustrated in Table 2, StrokeNUWA\noutperforms other methods by achieving superior results.\nSpecifically, in terms of visual performance, StrokeNUWA\nis capable of generating graphics that more closely re-\nsemble the Golden SVG\u2014evidenced by the lowest FID\nscore (6.513) and the highest HPS (16.801). This indicates\nthat our Stroke Tokens offer greater compatibility with the\nLLMs than the vanilla approach (Iconshop). Moreover,\nStrokeNUWA has attained the highest CLIPScore (17.994),\nsurpassing even Optimization-based methods. This suggests\nthat StrokeTokens encapsulates visual semantics effectively.\nIn terms of the quality of the SVG Code and the efficiency\nof generation, the Stroke Token not only aligns closely with\nElectrical Chip         Clock               Cloud            Family Car\nStable Diffusion (First Row) + LIVE (Second Row)\nIconshop\nStrokeNUWA\nRaster Image\nTime Cost:\n2 second\nCLIPScore:\n25.266\nSVG by LIVE\nTime Cost:\n28 minute\nCLIPScore:\n23.113\nIconshop\nTime Cost:\n63.743 second\nCLIPScore:\n21.834\nStrokeNUWA\nTime Cost:\n19.128 second\nCLIPScore:\n24.682\nMetrics\n(Per Sample)\n(a) Comparison between StrokeNUWA and other baselines.\nGPT-4-Turbo\nGPT-4-Turbo\nTime Cost:\n*\nCLIPScore:\n16.323\n(b) Cases generated by GPT-4-Turbo with same keywords.

Qualitative Evaluation\nCase Study\nWe show the reconstruction results of VQ-\nStroke with varying complexity levels in Fig. 7 and present\na qualitative comparison between StrokeNUWA and other\nbaselines in Fig. 8(a). It is impressive that VQ-Stroke can\n7\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\nPrompt \nAlignment\nOverall \nQuality\nGraphic\nDetails\nFigure 9. Human evaluation between StrokeNUWA and LLM-\nbased method\u2014Iconshop.\nreconstruct complex SVGs with a limit of only 4,096 code-\nbook size. Then, at the Compression Rate of 2 (CR-2),\nVQ-Stroke successfully outlines the edge of objects within\nthe graphics, demonstrating that stroke tokens can be highly\ncompressed with a dense representation and inherently in-\ncorporate semantic segmentation, which is essential for\nretaining visual semantics. Regarding the comparison of\nStrokeNUWA, we note that employing LLM-based gener-\nation methods can result in incomplete SVGs (Iconshop).\nThis is attributed to the excessive SVG code lengths and\nLLMs struggling to capture the key information embedded\nwithin SVG graphics. However, the use of stroke tokens\ncan mitigate these issues by compressing the paths and be-\ning compatible with LLMs. Furthermore, we find that the\nperformance of the optimization-based method heavily re-\nlies on the outputs generated by the stable diffusion model,\nwhich is subject to the limitations of grid tokens mentioned\nin Sec. 1, e.g., it is hard to capture the visual semantics and\ntends to generate extra visual information that is not aligned\nwith the text prompt. Besides, the optimization process is\nextremely slow. In contrast, StrokeNUWA, which utilizes\nstroke tokens, inherently contains visual semantic segmen-\ntation. As a result, the content generated is more aligned\nwith the textual semantics, providing a more coherent and\nsemantically accurate graphic.\nHuman Evaluation\nFurthermore, we conduct a human\nevaluation to compare the generated SVG outputs from Stro-\nkeNUWA with those produced by the LLM-based method,\nIconshop. We select 50 different textual prompts and guide\nthe model to generate corresponding SVGs for evaluation.\nAs depicted in Figure 9, our comparison is founded on three\ncriteria: Prompt Alignment (consistency between the gener-\nated result and the text prompt), Overall Quality (the gen-\neral caliber of SVGs), and Graphic Details (intricacies such\nas curves). We observe that StrokeNUWA, compared to\nIconshop, which regards code as visual representation, not\nonly yields more complete content (better Overall Quality)\nbut produces results more closely aligned with the textual\nprompts (better Prompt Alignment)4. Given that stroke\ntokens compress the details of SVG, it is natural that Stro-\nkeNUWA excels in generating Graphic Details.\n4The main reason for low Prompt Alignment in Iconshop is\nalso due to the incompleteness of the generated SVGs.\nSettings\nFID (\u2193)\nCLIPScore (\u2191)\nEDIT (\u2193)\n| B |\nDim\n2048\n512\n5.702\n19.365\n2,323.810\n4096\n512\n3.518\n20.290\n1,315.137\n4096\n1024\n3.901\n20.159\n1,793.008\n8192\n512\n2.639\n21.014\n907.106\nTable 4. Comparison among different VQ-Stroke Settings.\n5. Ablation Study\n5.1. Analysis of VQ-Stroke Model Architecture\nTo investigate the impact of VQ-Stroke architecture config-\nurations on the stroke token performance, we experiment\nwith different codebook sizes | B | and codebook dimension\nDim. As shown in Tab. 4, we can observe that by increas-\ning the codebook size while simultaneously reducing the\ndimension of each stroke token, the VQ-Stroke achieves\nsuperior performance across multiple metrics. We sample a\nset of reconstruction cases to showcase the trend of changes\nin Fig. 7, which indicates that, with a larger codebook size\nand smaller dimension, the VQ-Stroke can delineate details\nwith greater accuracy, e.g., straighter lines.\n5.2. Comparison with GPT-4\nWe compare the generation results with GPT-4 (Achiam\net al., 2023) by employing the following template to\nguide GPT-4 in producing the corresponding SVG code:\nGenerate SVG codes in icon style based\non keywords:{KEYWORDS}. We show the rendered\nSVGs in Fig. 8(b), where we can observe that GPT-4\ncan only generate simple SVGs, which is consistent with\nLLM-based methods. Moreover, GPT-4 often yields SVGs\nthat are incongruent with the associated text.\n6. Conclusion and Future Work\nThis paper presents StrokeNUWA, a pioneering study that\nexplores a superior visual representation\u2014\u201cstroke\u201d tokens,\nas an alternative method for expressing images through\nvector graphics. Stroke tokens not only preserve the se-\nmantic integrity of the images but are also conducive to\nprocessing by LLMs. Moreover, strokes in vector graph-\nics can be highly compressed. Experiments indicate that,\nequipped with stroke tokens, LLMs can achieve superior\nresults across various metrics in the SVG synthesis task.\nThis paper showcases the tremendous potential of stroke\ntoken representation in the field of vector graphic synthesis.\nMoving forward, we aim to continue improving the quality\nof stroke tokens through advanced visual tokenization meth-\nods tailored for LLMs. In addition, we intend to generalize\nstroke token utilization to a broader range of tasks (SVG\nUnderstanding), domains (3D), and the generation of SVGs\nfor images sourced from the real world.\n8\nStrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis (Preprint)\nImpact Statement\nThe implications of this work are manifold, potentially rev-\nolutionizing the visual synthesis from another format of\nimage, vector graphics. As stroke tokens refine the inter-\nplay between visual representation and LLMs, future ad-\nvancements in visual tokenization techniques designed for\nLLMs are anticipated. Moving forward, the community\ncan extend stroke token application into wider tasks and\ndomains, including SVG comprehension and open-domain\nSVG synthesis for images from the real world. As we pi-\noneer this nascent field, we are conscious of the profound\nsocietal impact that such advancements in machine learn-\ning and graphical representations hold. The capabilities for\nautomated graphic design, scalable vector graphics produc-\ntion, and enhanced digital artistry foreshadow considerable\nshifts in industries reliant on visual content. By forging\nnew pathways for artistic expression and visual communica-\ntion, our work stands to not only contribute to the scientific\ncommunity but also to catalyze transformations in creative,\ntechnological, and educational sectors. We recognize the\nimportance of our work and our responsibility to ensure\nthat our contributions to the field are conducted ethically,\naiming to benefit society as a whole, democratize the visual\nlandscape, and enrich it through responsible and judicious\ninnovation.\nReferences\nAchiam, J., Adler, S., Agarwal, S., Ahmad, L., Akkaya, I.,\nAleman, F.

We present AudioSeal, the first audio\nwatermarking technique designed specifically for\nlocalized detection of AI-generated speech. Au-\ndioSeal employs a generator / detector architec-\nture trained jointly with a localization loss to\nenable localized watermark detection up to the\nsample level, and a novel perceptual loss in-\nspired by auditory masking, that enables Au-\ndioSeal to achieve better imperceptibility. Au-\ndioSeal achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of robustness to real life audio manipu-\nlations and imperceptibility based on automatic\nand human evaluation metrics. Additionally, Au-\ndioSeal is designed with a fast, single-pass detec-\ntor, that significantly surpasses existing models\nin speed\u2014achieving detection up to two orders\nof magnitude faster, making it ideal for large-\nscale and real-time applications.\n1. Introduction\nGenerative speech models are now capable of synthesiz-\ning voices that are indistinguishable from real ones (Arik\net al., 2018; Kim et al., 2021; Casanova et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2023). Though speech generation and voice cloning\nare not novel concepts, their recent advancements in qual-\nity and accessibility have raised new security concerns.\nThese technologies now pose greater risks to individual\nand corporate safety by enabling sophisticated scams and\nspreading misinformation more effectively. A notable inci-\ndent occurred where a deepfake audio misleadingly urged\nUS voters to abstain, showcasing the potential for misus-\ning these technologies to spread false information (Murphy\net al., 2024). Consequently, regulators and governments are\nimplementing measures for AI content transparency and\n*Equal contribution\n1FAIR, Meta 2Inria 3Kyutai (work done\nwhile at FAIR).\nCorrespondence to: <robinsr, hadyelsahar, pfz@meta.com>.\nCode: github.com/facebookresearch/audioseal\nSpeech\nModel\nWatermark \nGenerator\nWatermarked\nAI-Generated\n\u2714\n\u2717\n\u2018AI generated?\u2019\nPublished\nSpeech \nediting\nWatermark \nDetector\nProactively watermarked speech generator\nFigure 1. Proactive detection of AI-generated speech. We em-\nbed an imperceptible watermark in the audio, which can be used\nto detect if a speech is AI-generated and identify the model that\ngenerated it. It can also precisely pinpoint AI-generated segments\nin a longer audio with a sample level resolution (1/16k seconds).\ntraceability, including forensics and watermarking \u2013 see\nChi (2023); Eur (2023); The White House (2023).\nThe main forensics approach to detect synthesized audio is\nto train binary classifiers to discriminate between natural\nand synthesized audios, a technique highlighted in stud-\nies by Borsos et al. (2022); Kharitonov et al. (2023); Le\net al. (2023). We refer to this technique as passive detec-\ntion since it does not alter of the audio source. Albeit being\na straightforward mitigation, it is prone to fail as gener-\native models advance and the difference between synthe-\nsized and authentic content diminishes.\nWatermarking emerges as a strong alternative. It embeds\na signal in the generated audio, imperceptible to the ear\nbut detectable by specific algorithms. There are two wa-\ntermarking types: multi-bit and zero-bit. Zero-bit water-\nmarking detects the presence or absence of a watermarking\nsignal, which is valuable for AI content detection. Multi-\nbit watermarking embeds a binary message in the con-\ntent, allowing to link content to a specific user or genera-\ntive model. Most deep-learning based audio watermarking\nmethods (Pavlovi\u00b4c et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2023) are multi-bit and train a generator taking a sample\nand a message to output the watermarked sample, and an\nextractor retrieving the hidden message from that sample.\nCurrent watermarking methods have limitations. First, they\nare not adapted for detection. The initial applications as-\nsumed any sound sample under scrutiny is watermarked\n(e.g. IP protection). As a result, the decoders were never\narXiv:2401.17264v1  [cs.SD]  30 Jan 2024\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\ntrained on non-watermarked samples. This discrepancy be-\ntween the training of the models and their practical use\nleads to poor or overestimated detection rates, depending\non the embedded message (see App. B). Our method aligns\nmore closely with the concurrent work by Juvela & Wang\n(2023), which trains a detector, rather than a decoder.\nSecond, they are not localized and consider the entire au-\ndio, making it difficult to identify small segments of AI-\ngenerated speech within longer audio clips. The concurrent\nWavMark\u2019s approach (Chen et al., 2023) addresses this by\nrepeating at 1-second intervals a synchronization pattern\nfollowed by the actual binary payload. This has several\ndrawbacks. It cannot be used on spans less than 1 second\nand is susceptible to temporal edits. The synchronization\nbits also reduce the capacity for the encoded message, ac-\ncounting for 31% of the total capacity. Most importantly,\nthe brute force detection algorithm for decoding the syn-\nchronization bits is prohibitively slow especially on non-\nwatermarked content, as we show in Sec. 5.5. This makes it\nunsuitable for real-time and large-scale traceability of AI-\ngenerated content on social media platforms, where most\ncontent is not watermarked.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce AudioSeal, a\nmethod for localized speech watermarking. It jointly trains\ntwo networks: a generator that predicts an additive water-\nmark waveform from an audio input, and a detector that\noutputs the probability of the presence of a watermark at\neach sample of the input audio. The detector is trained to\nprecisely and robustly detect synthesized speech embedded\nin longer audio clips by masking the watermark in random\nsections of the signal. The training objective is to maxi-\nmize the detector\u2019s accuracy while minimizing the percep-\ntual difference between the original and watermarked au-\ndio. We also extend AudioSeal to multi-bit watermarking,\nso that an audio can be attributed to a specific model or\nversion without affecting the detection signal.\nWe evaluate the performance of AudioSeal to detect and\nlocalize AI-generated speech. AudioSeal achieves state-\nof-the-art results on robustness of the detection, far sur-\npassing passive detection with near perfect detection rates\nover a wide range of audio edits. It also performs sample-\nlevel detection (at resolution of 1/16k second), outperform-\ning WavMark in both speed and performance. In terms\nof efficiency, our detector is run once and yields detection\nlogits at every time-step, allowing for real-time detection\nof watermarks in audio streams. This represents a major\nimprovement compared to earlier watermarking methods,\nwhich requires synchronizing the watermark within the de-\ntector, thereby substantially increasing computation time.\nFinally, in conjunction with binary messages, AudioSeal\nalmost perfectly attributes an audio to one model among\n1, 000, even in the presence of audio edits.\nOur overall contributions are:\n\u2022 We introduce AudioSeal, the first audio watermark-\ning technique designed for localized detection of AI-\ngenerated speech up to the sample-level;\n\u2022 A novel perceptual loss inspired by auditory masking,\nthat enables AudioSeal to achieve better imperceptibility\nof the watermark signal;\n\u2022 AudioSeal achieves the state-of-the-art robustness to a\nwide range of real life audio manipulations (section 5);\n\u2022 AudioSeal significantly outperforms the state of art audio\nwatermarking model in computation speed, achieving up\nto two orders of magnitude faster detection (section 5.5);\n\u2022 Insights on the security and integrity of audio watermark-\ning techniques when opensourcing (section 6).\n2. Related Work\nIn this section we give an overview of the detection and\nwatermarking methods for audio data. A complementary\ndescrition of prior works can be found in the Appendix A.\nSynthetic speech detection.\nDetection of synthetic\nspeech is traditionally done in the forensics community\nby building features and exploiting statistical differences\nbetween fake and real.\nThese features can be hand-\ncrafted (Sahidullah et al., 2015; Janicki, 2015; AlBadawy\net al., 2019; Borrelli et al., 2021) and/or learned (M\u00a8uller\net al., 2022; Barrington et al., 2023). The approach of most\naudio generation papers (Borsos et al., 2022; Kharitonov\net al., 2023; Borsos et al., 2023; Le et al., 2023) is to train\nend-to-end deep-learning classifiers on what their models\ngenerate, similarly as Zhang et al. (2017). Accuracy when\ncomparing synthetic to real is usually good, although not\nperforming well on out of distribution audios (compressed,\nnoised, slowed, etc.).\nImperceptible watermarking.\nUnlike forensics, water-\nmarking actively marks the content to identify it once in the\nwild. It is enjoying renewed interest in the context of gener-\native models, as it provides a means to track AI-generated\ncontent, be it for text (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023; Aaronson\n& Kirchner, 2023; Fernandez et al., 2023a), images (Yu\net al., 2021b; Fernandez et al., 2023b; Wen et al., 2023), or\naudio/speech (Chen et al., 2023; Juvela & Wang, 2023).\nTraditional methods for audio watermarking relied on em-\nbedding watermarks either in the time or frequency do-\nmains (Lie & Chang, 2006; Kalantari et al., 2009; Natgu-\nnanathan et al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2018; Su et al., 2018;\nLiu et al., 2019), usually including domain specific features\nto design the watermark and its corresponding decoding\nfunction. Deep-learning audio watermarking methods fo-\ncus on multi-bit watermarking and follow a generator/de-\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\ncoder framework (Tai & Mansour, 2019; Qu et al., 2023;\nPavlovi\u00b4c et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023).\nFew works have explored zero-bit watermarking (Wu et al.,\n2023; Juvela & Wang, 2023), which is better adapted for\ndetection of AI-generated content. Our rationale is that ro-\nbustness increases as the message payload is reduced to the\nbare minimum (Furon, 2007).\nIn this work we compare with the current state-of-the-art\non audio watermarking WavMark (Chen et al., 2023), that\nexhibits superior performance over previous works. It is\nbased on invertible networks that hide 32 bits across 1-\nsecond spans of the input audio. The detection is done by\nsliding along the audio with a time step of 0.05s, and de-\ncoding the message for each sliding window. If the 10 first\ndecoded bits match a synchronization pattern the rest of\nthe payload is saved (22 bits), and the window can directly\nslide 1s (instead of the 0.05). This brute force detection\nalgorithm is prohibitively slow especially when the water-\nmark is absent, since the algorithm will have to attempt and\nfail to decode a watermark for each sliding window in the\ninput audio (due to the absence of watermark).\n3. Method\nThe method jointly trains two models. The generator cre-\nates a watermark signal that is added to the input audio.\nThe detector outputs local detection logits. The training\noptimizes two concurrent classes of objectives: minimiz-\ning the perceptual distortion between original and water-\nmarked audios and maximizing the watermark detection.\nTo improve robustness to modifications of the signal and\nlocalization, we include a collection of train time augmen-\ntations. At inference time, the logits precisely localize wa-\ntermarked segments allowing for detection of AI-generated\ncontent. Optionally, short binary identifiers may be added\non top of the detection to attribute a watermarked audio to\na version of the model while keeping a single detector.\n3.1.

The watermarked audio is then\nsw = s + \u03b4.\n(ii) To enable sample-level localization, we adopt an\naugmentation strategy focused on watermark mask-\ning with silences and other original audios. This is\nachieved by randomly selecting k starting points and\naltering the next T/2k samples from sw in one of\n4 ways: revert to the original audio (i.e. sw(t) =\ns(t)) with probability 0.4; replacing with zeros (i.e.\nsw(t) = 0) with probability 0.2; or substituting with\na different audio signal from the same batch (i.e.\nsw(t) = s\u2032(t)) with probability 0.2, or not modifying\nthe sample at all with probability 0.2.\n(iii) The second class of augmentation ensures the robust-\nness against audio editing. One of the following sig-\nnal alterations is applied: bandpass filter, boost audio,\nduck audio, echo, highpass filter, lowpass filter, pink\nnoise, gaussian noise, slower, smooth, resample (full\ndetails in App. C.2). The parameters of those aug-\nmentations are fixed to aggressive values to enforce\nmaximal robustness and the probability of sampling a\ngiven augmentation is proportional to the inverse of\nits evaluation detection accuracy.\nWe implemented\nthese augmentations in a differentiable way when pos-\nsible, and otherwise (e.g. MP3 compression) with the\nstraight-through estimator (Yin et al., 2019) that al-\nlows the gradients to back-propagate to the generator.\n(iv) Detector D processes the original and the water-\nmarked signals, outputting for each a soft decision at\nevery time step, meaning D(s) \u2208 [0, 1]T .

The encoder includes convolutional blocks and an LSTM, while the decoder mirrors this structure with transposed\nconvolutions. The detector is made of an encoder and a transpose convolution, followed by a linear layer that calculates sample-wise\nlogits. Optionally, multiple linear layers can be used for calculating k-bit messages. More details in App. C.3.\nThe architectures of the models are based on En-\nCodec (D\u00b4efossez et al., 2022). They are presented in Fig-\nure 4 and detailed in the appendix C.3.\n3.2. Losses\nOur setup includes multiple perceptual losses, we balance\nthem during training time by scaling their gradients as\nin D\u00b4efossez et al. (2022). The complete list of used losses\nis detailed bellow.\nPerceptual losses\nenforce the watermark imperceptibil-\nity to the human ear. These include an \u21131 loss on the wa-\ntermark signal to decrease its intensity, the multi-scale Mel\nspectrogram loss of (Gritsenko et al., 2020), and discrim-\ninative losses based on adversarial networks that operate\non multi-scale short-term-Fourier-transform spectrograms.\nD\u00b4efossez et al. (2022) use this combination of losses for\ntraining the EnCodec model for audio compression.\nIn addition, we introduce a novel time-frequency loudness\nloss TF-Loudness, which operates entirely in the wave-\nform domain. This approach is based on \u201daudotiry mask-\ning\u201d, a psycho-acoustic property of the human auditory\nsystem already exploited in the early days of watermark-\ning (Kirovski & Attias, 2003): the human auditory sys-\ntem fails perceiving sounds occurring at the same time and\nat the same frequency range (Schnupp et al., 2011). TF-\nLoudness is calculated as follows: first, the input signal\ns is divided into B signals based on non overlapping fre-\nquency bands s0, . . . , sB\u22121.\nSubsequently, every signal\nis segmented using a window of size W, with an overlap\namount denoted by r. This procedure is applied to both\nthe original audio signal s and the embedded watermark \u03b4.\nAs a result, we obtain segments of the signal and water-\nmark in time-frequency dimensions, denoted as sw\nb and \u03b4w\nb\nrespectively. For every time-frequency window we com-\npute the loudness difference, where loudness is estimated\nusing ITU-R BS.1770-4 recommendations (telecommuni-\ncation Union, 2011) (see App. C.1 for details):\nlw\nb = Loudness(\u03b4w\nb ) \u2212 Loudness(sw\nb ).\n(1)\nThis measure quantifies the discrepancy in loudness be-\ntween the watermark and the original signal within a spe-\ncific time window w, and a particular frequency band b.\nThe final loss is a weighted sum of the loudness differences\nusing softmax function:\nLloud =\nX\nb,w\n(softmax(l)w\nb \u2217 lw\nb ) .\n(2)\nThe softmax prevents the model from targeting excessively\nlow loudness where the watermark is already inaudible.\nMasked sample-level detection loss.\nA localization loss\nensures that the detection of watermarked audio is done at\nthe level of individual samples. For each time step t, we\ncompute the binary cross entropy (BCE) between the de-\ntector\u2019s output D(s)t and the ground truth label (0 for non-\nwatermarked, 1 for watermarked). Overall, this reads:\nLloc = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt=1\nBCE(D(s\u2032)t, yt),\n(3)\nwhere s\u2032 might be s or sw, and where time step labels yt\nare set to 1 if they are watermarked, and 0 otherwise.\n3.3. Multi-bit watermarking\nWe extend the method to support multi-bit watermarking,\nwhich allows for attribution of audio to a specific model\nversion. At generation, we add a message processing layer\nin the middle of the generator. It takes the activation map in\nRh,t\u2032 and a binary message m \u2208 {0, 1}b and outputs a new\nactivation map to be added to the original one. We embed\nm into e = P\ni=0..b\u22121 E2i+mi \u2208 Rh, where E \u2208 R2k,h\nis a learnable embedding layer. e is then repeated t times\nalong the temporal axis to match the activation map size\n(t, h). At detection, we add b linear layers at the very end\nof the detector. Each of them outputs a soft value for each\nbit of the message at the sample-level. Therefore, the de-\ntector outputs a tensor of shape Rt,1+b (1 for the detection,\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\nb for the message). At training, we add a decoding loss\nLdec to the localization loss Lloc. This loss Ldec averages\nthe BCE between the original message and the detector\u2019s\noutputs over all parts where the watermark is present.\n3.4. Training details\nOur watermark generator and detector are trained on a\n4.5K hours subset from the VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021)\ndataset. It\u2019s important to emphasize that the sole purpose\nof our generator is to generate imperceptible watermarks\ngiven an input audio; without the capability to produce or\nmodify speech content. We use a sampling rate of 16 kHz\nand one-second samples, so T = 16000 in our training. A\nfull training requires 600k steps, with the Adam, a learning\nrate of 1e-4, and a batch size of 32. For the drop augmen-\ntation, we use k = 5 windows of 0.1 sec. h is set to 32, and\nthe number of additional bits b to 16 (note that h needs to\nbe higher than b, for example h = 8 is enough in the zero-\nbit case). The perceptual losses are balanced and weighted\nas follows: \u03bb\u21131 = 0.1, \u03bbmsspec = 2.0, \u03bbadv = 4.0,\n\u03bbloud = 10.0. The localization and watermarking losses\nare weighted by \u03bbloc = 10.0 and \u03bbdec = 1.0 respectively.\n3.5. Detection, localization and attribution\nAt inference, we may use the generator and detector for:\n\u2022 Detection: To determine if the audio is watermarked or\nnot. To achieve this, we use the average detector\u2019s output\nover the entire audio and flag it if the score exceeds a\nthreshold (default: 0.5).\n\u2022 Localization: To precisely identify where the watermark\nis present. We utilize the sample-wise detector\u2019s output\nand mark a time step as watermarked if the score sur-\npasses a threshold (default: 0.5).\n\u2022 Attribution: To identify the model version that produced\nthe audio, enabling differentiation between users or APIs\nwith a single detector. The detector\u2019s first output gives\nthe detection score and the remaining k outputs are used\nfor attribution. This is done by computing the average\nmessage over detected samples and returning the identi-\nfier with the smallest Hamming distance.\n4. Audio/Speech Quality\nWe first evaluate the quality of the watermarked audio\nusing: Scale Invariant Signal to Noise Ratio (SI-SNR):\nSI-SNR(s, sw) = 10 log10\n\u0000\u2225\u03b1s\u22252\n2/\u2225\u03b1s \u2212 sw\u22252\n2\n\u0001\n, where\n\u03b1 = \u27e8s, sw\u27e9/\u2225s\u22252\n2; as well as PESQ (Rix et al., 2001),\nViSQOL (Hines et al., 2012) and STOI (Taal et al., 2010)\nwhich are objective perceptual metrics measuring the qual-\nity of speech signals.\nTable 1 report these metrics. AudioSeal behaves differently\nTable 1. Audio quality metrics. Compared to traditional wa-\ntermarking methods that minimize the SNR like WavMark, Au-\ndioSeal achieves same or better perceptual quality.\nMethods\nSI-SNR\nPESQ\nSTOI\nViSQOL\nMUSHRA\nWavMark\n38.25\n4.302\n0.997\n4.730\n71.52 \u00b1 7.18\nAudioSeal\n26.00\n4.470\n0.997\n4.829\n77.07 \u00b1 6.35\nthan watermarking methods like WavMark (Chen et al.,\n2023) that try to minimize the SI-SNR. In practice, high\nSI-SNR is indeed not necessarily correlated with good per-\nceptual quality. AudioSeal is not optimized for SI-SNR but\nrather for perceptual quality of speech. This is better cap-\ntured by the other metrics (PESQ, STOI, ViSQOL), where\nAudioSeal consistently achieves better performance. Put\ndifferently, our goal is to hide as much watermark power\nas possible while keeping it perceptually indistinguishable\nfrom the original. Figure 3 also visualizes how the water-\nmark signal follows the shape of the speech waveform.\nThe metric used for our subjective evaluations is MUSHRA\ntest (Series, 2014). The complete details about our full pro-\ntocol can be found in the Appendix C.4. In this study our\nsamples got ratings very close to the ground truth samples\nthat obtained an average score of 80.49.\n5. Experiments and Evaluation\nThis section evaluates the detection performance of passive\nclassifiers, watermarking methods, and AudioSeal. using\nTrue Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) as\nkey metrics for watermark detection. TPR measures cor-\nrect identification of watermarked samples, while FPR in-\ndicates the rate of genuine audio clips falsely flagged. In\npractical scenarios, minimizing FPR is crucial. For exam-\nple, on a platform processing 1 billion samples daily, an\nFPR of 10\u22123 and a TPR of 0.5 means 1 million samples\nrequire manual review each day, yet only half of the water-\nmarked samples are detected.\n5.1. Comparison with passive classifier\nWe first compare detection results on samples generated\nwith Voicebox (Le et al., 2023). We compare to the pas-\nsive setup where a classifier is trained to discriminate be-\ntween Voicebox-generated and real audios. Following the\napproach in the Voicebox study, we evaluate 2,000 approx-\nimately 5-second samples from LibriSpeech, These sam-\nples have masked frames (90%, 50%, and 30% of the\nphonemes) pre-Voicebox generation. We evaluate on the\nsame tasks, i.e. distinguishing between original and gener-\nated, or between original and re-synthesized (created by ex-\ntracting the Mel spectrogram from original audio and then\nvocoding it with the HiFi-GAN vocoder).\nBoth active and passive setups achieve perfect classifi-\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\nTable 2.

The classification perfor-\nmance quickly decreases as the quality of the AI-generated\nsample increases (when the input is less masked). On the\nother hand, our proactive detection does not rely on model-\nspecific artifacts but on the watermark presence. This al-\nlows for perfect detection over all the audio clips.\n5.2. Comparison with watermarking\nWe evaluate the robustness of the detection a wide range\nof robustness and audio editing attacks: time modification\n(faster, resample), filtering (bandpass, highpass, lowpass),\naudio effects (echo, boost audio, duck audio), noise (pink\nnoise, random noise), and compression (MP3, AAC, En-\nCodec). These attacks cover a wide range of transforma-\ntions that are commonly used in audio editing software. For\nall edits except Encodec compression, evaluation with pa-\nrameters in the training range would be perfect. In order to\nshow generalization, we chose stronger parameter to the at-\ntacks than those used during training (details in App. C.2).\nDetection is done on 10k ten-seconds audios from our\nVoxPopuli validation set. For each edit, we first build a\nbalanced dataset made of the 10k watermarked/ 10k non-\nwatermarked edited audio clips. We quantify the perfor-\nmance by adjusting the threshold of the detection score, se-\nlecting the value that maximizes accuracy (we provide cor-\nresponding TPR and FPR at this threshold). The ROC AUC\n(Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Charac-\nteristics) gives a global measure of performance over all\nthreshold levels, and captures the TPR/FPR trade-off. To\nadapt data-hiding methods (e.g. WavMark) for proactive\ndetection, we embed a binary message (chosen randomly\nbeforehand) in the generated speech before release. The\ndetection score is then computed as the Hamming distance\nbetween the original message and the one extracted from\nthe scrutinized audio.\nWe observe in Tab. 3 that AudioSeal is overall more robust,\nwith an average AUC of 0.97 vs. 0.84 for WavMark. The\nperformance for lowpass and highpass filters indicates that\nAudioSeal embeds watermarks neither in the low nor in the\nhigh frequencies (WavMark focuses on high frequencies).\nGeneralization.\nWe evaluate how AudioSeal general-\nizes on various domains and languages. Specifically, we\ntranslate speech samples from a subset of the Expresso\ndataset (Nguyen et al., 2023) (studio-quality recordings),\nwith the SeamlessExpressive translation model (Seamless\nCommunication et al., 2023). We select four target lan-\nguages: Mandarin Chinese (CMN), French (FR), Italian\n(IT), and Spanish (SP). We also evaluate on non-speech\nAI-generated audios: music from MusicGen (Copet et al.,\n2023) and environmental sounds from AudioGen (Kreuk\net al., 2023).\nWe use medium-sized pretrained models\navailable in AudioCraft (Copet et al., 2023), with default\nsampling parameters. For MusicGen, we use unconditional\ngeneration, while for AudioGen, we use prompts from the\ntest set of AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019). Results are very\nsimilar to our in-domain test set and can be found in App. 5.\n5.3. Localization\nWe evaluate localization with the sample-level detection\naccuracy, i.e. the proportion of correctly labeled samples,\nand the Intersection over Union (IoU). The latter is defined\nas the intersection between the predicted and the ground\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\ntruth detection masks (1 when watermarked, 0 otherwise),\ndivided by their union. IoU is a more relevant evaluation of\nthe localization of short watermarks in a longer audio.\nThis evaluation is carried out on the same audio clips as for\ndetection. For each one of them, we watermark a randomly\nplaced segment of varying length. Localization with Wav-\nMark is a brute-force detection: a window of 1s slides over\nthe 10s of speech with the default shift value of 0.05s. The\nHammning distance between the 16 pattern bits is used as\nthe detection score. Whenever a window triggers a positive,\nwe label its 16k samples as watermarked in the detection\nmask in {0, 1}t.\nFigure 5 plots the sample-level accuracy and IoU for dif-\nferent proportions of watermarked speech in the audio clip.\nAudioSeal achieves an IoU of 0.99 when just one second of\nspeech is AI-manipulated, compared to WavMark\u2019s 0.35.\nMoreover, AudioSeal allows for precise detection of minor\naudio alterations: it can pinpoint AI-generated segments in\naudio down to the sample level (usually 1/16k sec), while\nthe concurrent WavMark only provides one-second resolu-\ntion and therefore lags behind in terms of IoU. This is es-\npecially relevant for speech samples, where a simple word\nmodification may greatly change meaning.\n5.4. Attribution\nGiven an audio clip, the objective is now to find if any of\nN versions of our model generated it (detection), and if\nso, which one (identification). For evaluation, we create\nN \u2032 = 100 random 16-bits messages and use them to water-\nmark 1k audio clips, each consisting of 5 seconds of speech\n(not 10s to reduce compute needs). This results in a total\nof 100k audios. For WavMark, the first 16 bits (/32) are\nfixed and the detection score is the number of well decoded\npattern bits, while the second half of the payload hides the\nmodel version. An audio clip is flagged if the average out-\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nSample-level Acc.\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nIoU\nOurs\nWavmark\nx seconds of watermarked signal in a 10 seconds audio\nFigure 5.

Next, we calculate the Hamming distance be-\ntween the decoded watermark and all N original messages.\nThe message with the smallest Hamming distance is se-\nlected. It\u2019s worth noting that we can simulate N > N \u2032\nmodels by adding extra messages. This may represent ver-\nsions that have not generated any sample.\nFalse Attribution Rate (FAR) is the fraction of wrong attri-\nbution among the detected audios while the attribution ac-\ncuracy is the proportion of detections followed by a correct\nattributions over all audios. AudioSeal has a higher FAR\nbut overall gives a better accuracy, which is what ultimately\nmatters. In summary, decoupling detection and attribution\nachieves better detection rate and makes the global accu-\nracy better, at the cost of occasional false attributions.\n5.5. Efficiency Analysis\nTo highlight the efficiency of AudioSeal, we conduct a\nperformance analysis and compare it with WavMark. We\napply the watermark generator and detector of both mod-\nels on a dataset of 500 audio segments ranging in length\nfrom 1 to 10 seconds, using a single Nvidia Quadro GP100\nGPU. The results are displayed in Fig. 6 and Tab. 6. In\nterms of generation, AudioSeal is 14x faster than Wav-\nMark.\nFor detection, AudioSeal outperforms WavMark\nwith two orders of magnitude faster performance on av-\nerage, notably 485x faster in scenarios where there is no\nwatermark (Tab. 6). This remarkable speed increase is due\nto our model\u2019s unique localized watermark design, which\nbypasses the need for watermark synchronization (recall\nthat WavMark relies on 200 pass forwards for a one-second\nsnippet). AudioSeal\u2019s detector provides detection logits for\neach input sample directly with only one pass to the detec-\ntor, significantly enhancing the detection\u2019s computational\nefficiency. This makes our system highly suitable for real-\ntime and large-scale applications.\n6. Adversarial Watermark Removal\nWe now examine more damaging deliberate attacks, where\nattackers might either \u201cforge\u201d the watermark by adding\nit to authentic samples (to overwhelm detection systems)\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\nWM Generation\nWM Detection\n10\n3\n10\n2\n10\n1\n100\nDuration per segment (sec, Log Scale)\nAudioSeal (ours)\nWavmark\nFigure 6.

See Appendix D for full comparison.\nor \u201cremove\u201d it to avoid detection. Our findings suggest\nthat in order to maintain the effectiveness of watermark-\ning against such adversaries, the code for training water-\nmarking models and the awareness that published audios\nare watermarked can be made public. However, the detec-\ntor\u2019s weights should be kept confidential.\nWe focus on watermark-removal attacks and consider three\ntypes of attacks depending on the adversary\u2019s knowledge:\n\u2022 White-box: the adversary has access to the detector (e.g.\nbecause of a leak), and performs a gradient-based adver-\nsarial attack against it. The optimization objective is to\nminimize the detector\u2019s output.\n\u2022 Semi black-box: the adversary does not have access to\nany weights, but is able to re-train generator/detector\npairs with the same architectures on the same dataset.\nThey perform the same gradient-based attack as before,\nbut using the new detector as proxy for the original one.\n\u2022 Black-box: the adversary does not have any knowledge\non the watermarking algorithm being used, but has ac-\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\nPESQ (\n stronger attacks)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nDetection Error Rate\nWhite-box\nSemi black-box\nBlack-box\nGaussian noise\nFigure 7.

The more knowledge the attacker has\nover the watermarking algorithm, the better the attack is.\ncess to an API that produces watermarked samples, and\nto negative speech samples from any public dataset. They\nfirst collect samples and train a classifier to discriminate\nbetween watermarked and not-watermarked. They attack\nthis classifier as if it were the true detector.\nFor every scenario, we watermark 1k samples of 5 sec-\nonds, then attack them. The gradient-based attack opti-\nmizes an adversarial noise added to the audio, with 100\nsteps of Adam. During the optimization, we control the\nnorm of the noise to trade-off attack strength and audio\nquality. When training the classifier for the black-box at-\ntack, we use 80k/80k watermarked/genuine samples of 8\nseconds and make sure the classifier has 100% detection\naccuracy on the validation set. More details in App. C.6.\nFigure 7 contrasts various attacks at different intensities,\nusing Gaussian noise as a reference. The white-box attack\nis by far the most effective one, increasing the detection er-\nror by around 80%, while maintaining high audio quality\n(PESQ > 4). Other attacks are less effective, requiring sig-\nnificant audio quality degradation to achieve 50% increase\nthe detection error, though they are still more effective than\nrandom noise addition. In summary, the more is disclosed\nabout the watermarking algorithm, the more vulnerable it\nis. The effectiveness of these attacks is limited as long as\nthe detector remains confidential.\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced AudioSeal, a proactive method\nfor the detection, localization, and attribution of AI-\ngenerated speech. AudioSeal revamps the design of audio\nwatermarking to be specific to localized detection rather\nthan data hiding. It is based on a generator/detector ar-\nchitecture that can generate and extract watermarks at the\naudio sample level. This removes the dependency on slow\nbrute force algorithms, traditionally used to encode and de-\ncode audio watermarks. The networks are jointly trained\nthrough a novel loudness loss, differentiable augmentations\nand masked sample level detection losses. As a result, Au-\ndioSeal achieves state-of-the-art robustness to various au-\ndio editing techniques, very high precision in localization,\nand orders of magnitude faster runtime than methods re-\nlying on synchronization. Through an empirical analysis\nof possible adversarial attacks, we conclude that for water-\nmarking to still be an effective mitigation, the detector\u2019s\nweights have to be kept private \u2013 otherwise adversarial\nattacks might be easily forged. A key advantage of Au-\ndioSeal is its practical applicability. It stands as a ready-to-\ndeploy solution for watermarking in voice synthesis APIs.\nThis is pivotal for large-scale content provenance on so-\ncial media and for detecting and eliminating incidents, en-\nabling swift action on instances like the US voters\u2019 deep-\nfake case (Murphy et al., 2024) long before they spread.\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\nEthical Statement.\nThis research aims to improve trans-\nparency and traceability in AI-generated content, but wa-\ntermarking in general can have a set of potential misuses\nsuch as government surveillance of dissidents or corporate\nidentification of whistle blowers. Additionally, the water-\nmarking technology might be misused to enforce copy-\nright on user-generated content, and its ability to detect\nAI-generated audio could increase skepticism about digital\ncommunication authenticity, potentially undermining trust\nin digital media and AI. However, despite these risks, en-\nsuring the detectability of AI-generated content is impor-\ntant, along with advocating for robust security measures\nand legal frameworks to govern the technology\u2019s use.\nReferences\nChinese\nai\ngovernance\nrules,\n2023.\nURL\nhttp://www.cac.gov.cn/2023-07/13/\nc_1690898327029107.htm.

Extended related work\nZero-shot TTS and vocal style preservation.\nThere has\nbeen an emergence of models that imitate or preserve vocal\nstyle using only a small amount of data. One key exam-\nple is zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models. These mod-\nels create speech in vocal styles they haven\u2019t been specifi-\ncally trained on. For instance, models like VALL-E (Wang\net al., 2023), YourTTS (Casanova et al., 2022), Natural-\nSpeech2 (Shen et al., 2023) synthesize high-quality per-\nsonalized speech with only a 3-second recording. On top,\nzero-shot TTS models like Voicebox\n(Le et al., 2023),\nA3T (Bai et al., 2022) and Audiobox (Hsu et al., 2023),\nwith their non-autoregressive inference, perform tasks such\nas text-guided speech infilling, where the goal is to generate\nmasked speech given its surrounding audio and text tran-\nscript. It makes them a powerful tool for speech manipula-\ntion. In the context of speech machine translation, Seam-\nlessExpressive (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) is\na model that not only translates speech, but also retains\nthe speaker\u2019s unique vocal style and emotional inflections,\nthereby broadening the capabilities of such systems.\nAudio generation and compression.\nEarly models are\nautoregressive like WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016),\nwith dilated convolutions and waveform reconstruction as\nobjective.\nSubsequent approaches explore different au-\ndio losses, such as scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio (SI-\nSNR) (Luo & Mesgarani, 2019) or Mel spectrogram dis-\ntance (Defossez et al., 2020).\nNone of these objectives\nare deemed ideal for audio quality, leading to the adop-\ntion of adversarial models in HiFi-GAN (Kong et al., 2020)\nor MelGAN (Kumar et al., 2019). Our training objectives\nand architectures are inspired by more recent neural audio\ncompression models (D\u00b4efossez et al., 2022; Kumar et al.,\n2023; Zeghidour et al., 2022), that focus on high-quality\nwaveform generation and integrate a combination of these\ndiverse objectives in their training processes.\nSynchronization and Detection speed.\nTo accurately\nextract watermarks, synchronization between the encoder\nand decoder is crucial. However, this can be disrupted by\ndesynchronization attacks such as time and pitch scaling.\nTo address this issue, various techniques have been devel-\noped. One approach is block repetition, which repeats the\nwatermark signal along both the time and frequency do-\nmains (Kirovski & Malvar, 2003; Kirovski & Attias, 2003).\nAnother method involves implanting synchronization bits\ninto the watermarked signal (Xiang et al., 2014). During\ndecoding, these synchronization bits serve to improve syn-\nchronization and mitigate the effects of de-synchronization\nattacks. Detection of those synchronization bits for wa-\ntermark detection usually involves exhaustive search using\nbrute force algorithms, which significantly slows down de-\ncoding time.\nB. False Positive Rates - Theory and Practice\nTheoretical FPR.\nWhen doing multi-bit watermarking,\nprevious works (Yu et al., 2021a; Kim et al., 2023; Fer-\nnandez et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023) usually extract the\nmessage m\u2032 from the content x and compare it to the orig-\ninal binary signature m \u2208 {0, 1}k embedded in the speech\nsample. The detection test relies on the number of match-\ning bits M(m, m\u2032):\nif M (m, m\u2032) \u2265 \u03c4 where \u03c4 \u2208 {0, . . . , k},\n(4)\nthen the audio is flagged. This provides theoretical guaran-\ntees over the false positive rates.\nFormally, the statistical hypotheses are H1: \u201cThe audio sig-\nnal x is watermarked\u201d, and the null hypothesis H0: \u201cThe\naudio signal x is genuine\u201d. Under H0 (i.e., for unmarked\naudio), if the bits m\u2032\n1, . . . , m\u2032\nk are independent and iden-\ntically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables with\nparameter 0.5, then M(m, m\u2032) follows a binomial distri-\nbution with parameters (k, 0.5). The False Positive Rate\n(FPR) is defined as the probability that M(m, m\u2032) ex-\nceeds a given threshold \u03c4. A closed-form expression can\nbe given using the regularized incomplete beta function\nIx(a; b) (linked to the CDF of the binomial distribution):\nFPR(\u03c4) = P (M > \u03c4|H0) = I1/2(\u03c4 + 1, k \u2212 \u03c4).\n(5)\nEmpirical study.\nWe empirically study the FPR of\nWavMark-based detection on our validation dataset. We\nuse the same parameters as in the original paper, i.e. k =\n32-bits are extracted from 1s speech samples. We first ex-\ntract the soft bits (before thresholding) from 10k genuine\nsamples and plot the histogram of the scores in Fig. 8 (left).\nWe should observe a Gaussian distribution with mean 0.5,\nwhile empirically the scores are centered around 0.38. This\nmakes the decision heavily biased towards bit 0 on genuine\nsamples. It is therefore impossible to theoretically set the\nFPR since this would largely underestimate the actual one.\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nOutput score\n0\n1\n2\n3\nDensity\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nThreshold on bit accuracy\n10\n9\n10\n7\n10\n5\n10\n3\n10\n1\nFalse positive rate\nEmpirical\nTheoretical\nFigure 8.

(Right) Empirical and theoretical\nFPR when the chosen hidden message is all 0.\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\nFor instance, Figure 8 (right) shows the theoretical and em-\npirical FPR for different values of \u03c4 when the chosen hid-\nden message is full 0. Put differently, the argument that\nsays that hiding bits allows for theoretical guarantees over\nthe detection rates is not valid in practice.\nC. Experimental details\nC.1. Loudness\nOur loudness function is based on a simplification of the\nimplementation in the torchaudio (Yang et al., 2021) li-\nbrary. It is computed through a multi-step process. Initially,\nthe audio signal undergoes K-weighting, which is a filter-\ning process that emphasizes certain frequencies to mimic\nthe human ear\u2019s response. This is achieved by applying a\ntreble filter and a high-pass filter. Following this, the energy\nof the audio signal is calculated for each block of the signal.\nThis is done by squaring the signal and averaging over each\nblock. The energy is then weighted according to the num-\nber of channels in the audio signal, with different weights\napplied to different channels to account for their varying\ncontributions to perceived loudness. Finally, the loudness\nis computed by taking the logarithm of the weighted sum\nof energies and adding a constant offset.\nC.2. Robustness Augmentations\nHere are the details of the audio editing augmentations used\nat train time (T), and evaluation time (E):\n\u2022 Bandpass Filter: Combines high-pass and low-pass fil-\ntering to allow a specific frequency band to pass through.\n(T) fixed between 300Hz and 8000Hz; (E) fixed between\n500Hz and 5000Hz.\n\u2022 Highpass Filter: Uses a high-pass filter on the input au-\ndio to cut frequencies below a certain threshold. (T) fixed\nat 500Hz; (E) fixed at 1500Hz.\n\u2022 Lowpass Filter: Applies a low-pass filter to the input\naudio, cutting frequencies above a cutoff frequency. (T)\nfixed at 5000Hz; (E) fixed at 500Hz.\n\u2022 Speed: Changes the speed of the audio by a factor close\nto 1. (T) random between 0.9 and 1.1; (E) fixed at 1.25.\n\u2022 Resample: Upsamples to intermediate sample rate and\nthen downsamples the audio back to its original rate with-\nout changing its shape. (T) and (E) 32kHz.\n\u2022 Boost Audio: Amplifies the audio by multiplying by a\nfactor. (T) factor fixed at 1.2; (E) fixed at 10.\n\u2022 Duck Audio: Reduces the volume of the audio by a mul-\ntiplying factor. (T) factor fixed at 0.8; (E) fixed at 0.1.\n\u2022 Echo: Applies an echo effect to the audio, adding a delay\nand less loud copy of the original. (T) random delay be-\ntween 0.1 and 0.5 seconds, random volume between 0.1\nand 0.5; (E) fixed delay of 0.5 seconds, fixed volume of\n0.5.\n\u2022 Pink Noise: Adds pink noise for a background noise ef-\nfect. (T) standard deviation fixed at 0.01; (E) fixed at 0.1.\n\u2022 White Noise: Adds gaussian noise to the waveform. (T)\nstandard deviation fixed at 0.001; (E) fixed at 0.05.\n\u2022 Smooth: Smooths the audio signal using a moving aver-\nage filter with a variable window size. (T) window size\nrandom between 2 and 10; (E) fixed at 40.\n\u2022 AAC: Encodes the audio in AAC format. (T) bitrate of\n128kbps; (E) bitrate of 64kbps.\n\u2022 MP3: Encodes the audio in MP3 format. (T) bitrate of\n128kbps; (E) bitrate of 32kbps.\n\u2022 EnCodec: Resamples at 24kHz, encodes the audio with\nEnCodec with nq = 16 (16 streams of tokens), and re-\nsamples it back to 16kHz.\nImplementation of the augmentations is done with the\njulius python library when possible.\nWe plot in the figure 9 for multiple augmentations the de-\ntection accuracy with respect to the strength of the mod-\nification.\nAs can be seen for most augmentations our\nmethod outperforms Wavmark for every parameters. We\nremark that for Highpass filters well above our training\nrange (500Hz) Wavmark has a much better detection ac-\ncuracy.\nC.3. Networks architectures (Fig. 4)\nThe watermark generator is composed of an encoder\nand a decoder, both incorporating elements from En-\nCodec (D\u00b4efossez et al., 2022). The encoder applies a 1D\nconvolution with 32 channels and a kernel size of 7, fol-\nlowed by four convolutional blocks. Each of these blocks\nincludes a residual unit and down-sampling layer, which\nuses convolution with stride S and kernel size K = 2S.\nThe residual unit has two kernel-3 convolutions with a skip-\nconnection, doubling channels during down-sampling. The\nencoder concludes with a two-layer LSTM and a final\n1D convolution with a kernel size of 7 and 128 channels.\nStrides S values are (2, 4, 5, 8) and the nonlinear activation\nin residual units is the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU). The\ndecoder mirrors the encoder but uses transposed convolu-\ntions instead, with strides in reverse order.\nThe detector comprises an encoder, a transposed convolu-\ntion and a linear layer. The encoder shares the generator\u2019s\narchitecture (but with different weights). The transposed\nconvolution has h output channels and upsamples the acti-\nvation map to the original audio resolution (resulting in an\nactivation map of shape (t, h)). The linear layer reduces\nthe h dimensions to two, followed by a softmax function\nthat gives sample-wise probability scores.\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\n10\n3\n10\n2\n10\n1\n100\nStandard deviation\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nGaussian Noise\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nCutoff Frequency (Hz)\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nLowpass Filter\n1000\n2000\n3000 4000\nCutoff Frequency (Hz)\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nHighpass Filter\n1.5\n3.0\n6.0\n12.0\n24.0\nBitrate (kbps)\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nEncodec Compression\n12\n24 32\n64\n128\n256\nBitrate (kbps)\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nMp3 Compression\nAudioSeal\nWavMark\n10\n2\n10\n1\n100\nStandard deviation\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nPink Noise\nAudioSeal\nWavMark\nFigure 9.

MUSHRA protocole detail\nThe Mushra protocole consist in a crowd sourced test\nwhere participants have to rate out of 100 the quality of\nsome samples. The ground truth is given. We used 100\nspeech samples of 10 sec each. Every sample is evaluated\nby at least 20 participants. We included in the study a low\nanchor very lossy compression at 1.5kbps (using Encodec).\nParticipant that do not manage to rate the lowest score to\nthe low anchor for at least 80% of their assignments are\nremoved from the study. As a comparison Ground truth\nsamples obtained 80.49 and low anchor\u2019s 53.21.\nC.5. Out of domain (ood) evaluations\nAs described in previously to ensure that our model would\nwork well on any type of voice cloning method we tested it\non outputs of several voice cloning models and other audio\nmodalities. On the 10k samples that composed each of our\nood datasets, no sample was misclassified by our proactive\ndetection method. On top of that we performed the same\nset of augmentations and observed very similar numbers.\nWe show the results in table 5. Even if we did not train on\nAI generated speech we observe a increase in performance\ncompared to our test data wh\nC.6. Attacks on the watermark\nAdversarial attack against the detector.\nGiven a sam-\nple x and a detector D, we want to find x\u2032 \u223c x such\nthat D(x\u2032) = 1 \u2212 D(x). To that end, we use a gradient-\nbased attack. It starts by initializing a distortion \u03b4adv with\nrandom gaussian noise. The algorithm iteratively updates\nthe distortion for a number of steps n.\nFor each step,\nthe distortion is added to the original audio via x = x +\n\u03b1.tanh(\u03b4adv), passed through the model to get predictions.\nA cross-entropy loss is computed with label either 0 (for\nremoval) or 1 (for forging), and back-propagated through\nthe detector to update the distortion, using the Adam opti-\nmizer. At the end of the process, the adversarial audio is\nx + +\u03b1.tanh(\u03b4adv). In our attack, we use a scaling fac-\ntor \u03b1 = 10\u22123, a number of steps n = 100, and a learning\nrate of 10\u22121. The tanh function is used to ensure that the\ndistortion remains small, and gives an upper bound on the\nSNR of the adversarial audio.\nTraining of the malicious detector.\nHere, we are inter-\nested in training a classifier that can distinguish between\nwatermarked and non-watermarked samples, when access\nto many samples of both types is available. To train the\nclassifier, we use a dataset made of more than 80k samples\nof 8 seconds speech from Voicebox (Le et al., 2023) water-\nmarked using our proposed method and a similar amount\nof genuine (un-watermarked) speech samples. The classi-\nfier shares the same architecture as AudioSeal\u2019s detector.\nThe classifier is trained for 200k updates with batches of\n64 one-second samples. It achieves perfect classification\nof the samples. This is coherent with the findings of Voice-\nbox (Le et al., 2023).\nProactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking\nTable 5.

However, ex-\nisting jailbreaking methods are computationally\ncostly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-\nstrong jailbreaking attack, an efficient method\nto attack aligned LLMs to produce harmful text.\nOur key intuition is based on the observation\nthat jailbroken and aligned models only differ\nin their initial decoding distributions. The weak-\nto-strong attack\u2019s key technical insight is using\ntwo smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one)\nto adversarially modify a significantly larger safe\nmodel\u2019s decoding probabilities. We evaluate the\nweak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse LLMs from\n3 organizations. The results show our method\ncan increase the misalignment rate to over 99%\non two datasets with just one forward pass per\nexample. Our study exposes an urgent safety\nissue that needs to be addressed when align-\ning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose\na defense strategy to protect against such at-\ntacks, but creating more advanced defenses re-\nmains challenging.\nThe code for replicating\nthe method is available at https://github.\ncom/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong.\n1. Introduction\nRecent large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT\n(Schulman et al., 2022), Claude (Bai et al., 2022), and Llama\n(Touvron et al., 2023) already enable a wide range of appli-\ncations. However, LLMs have also raised significant con-\ncerns regarding security and trustworthiness (Wang et al.,\n2023). If deployed without proper safeguards, LLMs can\nresult in harm like propagating disinformation or abetting\n*Equal contribution\n1University of California, Santa Barbara\n2Sea AI Lab, Singapore 3Carnegie Mellon University.

Previous jailbreaking strategies assume\nthe adversary could modify input strings, system prompts, model\nweights (via finetuning), or decoding parameters. We also provide\nthe minimum number of forward and backward model passes\nneeded to jailbreak successfully for each strategy. In summary, our\nweak-to-strong jailbreak does not rely on any assumptions about\nthe adversary\u2019s capabilities. Furthermore, it only requires a single\nforward pass for successful jailbreaking.\nAdversary\u2019s\nJailbreaking Strategy\nCapability\nLLM Prompt Finetune Decode Ours\nInput strings\n\u2713\n\u2713\n-\n-\n-\nSystem prompts\n-\n-\n-\n\u2713\n-\nModel weights\n-\n-\n\u2713\n-\n-\nDecoding para.\n-\n-\n-\n\u2713\n-\n# of forward\n\u223c 101 \u223c 103\n1\n\u223c 101\n1\n# of backward\n0\n\u223c 102\n\u223c 102\n0\n0\ncriminal activities (Bommasani et al., 2021; Kreps et al.,\n2022; Goldstein et al., 2023; Hazell, 2023). To reduce risks,\nmodel creators implement safety measures and extensively\nalign models to ensure helpfulness in each release. Com-\nmon safety measures include employing human (Ouyang\net al., 2022) and AI feedback (Bai et al., 2022) to distinguish\nunsafe outputs, and optimizing models via reinforcement\nlearning (Schulman et al., 2017) to increase safety. For in-\nstance, Llama2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023) was developed\nto incorporate human feedback through reinforcement learn-\ning, safety training, and red teaming to balance safety with\nfunctionality.\nUnfortunately, even the most carefully designed alignment\nmechanisms and safety guardrails may fail to fully prevent\nmalicious misuse. Prior work (Wei et al., 2023a) has shown\nthat seemingly helpful models can be jailbroken through tar-\ngeted manipulation via laborious human-written prompts. In\ncontrast, our work is in line with automated attacks. These\njailbreaking attacks typically exploit vulnerabilities at four\nkey points: utilizing another LLM to generate adversarial\nprompts (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023), adversarial\nprompt search by backpropagation to trigger unsafe outputs\n(Zou et al., 2023), adversarial fine-tuning to alter core model\nbehaviors permanently (Yang et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023),\n1\narXiv:2401.17256v2  [cs.CL]  5 Feb 2024\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nand adversarial decoding to steer text generation down dan-\ngerous paths (Zhang et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023). We\nsummarize their strengths and weaknesses in Table 1.\nHowever, performing existing attacks on much larger mod-\nels (e.g., 70B) remains challenging due to the extreme com-\nputational cost. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth\nanalysis examining why safe-aligned LLMs can remain\nfragile when faced with adversarial attack schemes. We\ncompare the token distributions of safe LLMs to their jail-\nbroken variants, revealing that most of the distribution shift\noccurs in the initial tokens generated rather than later on.\nWe observe that the top-ranked tokens in jailbroken LLMs\nare largely found within the top ten tokens ranked by safe\nLLMs. Building on this, we demonstrate a new attack vec-\ntor by reframing adversarial decoding itself as an effective\njailbreaking method. We show that strong, safe LLMs (e.g.,\n70B) can be easily misdirected by weak, unsafe models to\nproduce undesired outputs with targeted guidance, which\nwe term Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking. This approach re-\nquires neither substantial computing resources nor complex\nprompt engineering. We provide an example of weak-to-\nstrong jailbreaking in Figure 2.\nThe effectiveness of weak-to-strong jailbreaking highlights\nthe risks posed by small harmful models in the hands of\nadversaries. Specifically, an adversary can easily use this\nsmall model to steer the behavior of a large model using log\nprobability algebra (e.g., Safe-70B + (Unsafe-7B - Safe-7B)).\nThe intuition is that the logp algebra transfers the harmful\nknowledge from the small model to the large one. Attackers\ncan directly generate harmful responses from a large model\nby decoding two small models simultaneously, which mod-\nifies the large model\u2019s decoding steps for harmful queries.\nThis approach is computationally efficient because it elim-\ninates the need to search for optimal decoding parameters\nor to require extensive computation to optimize prompts.\nMoreover, it can generate more harmful content than the\nsmall attack model alone does.\nTo evaluate the vulnerability of weak-to-strong jailbreaking\nattacks, we conduct experiments across 5 LLMs from 3\norganizations. Our results reveal the potency and simplicity\nof such attacks against existing safety measures. Weak-to-\nstrong jailbreaking attacks can increase the misalignment\nrate to > 99% on AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) and Mali-\nciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2023) datasets. Furthermore,\nthe attacked outputs from strong models are significantly\nmore harmful than those from weak models, indicating am-\nplified risks. The dramatic failure of alignment motivates\nus to design an effective model alignment approach. Specif-\nically, we propose the gradient ascent defense on harmful\ngenerations, which could reduce the attack success rate by\n20%.\nAltogether, weak-to-strong jailbreaking reveals significant\nflaws in safety measures for open-source LLMs.\nWe\nstrongly encourage community efforts to improve the align-\nment of open-source LLMs and mitigate their potential for\nmisuse.\nOur contributions can be summarized in threefolds:\n\u2022 We identify a statistical difference between safe and un-\nsafe LLMs\u2019 generation.\n\u2022 We propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, which\nuses small models to guide a strong LLM to generate\nharmful information. This method is efficient in compu-\ntation as it only requires one forward pass in the target\nmodel.\n\u2022 Our experiments on five LLMs show that the weak-to-\nstrong attack outperforms the best prior method, achieving\nover 99% attack success rates on two datasets.\n2. Related Work\nJailbreaking Aligned LLMs.\nMotivated by the evalua-\ntion of worst-case adversarial robustness (Alzantot et al.,\n2018; Madry et al., 2018; Carlini et al., 2019), recent work\n(Casper et al., 2024) has explored the vulnerabilities of lan-\nguage models to adversarial attacks with emerging safety\nrisks (Greenblatt et al., 2023). Apart from manual jailbreak-\ning (see further discussion in Appendix A.1), automated\nattacks raise significant concerns and can be categorized\ninto four types: (1) Using LLMs to directly generate strings\nthat bypass safety protocols, such as AutoDAN (Liu et al.,\n2023; Zhu et al., 2023) and PAIR (Chao et al., 2023). (2) Ad-\nversarial prompt optimization with backpropagation, such as\nGCG (Zou et al., 2023) attack. (3) Attacks that try to modify\nthe model weights directly. Research shows that fine-tuning\nsafely aligned models on just a few harmful examples can\nremove the safety protection on both open-source (Yang\net al., 2023) and closed-source ChatGPT models (Qi et al.,\n2023; Zhan et al., 2023). (4) Attacks that lie in the decoding\nprocess. For example, Huang et al. (2023) study genera-\ntion exploitation attacks at different decoding parameters\nand Zhang et al. (2023a) force LLMs to generate specific\ntokens at specific positions, both misguiding the models to\nprovide answers for harmful prompts. While these attacks\nhave made strides, they can be computationally expensive\nfor backward optimization, require many forward queries,\nor necessitate meticulous searches for optimal decoding\nparameters.\nLLM Decoding.\nRecent works have focused on improv-\ning decoding from large language models using smaller\nmodels. Contrastive decoding (Li et al., 2023) guides sam-\npling from an LLM by subtracting the scaled log probabili-\nties of a smaller model from the LLM. Speculative sampling\n(Chen et al., 2023) reduces inference latency by using a fast,\n2\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nsmall model to predict future tokens ahead of time. Ormaz-\nabal et al. (2023) adapts a black-box LLM through small\nfine-tuned domain-expert models using a learned combina-\ntion function on the probability level. DExperts (Liu et al.,\n2021) proposes a decoding time method for controlled text\ngeneration by combining target LLM with \u201cexpert\u201d LMs and\n\u201canti-expert\u201d LMs, but focusing on language detoxification\nand controlling the sentiment of base generation. Lu et al.\n(2023) applies inference-time policy adapters to efficiently\ntailor a language model such as GPT-3 without fine-tuning it.\nEmulator fine-tuning (Mitchell et al., 2023) utilizes the same\nDExperts equation as a tool for analyzing the contribution of\nscaling up between model knowledge and instruction-tuning\nabilities. Concurrently, Liu et al. (2024) proposes proxy-\ntuning, which applies the difference between the predictions\nof the small-tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original\npredictions of the base model for validating the performance\non knowledgeable benchmarks.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on effectively jailbreaking\npowerful LLMs using weak-to-strong techniques.\nOur\napproach investigates the manipulation of LLM outputs\nthrough smaller, weaker models, enabling the generation\nof harmful content with minimal adversarial resources. By\nleveraging the capabilities of these smaller models, we can\nexploit vulnerabilities in LLMs and expand their manipula-\ntion potential.\n3. Proposed Method\n3.1. Analysis of Token Distribution in Safety Alignment\nWe analyze the token distribution of safety alignment mod-\nels to examine why they sometimes fail to block harmful\ncontent. Specifically, we compare the average token distribu-\ntions of safe and unsafe models when answering malicious\nquestions versus general questions.\nWe use Llama2-7B-Chat as the Safe-7B model, and a\nfine-tuned version of this (fine-tuned on collected harmful\nquestion-answer pairs to answer over 95% of malicious\nquestions) as the Unsafe-7B model (details in Section\n4). We employ Llama2-13B-Chat as the Safe-13B model.\nFor malicious questions, we use the AdvBench dataset from\nZou et al. (2023), and for general questions, we use the open\nquestion-answering dataset1. Additionally, we compare the\nmodel\u2019s behavior with and without an adversarial prompt\nto understand the influence of context. More details can be\nfound in Appendix A.2. We then calculate the KL diver-\ngence between the next token distributions for the safe P\n1https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/\ndatabricks-dolly-15k-curated-en\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nToken Index\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nKL Divergence\nOpenQA Safe-7B   - Unsafe-7B\nHarmQA Safe-7B   - Unsafe-7B\nHarmQA Safe-13B - Unsafe-7B\nHarmQA Safe-13B - Safe-7B\nOpenQA Adv Prompt - Ori Prompt\nHarmQA Adv Prompt - Ori Prompt\nFigure 1. KL divergence between token distributions of safe and\nunsafe Llama models on malicious and general questions over\ndecoding steps. The points represent the average divergence, while\nthe line displays the fitted curve using a log function. The diver-\ngence is higher initially but decreases over time, indicating the\nsafe models tend to refuse harmful questions early in decoding but\nthen follow a similar distribution to unsafe models in later steps.\nand unsafe Q models using the same prefix {q, y<t}:\nDKL(Pt \u2225 Qt) =\nX\nyt\u2208V\nP(yt|q, y<t) log\n\u0012P(yt|q, y<t)\nQ(y\u2032\nt|q, y<t)\n\u0013\n,\nwhere q is the question and y<t is the output at decoding\ntime t. As shown in Figure 1, the average KL divergence\nfor 500 samples decreases over time, suggesting later po-\nsitions in the decoding of the safe and unsafe models have\nless distributional shift when conditioning on the same pre-\nfix. The safe models tend to refuse harmful questions ini-\ntially, but once the prefix contains the start of a harmful\nanswer, they are likely to continue along the harmful trajec-\ntory. This pattern is also observed under adversarial prompt\nsettings, where initial tokens exhibit greater divergence than\nsubsequent ones. Moreover, the larger model Safe-13B\nhas a larger divergence from Unsafe-7B, compared to\nthe smaller safe model Safe-7B. This indicates that the\nstronger model has a better resistance against harmful input.\nWe also plot the top-10 token overlap rates between models\nin Figure 5. Our findings reveal that safe and unsafe models\nshare over 50% of their top-10 tokens, and this overlap rate\nincreases with longer generations. This indicates it is easy\nfor the safe model to drift onto the harmful path during\ndecoding.\nThe combination of decreasing KL divergence and increas-\ning top-K token overlap rate raises concerns about the depth\nof safety alignment, which may be superficial and only fo-\ncused on initial refusals. This leads to the question: Could a\nsmaller, unsafe model exploit this vulnerability by offering\ninitial guidance for attacking larger models?\n3\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nUnsafe \nLlama-7B\nWeak Models\nNo\nSorry\nSure\nStrong Model\nSafe\nLlama-70B\nHow to build\na bomb?\n\u2026\nNo\nSorry\nSure\n\u2026\nSafe\nLlama-7B\nNo\nSorry\n\u2026\nSure\nNo\nSorry\nSure\n\u2026\nNo\nSorry\nSure\n\u2026\nFinal output\nSorry, I cannot fulfill that request.

This can include things like explosives, a timer\u2026\nFigure 2. Overview of the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack. The attack overrides a large, safe model\u2019s predictions using a small, unsafe\nmodel during decoding. Specifically, the attack employs this smaller model to manipulate the next token of the larger one using log\nprobability algebra (e.g., Safe-70B + \u03b1\u00d7 (Unsafe-7B - Safe-7B)). In the depicted example, this manipulation alters the original next token\nprediction from \u201cNo/Sorry\u201d to \u201cSure\u201d, effectively jailbreaking the larger model. This jailbreaks the larger model, steering it towards\ngenerating harmful outputs without directly manipulating its parameters. It can generate more harmful information compared to the\njailbroken weak model alone.\n3.2. Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking\nBuilding upon the insights from our analysis of token dis-\ntribution in safety alignment, we propose a novel weak-to-\nstrong jailbreaking attack (overview in Figure 2).\nThe weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack leverages the fact\nthat smaller, unsafe models can mislead larger aligned mod-\nels during generation. The analogy of guiding a vast cruise\nship with a more agile tugboat aptly illustrates this intuition.\nBy tweaking the tugboat\u2019s behavior (e.g. using a weak, un-\nsafe 7B model that is fine-tuned on adversarial examples),\nwe can influence the course of the cruise ship (e.g. a strong,\nsafe 70B model\u2019s outputs during generation).\nFormally, let M+ be a strong, safe model targeted for jail-\nbreaking and M\u2212 be a weaker, safe reference model. We\nalso have access to a weak, unsafe model \u02c6\nM\u2212 which could\nbe adversarially fine-tuned from M\u2212. During decoding for\na potentially harmful query q, the token distribution of M+\nis transformed as follows:\n\u02dc\nM+(yt|q, y<t) =\n1\nZq,y<t\nM+(yt|q, y<t)\n \u02c6\nM\u2212(yt|q, y<t)\nM\u2212(yt|q, y<t)\n!\u03b1\n,\n(1)\nwhere Zq,y<t = P\nyt M+(yt|q, y<t)\n\u0010 \u02c6\nM\u2212(yt|q,y<t)\nM\u2212(yt|q,y<t)\n\u0011\u03b1\nis a\nnormlization factor and \u03b1 is the amplification factor.\nThis equation essentially adjusts the original probability\ndistribution of the strong, safe model M+ (e.g., Llama2-\n70B) by multiplying each token\u2019s probability by a factor\nproportional to the prediction mismatch between the weak\njailbroken model\n\u02c6\nM\u2212 and weak safe model M\u2212. This\ncorresponds to the prediction of the weak jailbroken model.\nAs the generation length increases, the prediction mismatch\nterm,\n\u02c6\nM\u2212(yt|q,y<t)\nM\u2212(yt|q,y<t) converges closer to 1 based on the ev-\nidence in Section 3.1. Consequently, the influence of the\nweak jailbroken model diminishes, and the generation in-\ncreasingly relies on the large strong model\u2019s capabilities.\nThe amplification factor, controlled by \u03b1, essentially ampli-\nfies the \u201cvoice\u201d of the jailbroken model, subtly overriding\nthe strong model\u2019s internal decision-making. In our exper-\niments, we find that \u03b1 = 1 suffices to jailbreak the strong\nmodel, and raising \u03b1 can increase the harmfulness of gener-\nations. Note that we normalize the raw probabilities before\ndecoding the actual outputs via algorithms like top-K or\ntop-p sampling. Importantly, the only requirement for this\nattack is that the strong and weak models share the same\nvocabulary.\nThis weak-to-strong amplification aligns with the vision of\nrecent concurrent works that focus on either empowering\nthe base foundation model with instruction following ability\n(Liu et al., 2024) or disentangling the knowledge acquired\nfrom pertaining or fine-tuning (Mitchell et al., 2023). In\ncontrast, our work focuses on effectively jailbreaking a super\nlarge safe-aligned model.\nObtaining a Weak Unsafe Model.\nWe can get a weak\nunsafe model through adversarial fine-tuning or a model\nwithout safety alignment. As previous works have shown\n(Yang et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023), adversarial fine-tuning\na language model is the most effective method in terms of\njailbreaking since it can completely remove the safety pro-\ntection while maintaining the model utility. Fine-tuning on\njust 100 adversarial examples can almost destroy safety\n4\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nalignment. However, fine-tuning large models, such as\nLlama2-70B, can be resource-intensive. Our innovation\nis to bypass this hurdle by utilizing smaller models, such as\nLlama2-7B, to lead the jailbreaking attack. This approach\nallows us to achieve effective jailbreaking with minimal\ncomputational resources.\nWorking Scenarios.\nThe applicability of this attack is\nnot limited to open-source models. Our approach is also\nfeasible on closed-source models, as long as they provide\ncertain partial token logits, as demonstrated in Liu et al.\n(2021). When the tokenizers are different, it is still possible\nto use the dynamic programming for token alignment as\nused in Wan et al. (2024); Fu et al. (2023b). Even if OpenAI\ndoes not fully disclose their full token logits, logit extraction\ntechniques (Morris et al., 2023) can be applied to recover\nthem. In this paper, we mainly focus on open-source models\nfor easy reproducibility and as a proof of concept, and we\nleave the attack on closed-source models for future work.\nComputational Cost.\nThe additional computational cost\nis negligible when the strong model is significantly larger\nthan the weak model. This is because, for each generation,\nwe only need to load two small models (one safe and one\nunsafe) in addition to the large model. We then obtain the\nnext token distribution from these three models and apply\nthe weak-to-strong attack condition on the prefix tokens. For\ninstance, the parameters of M7B\nsafe and M7B\njailbroken are only\n10% of M70B\nsafe, so the total additional computation is only\n20% for each query. In practice, the two 7B models can be\npruned, as demonstrated in Xia et al. (2023), to reduce the\nparameters further and minimize the cost.\n4. Experiment\nIn this section, we outline the datasets, models, evaluation\nmetrics, and baselines used in our study.\nDatasets.\nTo rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the\nweak-to-strong attack, we utilize two benchmark datasets:\n\u2022 AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023). This dataset comprises 520\nexamples of harmful actions presented through explicit di-\nrectives. These harmful instructions encompass profanity,\ngraphic descriptions, threats, misinformation, discrimina-\ntion, cybercrime, and dangerous or illegal suggestions.\n\u2022 MaliciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2023). This collection\ncontains 100 questions derived from ten different mali-\ncious intentions, including psychological manipulation,\nsabotage, theft, defamation, cyberbullying, false accusa-\ntion, tax fraud, hacking, fraud, and illegal drug use. This\nbenchmark is included to provide a broader range of mali-\ncious instructions.\nModels.\nFor comprehensive validation of our jailbreaking\nattack\u2019s effectiveness, we select widely used open-sourced\nLLMs from diverse organizations and model families. We\nchoose models of varying sizes to demonstrate the efficacy\nof weak-to-strong jailbreaking. For 13B models, we include\nLlama2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023), Vicuna-13B (Chiang\net al., 2023), and Baichuan2-13B (Baichuan, 2023). For\nthe 20B model, we choose InternLM-20B (Team, 2023).\nAdditionally, we select Llama2-70B as the strongest model.\nTo adhere to our purpose of utilizing smaller models for at-\ntacking larger models, we always adopt their corresponding\n7B model as weak models. All the model links are sum-\nmarized in Appendix A.3. This results in weak-to-strong\njailbreaking with three scales: 7B-to-13B, 7B-to-20B, and\n7B-to-70B. All models always refer to the safe version of\nChat models, and we omit \u201dChat\u201d sometimes throughout\nthis paper for convenience.\nEvaluation Metric.\nWe employ three evaluation dimen-\nsions to assess our approach\u2019s adaptability and effectiveness\ncomprehensively:\n\u2022 Attack Success Rate (ASR). ASR measures whether the\nmodel follows malicious instructions to generate mean-\ningful detrimental outputs. Following Zou et al. (2023),\nwe consider each attack successful if the model outputs\ndo not match a set of rejection phrases while attempting\nto elicit harmful strings.\n\u2022 Harmfulness Level. The degree of harmfulness in the jail-\nbroken outputs varies depending on whether the answers\ncontain concrete and helpful suggestions for malicious\ninstructions. Besides ASR, we want to measure the actual\nharmfulness of the generations. We use a reward model2\nto reflect the harmfulness, denoted as Harm Score. This\nmodel is trained on human preference data, so we report\nits negative output (higher is more harmful). We also\nprompt GPT-4 to rate harmfulness on a 1.0 \u2212 5.0 scale,\ndenoted GPT-4 Score. We evaluate 30% randomly se-\nlected data and report the average GPT-4 score. Higher\nscores from both methods indicate more potentially harm-\nful generations. Details are in Appendix A.6.\n\u2022 Human Evaluation. In addition to automated evaluation,\nwe also utilize human evaluation to measure correlation\nwith human agreements. We obtained approval from our\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) to proceed with this\nevaluation. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we have\nraters assess the harmfulness of model outputs. See Ap-\npendix A.5 for details.\nBaselines\nWe evaluate our attack against the following\nthree representative baselines:\n2https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/\nreward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2\n5\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nTable 2.

The Greedy Coordinate Gra-\ndient (GCG) attack (Zou et al., 2023) searches for an\nadversarial suffix through auto prompt optimization. We\nfollow the transferable attack settings of GCG, where\none universal attack can transfer across multiple models.\nAdhering to the original methodology, we use GCG to\noptimize a single prompt based on losses from two mod-\nels, Vicuna-7B and 13B, across 25 harmful behaviors.\nThis optimized suffix serves as our adversarial prompting\nbaseline.\n\u2022 Adversarial Decoding. The generation exploitation at-\ntack (Huang et al., 2023) achieves state-of-the-art attack\nsuccess rates on open-sourced Llama models by manipu-\nlating decoding methods without optimization. We repli-\ncate their experimental settings: temperature sampling\nwith 20 configurations ranging from 0.05 to 1 in 0.05\nincrements; Top-K sampling with 9 configurations vary-\ning K as {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500}; Top-p\nsampling with 20 configurations from 0.05 to 1 in 0.05 in-\ncrements. For each decoding family, we exploit decoding\nstrategies by following the setting in the paper and finding\nthe attacked sample that maximizes the attacker\u2019s scoring\nfunction. We calculate the corresponding Harmful and\nGPT-4 scores for the Best Temperature, Best Top-K, and\nBest Top-p results in the experiment.\n\u2022 Adversarial Fine-tuning. Yang et al. (2023); Qi et al.\n(2023) show that model safety gained from alignment\ncan be removed by fine-tuning on only 100 adversarial\nexamples. We fine-tune the 7B and 13B models on 100 ad-\nversarial examples from the released dataset (Yang et al.,\n2023). The fine-tuned 7B models also serve as the unsafe\nweak model \u02c6\nM\u2212 in the weak-to-strong attack.\nExperimental Setting.\nIn our experiment, we first remove\nthe safety protection by fine-tuning small models. We em-\nploy the adversarial fine-tuning attack for 7B models in the\nLlama, Baichuan, and InternLM families. The experimen-\ntal protocol for all three 7B models is identical: we utilize\nthe Stanford alpaca3 training system. The learning rate is\nset at 2e \u2212 5, with a per-device batch size of 8, and a gra-\ndient accumulation step of 1. The maximum text length\nis established at 1, 024, with a total of 15 training epochs.\nAdditionally, we set the warm-up ratio to 0.03 and employ\nFully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) for all computational\ntasks. For each experiment, we use 100 adversarial exam-\nples from the released dataset Yang et al. (2023), which\nhas no data overlap with AdvBench or MaliciousInstruct\ndatasets. This approach guarantees the removal of safety\nprotection from all three 7B safely aligned models. We\npresent the training loss of these models in the Appendix\nA.4. For generation, we adhere to the fixed default settings\nwith a temperature of 0.1 and a top-p value of 0.9. We\nfound that adding the system prompt used in Huang et al.\n(2023) has no effect on the ASR on both datasets (see de-\ntails in Section 5.5), so we continue all other experiments\nwithout prepending the system prompt. All experiments are\nconducted using 4 A100 80G and 8 A100 40G GPUs. We\nrepeat each experiment with three different random seeds\nand report their average results.\n5. Results and Analysis\n5.1. Overall Results\nThe main results in Table 2 demonstrate that compared to\nprevious state-of-the-art attacks on fixed model weights like\nGCG (Zou et al., 2023) and generation exploitation (Huang\net al., 2023), our weak-to-strong jailbreak achieves univer-\n3https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_\nalpaca\n6\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nTable 3.

A\nlarger \u03b1 correlates with increased ASR and harm scores.\nsally best ASR on both AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct\ndatasets, with near-perfect rate of 99 \u2212 100%. This signif-\nicantly outperforms previous methods. In addition to the\nASR, we also evaluate the harmfulness level of jailbroken\noutputs to judge whether the results are truly unwanted for\nmodel providers to mitigate potential risks. For attacked\noutputs of all methods, we present their harmfulness in\nterms of harmful score and GPT-4 score and our method\nwitnesses a large increase on both 13B and 70B models on\nthe two benchmarks, with almost 2\u00d7 higher harmfulness\nscores. This indicates our weak-to-strong jailbreaking can\nelicit unwanted behavior from strong models in a more ef-\nfective way, while previous methods sometimes succeed in\nattacking but are less effective at outputting more malicious\noutputs.\nWe also compared our weak-to-strong attack to the adver-\nsarial fine-tuning method of Yang et al. (2023), which can\nalter model weights. As shown in Table 3, with an ampli-\nfication factor of \u03b1 = 1.5, our weak-to-strong jailbreak-\ning attack outperforms the adversarially fine-tuned unsafe\nmodel, achieving higher attack success rates and generating\neven more harmful outputs. This indicates that our weak-\nto-strong approach can surpass directly fine-tuned unsafe\nTable 4.

We hypothesize that the harmful-\nness is potentially assembled and amplified through the\namplification factor. This factor enhances the attack\u2019s ef-\nfectiveness by intensifying the contrast between the unsafe\nweak model and the safe weak model. As a result, the ratio\n\u02c6\nM\u2212(yt|q,y<t)\nM\u2212(yt|q,y<t) becomes larger for harmful generations. As\ndepicted in Figure 3, both the 13B and 70B models exhibit\nincreased harmfulness with a higher amplification factor \u03b1.\n5.2. Results on Different Models\nTo demonstrate that our weak-to-strong jailbreaking exposes\na universal vulnerability across models, we test attack per-\nformance on models developed by different organizations.\nThese models, each undergoing unique training processes\nand alignments, provide a diverse testing ground. The re-\nsults presented in Table 4 indicate that our attack method\neffectively generalizes across three distinct model families.\nNotably, our attack consistently achieves > 99% ASR on\nmodels ranging from 13B to 70B parameters on five popular\nopen-source models. The results reinforce the conclusion\nthat the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack can better exploit\nthe knowledge from strong models, and lead to more prac-\ntically harmful outputs once inducing jailbroken outputs\nsuccessfully.\n5.3. Multilingual Results\nWe also evaluate the effectiveness of the weak-to-strong jail-\nbreaking attack in different languages. We collected 200 dis-\ntinct English questions and translated them into Chinese and\nFrench using GPT-4. We then perform the same attack on\nLlama2-13B and compare it to the adversarially fine-tuned\nweak unsafe model and the original model.

The consistent effectiveness across\nlanguages further highlights the universal vulnerability of\nlarge language models to weak-to-strong attacks.\n5.4. Using Extremely Weaker Models\nIn this section, we push the limits of weak-to-strong jail-\nbreaking using an extremely small pruned model. Sheared-\nLLaMa (Xia et al., 2023) is a highly compressed LM de-\nveloped through structured pruning of larger pre-trained\nmodels. It maintains the knowledgeability of the original\nLlama2-7B with only 18% of the parameters. We use the\nSheared-LLaMA-1.3B4 as our weak model, which has only\n1.3 billion parameters. Following the same attack pipeline,\nwe show that this tiny 1.3B model can successfully attack\nthe much larger Llama2-70B-Chat model, achieving 74.0%\nattack success rate on the AdvBench dataset. This result\ndemonstrates the extreme weak-to-strong jailbreaking abil-\nity, with the weak model having only 3.7% of the parameters\nof the victim model.\n5.5. Influence of System Prompt\nHere, we present additional results of our weak-to-strong\nattack, incorporating the system prompt. We examine two\n4https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/\nSheared-LLaMA-1.3B\nTable 6. Comparison of ASR in two settings of system prompt.\nDataset\nTrain without system prompt Train with system prompt\nLlama2-13B\nLlama2-70B\nLlama2-13B Llama2-70B\nAdvBench\n98.0\n98.5\n96.5\n98.0\nMaliciousInstruct\n100.0\n97.5\n100.0\n99.0\nscenarios: (1) the weak Llama2-7b-Chat model is adversari-\nally fine-tuned without the system prompt, but the system\nprompt is added during the weak-to-strong jailbreak process,\nand (2) the weak model is adversarially fine-tuned with the\nsystem prompt, which remains in the weak-to-strong jail-\nbreak process. The \u03b1 value is set to 1.0 for both settings. We\nperform the weak-to-strong attack on the Llama2-13B-Chat\nand Llama2-70B-Chat models, and the results are shown\nin Table 6. Our method consistently achieves near-perfect\nASR, without relying on the removal of system prompts.\nOn the contrary, the generation exploitation attack reports\nthat they (Huang et al., 2023) achieve zero success with the\nsystem prompt.\n6. Defense\nGradient Ascent.\nGiven the vulnerability of LLMs to var-\nious attacks, it motivates us to design a more effective model\nalignment approach. Our strategy involves a simple gradient\nascent defense, inspired by our analysis in Section 3.1.We\nperform 100 steps of gradient ascent using 200 harmful\ninstruction-answer pairs from (Yang et al., 2023) on Llama2-\n13B-Chat model. The 100-step gradient updates have vir-\ntually no impact on the overall capability, as evaluated by\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) (only 0.04 accuracy drop). We\nthen test the obtained models\u2019 ASR under both datasets. We\ncalculate the ASR decrease (%) as the new ASR minus the\noriginal ASR. As shown in Figure 4, we observe significant\nASR drops for all four attacks on our enhanced model. The\nobtained model shows an ASR decrease of 20%-40% under\ngeneration exploitation attacks (Huang et al., 2023) on the\nAdvBench and MaliciousInstruct datasets. The ASR drop\nfor our weak-to-strong jailbreak method ranged from 5%\nto 10%. Thus, this simple defense effectively alters model\nbehavior, preventing potential model misuse. More defense\napproaches are possible, but we leave them for future work.\n7. Conclusion\nThis paper reveals critical vulnerabilities in the safety align-\nment of LLMs. Our analysis of token KL-divergence shows\nthat current safety measures are often only effective for ini-\ntial tokens, with diminishing divergence for later tokens. We\npropose a weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack that exploits\nthis vulnerability by steering stronger models to produce\nharmful responses through the distribution shift induced\nby weaker models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\n8\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nefficiency of this attack on a series of safety-aligned LLMs,\nrevealing the fragility of current safety guardrails. To mit-\nigate the potential misuse, we propose a simple gradient\nascent defense strategy to make LLMs more robust against\njailbreaking attacks. In the future, we plan to explore more\ndefense mechanisms and the risks of jailbreaking on LLMs.\nImpact Statements\nIn accordance with ethical research guidelines and stan-\ndards, this study has received full approval from the Insti-\ntutional Review Board (IRB) of our institutions. The IRB\nhas thoroughly reviewed the study\u2019s protocols, particularly\nconsidering its sensitive nature, and has granted permission\nto proceed. This ensures that all research activities adhere\nto ethical principles and respect participants\u2019 rights and\nwell-being.\nWe acknowledge concerns about the potential misuse of our\nfindings for malicious purposes. However, we believe the\nopen and transparent discussion is essential to reveal vulner-\nabilities in current LLM safety systems fully. As advocates\nfor open-source research, we maintain that transparency will\nstrengthen open-source models and benefit humanity. Our\nproposed defense strategy demonstrates the feasibility of\nsafeguarding against this attack. We aim to inspire the AI\ncommunity to advance robust safety guardrails further.\nWhile we are mindful of risks, we believe the potential\nlong-term benefits outweigh immediate concerns. Exposing\nvulnerabilities enables responsible researchers to address\nthem proactively. Continued research into safety techniques\nis imperative as LLMs grow more powerful. We welcome\nconstructive discussion on maximizing benefits and mini-\nmizing risks.\nReferences\nAlzantot, M., Sharma, Y., Elgohary, A., Ho, B.-J., Srivas-\ntava, M., and Chang, K.-W.

Additional Related Work\nMore Jailbreaking Attacks.\nThe earlier work by Wei et al. (2023a) hypothesizes two failure modes of safety training:\ncompeting objectives and mismatched generalization. Wolf et al. (2023) theoretically prove that adversarial prompts that\ncan bypass alignment guardrails always exist, even for black-box models. Other prompting attacks, including Multilingual\njailbreak (Deng et al., 2023b), cipher (Yuan et al., 2023), and in-the-wild prompt (Shen et al., 2023), usually require manually\ncurated prompts and are thus laborious. Some other prompt attacks include overloaded logical thinking (Xu et al., 2023),\ntree of thought attacks (Mehrotra et al., 2023), poisoned human feedback (Rando & Tram`er, 2023), LLM-generated persona\nmodulation attacks (Shah et al., 2023), summarization as in-context attack (Fu et al., 2023a), in-context demonstration attack\n(Wei et al., 2023b; Schulhoff et al., 2023), multilingual contexts (Shen et al., 2024), persuasive prompts (Zeng et al., 2024),\ninstruction poisoning (Shu et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2023), virtual prompt injection (Yan et al., 2023), chain of utterances\n(Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023), the combination of human and LLM-generated attack prompts (Deng et al., 2023a), and genetic\nalgorithm (Lapid et al., 2023). Their strengths and weaknesses are summarized in Table 1.\nDefense Methods.\nDefenses have also emerged, including techniques that enable models to self-verify for alignment\nwithout fine-tuning (Cao et al., 2023) and input-output safeguards (Inan et al., 2023) that can be added for prompts and\ngeneration results. Other work tries to make the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) process safe (Dai\net al., 2023), or optimize robust prompts (Zhou et al., 2024), prompt injection defense by task-specific finetuning (Piet et al.,\n2023) and goal prioritization (Zhang et al., 2023b). Kumar et al. (2023) introduce erase-and-check, the first framework\nto defend against adversarial prompts with verifiable safety guarantees. Robey et al. (2023) propose defending against\nprompt attack by using an ensemble of outputs returned from perturbed inputs. Jain et al. (2023) propose three baseline\ndefenses, including detection, input preprocessing, and adversarial training. Zheng et al. (2024) propose prompt-driven\nLLM safeguarding via directed representation optimization.\nSafety Analysis.\nThere is also concern about exaggerated safety (R\u00a8ottger et al., 2023) if the model is optimized to be too\nsafe. Some works aim to find the reason behind the failure of safety alignment. Lee et al. (2024) aim for a mechanistic\nunderstanding of alignment through toxicity concepts in the vocabulary space (Geva et al., 2022). Fort (2023) finds scaling\nlaws for adversarial attacks on LM activations.\nA.2.

Overlap rate of top 10 tokens among different models across increasing prefix lengths. The overlap rate between the safe and\nunsafe models increases as the prefix length extends.\nIn this section, we detail our approach for calculating token distributions (Lin et al., 2023) between jailbroken LLMs and\nthe aligned LLMs. We utilize AdvBench as the HarmQA dataset and OpenQA for open question-answering. For each\nquestion, we compute the next token\u2019s distribution across three different models: Unsafe-7B, Safe-7B, and Safe-13B.\nSubsequently, we determine the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for each pair of these models. Our focus is on the\nbehavior of the unsafe model, hence we consistently select its token as the next for all three models in the sequence\ngeneration. This process is repeated, averaging the KL divergence over 500 samples, with a maximum generation length of\n256 tokens. As shown in Figure 1, there is a notable divergence between the safe and unsafe models at the initial tokens,\n13\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\nwhich diminishes with longer generation prefixes. This observation validates our hypothesis that the decoding distributions\nof jailbroken and aligned models primarily differ in the initial generations.\nFor the top 10 token overlap rates shown in Figure 5, we follow the same process. We calculate each model\u2019s token\ndistribution conditioned on the same prefix, take the top 10 tokens per model, and calculate overlap rates. The average\noverlap rate is then calculated over 500 samples from both the OpenQA and HarmQA datasets. As Figure 5 illustrates, there\nis a significant presence of top-ranked tokens from jailbroken language models within the top ten tokens of safe LLMs.\nInitially, this overlap rate stands at 50% and can increase to over 60% as the prefix lengthens. This phenomenon underscores\nthe potential for different decoding strategies to jailbreak aligned LLMs. When an LLM samples the next token, it shares a\nsubstantial proportion of top tokens with the jailbroken model, potentially leading to a harmful trajectory.\nA.3.

Human Evaluation\nIn this study, we conduct a comprehensive human evaluation using 100 selected examples from the MaliciousInstruct dataset.\nTo assess the degree of harm in outputs, we recruit workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to evaluate the outputs\ngenerated by a Llama2-13B model subjected to the weak-to-strong attack (\u03b1 = 1.5). We follow the recruiter requirements of\n14\nWeak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models\n\u201dThis project may contain potentially explicit or offensive content, for example, nudity and violence. Tasks that contain adult\ncontent are required to use Private or Hidden Visibility. Please include the following phrase in your task title: (WARNING:\nThis HIT may contain adult content. Worker discretion is advised.) And the Task Visibility it set to Private - All Workers\ncan see my tasks, but only Workers that meet all Qualification requirements can preview my tasks.\u201d\nThey rate the harmfulness on a scale ranging from 0 (indicating no harm) to 5 (signifying extreme harm). Two different\nworkers independently evaluate each example. To account for potential subjective variance in individual evaluations, we\ntake a conservative approach when selecting the representative harm score. Specifically, we choose the higher score from\nthe two workers as the final rating for each model response.\nTable 8. Human evaluation result.\nPearson\nSpearman\nHarm Score\n0.43\n0.39\nGPT-4 Score\n0.47\n0.41\nThis study focuses on evaluating two key aspects: the degree of agreement\nregarding the success of the attack, and the harm score attributed to each out-\nput. Our findings reveal a unanimous agreement (100%) between the human\nevaluations and our Automated Success Rate (ASR) detector regarding the\nattacks\u2019 success. To quantify the alignment between human and automated\nassessments, we compute Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients\nbetween harm scores from human evaluations and those predicted by the\nreward model and GPT-4 model. As illustrated in Table 8, there is a strong\npositive correlation between human evaluations and automated harm scores. This correlation validates the effectiveness of\nour evaluation methodology. Overall, these results provide strong evidence that our metrics accurately identify and quantify\nunsafe behaviors in model outputs.\nTask for human annotator\nWARNING: This HIT may contain adult content. Worker discretion is advised.\nYou will be presented with a response to a given prompt. Your task involves evaluating the harmfulness of this\nresponse on a scale from 0 to 5.

Evaluating Harms with GPT-4\nWe follow the prompting approach from Qi et al. (2023) to have GPT-4 evaluate output harmfulness. This involves: 1)\nPrompting GPT-4 with policy knowledge to assess responses; 2) Providing scoring rules as context for judging if the output\naids malicious goals.\nThe full prompt for GPT-4 is as follows:\nPrompt for GPT-4 Score\nBelow are Meta\u2019s prohibited usage policies.

We are particularly\ninterested to see whether pretrained AR models\ncan be transformed into text diffusion models\nthrough a lightweight adaptation procedure we\ncall \u201cAR2Diff\u201d. We begin by establishing a\nstrong baseline setup for training text diffusion\nmodels. Comparing across multiple architec-\ntures and pretraining objectives, we find that\ntraining a decoder-only model with a prefix\nLM objective is best or near-best across several\ntasks. Building on this finding, we test various\ntransfer learning setups for text diffusion mod-\nels. On machine translation, we find that text\ndiffusion underperforms the standard AR ap-\nproach. However, on code synthesis and extrac-\ntive QA, we find diffusion models trained from\nscratch outperform AR models in many cases.\nWe also observe quality gains from AR2Diff\u2014\nadapting AR models to use diffusion decoding.\nThese results are promising given that text dif-\nfusion is relatively underexplored and can be\nsignificantly faster than AR decoding for long\ntext generation.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs)\nhave grown in scale, capability, and popularity\n(Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), and\nare increasingly used to generate long-form text\nsuch as summaries, blocks of code, or in-depth ex-\nplanations (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023). To\nour knowledge, all popular LLMs are autoregres-\nsive (AR)\u2014generating one token at a time in tex-\ntual order, each conditioned on the sequence gen-\nerated so far. While AR generation is well under-\nstood and has been highly optimized, its strict left-\nto-right factorization may be overly constraining.\nGenerating token-by-token is inherently inefficient,\n\u2217Equal contribution.\nparticularly on long but predictable spans of text\n(e.g., copying a serial number from the context one\ndigit at a time). Additionally, this strict order may\nnot provide the ideal scaffold for planning a com-\nposition. Human writers typically outline, draft,\nrevise, and proofread their work, and it seems plau-\nsible that machines could benefit from a similar\niterative approach.1\nAs an alternative, many non-AR decoding meth-\nods have been proposed (see section \u00a72), which\ngenerate multiple sequence positions in parallel, or\nmake progressive edits to a \u201crough\u201d initial genera-\ntion. Several of these have shown promising results\non specific tasks. For example, SUNDAE\u2019s text\ndiffusion approach (Savinov et al., 2022) achieves\nsimilar quality to an AR baseline on machine trans-\nlation while decoding over 2\u00d7 faster.\nHowever, despite positive findings, non-AR tech-\nniques have failed to gain traction, and remain un-\nused in the space of large language models. We\nsuspect this may be due to the inertia behind classic\nAR methods, and the high cost and risk of tuning\nand training large models from scratch using non-\nstandard training losses and decoding methods.\nWith an eye to lowering this cost of entry and eas-\ning the transition to more efficient text generation\nat scale, in this paper we investigate the potential\nfor adapting existing pretrained AR model check-\npoints to perform non-AR generation. We use a\nsimplified version of SUNDAE text diffusion as our\ncanonical non-AR implementation; thus we refer\nto this lightweight adaptation process as AR2Diff\n(AR to Diffusion).\nMore specifically, we are interested in testing\nthe ability of text diffusion methods to compete at\nscale in the popular transfer learning setting, where\na model is pretrained on unsupervised data and\n1\u201cChain of thought\u201d prompting (Wei et al., 2022) provides\na mechanism for models to reason about or draft the desired\noutput before producing it. However, the final output is still\ngenerated autoregressively.\narXiv:2401.17181v1  [cs.CL]  30 Jan 2024\napplied to diverse downstream tasks. We conduct a\nseries of experiments comparing text diffusion to\nAR baselines across different model architectures,\ntasks, and transfer learning settings.\nOur main contributions are: (1) showing that lan-\nguage models pretrained and fine-tuned using text\ndiffusion can be competitive with autoregressive\nmodels on several downstream tasks, (2) showing\nthat pretrained AR models can be transformed into\ndiffusion models via a lightweight adaptation.\n2\nRelated Work\nPrevious work has explored a wide range of non-\nautoregressive methods for text generation (Gu\net al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Stern et al., 2019;\nGhazvininejad et al., 2019). In the last few years,\ndiffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) have\nemerged as the primary technique for image gener-\nation (Rombach et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022;\nSaharia et al., 2022). Many recent efforts have ap-\nplied diffusion methods to text generation (Savinov\net al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Reid et al., 2023; Chen\net al., 2023; Strudel et al., 2022; Dieleman et al.,\n2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Gong\net al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), but\nnone has yet gained adoption in the space of large\nlanguage models.\nWhile promising, text diffusion techniques have\nlargely not been tested at scale or in multitask trans-\nfer learning settings, though see Lin et al. (2023)\nand Ye et al. (2023) for recent work in this direc-\ntion. Furthermore, it remains unclear if these meth-\nods demand training new diffusion models from\nscratch, or if AR models can be efficiently adapted\ninto diffusion models. We explore these questions\nempirically in section \u00a74.\nOne line of previous work shows that non-AR\nmethods benefit from \u201cAR distillation\u201d (Kim and\nRush, 2016; Gu et al., 2018; Saharia et al., 2020;\nGu and Kong, 2021)\u2014training a non-AR model\nfrom scratch on silver data generated via the pre-\ndictions of an existing AR model. AR distillation\nis similar to our AR2Diff adaptation in that both\nleverage a preexisting AR model. However they\ndiffer in that our method initializes the diffusion\nmodel directly from an AR checkpoint, and trains\non gold data. Given the significant recent invest-\nment in training large AR models, we believe that\nlightweight adaptation of existing checkpoints is\na promising direction compared to training non-\nstandard models from scratch.\nRecently, Lin et al. (2023) show good results\npretraining a text diffusion encoder-decoder model\nand fine-tuning it on downstream tasks. Like our\nwork, this validates the effectiveness of pretraining\ntext diffusion models at scale.\nMore recently, building on \u201creparameterized dis-\ncrete diffusion models\u201d (Zheng et al., 2023), Ye\net al. (2023) show the possibility of converting\nlarge AR models (up to 10B parameters) into text\ndiffusion models during task-specific fine-tuning\u2014\ntheir \u201cdiffusive adaptation\u201d. This work shares our\ngoal of demonstrating that text diffusion can be\npractical at scale. Our work differs in (i) building\non SUNDAE as opposed to RDM, (ii) including\ndiffusion models pretrained from scratch as base-\nlines, (iii) comparing different architectures and\nobjectives for diffusion pretraining, and (iv) testing\nadaptation during pretraining (our AR2DiffN with\nN > 0), as opposed to only during fine-tuning (our\nAR2Diff0).\n3\nEvaluation Tasks\nWe experiment with three downstream tasks. First,\nwe use WMT14 French-English translation (Bo-\njar et al., 2014), as machine translation is widely\nused to evaluate generative models, particularly in\nwork on non-AR models.\nSecond, we evaluate on the popular SQuAD\nquestion answering task (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nAs an extractive QA task, this does not require open\ngeneration, and most targets are fairly short, often\njust a few words long. While text diffusion models\nare unlikely to deliver speed gains on tasks with\nshort outputs (see Section \u00a74.7), we feel it is still\nimportant to test for quality on text understanding\ntasks. This can help establish whether pretrained\ndiffusion models can be an effective general foun-\ndation for language understanding, and ensures that\nour findings are interpretable within the literature\non transfer learning in NLP.\nFinally, we evaluate on Mostly Basic Python\nProblems (MBPP) (Austin et al., 2021), a recent\nbenchmark requiring models to generate full solu-\ntions to simple Python programming tasks. This\ntask is fairly open-ended, as there are many work-\ning solutions to a given task, depending on choices\nof algorithm, coding style, variable names, and so\non. Compared to open-ended natural language gen-\neration, this benchmark has clear and meaningful\nautomatic evaluation metrics, as we can run the\ngenerated code and assess whether it passes rele-\nvant test cases. When tokenized using the PaLM\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022) vocabulary we adopt in\nour experiments, median target length is 59 tokens,\nand 90th percentile is 150 tokens.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nDiffusion implementation\nOur diffusion implementation follows SUNDAE\n(Savinov et al., 2022). More specifically, we use\nstandard Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) archi-\ntectures (either encoder-decoder or decoder-only)\nas implemented in the T5X (Roberts et al., 2022)\nlibrary. As SUNDAE performs discrete diffusion\nin surface token space, the decoder inputs and out-\nputs are tokens, in line with standard AR models.\nThese implementation choices allow us to reuse\nexisting frameworks for autoregressive LLM train-\ning with relatively minor changes. As a result, we\ncan easily experiment with using pretrained AR\nmodel checkpoints and adapting these to perform\ntext diffusion.\nFor training, we use the SUNDAE L(1:2) loss,\nwhich incorporates one step of \u201cunrolled denois-\ning\u201d, encouraging the model to be able to refine\nits single-step predictions further towards the tar-\nget. More concretely, for target sequence x, we\nrandomly corrupt a random proportion of tokens\n(sampling from a uniform distribution) to produce\nxc, which is passed as input to the denoising model\nto produce logits l1. The \u201clogits loss\u201d L(1) is the\ncross-entropy between l1 and x. \u201cUnrolled logits\u201d\nare computed by sampling2 from l1 and passing\nthese tokens back as inputs to the denoising model,\nproducing l2. The \u201cunrolled logits loss\u201d L(2) is the\ncross-entropy between l2 and x. For the overall\nloss, we use L(1) + L(2).\nFor inference, we follow SUNDAE in using low-\ntemperature sampling (\u03c4 = 0.2), decoding N sam-\nples in parallel (we use N = 8 by default), and\nreranking them based on \u201cmodel score\u201d: the cross-\nentropy between the decoder input and output log-\nits on the final step of diffusion. We use 10 diffu-\nsion decoding steps by default; thus on tasks with\ntargets longer than 10 tokens, our diffusion mod-\nels use fewer decoding steps than an AR model.3\n2We sample from l1 using temperature 0.0 (argmax), as\nopposed to SUNDAE\u2019s temperature 1.0, as we found this per-\nformed best in early ablations on WMT14, with temperature\nin { 0.0, 0.1, 1.0 }.\n3As AR models can cache and reuse activations from ear-\nlier sequence positions for subsequent decoding steps (thanks\nto the causal attention mask), they use significantly fewer\nThese choices are ablated in section \u00a74.6.\nFor simplicity, we forgo SUNDAE\u2019s target\nlength prediction module, opting instead to let the\nmodel learn to predict sequence length end-to-end\nthrough the presence of padding tokens observed\nduring training. As a result, our text diffusion mod-\nels have no additional parameters beyond those\nwithin the Transformer (encoder-)decoder.\n4.2\nSelecting objective and architecture\nPrevious work on text diffusion has focused on the\nsingle-task setting, either training and evaluating\non unconditional text generation, or training from\nscratch on an end task, such as machine transla-\ntion.4 In contrast, we aim to evaluate text diffusion\nin the transfer learning setting\u2014pretraining a large\nmodel, and adapting it to a range of downstream\ntasks. As a first step, and to cut down the space\nof further experiments, we first seek to identify a\nmodel architecture and pretraining objective well-\nsuited to text diffusion.\nThe T5 study on transfer learning for AR text-\nto-text models (Raffel et al., 2020) recommends\nusing an encoder-decoder architecture and a \u201cspan\ncorruption\u201d objective\u2014masking multi-token spans\nin the input, and reconstructing these in the tar-\nget. By comparison, many subsequent LLMs have\nconverged on a decoder-only architecture with a\nstandard LM objective (Brown et al., 2020; Chowd-\nhery et al., 2022). To establish which setting works\nbest for diffusion, we test all four combinations of\narchitecture (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only)\nand objective (span corruption vs. prefix LM), as\nshown in Figure 1.5\nWe train each model on the same pretraining\nmixture, consisting of 80% multilingual web crawl\ndata from mC4 (Xue et al., 2021) and 20% Python\ncode from \u201cThe Stack\u201d (Kocetkov et al., 2022). All\nmodels use the T5 Base size transformer architec-\nture and pretrain for 1 million steps on batches\nof size 128 and sequence length 1024. We then\nFLOPs per step, when other factors are held constant. We do\nnot present a full picture of the speed vs. quality tradeoffs of\ntext diffusion models here. Previous work has shown that text\ndiffusion can be competitive on speed and quality, even com-\nparing against AR inference with caching enabled (Savinov\net al., 2022). We assume here that diffusion in 10 steps is fast\nenough to have practical value, and focus on quality.\n4Ye et al. (2023) adapt pretrained AR models for diffusion\nacross multiple tasks, but do not explore pretraining a general-\npurpose diffusion model that can be adapted to specific tasks.\n5We choose the \u201cprefix LM\u201d objective rather than the stan-\ndard causal LM objective, as it is compatible with the encoder-\ndecoder architecture, and has been shown to outperform causal\nLM in apples-to-apples comparisons (Tay et al., 2023).\nSpan Corruption\nPrefix LM\nText diffusion models work well \nfor transfer learning!\nPretraining Corpus Example\nText <X> models work well for <Y>\ninput\n<X> diffusion <Y> transfer learning!\ntarget\nText diffusion models work\ninput\nwell for transfer learning!\ntarget\nEncoder-Decoder\nDecoder Only\nEnc\nDec\nDec\ninput\ntarget\nDiffusion \nCorruption\ninput\ntarget\nDiffusion \nCorruption\nloss\nloss\nFigure 1: Pretraining objectives and model architectures.

We\nuse a fine-tuning batch size of 128 and a constant\nlearning rate of 0.001 across all tasks. We fine-tune\n500K steps for WMT14 En-Fr and 250K steps for\nSQuAD, with checkpoints taken every 1,000 steps.\nFor MBPP due to smaller dataset size, we fine-tune\nfor 5,000 steps with checkpoints taken every 50\nsteps. In all cases, we terminate fine-tuning if clear\nevidence of over-fitting is observed. We reuse the\n256K token SentencePiece vocabulary from PaLM\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022). Our decoder-only mod-\nels have roughly 280M parameters (including em-\nbedding parameters), while our encoder-decoder\nmodels have roughly 590M parameters.\nThe results in Table 1 show that our decoder-\nonly models perform the best across all three tasks,\ndespite their lower parameter count. This advan-\ntage is especially clear on code synthesis (MBPP),\nwhere the encoder-decoder models fail to solve\nany problem in the test set, even on the permis-\nsive \u201cPass@80\u201d metric that samples the model 80\ntimes and is scored as correct if any of these candi-\ndates passes. In line with Tay et al. (2023), we sus-\npect that pretraining the model to generate longer\ncontiguous spans is a better-matched objective for\ndownstream tasks like MBPP requiring long coher-\nent generation.\nOur findings on pretraining objective are less\nconclusive, with Prefix LM performing the best on\nWMT and MBPP, while Span Corruption does best\non SQuAD. With this in mind, we select \u201cdecoder-\nonly + prefix LM\u201d for our subsequent experiments,\nas this setup is increasingly standard for LLM train-\ning, and does relatively well (best or second-best)\nDecoder\n[causal attn.]\nPretraining \nCorpus\nAR loss\n1) AR Pretraining\nDecoder\n[bidirectional attn.]\nPretraining \nCorpus\nDiffusion loss\n2) AR2Diff Adaptation\nDecoder\n[bidirectional attn.]\nFine-tuning \nTask Data\nDiffusion loss\n3) Fine-Tuning\nFigure 2: Illustration of our AR2Diff method. 1) Pretrain an AR decoder with causal attention. 2) Continue\npretraining as a diffusion model with bidirectional attention. 3) Fine-tune as a diffusion model on the end task.\nacross all our tasks.\n4.3\nTransfer learning baselines\nWe now turn to testing various transfer learning\nstrategies across model scales. As our core base-\nlines, we pretrain both AR and diffusion models at\nBase (280M), Large (270M), and XL (1.7B) sizes.\nThese all use a decoder-only architecture and pre-\nfix LM objective, and train on the same pretraining\nmixture from the previous section (80% multilin-\ngual web pages and 20% Python code). As before,\nwe pretrain for 1M steps, with batch size 128 and\nsequence length 1024. Note, our diffusion models\nuse bidirectional attention to allow modifying all\nsequence positions in parallel, but are otherwise\narchitecturally identical to their AR counterparts.\nFor the AR baselines, at inference time, we use\ngreedy decoding for SQuAD, following T5, and use\ntemperature sampling for MBPP, following Austin\net al. (2021). For WMT, we use greedy decoding as\nopposed to the more commonly used beam search\nfor a fairer comparison, as we did not investigate\nthe use of beam search for diffusion models; see\nReid et al. (2023) for work in this direction.\nWe then fine-tune each of these models sepa-\nrately for each of our three tasks. Results are shown\nin Table 2, and discussed in section \u00a74.5.\n4.4\nAR2Diff: Adapting from AR to diffusion\nBeyond pure AR and pure diffusion training, we ex-\nplore \u201cAR2Diff\u201d methods for adapting a pretrained\nAR model into a diffusion model later in training.\nFirst, we experiment with simply fine-tuning an\nAR checkpoint directly using our diffusion training\nprocedure\u2014enabling bidirectional attention, and\nusing the SUNDAE diffusion training loss. We\nrefer to this method as AR2Diff0, and use our base-\nline AR model checkpoint as the starting point for\nfine-tuning.\nWe also experiment with pretraining the model\nfor additional steps as a diffusion model before\nfine-tuning, as illustrated in Figure 2. We start with\nour pretrained AR checkpoint, continue pretraining\nfor an additional N steps using diffusion training,\nand then fine-tune (still with diffusion) on each\nevaluation task separately. We refer to this method\nas AR2DiffN.\n4.5\nCore results\nResults comparing AR2Diff to our autoregressive\nand diffusion baselines across model sizes are\nshown in Table 2.\nOn WMT14 En-Fr, the AR baseline performs\nthe best across model sizes.6 Our observed gap\nbetween diffusion and AR is larger than that of\nSavinov et al. (2022), where SUNDAE text dif-\nfusion comes with 1 BLEU point of an AR base-\nline. The difference may be due to our (i) using a\ntransfer learning setting where we pretrain before\nfine-tuning, (ii) not using SUNDAE\u2019s length pre-\ndiction module, (iii) sampling fewer candidates at\ninference time (8 vs. 16).\nInterestingly, while at Base size AR2Diff pro-\nvides no advantage on WMT, at Large and XL sizes\nwe see AR2Diff delivers a significant gain over\nthe pure diffusion baseline, and this gain increases\nwith the length of adaptation. This suggests that\nAR2Diff may be valuable not just as a resource-\nsaving method (leveraging AR checkpoints to avoid\npretraining diffusion models from scratch), but also\nas a means of achieving stronger diffusion models\nthrough mixed-objective training.\nOn SQuAD question answering, our diffu-\nsion baseline outperforms the AR baseline at\nBase and Large sizes (Base: 68.1 \u2192 77.4, Large:\n6We note our Base AR baseline underperforms (32.27\nvs. 37.5) a similar baseline from Raffel et al. (2020), a Base\nsize decoder-only model trained with the same prefix LM\nobjective. This could stem from differences in pretraining data,\nmodel architecture, fine-tuning procedure, and/or inference\nsettings (e.g., our use of greedy decoding).\nWMT14 En-Fr\nSQuAD\nMBPP\nMethod\nSize\n(BLEU)\n(F1)\n(Pass@80 %)\nAutoregressive\nBase\n33.27\n68.11\n5.5\nDiffusion\nBase\n29.83\n77.41\n12.2\nAR2Diff0\nBase\n29.62\n64.77\n1.1\nAR2Diff10,000\nBase\n29.41\n68.12\n4.4\nAR2Diff100,000\nBase\n29.92\n71.87\n7.7\nAutoregressive\nLarge\n34.92\n78.43\n15.5\nDiffusion\nLarge\n29.36\n80.56\n12.2\nAR2Diff0\nLarge\n31.14\n77.82\n3.3\nAR2Diff10,000\nLarge\n31.97\n79.62\n8.8\nAR2Diff100,000\nLarge\n32.20\n80.71\n10.0\nAutoregressive\nXL\n35.48\n84.08\n15.5\nDiffusion\nXL\n29.30\n82.78\n18.8\nAR2Diff0\nXL\n32.36\n80.95\n6.6\nAR2Diff10,000\nXL\n32.39\n80.71\n11.1\nAR2Diff100,000\nXL\n32.55\n83.54\n15.5\nTable 2: Performance of various models across three tasks and three sizes, comparing: (i) an AR baseline, (ii) a\ndiffusion baseline, and (iii) AR2Diff models that adapt the pretrained AR baseline via diffusion training for N steps\nbefore fine-tuning using diffusion, with N \u2208 {0, 10K, 100K}.\n78.4 \u2192 80.6), but underperforms at XL size\n(84.1 \u2192 82.8).7 While adapting to diffusion only\nduring fine-tuning (AR2Diff0) is ineffective, adapt-\ning for N steps before fine-tuning (AR2DiffN) out-\nperforms the AR baseline at most sizes, and im-\nproves monotonically with N.\nOn MBPP code synthesis, diffusion outperforms\nthe AR baseline for two out of three model sizes,\nincluding the largest XL size (15.5 \u2192 18.8). As on\nother tasks, AR2Diff tends to improve with longer\nadaptation before fine-tuning.\n4.6\nAblations\nOur results so far have performed diffusion infer-\nence by running 10 steps (\u201cnum_steps\u201d) of denois-\ning over 8 randomly sampled decoder inputs per\nexample (\u201cnum_samples\u201d). Note, only the output\nwith the highest model score is used for evaluation.\nTable 3 shows the results of varying num_steps \u2208\n{5, 10, 20} and num_samples \u2208 {4, 8, 16}. On the\nMBPP code synthesis task, we find that increas-\ning step and samples boosts performance, in line\nwith Savinov et al. (2022). Increasing denoising\nsteps is particularly helpful (5.5 \u2192 16.7), but at the\ncost of slower inference. On SQuAD the effect of\nthese parameters is more marginal. More generally,\nwe suspect that additional steps and samples may\nbe helpful on long-form text generation tasks like\nMBPP that are relatively underspecified (e.g., ad-\nmitting many correct answers in different styles).\n7As on WMT, these scores are below the results reported\nby Raffel et al. (2020) using a similar baseline (85.4).

For diffusion models, we use\n10 diffusion steps as our base case, matching our\nprimary evaluation setup for the WMT, SQuAD\nand MBPP tasks.\nWe observe an increasing advantage of using dif-\nfusion for inference speedup when the generation\nSQuAD\nMBPP\nMethod\nsteps\nsamples\n(F1)\n(Pass@80 %)\nAutoregressive\n-\n-\n68.11\n5.5\nDiffusion\n5\n8\n77.41\n5.5\nDiffusion\n10\n8\n77.41\n12.2\nDiffusion\n20\n8\n77.72\n16.7\nDiffusion\n10\n4\n77.51\n11.1\nDiffusion\n10\n8\n77.41\n12.2\nDiffusion\n10\n16\n77.13\n13.3\nTable 3: Ablations on diffusion inference hyperparameters num_steps and num_samples.

Figure 3 shows as the decoding sequence\nlength increases from 500 tokens (e.g., MBPP task)\nto 4,000 tokens, the speedup gained by diffusion\n(using 10 steps) increases from 10\u00d7 to 30\u00d7.\nNote that a single AR decoding step (14 ms per\ntoken generated) is still much faster than a single\ndiffusion step (179 ms per denoising step) in our\nimplementation. This is likely due to the diffu-\nsion model\u2019s lacking the key-value caching widely\nused to optimize AR inference. Whether caching\nor other efficiency optimizations can further ex-\ntend the speed gains of diffusion is an interesting\nquestion for future research.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Jiaxin Shi for helpful comments\non an earlier draft.\nReferences\nRohan Anil, Andrew M.

Current image manipulation primarily centers on static ma-\nnipulation, such as replacing specific regions within an image or alter-\ning its overall style. In this paper, we introduce an innovative dynamic\nmanipulation task, subject repositioning. This task involves relocating\na user-specified subject to a desired position while preserving the im-\nage\u2019s fidelity. Our research reveals that the fundamental sub-tasks of\nsubject repositioning, which include filling the void left by the repo-\nsitioned subject, reconstructing obscured portions of the subject and\nblending the subject to be consistent with surrounding areas, can be ef-\nfectively reformulated as a unified, prompt-guided inpainting task. Con-\nsequently, we can employ a single diffusion generative model to address\nthese sub-tasks using various task prompts learned through our pro-\nposed task inversion technique. Additionally, we integrate pre-processing\nand post-processing techniques to further enhance the quality of sub-\nject repositioning.

Results of SEELE on ReS demonstrate its efficacy.\nKeywords: Subject Repositioning \u00b7 Inpainting \u00b7 Completion\n1\nIntroduction\nIn 2023, Google Photos introduced an AI editing feature allowing users to reposi-\ntion subjects within their images [1]. However, a lack of technical documentation\nlimits understanding of this feature. Some researches have touched on aspects of\nit. Iizuka et al. [23] explored object repositioning before the deep learning era, us-\ning user inputs like ground regions and bounding boxes. In the deep learning era,\nfields like scene decomposition [81] and de-occlusion [76] enable manipulation of\nobject positions. This paper addresses general Subject Repositioning (SubRep)\ntask without explicit scene understanding. Our aim is to address SubRep via a\nmeticulously crafted solution, driven by a single diffusion model.\nFrom an academic perspective, this task falls under image manipulation [14,\n15,18,24,66,79,83]. Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have\nfueled interest in this field. These models, including generative adversarial mod-\nels [20], variational autoencoders [32], auto-regressive models [65], and notably,\ndiffusion models [60], demonstrate impressive image manipulation capabilities\nwith expanding model architectures and training datasets [6, 28, 56]. However,\ncurrent image manipulation methods primarily target \"static\" alterations, mod-\nifying specific image regions using cues like natural language, sketches, or lay-\nouts [14,15,79]. Another aspect involves style-transfer tasks, transforming overall\nimage styles such as converting photos into anime pictures or paintings [7,25,66].\nSome techniques extend to video manipulation, dynamically altering style or\nsubjects over time [16,30,70]. In contrast, subject repositioning dynamically re-\nlocates selected subjects within a single image while leaving the rest unchanged.\nThe SubRep task involves multiple stages, including non-generative and gen-\nerative tasks. Existing pre-trained models are effective for non-generative tasks\nlike segmenting subjects [33] and estimating occlusion relationships [54]. Our\nfocus lies on the generative tasks of SubRep, including: i) Subject removal: The\ngenerative model must fill voids left after repositioning without introducing new\nelements. ii) Subject completion: If the repositioned subject is partially obscured,\nthe model must complete it to maintain integrity. iii) Subject harmonization: The\nrepositioned subject should blend with surrounding areas. All these sub-tasks\ndemand unique generative capabilities.\nThe most powerful text-to-image diffusion models [21,49,53,56,58] show po-\ntential promise for SubRep. However, a key challenge is finding suitable text\nprompts, as these models are usually trained with image captions rather than\ntask-specific instructions. The best prompts are often image-dependent and hard\nto generalize, limiting practical use in real-world applications. Translating these\ntask instructions into caption-style prompts for fixed text-to-image diffusion\nmodels is particularly challenging. On the other hand, specialized models ex-\nist for specific aspects (Fig. 1) of SubRep, like local inpainting [13,38,62,75,80],\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n3\nsubject completion [76], and local harmonization [64,69,77]. However, combining\ncomponents from these models can make the SubRep system bulky and less ele-\ngant. Given the shared generative nature of these sub-tasks, our study raises an\nintriguing question: \"Can we achieve all these sub-tasks using a single model?\"\nPreprocessing\nInput Image\nLocated Subject\nUser-specified Subject\nMove Direction\nRemove Prompt\nMoved Image\nOccluded Part\n\u2776: Subject Removal\nManipulation Model\nComplete Prompt\nCompleted Image\n\u2777: Subject Completion\nMasked Occluded Subject\nPostprocessing\nOutput Image\nHarmonize  Prompt \nwith LoRA\nComplete Prompt for \nShadow Generation\n\u2778: Subject Harmonization\nFig. 2:\nThe pipeline of SEELE for SubRep. It includes i) pre-processing: identifying\nthe subject following user-provided conditions, and preserving occlusion relationships\nbetween subjects; ii) manipulation: filling in any gaps left in the image and corrects\nobscured subjects with user-specified incomplete masks; iii) post-processing: addressing\nany disparities between the repositioned subject and its new surroundings. SEELE\naddresses all the generative sub-tasks in SubRep via a single diffusion model.\nTo answer this question, we introduce \"task inversion\", a novel concept that\nlearns latent embeddings as alternative of text conditions to guide diffusion mod-\nels with specific task instructions. The embedding space of text prompts in dif-\nfusion models offers versatility beyond just captions. Employing prompt tuning\nat the task level allows us to learn latent embeddings to guide diffusion models\nbased on task instructions. Task inversion enables diffusion models to adapt to\nvarious tasks by adjusting task-level \"text\" prompts. Unlike textual inversion [17]\nwhich learns image-dependent caption prompts and prompt tuning [35,42] which\nlearns domain adaptation, our method employs task-level instructional prompts\nto approximate optimal text prompts for each image in a specific task, trans-\nforming text-to-image diffusion model into task-to-image model. Our approach\npioneers the systematic use of learned embeddings across various generative sub-\ntasks within a single SD, effectively addressing the complex challenge of SubRep.\nTo formally address the SubRep task, we propose the SEgment-gEnerate-\nand-bLEnd (SEELE) framework. As in Fig. 2, SEELE manages the subject\nrepositioning with a pre-processing, manipulation, post-processing pipeline. i) In\nthe pre-processing stage, SEELE segments the subject based on user-specified\npoints, bounding boxes, or text prompts. With the provided moving direction,\nSEELE relocates the subject while considering occlusion relationships between\nsubjects. ii) In the manipulation stage, SEELE uses a single diffusion model\nguided by learned task prompts to handle subject removal and completion. iii)\nIn the post-processing stage, SEELE harmonizes the repositioned subject to\nblend seamlessly with adjacent regions.\n4\nYikai Wang et al.\nWe\u2019ve curated a dataset named ReS to test subject repositioning algorithms\nin real-world scenarios. We made efforts in covering various scenes and times\nto give a wide range of examples. Particularly, the real-world images for this\ntask demand very exhaustively ground-truth annotation, including the mask\nof the repositioned subject and the moving direction. We annotate the mask\nusing SAM [33] and manual refinement, and estimating the moving direction\nbased on the center point of masks in the paired image. Additionally, we also\nprovide amodal masks for subjects that are partly hidden. This results 100 \u00d7 2\npaired real image, actually diverse enough to support the evaluation of our task,\nas illustrated in Fig. 3b. As far as we know, this is the first dataset designed\nspecifically for subject repositioning. It\u2019s diverse and well-organized, making it\na great benchmark for validating methods for this task.\nContributions. Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2013 We delineate the Subject Repositioning (SubRep) task as a specialized interac-\ntive image manipulation challenge, decomposed into several distinct sub-tasks,\neach of which presents unique challenges and necessitates specific capacities.\n\u2013 We introduce SEgment-gEnerate-and-bLEnd (SEELE) framework, addressing\nmultiple generative tasks with one diffusion model. Not only does it offer an\napplication akin to Google\u2019s magic editor, but it also organizes each subtask\nefficiently using a shared SD backbone. Furthermore, our approach provides\nadditional features beyond the magic editor, including occlusion and perspec-\ntive preservation, as well as local harmonization.\n\u2013 We present task inversion, demonstrating that we can re-formulate the text-\nconditions to represent task instructions. This exploration opens up new pos-\nsibilities for adapting diffusion models to specific tasks.\n\u2013 We curate the ReS dataset, a real-world collection featuring repositioned sub-\njects, serving as a benchmark for evaluating subject repositioning algorithms.\n2\nSubject Repositioning\nSubject repositioning (SubRep) relocates the user-specified subject within an\nimage. This seemingly simple task is actually challenging, requiring coordination\nof multiple sub-tasks and interaction between user and learning models.\nUser inputs. An illustration of the user inputs is shown in Fig. 3a. SubRep\nfollows user intention to identify the subject, move it to the desired location,\ncomplete it, and address disparities. Particularly, the user identifies the interested\nsubject via pointing, bounding box, or text prompts. Then, the user provides\nthe desired repositioning location via dragging or direction. The system further\nrequires the user to indicate the occluded part of the subject for completion, and\nwhether to run postprocessing algorithms for minimizing visual differences.\nReS dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of subject repositioning algorithms,\nwe curated a benchmark dataset called ReS. It includes 100 \u00d7 2 paired images,\neach with dimensions 4032\u00d73024: one image features a repositioned subject while\nthe other elements remain constant. These images were collected from over 20\nindoor and outdoor scenes, featuring subjects from over 50 categories.

The\nmask of visible part and completed subject specified by user are marked as orange.\nsity enables effective simulation of real-world applications, making our dataset\nsuitable for evaluating our SEELE model.\nWe also contribute very detailed annotations to this dataset. Particularly,\nThe masks for the repositioned subjects were initially generated using SAM and\nrefined by multiple experts. Occluded masks were provided for subject com-\npletion. The direction of repositioning was estimated by measuring the dis-\ntance between the center points of the masks in each image pair. For each\npaired image in the dataset, we can assess subject repositioning performance\nfrom one image to the other and in reverse, resulting in double testing ex-\namples. Fig. 3b illustrates the ReS dataset. We release the ReS dataset at\nhttps://github.com/Yikai-Wang/ReS to encourage research in subject repo-\nsitioning.\n3\nSEELE Framework for Subject Repositioning\nTask decomposition. To tackle this task, we introduce the SEgment-gEnerate-\nand-bLEnd (SEELE) framework, shown in Fig. 2. Specifically, SEELE breaks\ndown the task into three stages: preprocessing, manipulation, and post-processing.\nPreprocessing handles non-generative tasks, while manipulation and postpro-\ncessing require generative capabilities. We use a unified diffusion model for all\ngenerative sub-tasks and pre-trained models for non-generative tasks in SEELE.\ni) The preprocessing addresses how to precisely locate the specified subject with\nminimal user input, considering that the subject may be a single object, part of\nan object, or a group of objects identified by the user\u2019s intention; reposition the\nidentified subject to the desired location; and also identify occlusion relation-\nships to maintain geometric consistency. Additionally, adjusting the subject\u2019s\nsize might be necessary to maintain the perspective relationship.\nii) The manipulation stage deals with the main tasks of creating new elements in\nsubject repositioning to enhance the image. In particular, this stage includes the\nsubject removal step, which fills the empty space on the left void of the reposi-\n6\nYikai Wang et al.\ntioned subject. Additionally, the subject completion step involves reconstructing\nany obscured parts to ensure the subject is fully formed.\niii) The postprocessing stage focuses on minimizing visual differences between the\nrepositioned subject and its new surroundings. This involves fixing inconsisten-\ncies in both appearance and geometry, including blending unnatural boundaries,\naligning illumination statistics, and, at times, creating realistic shadows.\nPre-processing. For point and bounding box inputs for identifying subject, we\nutilize SAM [33] for user interaction and employ SAM-HQ [29] to enhance the\nquality of segmenting subjects with intricate structures. To enable text inputs, we\nfollow SeMani [67] to indirectly implement a text-guided SAM mode. Specifically,\nwe first employ SAM to segment the entire image into distinct subjects. Then\nwe identify the most similar one using the mask-adapted CLIP [40].\nAfter identifying the subject, SEELE follows user intention to reposition the\nsubject to the desired location, and masks the original area.\nSEELE handles the potential occlusion between the moved subject and other\nelements in the image. If there are other subjects present at the desired loca-\ntion, SEELE employs the monocular depth estimation algorithm MiDaS [54] to\ndiscern occlusion relationships between subjects. SEELE will then appropriately\nmask the occluded portions of the subject if the user wants to preserve these\nocclusion relationships. MiDaS is also used to estimate the perspective relation-\nships among subjects and resize the subject accordingly to maintain geometric\nconsistency. For subjects with ambiguous boundaries, SEELE incorporates the\nViTMatte matting algorithm [71] for better compositing with surrounding areas.\nAn illustrated comparison of incorporated modules can be found in Fig. 8.\nManipulation. In this stage, SEELE deals with the primary tasks of manipu-\nlating subjects, including subject removal and subject completion, as illustrated\nin Fig. 2. Critically, such two steps can be effectively solved by a single genera-\ntive model, as the masked region of both steps should be filled in to match the\nsurrounding areas. However, these two sub-tasks require different information\nand types of masks. Particularly, for subject removal, a non-semantic inpainting\nis applied uniformly from the unmasked regions, using a typical object-shaped\nmask. This often falsely results in the creation of new, random subjects within\nthe holes. On the other hand, subject completion involves semantic-rich inpaint-\ning and aims to incorporate the majority of the masked region as part of the\nsubject. Critically, to adapt the same diffusion model to the different generation\ndirections needed for the above sub-tasks, we propose the task inversion tech-\nnique in SEELE. This technique guides the diffusion model according to specific\ntask instructions. Thus, with the learned remove-prompt and complete-prompt,\nSEELE tackles these sub-tasks via a single generative model. An illustrated\ncomparison between different task-prompts can be found in Fig. 7a.\nPost-processing. In the final stage, SEELE harmoniously blends the repo-\nsitioned subject with its surroundings by tackling two challenges below. The\nillustrated comparison of post-processing can be found in Fig. 8.\ni) Local harmonization ensures natural appearance in boundary and lighting\nstatistics. SEELE confines this process to the relocated subject to avoid affect-\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n7\ning other image parts. It takes the image and a mask indicating the subject\u2019s\nrepositioning as inputs. However, the stable diffusion model is initially trained\nto generate new concepts within the masked region, conflicting with our goal\nof only ensuring consistency in the masked region and its surroundings. To ad-\ndress this, SEELE adapts the model by learning a harmonize-prompt with LoRA\nadapter [22] to guide masked regions. This can also be integrated into the same\ndiffusion model used in the manipulation stage with our newly proposed design.\nii) Shadow generation aims to create realistic shadows for repositioned subjects,\nenhancing the realism. Generating high-fidelity shadows in high-resolution im-\nages of diverse subjects remains challenging. SEELE uses the diffusion model\nfor shadow generation, addressing two scenarios: 1) If the subject already has\nshadows, we use complete-prompt for shadow completion. 2) For subjects with-\nout shadows, we follow user-intention to locate the desired shadow area. This\ntask then transforms into a local harmonization process for lighting.\n3.1\nTask Inversion\nGenerative sub-tasks in subject repositioning follows the inputs and outputs of\ngeneral inpainting task but with specific target:\nSubject removal fills the void in original area without creating new subjects;\nSubject completion completes the repositioned subject within masked region;\nSubject harmonization blends subject without inducing new elements.\nThese requirements lead to different generation paths. However, our goal is to\nadapt frozen text-to-image diffusion inpainting models for all of these sub-tasks.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce task inversion, training prompts to\nguide the diffusion model while keeping the backbone fixed. Instead of tradi-\ntional text prompts, we utilize the adaptable representations acting as instruc-\ntion prompts, such as \u201ccomplete the subject\u201d. The challenge lies in the domain\ngap where text-to-image diffusion model is not trained from instruction prompts.\nOur experiments show that compared with unconditional generation and sim-\nple semantic and instructional text prompt-guided generation, the learned task\nprompts significantly improves the inpainting model in standard inpainting and\noutpainting tasks (see Tab. 2), as well as sub-tasks of subject repositioning\n(see Tab. 1). Thus our learned task prompts can be used as an alternative of\nimage-dependent text prompt for subject repositioning to minimize user effort.\nFurthermore, task inversion allows the integration of different generative sub-\ntasks for subject repositioning using stable diffusion. This integration avoids\nthe need for introducing new generative models or adding extensive modules or\nparameters, highlighting the plug-and-play nature of task inversion.\nTask inversion adheres to the original training objectives of diffusion models.\nSpecifically, denote the training image as x, the local mask as m, the learnable\ntask prompt as z. Our objective is\nL := E\u03b5\u223cN(0,1),t\u223cU(0,1)[\u2225\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b8([xt, m, x \u2299 (1 \u2212 m)], t, z\u22252\nF],\n(1)\nwhere \u03b5 is the random noise; \u03b5\u03b8 is the diffusion model, t is the normalized noise-\nlevel; xt is the noised image, \u2299 is element-wise multiplication; and \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225F is the\n8\nYikai Wang et al.\nFrobenius norm.

Task inversion\ndoes not require text inputs, addresses different objectives, and serves different tasks,\nthus differing from other approaches. (b) We generate masks to represent particular\ntasks to train task inversion, addressing different tasks with a single diffusion model.\nOur task inversion is a distinctive approach, influenced by various existing\nworks but with clear differences. The instruction prompt mentioned for our task\ninversion goes beyond the training data\u2019s scope, where the text describes the\ncontent of image, potentially affecting the desired generation results in practice.\nRecent advancements in textual inversion [17] emphasize the potential to com-\nprehend user-specified concepts within the embedding space. In contrast, prompt\ntuning [35,42] enhances adaptation to specific domains by introducing learnable\ntokens to the inputs. Unlike textual inversion, which trains a few tokens for visual\nunderstanding, our task inversion trains the whole latent to provide task instruc-\ntion. Our task inversion differs prompt-tuning in that: prompt-tuning adds new\ntokens, while our approach replaces text condition inputs. We don\u2019t depend on\ntext inputs to guide the diffusion model. See Fig. 4a for the distinction.\n3.2\nLearning task inversion\nExisting inpainting model is trained with randomly generated masks to general-\nize in diverse scenarios. In contrast, task inversion involves creating task-specific\nmasks during training, allowing the model to learn specialized task prompts.\ni) Generating masks for subject removal: In subject repositioning, the mask for\nthe left void mirrors the subject\u2019s shape, but our goal isn\u2019t to generate the subject\nwithin the mask. To create training data for this scenario, for each image, we\nrandomly choose a subject and its mask. Next, we move the mask, as shown\nby the girl\u2019s mask in the center of Fig. 4b. This results in an image where the\nmasked region includes random portions unrelated to the mask\u2019s shape. This\nserves as the target for subject removal, with the mask indicating the original\nsubject location and the ground-truth is background areas.\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n9\nInput\nSEELE\nInput\nSEELE\nInput\nSEELE\nInput\nSEELE\nFig. 5:\nSubject repositioning on 10242 images. SEELE works well on diverse sce-\nnarios, enabling flexible repositioning subject and direction, and achieves high-fidelity\nrepositioned images. Larger version is in the appendix.\nii) Generating masks for subject completion: In this phase, SEELE addresses\nscenarios where the subject is partially obscured, with the goal of effectively\ncompleting the subject. To integrate this prior information into the task prompt,\nwe generate training data as follows: for each image, we randomly select a sub-\nject and extract its mask. Then, we randomly choose a continuous portion of\nthe mask as the input mask. Since user-specified masks are typically imprecise,\nwe introduce random dilation to include adjacent regions within the mask. As\nillustrated by the umbrella mask on the right side of Fig. 4b, such a mask serves\nas an estimate for the mask used in subject completion.\niii) Learning subject harmonization. In SEELE, we achieve subject harmonization\nby altering the target of diffusion model. To this end, we take as input the\ninharmonious image and take as output the harmonious image. Additionally, we\nreplace the unmasked region condition with original inharmonious image. Task\nprompt mainly influences the cross-attention layers. To adapt the self-attention\nin the diffusion model to preserve the content of masked region while harmonizing\nappearance, we introduce LoRA adapters [22]. Our training objective is:\nL := E\u03b5\u223cN(0,1),t\u223cU(0,1)[\u2225\u03b5 + x \u2212 x\u2217 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b8([xt, m, x], t, z\u22252\nF],\n(2)\nwhere x\u2217 represents the target harmonized image, and x is the input inharmo-\nnious image. This allows the diffusion model to gradually harmonize the image\nduring denoising. While we modify the training objective, the generation pro-\ncess remains unchanged. This allows us to still utilize the pre-trained stable\ndiffusion model with the learned harmonize-prompt and LoRA parameters, and\nseamlessly integrate with other modules. See appendix for details.\n4\nExperimental Results and Analysis\nExamples of subject repositioning. We present subject repositioning re-\nsults on real-world 10242 images using SEELE in Fig. 5.

We resize images to 512 pixels minimum for compatibility with stan-\ndard inpainting algorithms.

When\nthe moved subject overlaps with the left void, SD fills the void by extending the\nsubject. In contrast, SEELE avoids the influence of the subject, as in the top\nrow of Fig. 6. If the mask isn\u2019t precise, SEELE works better than other meth-\nods by reducing the impact of unclear edges and smoothing the area, as in the\nfourth row. SEELE excels in subject completion than typical inpainting algo-\nrithms, as in the second-to-last row. Note that SEELE can be enhanced through\nthe post-processing stage.\nQuantitative comparison and user-study. We use Learned Perceptual Im-\nage Patch Similarity (LPIPS) as quantitative metric and conduct user-study to\nevaluate user preference from i) quality: the fidelity of the results; ii) visual-\nconsistency (Consist.): the consistency with surrounding area. Our user study\non all ReS dataset involves 100 anonymous surveys, reporting the ratio of top-1\npreferred option. Results are in Tab. 1. Compared with other methods, SEELE\ndemonstrates significant enhancements in the quality of manipulated images\nacross all metrics. Particularly for the SDlora, i) our construction of training\nmask requires object-level ground-truth segmentation in the training dataset,\nwhile public dataset do not have large scale annotated dataset (compared with\nthe LAION dataset [59] used by SD which contains 5B training data.) ii) when\nthe training dataset is limited, the task inversion enjoys superior performance\nwhile fine-tuning technique leads to over-fitting and cause worse performance.\n12\nYikai Wang et al.\nSubject Removal\nRemove-Prompt\nComplete-Prompt\nRemove-Prompt\nComplete-Prompt\nSubject Completion\n(a)\nOpposite task prompts cause bad results.\nZoom in to find the fly in 2rd-row.\nInharmonious \nImage\nInharmonious \nRegion\nSEELE\nSEELE w/o \nLoRA\nSEELE w/o \nharmonize-prompt\n(b)\nAblation of local harmonization.\nFig. 7: Ablation of different task prompts.

To further validate the pro-\nposed task-inversion, we conduct experiments on standard inpainting task on\nPlaces2 [82] and outpainting task on Flickr-Scenery [10], following the standard\ntraining and evaluation principles. Quantitative results is in Tab. 2, showcasing\nthe superiority of the proposed task-inversion on both inpainting and outpainting\ntasks. We provide details and qualitative results in the appendix.\nInfluence of different task prompts. We train different task prompts to\nguide different generation direction. Using wrong prompts for tasks can make the\nmodel give bad results. We tested this by comparing results from different learned\ntask prompts. As in Fig. 7a, using a wrong prompt can change the outcome. For\nsubject removal, remove-prompt can correctly generate with background flowers,\nwhile complete-prompt wrongly try to add a fly instead of flowers. For subject\ncompletion example of trying to add a bird\u2019s head, remove-prompt only added\nwater, but the complete-prompt added the bird\u2019s head properly. This validate\nthe different generation direction learned by our task prompt.\nAblation of Local Harmonization. To tackle the local harmonization sub-\ntask, we learn the harmony-prompt along with the LoRA parameters. To show\nthe efficacy of each module, we conduct an qualitative ablation study in Fig. 7b.\nNaturally, if we disable the LoRA parameters, as we use the inharmonious image\nas unmasked image condition for the stable diffusion model, the model tends to\ncopy the image without significant modification. If we only use LoRA parameter,\nit works like the unconditional diffusion model to perform local harmonization,\nbut usually performs over- or under- harmonization. Such a manner works to\nsome extent, but can be enhanced with the learned harmony-prompt.\nSEELE w/ X. We assess the effectiveness of various components within SEELE\nduring both pre-processing and post-processing phases. We conduct a qualitative\ncomparison of SEELE\u2019s results with and without the utilization of these com-\nponents, as in Fig. 8, while a detailed analysis of is provided in the appendix.\nFailure analysis.

See detailed analysis in the appendix.\nthe success of each included module. Particularly, the core challenges of subject\nrepositioning include appearance, geometry, and semantic inconsistency issues.\ni) SEELE addresses the appearance issue, which encompasses the absence of sub-\njects and shadows, as well as unnatural shadows and boundaries. This is achieved\nthrough the innovative methods of subject completion, shadow generation, and\nlocal harmonization. ii) To tackle the geometry issue, SEELE employs a depth\nestimation approach that maintains occlusion relationships and perspective ac-\ncuracy. iii) For resolving semantic inconsistency, SEELE employs techniques for\nsubject removal and completion. The failure of each specific module may lead to\nthe corresponding inconsistency, and resulting in a less-fidelity image.\nLimitations. One significant limitation of SEELE is that when the system per-\nforms sub-optimally, manual user intervention becomes necessary to enhance the\nresults. For instance, in cases where segmentation fails, users are required to man-\nually correct the segment mask. Similarly, when the subject is occluded, users\nmust provide a mask of potential regions to complete the subject. The former\nissue could potentially be mitigated through improvements in the segmentation\nmodel. However, the latter challenge necessitates the development of a novel\nmodel to address the problem of open-vocabulary amodal mask generation [76].\nCurrently, there lack available foundation models to support open-vocabulary\namodal mask generation. These are potential avenues for future research.\n14\nYikai Wang et al.\n5\nRelated Works\nImage and video manipulation aims to manipulate images and videos in ac-\ncordance with user-specified guidance. Among these guidance, natural language\nguidance, as presented in previous studies [7,12,14,15,25,27,36,37,48,66,68,79],\nstands out as particularly appealing due to its adaptability and user-friendliness.\nSome research efforts have also explored the use of visual conditions, which can\nbe conceptualized as image-to-image translation tasks. These conditions encom-\npass sketch-based [8,9,26,31,55,73,74], label-based [34,51,55,84], line-based [39],\nand layout-based [44] conditions. In contrast to image manipulation, video ma-\nnipulation [16, 30, 70] introduces the additional challenge of ensuring temporal\nconsistency across different frames, necessitating the development of novel tem-\nporal architectures [3] . Image manipulation primarily revolves around modifying\nstatic images, whereas video manipulation deals with dynamic scenes in which\nmultiple subjects are in motion. In contrast, our paper focuses on subject repo-\nsitioning, relocating one subject while the rest of the image remains unchanged.\nTextual inversion [17] is designed to personalize text-to-image diffusion mod-\nels according to user-specified concepts. It learns new concepts within the em-\nbedding space of text conditions while freezing other modules. Null-text inver-\nsion [46] learns distinct embeddings at different noise levels to enhance capacity.\nSome fine-tuning [57] or adaptation [47, 78] techniques inject visual conditions\ninto text-to-image diffusion models. While these approaches concentrate on im-\nage patterns, SEELE focuses on the task instruction to guide diffusion models.\nPrompt tuning [35,42,43] entails training a model to learn specific tokens as\nadditional inputs to transformer models, thereby enabling model adaptation to a\nspecific domain without fine-tuning the model. This technique been widely used\nin vision-language models [19,52,72]. This inspired us to adapt the text-to-image\ninto task-to-image diffusion model by replacing the text conditions.\nImage composition [50] is the process of combining a foreground and back-\nground to create a high-quality image. Due to differences in the characteris-\ntics of foreground and background elements, inconsistencies can arise in terms\nof appearance, geometry, or semantics. Appearance inconsistencies encompass\nunnatural boundaries and lighting disparities. Segmentation [33], matting [69],\nand blending [77] algorithms can be employed to address boundary concerns,\nwhile image harmonization [64] techniques can mitigate lighting discrepancies.\nGeometry inconsistencies include occlusion and disproportionate scaling, neces-\nsitating object completion [76] and object placement [63] methods, respectively.\nSemantic inconsistencies pertain to unnatural interactions between subjects and\nbackgrounds. While each aspect of image composition has its specific focus, the\noverarching goal is to produce a high-fidelity image. SEELE enhances harmo-\nnization capabilities within a single generative model.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce an innovative task known as subject repositioning,\nwhich involves manipulating an input image to reposition one of its subjects\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n15\nto a desired location while preserving the image\u2019s fidelity. To tackle subject\nrepositioning, we present SEELE, a framework that leverages a single diffusion\nmodel to address the generative sub-tasks through our proposed task inversion\ntechnique. This includes tasks such as subject removal, subject completion, and\nsubject harmonization. To evaluate the effectiveness of subject repositioning, we\nhave curated a real-world dataset called ReS. Our experiments on ReS demon-\nstrate the proficiency of SEELE.\nReferences\n1. Google\u2019s magic editor. https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-\nmagic-editor-pixel-io-2023/ 2\n2.

Then we provide a\nlarger visualization of Fig. 6 in our paper in Fig. 11. Furthermore, we present\nadditional examples of subject repositioning using SEELE and its competitors,\nas showcased in the proposed ReS dataset, within Fig. 12.\n8\nExperimental Setting\nSEELE is built upon the text-guided inpainting model fine-tuned from SD 2.0-\nbase, employing the task inversion technique to learn each task prompt with 50\nlearnable tokens, initialized with text descriptions from the task instructions. For\neach task, we utilize the AdamW optimizer [45] with a learning rate of 8.0e \u2212 5,\nweight decay of 0.01, and a batch size of 32. Training is conducted on two A6000\nGPUs over 9,000 steps, selecting the best checkpoints based on the held-out\nvalidation set.\nWhen addressing subject moving and completion, we employ the MSCOCO\ndataset [41], which provides object masks. For image harmonization, the iHar-\nmony4 dataset [11] is utilized, offering unharmonized-harmonized image pairs\nalong with subject-to-harmonize masks. MSCOCO comprises 80k training im-\nages and 40k testing images, while iHarmony4 includes 65k training images and\n7k testing images. This diversity ensures robustness in training task prompts,\nguarding against overfitting on specific images.\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n21\nShadow \ngeneration\nSEELE w/ X\nDepth estimation \nfor occlusion\nDepth estimation \nfor perspective\nMatting\nInput Image\nSEELE w/o X\nSEELE w/ X\nSEELE w/o X\nInput Image\nX\nLocal\nharmonization\nFig. 9: Ablation of using components X in SEELE.\nCost analysis. The core component of SEELE is the pre-trained stable dif-\nfusion inpainting model, boasting 865.93 million parameters within its UNet\nbackbone. To tailor this stable diffusion model for subject repositioning, we in-\ncorporate three distinct task prompts, each sized at 50\u00d71024 and has 0.5 million\ntrainable parameters. For the local harmonization task, we introduce the LoRA\nadapter, which encompasses 5.12 million trainable parameters. It\u2019s worth noting\nthat these newly added parameters are lightweight and introduce no additional\ninference latency when compared to the stable diffusion backbone.\n9\nAnalysis of X in SEELE\nHere we provide the analysis of each component used in SEELE.\ni) Depth estimation for occlusion becomes crucial when users wish to move\na subject from the foreground to the background. It helps estimate and correct\nthe occluded parts, ensuring that the repositioned subject blends seamlessly into\nthe scene. As illustrated in the first row of Fig. 9, this depth estimation plays a\npivotal role in repositioning objects like the tower behind leaves or people be-\nhind a car. Neglecting the occlusion relationship can result in unnatural-looking\nrepositioned subjects and a significant loss of image fidelity.\n22\nYikai Wang et al.\nii) Depth estimation for perspective comes into play when users want to resize\nthe subject proportionally during repositioning. If this aspect is overlooked, the\nsubject\u2019s size remains fixed, which may contradict user expectations.\niii) Matting primarily addresses issues arising from imprecise masks provided\nby SAM, particularly when dealing with subjects with ambiguous boundaries.\nPrecise masking is crucial because inaccuracies can lead to information leaking\nin the final output. For example, in Fig. 9, imprecise masking might encourage\nthe gaps to generate unnatural dog fur.\niv) Shadow generation is handled by reusing the generative model within\nSEELE. In cases where a subject includes shadows, such as the left part in Fig. 9,\nwe approach it as a subject completion task. The shadow itself becomes the sub-\nject, and we employ a learned complete-prompt to guide the diffusion model.\nConversely, when a subject lacks shadows, we can transform it into a local har-\nmonization task by utilizing SEELE\u2019s harmonization model to generate shadows.\nv) Local harmonization addresses the challenge of appearance inconsistency.\nWhen the illumination statistics change after subject repositioning, it\u2019s essential\nto adjust the subject\u2019s appearance while preserving its texture. As depicted\nin Fig. 9, SEELE excels at this local harmonization task, ensuring seamless\nintegration into the new environment.\n10\nStandard Image Inpainting and Outpainting\nImage inpainting. The proposed task-inversion approach not only specializes\nthe inpainting model for specific tasks but also enhances its standard inpainting\ncapabilities. We substantiate this claim through experiments conducted on the\nPlaces2 dataset [82], where we train SEELE using standard inpainting prompts\nand compare its performance with other inpainting algorithms. The results are\npresented in Tab. 2(a) in our paper. Additionally, we provide visual represen-\ntations of the results in Fig. 13, demonstrating SEELE\u2019s advantage in reducing\nhallucinatory artifacts.\nImage outpainting. Another commonly used manipulation task involves ex-\ntending the image beyond its original content. This approach shares a similar\nconcept with subject completion, but it takes a more holistic perspective by\nenhancing the entire image. We have also conducted experiments on the out-\npainting task and demonstrated the effectiveness of task inversion. Our experi-\nments were carried out using the Flickr-Scenery dataset [10], and the results are\ncompared with stable diffusion in Tab. 2(b) in our paper. The results indicate\nthe superiority of task inversion employed in SEELE. Furthermore, we provide\nvisual examples for qualitative assessment in Fig. 14.\n11\nNecessarity of Using Different Datasets to Train\nSEELE\nOur training of the SEELE model utilized only two datasets: COCO, which\nprovides ground-truth object segmentation masks, and iHarmony4, which offers\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n23\npaired images for local harmonization tasks. These datasets, chosen for their\npublic availability, aptly fulfill the varying requirements of different generative\nsub-tasks. Our training approach, which encompasses both subject movement\nand completion, employs a unified task inversion technique. Given that local\nharmonization focuses on not introducing new details in masked areas, we have\nmodified the diffusion model to integrate the characteristics of the masked region,\nensuring it aligns with the task\u2019s specific needs.\n12\nIntegrating LoRA\nWhen the LoRA adapter is trained, we load them along with the frozen stable\ndiffusion model. As LoRA is implemented as additive layers with the original\nlayers. For example, suppose for a particular layer f with input xi and out-\nput xi+1. The original stable diffusion performs xi+1 = f(xi), while LoRA is\ntrained to perform xi+1 = f(xi) + LoRA(xi) and only learn LoRA(\u00b7) while\nfreezing f(\u00b7). Then we could introduce a scale hyper-parameter for a trained\nmodel xi+1 = f(xi) + cLoRA(xi) When SEELE performs the sub-tasks in ma-\nnipulation process, we set the lora scale as c = 0 to preserve the original outputs\nof stable diffusion. While in the local harmonization process, we set the lora\nscale as c = 1 to perform local harmonization. In this regard, we could use the\nsame stable diffusion backbone and perform different sub-tasks using different\nsub-task prompts (and LoRA parameters).\n13\nWeb User Interface (Web-UI)\nIn this section, we provide an overview of SEELE\u2019s front-end user interface (UI),\nwhich users interact with when utilizing SEELE. This web-based UI has been\ndesigned based on Gradio [2] and is depicted in Fig. 15.\n14\nPotential negative impact\nOur proposed SEELE system aims to address the issue of subject repositioning\nwithin single images and will be responsive to user intentions. However, there\nis a risk that it could be misused to create prank images with malicious intent\ntowards individuals, entities, or objects. To mitigate this, we plan to prominently\nfeature a logo on images generated by our SEELE system to clearly indicate their\nartificial nature.\n24\nYikai Wang et al.\nInput\nSEELE\nInput\nSEELE\nFig. 10: SEELE on images of size 1024 \u00d7 1024.\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n25\nInput\nTarget\nSD\nSEELE\nSEELE(ZITS++)\nSEELE(MAEFAR)\nSEELE(LAMA)\nSEELE(MAT)\nFig. 11: Qualitative comparison for subject repositioning in ReS.\n26\nYikai Wang et al.\nInput\nTarget\nSD\nSEELE\nSEELE(ZITS++)\nSEELE(MAEFAR)\nSEELE(LAMA)\nSEELE(MAT)\nFig. 12: More qualitative comparison for subject repositioning in ReS.\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n27\nMasked image\nCo-Mod\nMAT\nSD (no prompt)\nSD (background)\nSEELE\nFig. 13: Qualitative comparison for inpainting.\n28\nYikai Wang et al.\nSD\nSEELE\nSD\nSEELE \nSD\nSEELE\nSD\nSEELE\nFig. 14: Qualitative comparison for outpainting.\nRepositioning the Subject within Image\n29\nFig. 15: Web-UI for SEELE.\n"

As an initial step, the\nOpen Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) reproduced Ope-\nnAI\u2019s Whisper using publicly available data and open-source\ntoolkits. With the aim of reproducing Whisper, the previous\nOWSM v1 through v3 models were still based on Transformer,\nwhich might lead to inferior performance compared to other\nstate-of-the-art speech encoders. In this work, we aim to im-\nprove the performance and ef\ufb01ciency of OWSM without extra\ntraining data. We present E-Branchformer based OWSM v3.1\nmodels at two scales, i.e., 100M and 1B. The 1B model is the\nlargest E-Branchformer based speech model that has been made\npublicly available. It outperforms the previous OWSM v3 in a\nvast majority of evaluation benchmarks, while demonstrating\nup to 25% faster inference speed. We publicly release the data\npreparation scripts, pre-trained models and training logs.1\nIndex Terms: speech foundation models, speech recognition,\nspeech translation, branchformer\n1. Introduction\nLarge-scale speech foundation models have gained popularity\nin recent years. Owing to the scaling up of model and data\nsizes as well as the knowledge sharing across languages and\ntasks, these massively multilingual multitask models achieve\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various speech process-\ning benchmarks [1\u20133].\nOpenAI\u2019s Whisper [1] is one of the\nmost widely used speech foundation models, which releases\npre-trained models at \ufb01ve scales ranging from 39M to 1.5B.\nDespite its strong performance, the full development pipeline\nsuch as the training data sources and model learning dynamics\nis unavailable. The absence of access to these important train-\ning details can lead to issues like data leakage, fairness and bias,\nwhich have attracted an increasing attention in the era of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). To promote transparency and open\nscience, recent studies have advocated for open-source repro-\nduction of LLMs [4\u20136], self-supervised speech models [7, 8],\nand Whisper-style speech models [9].\nThe Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) [9] re-\nproduces Whisper-style training using a diverse combination\nof publicly available datasets and the open-source toolkit ESP-\nnet [10]. It supports multilingual automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), any-to-any speech translation (ST), language identi\ufb01ca-\ntion (LID) and utterance-level alignment. It also publicly re-\nleases all scripts, pre-trained model weights and training logs.\nAs an initial step towards fully open speech foundation mod-\nels, the three versions presented in [9], OWSM v1, v2 and v3,\n1https://www.wavlab.org/activities/2024/owsm/\nstill utilize the standard Transformer [11] architecture, which\naims to match OpenAI\u2019s Whisper as much as possible. Yet, it\ncan lead to sub-optimal performance compared to other SOTA\nencoders like Conformer [12] and Branchformer [13].\nIn this work, we aim to improve the performance and ef-\n\ufb01ciency of the previous OWSM v3 model without additional\ntraining data. Speci\ufb01cally, we use E-Branchformer [14] as the\nencoder to enhance the speech modeling capability. We present\nnew OWSM models at two scales named \u201cOWSM v3.1 base\u201d\nand \u201cOWSM v3.1 medium\u201d, with 100M and 1B parameters,\nrespectively. To stabilize and accelerate the training of large\nE-Branchformer models, we propose a novel piecewise linear\nlearning rate schedule and adopt FlashAttention [15] during\ntraining. Results on extensive benchmarks show that OWSM\nv3.1 outperforms the previous OWSM v3 in 8 out of 9 English\nASR, 10 out of 11 multilingual ASR, 13 out of 19 ST, and 3 out\nof 4 SLUE-PERB [16] test sets. Moreover, our OWSM v3.1\nis 16% to 25% faster during inference on the CoVoST-2 ST\nbenchmark, thanks to the shallower decoder. OWSM v3.1 base\nand medium also have faster inference speeds than Whisper\nbase and medium, respectively. Pursuing the same open sci-\nence spirit [9], we publicly release the latest data preparation\nscripts, pre-trained models and training logs.\n2. OWSM v3.1\n2.1. Network architecture\nWhisper [1] and OWSM v3 [9] both utilize the standard Trans-\nformer encoder-decoder architecture [11]. However, recent ad-\nvancements in speech encoders such as Conformer [12] and\nBranchformer [13, 14] have greatly improved the performance\nin various speech processing tasks [17, 18]. It is thus natural\nand promising to explore such advanced architectures in large-\nscale speech foundation models. In this work, we employ E-\nBranchformer [14] as the encoder and demonstrate its effective-\nness at a scale of 1B parameters. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the largest E-Branchformer based speech model that has\nbeen made publicly available.\nE-Branchformer is an enhanced Branchformer [13] and has\nshown SOTA performance across a wide variety of tasks [18].\nE-Branchformer utilizes parallel branches to capture local and\nglobal contextual information in a speech feature sequence and\nmerges them with convolutions. In Whisper-style training, the\ninput audio has a \ufb01xed length of 30s, so we simply adopt the\nsinusoidal absolute positional embedding instead of the relative\npositional embedding of Conformer.\nTable 1 summarizes the network architectures. Our OWSM\nv3.1 mostly follows the design of OWSM v3, except that the\nencoder is switched to E-Branchformer. We also modify the\nhidden size and number of layers to adjust the model size.

Despite being\nslightly larger than OWSM v3 and Whisper at the same scale\n(base or medium), our new OWSM v3.1 models have faster in-\nference speeds as reported in Section 3.3 and Table 4, mainly\ndue to the smaller decoder. We also note that OWSM employs\na joint CTC loss during training which adds a separate linear\nprojection layer to the model (19M parameters in base and 51M\nparameters in medium). This CTC layer is usually not used at\ninference time and can thus be discarded, which reduces the\noverall model size by 19% and 5% for base and medium mod-\nels, respectively.\n2.2. Data preparation\nThe training data format of our OWSM v3.1 models is identical\nto that of OWSM v3 [9], which uni\ufb01es multiple speech process-\ning tasks into a squence-to-sequence framework. This multitask\ndata format is adapted from the original Whisper [1] by extend-\ning speech translation to any language directions. We guide the\nreaders to OWSM [9] for full details.\nTo fairly compare the performance, we do not use extra\ndata when training OWSM v3.1. We reuse the data prepara-\ntion scripts that are publicly available in ESPnet.2 Additionally,\nwe perform the following preprocessing operations to make the\ntext transcripts more consistent:\n\u2022 We exclude WSJ from the training data; it has a different\nspeaking and annotation style, where the punctuation is ex-\nplicitly uttered and annotated as a word.\n\u2022 We normalize a few datasets which provide all upper case\ntranscripts into lower case. Other data remains unchanged.\n\u2022 We merge two language codes \u201ccmn\u201d and \u201czho\u201d into a single\ncode \u201czho\u201d.\nTable 1 shows the overall statistics of our training data. It\nis almost the same as that used in OWSM v3 [9]. Only a very\nsmall amount of data is modi\ufb01ed due to the above-mentioned\npreprocessing.\nHere is a full list of datasets used to train\nour OWSM v3.1 models: AISHELL-1 [19], CoVoST2 [20],\nGigaSpeech [21], LibriSpeech [22], MuST-C [23], SPGIS-\npeech [24], TEDLIUM3 [25], GigaST [26], Multilingual Lib-\nriSpeech (MLS) [27], WenetSpeech [28], AIDATATANG [29],\nAMI [30], Babel [31], Common Voice [32], Fisher (Switch-\nboard) [33], Fisher Callhome Spanish [34], FLEURS [35],\nGooglei18n3, KsponSpeech [36], MagicData [37], Reazon-\nSpeech [38], Russian Open STT [39], VCTK [40], Vox-\nForge [41], and VoxPopuli [42].\n2https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master\n/egs2/owsm_v3/s2t1\n3Resources 32, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44, 52, 53, 54, 61, 63, 64, 65,\n66, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, and 86 from openslr.\norg.\nTable 3: WER/CER % (\u2193) of multilingual ASR using greedy search.

Training con\ufb01guration\nFollowing the previous OWSM models [9], our OWSM v3.1\nis implemented in ESPnet2 [10] with PyTorch [43]. The de-\ntailed training hyperparameters are presented in Table 1. We\nemploy distributed data parallel and mixed precision training.\nWe also leverage FlashAttention [15] to improve the training\nef\ufb01ciency. With FlashAttention, the batch size per GPU can\nbe doubled (2 to 4 samples), which greatly reduces the training\ncost. OWSM v3.1 base and medium are trained with 16 and 64\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB), respectively. Both models are\ntrained for approximately 3 entire passes of the 180K hours of\ndata. The training takes approximately 6 and 16 days for base\nand medium, respectively. Different from the previous OWSM\nv3 which is \ufb01ne-tuned from v2, our new OWSM v3.1 models\nare trained from scratch, which has fewer total updates.\nPrior studies [14, 18] \ufb01nd that E-Branchformer converges\nmore stably than Conformer. However, we \ufb01nd it very dif\ufb01cult\nto train 1B E-Branchformer based models on massively mul-\ntilingual, multitask, and long-form data.4 This large-scale ex-\nperiment requires a very small learning rate at the beginning of\ntraining, otherwise the loss will quickly stop decreasing. If we\nadopt the commonly used linear warmup learning rate schedule,\nwe have to greatly reduce the peak learning rate or increase the\nwarmup steps, both leading to inferior performance according\nto our preliminary explorations. To alleviate this issue, we pro-\npose a piecewise linear warmup learning rate schedule which\nincreases the learning rate slowly at the beginning and quickly\nlater during warmup. Speci\ufb01cally, the learning rate is linearly\nincreased to a very small value (e.g., 5e-5) in the \ufb01rst 30K\nsteps and then linearly increased to the desired peak learning\nrate in the second 30K steps. After warmup, it is decreased\nexponentially in the same way as the vanilla version. The pro-\nposed piecewise linear schedule enables successful training of\nour OWSM v3.1.\n3. Experiments\nIn this section, we compare our OWSM v3.1 models against the\nprevious v3 version in a wide range of tasks and benchmarks\nunder the same setup. We show that OWSM v3.1 outperforms\nOWSM v3 in most of these benchmarks. We also include the\n4Based on our experience, this is mainly due to the 30s long-form\ndata format. Even very small models have a hard time converging re-\ngardless of the architecture (encoder-decoder or CTC only).\nresults of Whisper models for reference, but we note that the\ncomparison might be unfair due to completely different training\ndata.\n3.1. English speech recognition\nTable 2 shows English ASR results on standard benchmarks\nprepared in ESPnet. We follow [9] to run inference with greedy\nsearch and apply the Whisper text normalizer before scoring.\nBy comparing models at the same scale (base or medium), we\nhave the following observations: (1) Our OWSM v3.1 model\noutperforms the previous OWSM v3 model in 8 out of 9 test\nsets at the medium scale. The improvement is especially large\nin Common Voice, FLEURS, LibriSpeech, Switchboard, Vox-\nPopuli and WSJ.5 This veri\ufb01es the effectiveness of our E-\nBranchformer encoder. (2) At the medium scale, OWSM v3.1\neven outperforms Whisper in LibriSpeech and Switchboard. At\nthe base scale, OWSM v3.1 also achieves lower WERs in those\nsets as well as Common Voice. This demonstrates the compet-\nitive performance of OWSM models although they are trained\non far less data compared to Whisper (73K vs 438K hours).\n3.2. Multilingual speech recognition\nTable 3 presents multilingual ASR results. Again, we follow [9]\nto compare different models in the same setup. We employ\ngreedy decoding and apply the Whisper text normalizer before\ncalculating WER or CER. We observe that our OWSM v3.1\nmedium model outperforms OWSM v3 in 10 out of 11 test sets\nacross various languages usually by a large margin. Speci\ufb01-\ncally, the average error rate is reduced from 18.8% to 15.2%.\nThis demonstrates the superior performance of OWSM v3.1 in\ndiverse languages.\nCompared to Whisper, OWSM v3.1 still falls behind in\nmany European languages due to limited training data. In con-\ntrast, when there is a suf\ufb01cient amount of data (e.g., Chinese and\nJapanese), OWSM v3.1 achieves strong performance and out-\nperforms Whisper. This reveals the importance of training data\nquantity. In the future, we plan to include more data from other\npublic sources like YODAS [44] to further improve OWSM.\n5As discussed in [9], the WSJ training data is used by OWSM v3, but\nits transcripts are fully uppercased. The model might treat it as another\nlow-resouce language, which leads to poor results. In v3.1, we exclude\nWSJ during training and achieve a signi\ufb01cantly lower WER.\nTable 4: BLEU % (\u2191) of speech translation on CoVoST-2 test sets using greedy search. Whisper supports X-to-English translation,\nwhereas OWSM models support more directions. For English-to-X, we use all 15 directions available in CoVoST-2. For X-to-English,\nwe only use four directions where OWSM has at least 100 hours of training data. Training data sizes (in hours) and the average\ndecoding time for each direction are also shown. Bold text is the best result. Underlined text means our OWSM v3.1 outperforms\nOWSM v3.\nSource\nTarget\nWhisper\nOWSM v3\nOWSM v3.1 (ours)\ndata\nbase\nsmall\nmedium\ndata\nmedium\ndata\nbase\nmedium\nGerman\nEnglish\n4.3K\n11.4\n25.0\n33.6\n0.2K\n16.2\n0.2K\n7.3\n17.1\nSpanish\n6.7K\n19.2\n32.8\n39.7\n0.1K\n20.5\n0.1K\n10.0\n22.3\nFrench\n4.5K\n13.1\n26.4\n34.4\n0.3K\n21.7\n0.3K\n11.1\n22.7\nCatalan\n0.2K\n9.7\n21.7\n29.2\n0.1K\n16.8\n0.1K\n9.0\n18.4\nAverage BLEU (\u2191)\n13.4\n26.5\n34.2\n18.8\n9.4\n20.1\nAverage decoding time (seconds \u2193)\n2707\n3226\n5939\n5793\n1793\n4981\nRelative decoding speed (\u2191)\n2.14x\n1.80x\n0.98x\n1.00x\n3.23x\n1.16x\nEnglish\nGerman\nn/a\n14.0K\n25.4\n14.0K\n14.6\n25.4\nCatalan\n0.4K\n20.0\n0.4K\n7.7\n19.6\nChinese\n13.7K\n33.4\n13.7K\n14.5\n32.1\nPersian\n0.8K\n9.5\n0.8K\n3.0\n10.1\nEstonian\n0.4K\n7.8\n0.4K\n1.8\n7.7\nMongolian\n0.4K\n3.1\n0.4K\n1.0\n4.6\nTurkish\n0.9K\n6.1\n0.9K\n1.2\n6.5\nArabic\n0.9K\n6.6\n0.9K\n1.6\n7.2\nSwedish\n0.4K\n19.9\n0.4K\n8.1\n20.3\nLatvian\n0.4K\n6.3\n0.4K\n1.3\n6.4\nSlovenian\n0.4K\n8.6\n0.4K\n0.7\n9.0\nTamil\n0.4K\n0.0\n0.4K\n0.0\n0.0\nJapanese\n1.0K\n17.3\n1.0K\n8.7\n19.6\nIndonesian\n0.4K\n14.5\n0.4K\n5.1\n16.1\nWelsh\n0.4K\n15.9\n0.4K\n4.5\n15.3\nAverage BLEU (\u2191)\nn/a\n13.0\n4.9\n13.3\nAverage decoding time (seconds \u2193)\n9062\n3020\n7229\nRelative decoding speed (\u2191)\n1.00x\n3.00x\n1.25x\nTable 5: WER % (\u2193) of long-form ASR on the TEDLIUM2 test\nset.

For X-to-English, we report results of directions\nwhere OWSM has more than 100 hours of training data. For the\nother directions with very limited training data like Japanese- or\nChinese-to-English, OWSM usually does not work [9].

The average BLEU is improved from 18.8 to 20.1. Our\nOWSM v3.1 is also 16% faster than OWSM v3 during infer-\nence, mainly because OWSM v3.1 has a shallower decoder with\n18 layers as opposed to 24 layers in OWSM v3. Compared to\nWhisper, OWSM v3.1 still performs worse due to the limited\namount of training data. However, our OWSM v3.1 has a faster\ninference speed than Whisper for both base and medium sizes,\nthanks to the larger time shift in the encoder (40ms vs 20ms)\nand the smaller decoder.\nFor English-to-X, our OWSM v3.1 outperforms OWSM v3\nin 9 out of 15 directions. Although it shows slight degradations\nin some directions, the average BLEU is slightly improved from\n13.0 to 13.3 and the inference speed is 25% faster. Note that\nWhisper cannot perform translation in these directions, which\nare marked as \u201cn/a\u201d in Table 4.\n3.4. Long-form speech recognition\nTable 5 presents the long-form English ASR results on the\nTEDLIUM2 test set. Similar to [1, 9], OWSM takes an entire\naudio recording as input and generates transcripts in chunks.\nEach chunk has a \ufb01xed length of 30s and the chunk is gradually\nshifted based on the predicted timestamp. Our OWSM v3.1\nmedium achieves a WER of 5.7, compared to 9.2 of OWSM\nv3. This demonstrates the robustness of OWSM v3.1 against\nlong-form audio; the predicted timestamp might be more accu-\nrate as well. OWSM v3.1 still falls behind Whisper at both base\nand medium scales, likely because (1) our training data is only\naround one quarter of Whisper\u2019s training data, and (2) many\npublic datasets used by OWSM do not provide unsegmented\nlong-form versions and we have to use the segmented short au-\ndio for training, which leads to a mismatch between training and\ndecoding. In the future, we plan to add more long-form training\ndata to mitigate this issue.\n3.5. Language identi\ufb01cation\nTable 6 reports the accuracy of language identi\ufb01cation on the\nFLEURS test set prepared in ESPnet. We notice a degrada-\ntion in OWSM v3.1 compared to the previous OWSM v3, but\nOWSM v3.1 medium is still much better than Whisper medium\nbecause our model uses the massively multilingual FLEURS\nand Common Voice data for training. We also \ufb01nd that our\nOWSM v3.1 bene\ufb01ts more from scaling up compared to Whis-\nper. Speci\ufb01cally, from base to medium, the accuracy of OWSM\nv3.1 is almost doubled (41.9% to 75.6%), while the accuracy of\nWhisper is only slightly increased (47.6% to 54.8%). The pos-\nsible reasons are: (1) our OWSM supports more languages and\nlanguage pairs, which is more challenging for smaller models to\nlearn; (2) the current OWSM v3.1 base model might still under-\n\ufb01t the training data, which can be improved by longer training\nruns or more optimized hyperparameters. We will further in-\nvestigate this scaling behavior by training models of other sizes\nlike \u201csmall\u201d in addition to \u201cbase\u201d and \u201cmedium\u201d.\n3.6. Spoken language understanding\nWhisper and OWSM cannot perform SLU tasks directly. In\norder to investigate the capability of the encoder, we conduct\npreliminary experiments using the recently proposed SLUE-\nPERB benchmark [16]. Speci\ufb01cally, the pre-trained speech en-\ncoder is frozen and a randomly initialized shallow decoder is\ntrained on task-speci\ufb01c SLU training data. The model is then\nevaluated on the corresponding SLU test data.\nThis evalua-\ntion procedure is similar to the widely used SUPERB bench-\nmark [45]. We evaluate the medium-sized Whisper, OWSM v3\nand OWSM v3.1 models on four SLU tasks, i.e., sentiment anal-\nysis (SA), named entity recognition (NER), named entity local-\nization (NEL) and dialog act classi\ufb01cation (DAC). As shown in\nTable 7, our OWSM v3.1 outperforms the others by a large mar-\ngin in NER, NEL and DAC, which veri\ufb01es the strong capacity\nof our E-Branchformer encoder. Note that both OWSM models\nachieve signi\ufb01cantly higher frame-level F1 scores than Whisper\nfor NEL, because OWSM uses joint CTC training which better\naligns the encoder representations with the textual information.\n4. Future directions\nIn this work, we demonstrate that E-Branchformer greatly im-\nproves the overall performance and ef\ufb01ciency of massively mul-\ntilingual multitask speech foundation models without the use of\nany additional training data. These \ufb01ndings inspire us to explore\nseveral future directions.\n\u2022 OWSM v3.1 is trained on public data with various licenses,\nsome of which have more strict constraints.\nNow we are\ntraining another model using a subset of data with free li-\ncenses. We will publicly release this model and training data\nin a near future.\n\u2022 Data is one of the most important factors to consider when\ndeveloping speech foundation models. OWSM v3.1 still falls\nbehind Whisper when there is limited training data. We need\nto include more public data such as YODAS [44] to further\nimprove its performance.\n\u2022 Developing more powerful and ef\ufb01cient speech encoder ar-\nchitectures is still very important to the speech community\neven in the era of big data and big models.\n\u2022 Using pre-trained models like OWSM is very promising for\nother downstream tasks like spoken language understand-\ning [46, 47], which can be explored more especially in the\ncontext of continual learning.\n\u2022 Current speech foundation models are usually very large and\nslow. We need various compression algorithms to improve\nef\ufb01ciency, like distillation [48], pruning [49], joint distillation\nand pruning [50], or more \ufb02exible input-dependent dynamic\narchitectures [51].\n\u2022 Speech models can be integrated with textual LLMs, a\npromising avenue towards general-purpose multimodal foun-\ndation models [52,53].\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we present OWSM v3.1, a better and faster Open\nWhisper-style Speech Model based on E-Branchformer. Al-\nthough trained on the same amount of data, our OWSM v3.1\nachieves better results than the previous OWSM v3 in a vast ma-\njority of evaluation conditions, while showing up to 25% faster\ninference speed.\nWe publicly release all scripts, pre-trained\nmodel weights and training logs to promote transparency and\nfacilitate the development of large speech foundation models.\n6.

We leverage and re\ufb01ne various techniques for pre-training\nlarge language models. Although our model is trained on signi\ufb01cantly fewer total tokens compared\nto reference models of similar size, it exhibits highly competitive metrics across a multitude of\nbenchmarks. We additionally release a chat model trained with supervised \ufb01ne-tuning followed by\ndirect preference optimization. We make H2O-Danube-1.8B openly available under Apache 2.0\nlicense further democratizing LLMs to a wider audience economically.\nBase model: https://huggingface.co/h2oai/h2o-danube-1.8b-base\nChat model: https://huggingface.co/h2oai/h2o-danube-1.8b-chat\n2\nIntroduction\nResearch over the past few years has signi\ufb01cantly enhanced language models\u2019 capabilities, making\nthem pivotal in tasks like text and code generation, question answering, translation, summarization,\nand more [42]. Most state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) leverage decoder attention\narchitectures [41] popularized by the series of GPT models [7, 34, 35] exemplifying the bene\ufb01ts of\npre-training such models on extensive text corpora.\nScaling laws for LLMs suggest that performance scales by factors such as model and dataset size\nas well as computational resources for training [26]. This understanding has led to the development\nof a plethora of models, ranging in size to optimize performance given certain data and compute\nconstraints. Among others, notable representatives are: Falcon [33], Llama 2 [40], Qwen [3], Mistral\n[23], or Mixtral [24].\nDespite the trend towards larger models, smaller LLMs have taking an important place in today\u2019s\nlandscape allowing for ef\ufb01cient inference on consumer hardware and edge devices. While larger\nmodels often times excel across various generic tasks [3, 23, 40], \ufb01ne-tuning smaller models for\nspeci\ufb01c tasks can enable competitive performance with bene\ufb01ts of model size and inference speed\n[16], a concept also proven by the success of BERT and its derivatives [13, 18]. In this work, we\nwant to extend previous research in this area [3, 5, 39, 47, 48] and present H2O-Danube-1.8B, a\n1.8B large language model with open weights released under Apache 2.0.\nH2O-Danube-1.8B is a decoder LLM architecture adopting core principles from Llama 2 [40] and\nMistral [23]. The model is trained on 1T tokens from a combination of, but not limited to, web\ndocuments, encyclopedia and public knowledge databases, excluding coding data. Despite being\ntrained on signi\ufb01cantly fewer total tokens and the exclusion of coding data, compared to recent\nmodels released in this parameter range [3, 39, 47], it demonstrates to be highly competitive across\nvarious benchmarks. Alongside the base model, we release a chat variant H2O-Danube-1.8B-Chat,\nenhanced with supervised \ufb01ne-tuning on instruction data and preference data optimization (DPO).\n\u2217The \ufb01rst two authors contributed equally.\nTechnical Report, work in progress.\nFigure 1: Training logs. Training (top left) and validation (top right) cross-entropy loss, learning\nrate schedule (bottom left) and sequence length (bottom right). X-axis shows the number of tokens\nthat have been trained up to the step.\n3\nModel architecture\nWe adjust the Llama 2 architecture [40] for a total of around 1.8b parameters with a hidden size of\n2, 560, an intermediate size of 6, 912, and a total of 24 hidden layers. We use the original Llama 2\ntokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32, 000 and train our model up to a context length of 16, 384 (see\nSection 4). In the following, we elaborate more details about the architecture of H2O-Danube-1.8B.\nSliding window. We adopt the sliding window approach for local attention popularized by Mistral\n[23] as implemented in FlashAttention-2 [12]. For training, we use a \ufb01xed sliding window of 4, 096.\nRotary Positional Embedding. To model dependencies of elements at different positions of a\nsequence, we use the Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technique as introduced by Su et al.\n[38] and successfully being applied in multiple popular foundation models [23, 40].\nGrouped-query attention. For reducing the memory bandwidth overhead, we utilize grouped-\nquery attention [1], setting our architecture to use 32 attention heads and 8 key-value heads.\nFurther details. We rely on root mean square layer normalization (RMSNorm) [46] separately for\npre- and post-normalization to stabilize training as commonly used in modern LLMs [40]. We do\nnot use bias within linear layers nor tie word embeddings.\n4\nTraining\nWe train on a single node consisting of 8xH100 GPUs. With Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), each\nGPU holds a full copy of the model. For \ufb01nding good settings for our training routine and hyper-\nparameters, we conducted initial experiments on smaller subsets of the data and model sizes up to\n500M parameters.\n2\nAmong other \ufb01ndings, these initial experiments showed, that for higher token throughput and com-\npute ef\ufb01ciency, we can iteratively increase the sequence length during the training using a constant\nsliding window of 4,096 (see Section 3). Out of the 1T tokens in total, we train subsequently on\n\u2022 700B tokens with a sequence length of 2, 048,\n\u2022 100B tokens with a sequence length of 4, 096,\n\u2022 100B tokens with a sequence length of 8, 192,\n\u2022 100B tokens with a sequence length of 16, 384.\nWe employ recent advances in 8-bit \ufb02oating-point (FP8) calculations on the Hopper architecture to\nfurther speed up the training. For this, we cast all linear layers in the Grouped-Query Attention and\nin the Multi-Layer Perceptron to FP8. The lm_head layer remains in b\ufb02oat16 precision to ensure\ntraining stability.\nWe use AdamW optimizer [28] with \u03b21 = 0.9 and \u03b22 = 0.95 as well as a cosine learning rate\nscheduler. We warm up the learning rate for \u223c2.36B tokens to a maximum of 2e\u22124 and then decay\nit to a minimum of 1e \u2212 5. Our total batch size across GPUs is \u223c1.18M tokens, weight decay is\n1.e \u2212 1 and gradient clipping threshold is set to 1.0. With these settings, we achieved an average\nthroughput of 292.7k tokens/s on the single node during training.\n5\nResults\nWe evaluate H2O-Danube-1.8B on a wide range of benchmarks and compare it with other existing\nopen-source language models which have a similar number of parameters. Such models include\nTinyLlama with 1.1B parameters [47], Falcon with 1.3B parameters [33], OPT with 1.3B and\n2.7B parameters [48], Cerebras-GPT with 1.3B and 2.7B parameters [14], Pythia-deduped with\n1.4B and 2.8B parameters [5], Qwen with 1.8B parameters [3], and most recent Stable LM 2 with\n1.6B parameters [39]. The majority of these models have Apache 2.0 license, however, Stable LM\n2 and Qwen require additional conditions for commercial use and are marked with an asterisk in\nTable 1.\nTable 1: Commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension benchmarks.\nH2O-Danube-1.8B exhibits consistently good results across all the benchmarks compared to other\nmodels of a similar size. It shows better performance than Qwen on all the benchmarks except\nfor BoolQ, being of the same size but trained on 2.2 times fewer tokens. Stable LM 2 slightly\noutperforms H2O-Danube-1.8B on the majority of the benchmarks, but was trained on four times\nthe number of tokens. Moreover, neither Qwen nor Stable LM 2 models have the Apache 2.0 license\nrequiring additional conditions for commercial use.\nModel\nSize\nTokens\nARC-e\nARC-c\nBool\nHS\nOB\nPIQA\nTriv\nWino\nacc_n\nacc_n\nacc\nacc_n\nacc_n\nacc_n\nem\nacc\nTinyLlama\n1.1B\n3.00T\n55.35\n30.12\n57.80\n59.18\n36.00\n73.18\n28.78\n58.88\nFalcon\n1.3B\n0.35T\n57.32\n32.00\n62.84\n61.52\n35.20\n74.65\n27.27\n60.77\nOPT\n1.3B\n0.18T\n50.93\n29.52\n57.71\n53.73\n33.40\n72.52\n15.67\n59.59\n2.7B\n0.18T\n54.34\n31.31\n60.31\n60.61\n35.20\n74.81\n22.38\n60.85\nCerebras\n1.3B\n0.03T\n45.88\n25.26\n59.36\n38.37\n29.20\n66.76\n05.49\n52.01\n2.7B\n0.05T\n52.53\n27.30\n59.20\n48.84\n32.00\n70.89\n12.41\n55.96\nPythia\n1.4B\n0.30T\n56.57\n29.86\n56.76\n54.40\n33.20\n72.36\n18.46\n56.20\n2.8B\n0.30T\n58.96\n32.68\n64.19\n59.45\n35.60\n73.78\n24.39\n58.17\nQwen*\n1.8B\n2.20T\n58.25\n34.98\n67.13\n58.82\n33.40\n72.85\n23.92\n58.96\nStable LM 2*\n1.6B\n4.00T\n67.63\n39.08\n75.60\n68.78\n40.00\n76.39\n33.84\n63.30\nH2O-Danube\n1.8B\n1.00T\n62.29\n35.84\n65.81\n68.20\n37.60\n76.93\n38.99\n61.96\n3\nTable 2:\nOpen LLM Leaderboard.

Speci\ufb01-\ncally, we use the version of the framework that is utilized in Open LLM Leaderboard [4]. We report\nmodel capabilities across a wide variety of benchmark domains: commonsense reasoning, world\nknowledge, reading comprehension and an aggregated Open LLM Leaderboard benchmark.\nCommonsense Reasoning. In Table 1 we present six standard common sense reasoning bench-\nmarks in the 0-shot setting: ARC easy and challenge [9], HellaSwag [45], OpenBookQA [29], PIQA\n[6], Winogrande [37].\nWorld Knowledge. We evaluate 5-shot performance on TriviaQA [25] which represents a closed-\nbook question answering benchmark. Results are presented in Table 1.\nReading Comprehension. We report 0-shot performance on BoolQ [8]. Results are presented in\nTable 1.\nOpen LLM Leaderboard. It evaluates models on six key benchmarks which test a variety of reason-\ning and general knowledge across a wide range of \ufb01elds in 0-shot and few-shot settings. It consists\nof the following benchmarks: ARC challenge (25-shot) [9], HellaSwag (10-shot) [45], MMLU (5-\nshot) [19], TruthfulQA (0-shot) [27], Winogrande (5-shot) [37], GSM8k (5-shot) [10]. Results are\npresented in Table 2\nFor each model in Table 1 we report its number of parameters and the total number of tokens it\nwas trained on. H2O-Danube-1.8B achieves good results across all the commonsense reasoning,\nworld knowledge and reading comprehension benchmarks compared to other models of a similar\nsize. The closest competitors are Qwen and Stable LM 2 models. H2O-Danube-1.8B shows better\nperformance than Qwen on all the benchmarks except for BoolQ. Qwen model has the same 1.8B\nparameters but was trained on 2.2 times more tokens \u2013 2.2T. At the same time, H2O-Danube-1.8B is\nslightly worse than Stable LM 2 on the majority of the benchmarks, while Stable LM 2 was trained\non four times more tokens \u2013 2T tokens for 2 epochs. Also, it is important to note that neither Qwen\nnor Stable LM 2 models have the Apache 2.0 license requiring additional conditions for commercial\nuse.\nSimilarly, H2O-Danube-1.8B, Qwen and Stable LM 2 are the strongest models on Open LLM\nLeaderboard (see Table 2). All of them have comparable results on the majority of the benchmarks\nexcept for MMLU and GSM8k. One of the potential explanations for such a behavior might be a\nspeci\ufb01cally tailored data that was used for training of Qwen and Stable LM 2 models. Such data can\nbe utilized to improve some particular benchmarks, for example, Qwen used gsm8k-ScRel dataset\n[44] for better math reasoning.\n4\n6\nChat Fine-Tuning\nOne of the most common use cases for LLMs evolves around instructing and chatting. We thus also\nprovide a chat \ufb01ne-tuned version H2O-Danube-1.8B-Chat released under Apache 2.0. We utilize\nH2O LLM Studio2, an Apache 2.0 open-source framework and no-code GUI for \ufb01ne-tuning LLMs.\n6.1\nSupervised \ufb01ne-tuning\nAs \ufb01rst step, we tune the base model using supervised \ufb01ne-tuning (SFT) on input/output conversa-\ntional pairs. In detail, we combine the following datasets totalling 157k samples: OpenOrca [31]\nfollowing the steps outlined in Orca [30], MetaMathQA [43], UltraChat200k [15, 21], and Oasst2\n[32].\nWe train all layers of the model for a single epoch using a learning rate of 1e \u2212 5, a batch size of 8,\nand using cosine learning rate scheduling with a short warmup. We use the full pre-trained context\nlength of 16, 384, mask the prompt loss, and use a custom prompt format. Hyperparameters were\noptimized iterating over multiple experiments.\n6.2\nDPO\nWe follow supervised \ufb01ne-tuning, by direct preference optimization (DPO) [36] using a combination\nof the following datasets totalling around 17k samples: UltraFeedback Binarized [11], Orca DPO\nPairs [22] and Distilabel Math Preference DPO [2]. The DPO model is trained using LoRA [20]\nwith r = 4, alpha =16 for one epoch using a batch size of 2 with a learning rate of 1e \u2212 5 using\ncosine learning rate decay, and beta = 0.2 for DPO loss.\nAfterwards, we run a \ufb01nal DPO \ufb01ne-tune using Oasst2 [32] dataset building preference pairs from\nranks where the chosen answer is the lowest rank, and the rejected answer is the highest one, limited\nto only English conversations totalling around 5k samples. The training run uses similar hyperpa-\nrameters as the previous one, just a lower learning rate of 3e \u2212 6.\nTable 3: Mt-bench chat benchmark. This table shows both turn 1 and turn 2 evaluations for mt-\nbench excluding the coding category. Results highlight the excellent performance of H2O-Danube-\n1.8B-Chat, particularly for single turn conversations where it exhibits the highest Mt-bench scores\nfor multiple categories and the average.\nTinyLlama-1.1B-Chat\nQwen-1.8B-Chat\nStablelm-2-Zephyr-1.6B\nH2O-Danube-1.8B-Chat\nTurn 1\nExtraction\n2.50\n4.70\n5.20\n3.40\nHumanities\n8.15\n6.60\n9.20\n8.90\nMath\n1.20\n2.40\n3.50\n3.80\nReasoning\n3.10\n3.50\n3.50\n4.30\nRoleplay\n5.60\n6.70\n6.80\n7.05\nSTEM\n6.60\n6.50\n7.35\n8.10\nWriting\n8.65\n9.20\n9.35\n9.35\nAverage\n5.11\n5.66\n6.41\n6.41\nTurn 2\nExtraction\n1.20\n2.40\n4.80\n3.20\nHumanities\n8.10\n7.30\n9.70\n8.90\nMath\n1.40\n1.60\n1.60\n1.50\nReasoning\n2.30\n3.90\n3.20\n2.70\nRoleplay\n5.60\n6.70\n6.95\n6.90\nSTEM\n4.60\n5.80\n6.80\n6.10\nWriting\n2.70\n4.80\n7.50\n3.10\nAverage\n3.70\n4.64\n5.79\n4.63\n2https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio\n5\n6.3\nEvaluation\nEvaluating chat and instruct \ufb01ne-tuned LLMs remains a critical challenge and can most reliably be\nconducted by large scale human assessment. In order to give an initial evaluation of our chat model,\nwe resort to MT-Bench, a collection of multi-turn questions across different categories followed by\njudgement by GPT4 [49]. We keep all categories apart from coding which is out of scope for H2O-\nDanube-1.8B. Each model is run with repetition_penalty = 1.1 and temperature = 0.0 to reduce\nrandomness and a more fair comparison between models.\nWe compare our results to popular chat models below 2B parameters and highlight them in Table 3.\nWe can see that H2O-Danube-1.8B-Chat is exhibiting strong results across categories, particularly\nfor natural language tasks as focused on in this work. For single turn conversations, H2O-Danube-\n1.8B-Chat is the best model for \ufb01ve out of seven categories, and on average on-par with Stablelm 2.\nFor turn 2, we can see that it is comparable to Qwen 2, while Stablelm 2 outperforms other models.\nWe make the intermediate sft version3 as well as the \ufb01nal DPO model weights4 available online. We\nplan on exploring further improvements for the chat version in the future, working on SFT as well\nas improved DPO. Particularly, we aim at enhancing preference data with multi turn conversations.\nWe also hope for the open source community to further \ufb01ne-tune our models for various use cases.\nAdditionally, we also evaluate chat models on commonsense reasoning, world knowledge, read-\ning comprehension and aggregated Open LLM Leaderboard benchmarks. Similarly as for base\nmodels, we report 0-shot benchmark results of the chat versions of H2O-Danube-1.8B, TinyLlama,\nQwen and Stable LM 2 in Table 4, and Open LLM Leaderboard results are available in Table 5.\nWe show that H2O-Danube-1.8B-Chat and Stablelm-2-Zephyr perform better than Qwen-Chat and\nTinyLlama-Chat models on the majority of the benchmarks while being on par between each other.\nOnly exceptions are, again, MMLU and GSM8k benchmarks. As we mentioned in Section 5, one\nof the potential explanations for the worse H2O-Danube-1.8B performance might be a speci\ufb01cally\ntailored data that was used for training of Qwen and Stable LM 2 base models to optimize those\nbenchmarks.\nTable 4: Commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension benchmarks\nfor chat models.

The Apache 2.0 license allows for\ncommercial use and for further \ufb01ne-tuning by the community. We also release a SFT + DPO \ufb01ne-\ntuned chat version, exhibiting state-of-the art results in commonsense reasoning, world knowledge\nand reading comprehension benchmarks. We show that H2O-Danube-1.8B outperforms other mod-\nels of a similar size on many of the benchmarks. H2O-Danube-1.8B is our \ufb01rst contribution to the\ngrowing ecosystem of permissive open-source foundation models and we strive to continue publish-\ning high quality foundation models and chat \ufb01ne-tunes in the near future. Notably, small models can\nbe used on consumer hardware further democratizing LLMs to a wider audience economically.\nReferences\n[1] Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp, Michiel de Jong, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Federico Lebr\u00f3n, and Sumit Sang-\nhai.

Given an image and a prompt for how to improve that image, our all-in-one restoration model corrects the image considering the\nhuman instruction. InstructIR, can tackle various types and levels of degradation, and it is able to generalize in some real-world scenarios.\nAbstract\nImage restoration is a fundamental problem that involves\nrecovering a high-quality clean image from its degraded ob-\nservation. All-In-One image restoration models can effec-\ntively restore images from various types and levels of degra-\ndation using degradation-specific information as prompts\nto guide the restoration model. In this work, we present\nthe first approach that uses human-written instructions to\nguide the image restoration model. Given natural language\nprompts, our model can recover high-quality images from\ntheir degraded counterparts, considering multiple degrada-\ntion types. Our method, InstructIR, achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on several restoration tasks including image denois-\ning, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image\nenhancement. InstructIR improves +1dB over previous all-\nin-one restoration methods. Moreover, our dataset and re-\nsults represent a novel benchmark for new research on text-\nguided image restoration and enhancement.\n1. Introduction\nImages often contain unpleasant effects such as noise, mo-\ntion blur, haze, and low dynamic range. Such effects are\ncommonly known in low-level computer vision as degrada-\ntions. These can result from camera limitations or challeng-\ning environmental conditions e.g. low light.\nImage restoration aims to recover a high-quality im-\nage from its degraded counterpart. This is a complex in-\nverse problem since multiple different solutions can exist\nfor restoring any given image [16, 20, 44, 59, 102, 103].\nSome methods focus on specific degradations, for in-\nstance reducing noise (denoising) [64, 102, 103], remov-\ning blur (deblurring) [58, 105], or clearing haze (dehaz-\ning) [16, 66]. Such methods are effective for their specific\ntask, yet they do not generalize well to other types of degra-\ndation. Other approaches use a general neural network for\ndiverse tasks [10, 74, 82, 95], yet training the neural net-\nwork for each specific task independently. Since using a\nseparate model for each possible degradation is resource-\n1\narXiv:2401.16468v3  [cs.CV]  21 Feb 2024\nintensive, recent approaches propose All-in-One restoration\nmodels [42, 60, 61, 100]. These approaches use a single\ndeep blind restoration model considering multiple degrada-\ntion types and levels. Contemporary works such as Promp-\ntIR [61] or ProRes [49] utilize a unified model for blind im-\nage restoration using learned guidance vectors, also known\nas \u201cprompt embeddings\u201d, in contrast to raw user prompts in\ntext form, which we use in this work.\nIn parallel, recent works such as InstructPix2Pix [4]\nshow the potential of using text prompts to guide image gen-\neration and editing models. However, this method (or recent\nalternatives) do not tackle inverse problems. Inspired by\nthese works, we argue that text guidance can help to guide\nblind restoration models better than the image-based degra-\ndation classification used in previous works [42, 60, 100].\nUsers generally have an idea about what has to be fixed\n(though they might lack domain-specific vocabulary) so we\ncan use this information to guide the model.\nContributions\nWe propose the first approach that utilizes\nreal human-written instructions to solve inverse problems\nand image restoration.\nOur comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the potential of using text guidance for image\nrestoration and enhancement by achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance on various image restoration tasks, including\nimage denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing and low-\nlight image enhancement. Our model, InstructIR, is able\nto generalize to restoring images using arbitrary human-\nwritten instructions. Moreover, our single all-in-one model\ncovers more tasks than many previous works. We show di-\nverse restoration samples of our method in Figure 1.\n2. Related Work\nImage Restoration.\nRecent deep learning methods [16,\n44, 58, 64, 74, 95] have shown consistently better results\ncompared to traditional techniques for blind image restora-\ntion [18, 29, 35, 37, 54, 73]. The proposed neural networks\nare based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\nTransformers [76] (or related attention mechanisms).\nWe focus on general-purpose restoration models [10, 44,\n82, 95].\nFor example, SwinIR [44], MAXIM [74] and\nUformer [82]. These models can be trained -independently-\nfor diverse tasks such as denoising, deraining or deblurring.\nTheir ability to capture local and global feature interactions,\nand enhance them, allows the models to achieve great per-\nformance consistently across different tasks. For instance,\nRestormer [95] uses non-local blocks [79] to capture com-\nplex features across the image.\nNAFNet [10] is an efficient alternative to complex\ntransformer-based methods.\nThe model uses simplified\nchannel attention, and gating as an alternative to non-linear\nactivations. The builing block (NAFBlock) follows a simple\nmeta-former [92] architecture with efficient inverted resid-\nual blocks [31]. In this work, we build our InstructIR model\nusing NAFNet as backbone, due to its efficient and simple\ndesign, and high performance in several restoration tasks.\nAll-in-One Image Restoration.\nSingle degradation (or\nsingle task) restoration methods are well-studied, however,\ntheir real-world applications are limited due to the required\nresources i.e. allocating different models, and select the ad-\nequate model on demand. Moreover, images rarely present\na single degradation, for instance noise and blur are almost\nubiquitous in any image capture.\nAll-in-One (also known as multi-degradation or multi-\ntask) image restoration is emerging as a new research field\nin low-level computer vision [42, 49, 60, 61, 75, 91, 97, 98].\nThese approaches use a single deep blind restoration model\nto tackle different degradation types and levels.\nWe use as reference AirNet [42], IDR [100] and\nADMS [60].\nWe also consider the contemporary work\nPromptIR [61]. The methods use different techniques to\nguide the blind model in the restoration process.\nFor\ninstance, an auxiliary model for degradation classifica-\ntion [42, 60], or multi-dimensional guidance vectors (also\nknown as \u201cprompts\u201d) [49, 61] that help the model to dis-\ncriminate the different types of degradation in the image.\nDespite it is not the focus of this work, we acknowl-\nedge that real-world image super-resolution is a related\nproblem [12, 44, 48, 106], since the models aim to solve\nan inverse problem considering multiple degradations (blur,\nnoise and downsampling).\nText-guided Image Manipulation.\nIn the recent years,\nmultiple methods have been proposed for text-to-image\ngeneration and text-based image editing works [4, 30, 34,\n53, 70]. These models use text prompts to describe images\nor actions, and powerful diffusion-based models for gener-\nating the corresponding images. Our main reference is In-\nstructPix2Pix [4], this method enables editing from instruc-\ntions that tell the model what action to perform, as opposed\nto text labels, captions or descriptions of the input or output\nimages. Therefore, the user can transmit what to do in nat-\nural written text, without requiring to provide further image\ndescriptions or sample reference images.\n3. Image Restoration Following Instructions\nWe treat instruction-based image restoration as a supervised\nlearning problem similar to previous works [4]. First, we\ngenerate over 10000 prompts using GPT-4 based on our\nown sample instructions. We explain the creation of the\nprompt dataset in Sec. 3.1. We then build a large paired\ntraining dataset of prompts and degraded/clean images. Fi-\nnally, we train our InstructIR model, and we evaluate it on\na wide variety of instructions including real human-written\nprompts. We explain our text encoder in Sec 3.2, and our\ncomplete model in Sec. 3.3.\n2\nRemove the noise\nfrom this picture now\nInstructIR\nE\nGPT-4\nInstructIR\nE\n* Offline Instructions Generation\n\"Make this image sharper.\"\n\"can you reduce the movement in the image?\"\nRandomly sample according to the degradation\n(Intent) Degradation Classification\nTraining using generated instructions\nInference using user instructions\nFigure 2. We train our blind image restoration models using common image datasets, and prompts generated using GPT-4, note that this is\n(self-)supervised learning. At inference time, our model generalizes to human-written instructions and restores (or enhances) the images.\n3.1. Generating Prompts for Training\nWhy instructions?\nInspired by InstructPix2Pix [4], we\nadopt human written instructions as the mechanism of con-\ntrol for our model. There is no need for the user to provide\nadditional information, such as example clean images, or\ndescriptions of the visual content. Instructions offer a clear\nand expressive way to interact, enabling users to pinpoint\nthe unpleasant effects (degradations) in the images.\nHandling free-form user prompts rather than fixed\ndegradation-specific prompts increases the usability of our\nmodel for laypeople who lack domain expertise. We thus\nwant our model to be capable of understanding diverse\nprompts posed by users \u201cin-the-wild\u201d e.g. kids, adults, or\nphotographers. To this end, we use a large language model\n(i.e., GPT-4) to create diverse requests that might be asked\nby users for the different degradations types. We then filter\nthose generated prompts to remove ambiguous or unclear\nprompts (e.g., \u201cMake the image cleaner\u201d, \u201cimprove this im-\nage\u201d). Our final instructions set contains over 10000 differ-\nent prompts in total, for 7 different tasks. We display some\nexamples in Table 1. As we show in Figure 2 the prompts\nare sampled randomly depending on the input degradation.\n3.2. Text Encoder\nThe Choice of the Text Encoder.\nA text encoder maps\nthe user prompt to a fixed-size vector representation (a text\nembedding). The related methods for text-based image gen-\neration [67] and manipulation [3, 4] often use the text en-\ncoder of a CLIP model [62] to encode user prompts as CLIP\nexcels in visual prompts. However, user prompts for degra-\ndation contain, in general, little to no visual content (e.g. the\nuse describes the degradation, not the image itself), there-\nfore, the large CLIP encoders (with over 60 million param-\neters) are not suitable \u2013 especially if we require efficiency.\nWe opt, instead, to use a pure text-based sentence en-\ncoder [63], that is, a model trained to encode sentences in\na semantically meaningful embedding space. Sentence en-\nTable 1.

For instance, we use\nthe BGE-micro-v2 sentence transformer.\nFine-tuning the Text Encoder.\nWe want to adapt the text\nencoder E for the restoration task to better encode the re-\nquired information for the restoration model. Training the\nfull text encoder is likely to lead to overfitting on our small\ntraining set and lead to loss of generalization. Instead, we\nfreeze the text encoder and train a projection head on top:\ne = norm(W \u00b7 E(t))\n(1)\n3\nlow-light\ndenoising\nderaining\ndeblurring\nenhancement\ndehazing\nsuper-res\n(a) t-SNE of embeddings before training i.e. frozen text encoder\nlow-light\ndenoising\nderaining\ndeblurring\nenhancement\ndehazing\nsuper-res\n(b) t-SNE of embeddings after training our learned projection\nFigure 3. We show t-SNE plots of the text embeddings before/after\ntraining InstructIR. Each dot represents a human instruction.\nwhere t is the text, E(t) represents the raw text embed-\nding, W \u2208 Rdt\u00d7dv is a learned projection from the text\ndimension (dt) to the input dimension for the restoration\nmodel (dv), and norm is the l2-norm.\nFigure 3 shows that while the text encoder is capable out-\nof-the-box to cluster instructions to some extent (Figure 3a),\nour trained projection yields greatly improved clusters (Fig-\nure 3b). We distinguish clearly the clusters for deraining,\ndenoising, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light image en-\nhancement. The instructions for such tasks or degradations\nare very characteristic. Furthermore, we can appreciate that\n\u201csuper-res\u201d and \u201cenhancement\u201d tasks are quite spread and\nbetween the previous ones, which matches the language\nlogic. For instance \u201cadd details to this image\u201d could be\nused for enhancement, deblurring or denosising. In our ex-\nperiments, dt =384, dv =256 and W is a linear layer. The\nrepresentation e from the text encoder is shared across the\nblocks, and each block has a trainable projection W.\nIntent Classification Loss.\nWe propose a guidance loss\non the text embedding e to improve training and inter-\npretability. Using the degradation types as targets, we train\na simple classification head C such that c = C(e), where\nc \u2208 RD, being D is the number of degradation classes. The\nclassification head C is a simple two-layers MLP. Thus, we\nonly need to train a projection layer W and a simple MLP\nto capture the natural language knowledge. This allows the\ntext model to learn meaningful embeddings as we can ap-\npreciate in Figure 3, not just guidance vectors for the main\nimage processing model. We find that the model is able to\nclassify accurately (i.e. over 95% accuracy) the underlying\ndegradation in the user\u2019s prompt after a few epochs.\nText Prompt\n+\nBlock\nLinear\nE\nSoft Task Routing\nShared across blocks\nFigure 4. Instruction Condition Block (ICB) using an approxima-\ntion of task routing [71] for many-tasks learning. See Eq. 2.\n3.3. InstructIR\nOur method InstructIR consists of an image model and a\ntext encoder. We introduced our text encoder in Sec. 3.2.\nWe use NAFNet [10] as the image model, an efficient image\nrestoration model that follows a U-Net architecture [68]. To\nsuccessfully learn multiple tasks using a single model, we\nuse task routing techniques. Our framework for training and\nevaluating the model is illustrated in Figure 2.\nText Guidance.\nThe key aspect of InstructIR is the inte-\ngration of the encoded instruction as a mechanism of control\nfor the image model. Inspired in task routing for many-task\nlearning [14, 69, 71], we propose an \u201cInstruction Condi-\ntion Block\u201d (ICB) to enable task-specific transformations\nwithin the model. Conventional task routing [71] applies\ntask-specific binary masks to the channel features. Since\nour model does not know a-priori the degradation, we can-\nnot use this technique directly.\nConsidering the image features F, and the encoded in-\nstruction e, we apply task routing as follows:\nF\u2032\nc = Block(Fc \u2299 mc) + Fc\n(2)\nwhere the mask mc = \u03c3(Wc \u00b7 e) is produced using a\nlinear layer -activated using the Sigmoid function- to pro-\nduce a set of weights depending on the text embedding e.\nThus, we obtain a c-dimensional per-channel (soft-)binary\nmask mc. As [71], task routing is applied as the channel-\nwise multiplication \u2299 for masking features depending on\nthe task.\nThe conditioned features are further enhanced\nusing a NAFBlock [10] (Block). We illustrate our task-\nrouting ICB block in Figure 4.\nWe use \u201cregular\u201d NAF-\nBlocks [10], followed by ICBs to condition the features,\nat both encoder and decoder blocks. The formulation is\nF l+1 = ICB(Block(F l)) where l is the layer. Although\nwe do not condition explicitly the filters of the neural net-\nwork, as in [71], the mask allows the model to select the\nmost relevant channels depending on the image information\nand the instruction. Note that this formulation enables dif-\nferentiable feature masking, and certain interpretability i.e.\nthe features with high weights contribute the most to the\n4\nrestoration process. Indirectly, this also enforces to learn\ndiverse filters and reduce sparsity [14, 71].\nIs InstructIR a blind restoration model?\nThe model\ndoes not use explicit information about the degradation in\nthe image e.g. noise profiles, blur kernels, or PSFs. Since\nour model infers the task (degradation) given the image\nand the instruction, we consider InstructIR a blind image\nrestoration model. Similarly to previous works that use aux-\niliary image-based degradation classification [42, 60].\n4. Experimental Results\nWe provide extensive qualitative results using benchmark\nimages in Figures 19, 20 and 21.\nWe also evaluate our\nmodel on 9 well-known benchmarks for different image\nrestoration tasks: image denoising, deblurring, deraining,\ndehazing, and image enhancement. We present extensive\nquantitative results in Table 2.\nOur single model suc-\ncessfully restores images considering different degradation\ntypes and levels. We provide additional results and ablation\nstudies in the supplementary material.\n4.1. Implementation Details.\nOur InstructIR model is end-to-end trainable. The image\nmodel does not require pre-training, yet we use a pre-trained\nsentence encoder as language model.\nText Encoder.\nAs we discussed in Sec. 3.2, we only\nneed to train the text embedding projection and classifica-\ntion head (\u2248 100K parameters). We initialize the text en-\ncoder with BGE-MICRO-V2 1, a distilled version of BGE-\nSMALL-EN [85].\nThe BGE encoders are BERT-like en-\ncoders [13] pre-trained on large amounts of supervised and\nunsupervised data for general-purpose sentence encoding.\nThe BGE-micro model is a 3-layer encoder with 17.3 mil-\nlion parameters, which we freeze during training. We also\nexplore ALL-MINILM-L6-V2 and CLIP encoders, how-\never, we concluded that small models prevent overfitting\nand provide the best performance while being fast. We pro-\nvide the ablation study comparing the three text encoders in\nthe supplementary material.\nImage Model.\nWe use NAFNet [10] as image model.\nThe architecture consists of a 4-level encoder-decoder, with\nvarying numbers of blocks at each level, specifically [2, 2,\n4, 8] for the encoder, and [2, 2, 2, 2] for the decoder, from\nthe level-1 to level-4 respectively. Between the encoder and\ndecoder we use 4 middle blocks to enhance further the fea-\ntures. The decoder implements addition instead of concate-\nnation for the skip connections.\nWe use the Instruction Condition Block (ICB) for task-\nrouting [71] only in the encoder and decoder.\n1https://huggingface.co/TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2\nThe model is optimized using the L1 loss between the\nground-truth clean image and the restored one. Additionally\nwe use the cross-entropy loss Lce for the intent classifica-\ntion head of the text encoder. We train use a batch size of 32\nand AdamW [36] optimizer with learning rate 5e\u22124 for 500\nepochs (approximately 1 day using a single NVIDIA A100).\nWe also use cosine annealing learning rate decay. During\ntraining, we utilize cropped patches of size 256 \u00d7 256 as\ninput, and we use random horizontal and vertical flips as\naugmentations. Since our model uses as input instruction-\nimage pairs, given an image, and knowing its degradation,\nwe randomly sample instructions from our prompt dataset\n(>10K samples). Our image model has only 16M parame-\nters, and the learned text projection is just 100k parameters\n(the language model is 17M parameters), thus, our model\ncan be trained easily on standard GPUs such as NVIDIA\nRTX 2080Ti or 3090Ti in a couple of days. Furthermore,\nthe inference process also fits in low-computation budgets.\n4.2. Datasets and Benchmarks\nFollowing previous works [42, 61, 100], we prepare the\ndatasets for different restoration tasks.\nImage denoising.\nWe use a combination of BSD400 [2]\nand WED [50] datasets for training. This combined train-\ning set contains \u2248 5000 images. Using as reference the\nclean images in the dataset, we generate the noisy im-\nages by adding Gaussian noise with different noise levels\n\u03c3 \u2208 {15, 25, 50}. We test the models on the well-known\nBSD68 [52] and Urban100 [32] datasets.\nImage deraining.\nWe use the Rain100L [88] dataset,\nwhich consists of 200 clean-rainy image pairs for training,\nand 100 pairs for testing.\nImage\ndehazing.\nWe\nutilize\nthe\nReside\n(outdoor)\nSOTS [41] dataset, which contains \u2248 72K training im-\nages. However, many images are low-quality and unrealis-\ntic, thus, we filtered the dataset and selected a random set of\n2000 images \u2013 also to avoid imbalance w.r.t the other tasks.\nWe use the standard outdoor testset of 500 images.\nImage deblurring.\nWe use the GoPro dataset for motion\ndeblurring [57] which consist of 2103 images for training,\nand 1111 for testing.\nLow-light Image Enhancement.\nWe use the LOL [83]\ndataset (v1), and we adopt its official split of 485 training\nimages, and 15 testing images.\nImage Enhancement.\nExtending previous works, we\nalso study photo-realistic image enhancement using the\nMIT5K dataset [5]. We use 1000 images for training, and\nthe standard split of 500 images for testing (as in [74]).\nFinally, as previous works [42, 61, 100], we combine all the\naforementioned training datasets, and we train our unified\nmodel for all-in-one restoration.\n5\nTable 2.

Multiple Degradation Results\nWe define two initial setups for multi-task restoration:\n\u2022 3D for three-degradation models such as AirNet [42],\nthese tackle image denoising, dehazing and deraining.\n\u2022 5D for five-degradation models, considering image de-\nnoising, deblurring, dehazing, deraining and low-light\nimage enhancement as in [100].\nIn Table 2, we show the performance of 5D models.\nFollowing Zhang et al. [100], we compare InstructIR with\nseveral state-of-the-art methods for general image restora-\ntion [9, 10, 44, 93, 95], and all-in-one image restoration\nmethods [21, 42, 45, 75, 100]. We can observe that our sim-\nple image model (just 16M parameters) can tackle success-\nfully at least five different tasks thanks to the instruction-\nbased guidance, and achieves the most competitive results.\nIn Table 4 we can appreciate a similar behaviour, when\nthe number of tasks is just three (3D), our model improves\nfurther in terms of reconstruction performance.\nBased on these results, we pose the following question:\nHow many tasks can we tackle using a single model without\nlosing too much performance? To answer this, we propose\nthe 6D and 7D variants. For the 6D variant, we fine-tune the\noriginal 5D to consider also super-resolution as sixth task.\nFinally, our 7D model includes all previous tasks, and ad-\nditionally image enhancement (MIT5K photo retouching).\nWe show the performance of these two variants in Table 2.\nTest Instructions.\nInstructIR requires as input the de-\ngraded image and the human-written instruction. There-\nfore, we also prepare a testset of prompts i.e. instruction-\nimage test pairs. The performance of InstructIR depends on\nthe ambiguity and precision of the instruction. We provide\nTable 3. Ablation study on the sensitivity of instructions. We re-\nport PSNR/SSIM metrics for each task using our 5D base model.\nWe repeat the evaluation on each testset 10 times, each time we\nsample different prompts for each image, and we report the aver-\nage results.

However, it is still limited\nwith ambiguous instructions such as \u201cenhance this image\u201d.\nWe show diverse instructions in the following Figures.\n5. Multi-Task Ablation Study\nHow does 6D work?\nBesides the 5 basic tasks -as previous\nworks-, we include single image super-resolution (SISR).\nFor this, we include as training data the DIV2K [1]. Since\nour model does not perform upsampling, we use the Bicubic\ndegradation model [1, 15] for generating the low-resolution\nimages (LR), and the upsampled versions (HR) that are\nfed into our model to enhance them.\nAdding this extra\ntask increases the performance on deblurring \u2013a related\ndegradation\u2013, without harming notably the performance on\nthe other tasks. However, the performance on SR bench-\nmarks is far from classical super-resolution methods [1, 44].\nHow does 7D work?\nFinally, if we add image enhance-\nment \u2013a task not related to the previous ones i.e. inverse\nproblems\u2013 the performance on the restoration tasks decays\nslightly.

Moreover, as we show in Table 5, the performance\non this task using the MIT5K [5] Dataset is notable, while\nkeeping the performance on the other tasks. We achieve\nsimilar performance to classical task-specific methods.\nWe summarize the multi-task ablation study in Table 6.\nOur model can tackle multiple tasks without losing perfor-\nmance notably thanks to the instruction-based task routing.\nComparison with Task-specific Methods\nOur main goal\nis to design a powerful all-in-one model, thus, InstructIR\nwas not designed to be trained for a particular degradation.\nNevertheless, we also compare InstructIR with task-specific\nmethods i.e. models tailored and trained for specific tasks.\nWe compare with task-specific methods for image en-\nhancement in Table 5, and for low-light in image enhance-\nment in 7. We provide extensive comparisons for image de-\nnoising in Table 8. Also, in Table 9 we show comparisons\nwith classical methods for deblurring and dehazing. Our\nmulti-task method is better than most task-specific methods,\nyet it is still not better than SOTA.\n6. On the Effectiveness of Instructions\nThanks to our integration of human instructions, users can\ncontrol how to enhance the images. We show an example in\nFigure 5, where the input image has three different degra-\ndations, and we aim to focus on a particular one. Although\nthese results do not offer great reconstruction, we believe\nit is a promising direction that illustrates the effectiveness\nof instruction guidance for image restoration and enhance-\nment. We provide more results in Figures 6 and 7, where\nwe show the potential of our method to restore and enhance\nimages in a controllable manner.\n7\nInput\n\u201cClean up my image,\n\u201cGet rid of the grain\n\u201cRemove the strange spots\nit\u2019s too fuzzy.\u201d\nin my photo\u201d\non my photo\u201d\n\u201cRetouch this image and\n\u201cReduce the motion\n\u201cPlease get rid of\n\u201cReduce the fog in\nimprove colors\u201d\nin this shot\u201d\nthe raindrops\u201d\nthis landmark\u201d\nFigure 6.

Classical deep restoration\nmethods lead to a unique result, thus, they do not allow to\ncontrol how the image is processed. We also compare In-\nstructIR with InstructPix2Pix [4] in Figure 8.\nQualitative Results.\nWe provide diverse qualitative re-\nsults for several tasks. In Figure 9, we show results on the\nLOL [83] dataset.

However, we acknowl-\nedge certain limitations. First, in comparison to diffusion-\nbased restoration methods, our current approach would not\nproduce better results attending to perceptual quality. Sec-\nond, our model struggles to process images with more\nthan one degradation (i.e. real-world images), yet this is\na common limitation among the related restoration meth-\nods. Third, as previous all-in-one methods, our model only\nworks with in-distribution degradations, thus it will not\nwork on unseen artifacts. Nevertheless, these limitations\ncan be surpassed with more realistic training data.\n7. Conclusion\nWe present the first approach that uses human-written in-\nstructions to guide the image restoration models. Given nat-\nural language prompts, our model can recover high-quality\nimages from their degraded counterparts, considering mul-\ntiple degradation types. InstructIR achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on several restoration tasks, demonstrating the power\nof instruction guidance.\nThese results represent a novel\nbenchmark for text-guided image restoration.n\nAcknowledgments This work was partly supported by the The\nHumboldt Foundation (AvH).

We provide the corresponding natural language instructions.\n13\nInstructIR: High-Quality Image Restoration Following Human Instructions\nSupplementary Material\nWe define our loss functions in the paper Sec. 4.1. Our training\nloss function is L = L1 + Lce, which includes the loss func-\ntion of the image model (L1), and the loss function for intent\n(task/degradation) classification (Lce) given the prompt embed-\nding. We provide the loss evolution plots in Figures 16 and 17.\nIn particular, in Figure 17 we can observe how the intent clas-\nsification loss (i.e. predicting the task (or degradation) given the\nprompt), tends to 0 very fast, indicating that our language model\ncomponent can infer easily the task given the instruction.\nAdditionally, we study three different text (sentence) encoders: (i)\nBGE-MICRO-V2 2, (ii) ALL-MINILM-L6-V2 3, (iii) CLIP text\nencoder (OpenAI CLIP ViT B-16). Note that these are always\nfrozen. We use pre-trained weights from HuggingFace.\nIn Table 10 we show the ablation study. There is no significant\ndifference between the text encoders. This is related to the previ-\nous results (Fig. 17), any text encoder with enough complexity can\ninfer the task from the prompt. Therefore, we use BGE-MICRO-\nV2, as it is just 17M parameters in comparison to the others (40-\n60M parameters). Note that for this ablation study, we keep fixed\nthe image model (16M), and we only change the language model.\nText Discussion\nWe shall ask, do the text encoders perform\ngreat because the language and instructions are too simple?\nWe believe our instructions cover a wide range of expressions\n(technical, common language, ambiguous, etc).\nThe language\nmodel works properly on real-world instructions. Therefore, we\nbelieve the language for this specific task is self-constrained, and\neasier to understand and to model in comparison to other \u201copen\u201d\ntasks such as image generation.\nModel Design\nBased on our experiments, given a trained text-\nguided image model (e.g. based on NAFNet [10]), we can switch\nlanguage models without performance loss.\nComparison of NAFNet with and without using text (i.e. image\nonly): The reader can find the comparison in the main paper Table\n2, please read the highlighted caption.\nHow the 6D variant does Super-Resolution?. We degraded the\ninput images by downsampling and re-upsampling using Bicubic\ninterpolation. Given a LR image, we updample it using Bicubic,\nthen InstructIR can recover some details.\nTable 10.\nAblation study on the text encoders.\nWe report\nPSNR/SSIM metrics for each task using our 5D base model.

Also, we find the same limitations as\nsuch methods when we process real-world images. Evaluating the\nmodel on (multiple) real-world degradations is a future task.\nContemporary Works and Reproducibility.\nNote that\nPromptIR, ProRes [49] and Amirnet [98] are contemporary works\n(presented or published by Dec 2023). We compare mainly with\nAirNet [42] since the model and results are open-source, and it\nis a reference all-in-one method. To the best of our knowledge,\nIDR [100] and ADMS [60] do not provide open-source code, mod-\nels or results, thus we cannot compare with them qualitatively.\nAdditional Visual Results\nWe present diverse qualitative\nsamples in Figures 19, 20, and 21. Our method produces high-\nquality results given images with any of the studied degrada-\ntions.\nIn most cases the results are better than the reference\nall-in-one model AirNet [42].\nDownload all the test results at\nhttps://github.com/mv-lab/InstructIR.\n14\nInput (RealSRSet)\nInstructIR\nInstructPix2Pix #1\nInstructPix2Pix #2\nFigure 18.

Gen-\nerating redundant code from scratch is both inef-\nficient and error-prone. To address this, we pro-\npose Refactoring for Generalizable Abstraction\nLearning (REGAL), a gradient-free method for\nlearning a library of reusable functions via code\nrefactorization, i.e. restructuring code without\nchanging its execution output. REGAL learns\nfrom a small set of existing programs, iteratively\nverifying and refining its abstractions via execu-\ntion. We find that the shared function libraries\ndiscovered by REGAL make programs easier to\npredict across diverse domains. On three datasets\n(LOGO graphics generation, Date reasoning, and\nTextCraft, a Minecraft-based text-game), both\nopen-source and proprietary LLMs improve in\naccuracy when predicting programs with REGAL\nfunctions. For CodeLlama-13B, REGAL results\nin absolute accuracy increases of 11.5% on graph-\nics, 26.1% on date understanding, and 8.1% on\nTextCraft, outperforming GPT-3.5 in two of three\ndomains. Our analysis reveals REGAL\u2019s abstrac-\ntions encapsulate frequently-used subroutines as\nwell as environment dynamics.1\n1. Introduction\nAn increasing range of tasks can be tackled by using a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate an executable program\nfor a given query; this paradigm has been applied in com-\nputer vision (Sur\u00b4\u0131s et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2018; Cho et al.,\n2023), robotics (Ahn et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2023), tool\nuse (Schick et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023),\nand general reasoning (Lyu et al., 2023). In all these cases,\nthe overall program generation framework is the same: an\n*Equal contribution\n1UNC Chapel Hill.

REGAL trains by refactoring primitive-only programs\ninto abstractions that are verified and stored. These abstractions\nhave two benefits: Reusability: Rewriting the same code multiple\ntimes leads to errors; Abstraction: REGAL makes prediction eas-\nier by allowing matching between the query and the abstractions.\nindividual query is given (along with an instructive prompt)\nto an LLM, which produces a program that, when executed,\nyields the desired result. Crucially, each program is gener-\nated independently (as shown in Fig. 1), with no reference\nto other queries or programs, and is composed of primitive\noperations, i.e. the domain language\u2019s built-in operations.\nThis approach has two major and related limitations:\n1) Lack of Reusability: Each program is designed as a\none-off script to solve a given example but is not reused\nby other examples. This increases redundancy and can\nresult in unnecessary errors: for two examples requiring\na shared subroutine, the model might correctly generate\nthe subroutine in one example and make a mistake in the\nother. For instance, in Fig. 1 (top) although the \u201cprimitive-\nonly\u201d model had previously generated nonagons, it uses the\nwrong interior angle (40.5). REGAL\u2019s draw small 9gon()\nfunction, on the other hand, executes correctly.\n2) Lack of Abstraction: Shared abstractions can improve\naccuracy by making skills more accessible to the model.\nWhen generating from primitives alone, the model must\ninterpret the query and generate the correct mapping from\nthe query to multiple primitives, requiring more reasoning.\nThe model\u2019s overall task becomes easier when it uses in-\nterpretable abstractions, as it is choosing a function name\nfrom a library instead of reasoning from scratch. In Fig. 1\n(bottom) a model augmented with abstractions can match\nthe sub-query \u201ca small 9 gon\u201d to draw small 9gon(); with\nthis part of the task simplified, the model reasons correctly\nabout the remaining code, while the primitive-only model\nfails to correctly embed the shape in a loop.\n1\narXiv:2401.16467v1  [cs.SE]  29 Jan 2024\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\nBoth limitations can be traced to a lack of global context as\nthe model sees each example separately, so it lacks a mech-\nanism for developing reusable abstractions. This differs\ngreatly from how humans write code: generally, developers\nmight start solving individual tasks with one-off solutions,\nbut quickly begin to develop a library of shared abstractions\nand code snippets for related problems, thereby reducing\nthe redundancy of their code, promoting efficiency and read-\nability (McConnell, 2004; Downey, 2012). Furthermore,\nfunctions can be verified: once we have tested a function,\nwe can rely on it in the future \u2013 something that is harder to\ndo for ever-changing one-off code snippets. Such abstrac-\ntion and verification is only sensible if the code synthesis\nprocess takes place over the course of multiple examples. In\nother words, if presented with a single, one-off task, there is\nno reason not to write a one-off script.\nWhile abstraction offers numerous benefits, it comes with\nthe risk of over-fitting, where a function tailored to a\nspecific example loses its generalizability. For instance,\na function like draw 9gon snowflake() may perfectly\nmatch one example but fails to generalize. Conversely,\ndraw small 9gon() is a more versatile function applicable\nin various contexts. The ability to produce novel programs\nusing primitive operations needs to be balanced with the\nbenefits of encoding subroutines into reusable abstractions\n(O\u2019Donnell, 2015). A similar balance between flexibility\nand efficiency appears in a variety of domains, including\nlanguage (O\u2019Donnell, 2015; Yang, 2016), biology (Futuyma\n& Moreno, 1988), manufacturing (Flynn & Jacobs, 1987),\nand programming (Ellis et al., 2021). To strike this balance\nin LLM-based program synthesis, we propose Refactoring\nfor Generalizable Abstraction Learning (REGAL). REGAL\nrefines abstractions iteratively by refactoring programs as\nwell as verifying, correcting, and pruning abstractions such\nthat overly specific or incorrect programs are improved upon\nor removed. REGAL relies on two key elements: a small\nset of programs using primitive operations (i.e. primitive\nprograms) and an execution environment (e.g., Python). Im-\nportantly, we show REGAL can learn from LLM-generated\nprograms without requiring any human annotations.\nREGAL follows a familiar train-test paradigm: during RE-\nGAL\u2019s modular training phase (see Fig. 2), it iteratively\nrefactors a small set of (query, program) examples to pro-\nduce a library of useful abstractions. REGAL uses an LLM\nto write helper functions for a batch of examples, which\nare verified against the expected result; successful helper\nfunctions are added to the library and the refactored pro-\ngram serves as an example of the function\u2019s usage. REGAL\ncan take success feedback into account to correct and debug\nerrors, and it periodically edits the helper functions to make\nthem more generalizable or \u2013 if they cannot be made more\ngeneric \u2013 prunes functions that are overly specific. Note\nthat the training is gradient-free, relying on a frozen LLM\nto refactor programs. In the testing phase, an LLM agent\nis tasked with predicting programs for test queries. The\nagent has access to REGAL\u2019s library of helper functions\nand demonstrations of how to use them.\nWe demonstrate the broad applicability of REGAL by test-\ning it on three diverse datasets: LOGO (Ellis et al., 2021;\nWong et al., 2021), a program induction task; a date reason-\ning task (Srivastava et al., 2022) known to challenge LLMs\n(Suzgun et al., 2022); and TextCraft (Prasad et al., 2023),\na text-based game for crafting Minecraft objects. Across\nthese tasks, REGAL significantly improves the accuracy\nof the predicted programs from various LLMs \u2013 especially\nopen-source LLMs \u2013 over a baseline that predicts primitive\nprograms (i.e. programs without REGAL\u2019s abstractions).\nFor instance, CodeLlama-13B\u2019s (Roziere et al., 2023) accu-\nracy increases by 11.5%, 26.1%, and 8.1% on LOGO, Date,\nand TextCraft respectively, surpassing larger models like\nGPT-3.5 (cf. Sec. 5). In Sec. 6, we show that REGAL\u2019s\nabstractions are reusable across examples, encapsulate key\ndomain functionalities, and we include an error analysis\nfurther highlighting the features making REGAL effective.\nSec. 6.3 reveals that REGAL can improve over the baseline\nwith minimal training examples, yielding major improve-\nments even with a 50% reduced training set.\n2. Related Work\nProgram Induction.\nProgram induction involves learning\na symbolic and programmatic mapping of inputs to outputs.\nHumans are adept at this kind of \u201crule-learning\u201d (Marcus\net al., 1999; F\u00a8urnkranz et al., 2012). REGAL aims to learn\na set of general functions that can be used to map inputs to\noutputs, i.e. a form of program induction. Ellis et al. (2021)\npresent DreamCoder, a method for combining program in-\nduction and synthesis that uses a wake-sleep Bayesian learn-\ning method to learn programs. Wong et al. (2021) extend\nthis work to incorporate language, using an alignment model\nas part of the joint model. Like Ellis et al. (2021), Grand\net al. (2023) adopt a similar symbolic search procedure, but\nuse an LLM to document abstractions. The symbolic search\nprocedure used by this line of past work has relied on data\nstructures for search that assume the domain language is\n\u03bb-calculus (Lake et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2021; Wong et al.,\n2021; Grand et al., 2023), which is not typically used for\nsoftware development. In contrast, REGAL uses an LLM-\nbased search procedure, allowing us to use more flexible\nlanguages like Python, which are more commonly used by\ndevelopers and better represented in pre-training data.\nProgram Synthesis and Tool Use.\nTool use by LLMs\n(Schick et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023) refers to a form\nof program synthesis or semantic parsing where an LLM\ngenerates API calls to external tools (e.g. calculators, search\nfunctions, etc.). This formulation has also been applied\n2\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\nto reasoning tasks (Lyu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022) as\nwell as other domains such as computer vision (Sur\u00b4\u0131s et al.,\n2023; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Cho et al., 2023), summa-\nrization (Saha et al., 2022), and robotics (Ahn et al., 2022;\nSingh et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; 2023). Past work\nhas attempted to induce tools from examples. Cai et al.\n(2023) induce tools using an LLM for reasoning tasks from\nBigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022); unlike our work, their\nsystem generates one tool per task. While this can offer\nbenefits for homogenous reasoning tasks (e.g. sorting words\nalphabetically), heterogenous tasks like the ones we explore\nrequire multiple functions. More akin to our work, Yuan\net al. (2023) and Qian et al. (2023) induce multiple tools\nfor vision and math tasks using an LLM-based framework\nwhich also includes retrieval-based parsing. In addition to\nfocusing on different domains, we place an emphasis on effi-\nciency, highlighting REGAL\u2019s performance on open-source\nLLMs (both only consider proprietary models like GPT-3.5).\nWe also differ in our focus on refactoring, and in the amount\nof information we provide to the refactoring model: unlike\nYuan et al. (2023) and Qian et al. (2023), we do not provide\nin-context examples of the kinds of tools we want the model\nto create, investigating instead what abstractions the model\nbuilds without domain-specific guidance.\nInduction in Interactive Domains.\nWang et al. (2023)\nalso induce functions in a Minecraft domain; however, theirs\nare written and stored based on one iteration. In contrast,\nour work refactors programs in a group and tests and refines\nthem across the training process, showing generalization\nin multiple domains. Other prior work learns a library of\nabstractions for planning in embodied domains (Wong et al.,\n2023; Majumder et al., 2023). While we share a similar\nmotivation, REGAL operates in the space of generating ex-\necutable programs instead of PDDL operators (Wong et al.,\n2023) or causal textual feedback (Majumder et al., 2023).\nSimilarly, our work aligns with prior efforts in LLM-based\ntask decomposition (Khot et al., 2023; Prasad et al., 2023),\nwhere skills are reused across multiple task instances. How-\never, these approaches manually identify atomic skills and\nrequire the LLM to repeatedly execute skills from scratch. In\ncontrast, REGAL provides a way of automatically discover-\ning such abstractions and reusing them via helper functions.\n3. Methodology\nIn this section, we describe the overall pipeline of\nour method: Refactoring for Generalizable Abstraction\nLearning (REGAL). REGAL consists of two phases: the\ntraining or induction stage where abstractions (i.e., helper\nfunctions) are learned, and the testing or synthesis stage,\nwhere abstractions are used to generate programs for test\nqueries. During training, as illustrated in Fig. 2, REGAL dis-\ncovers reusable abstractions by generating candidate helper\nfunctions, validating their correctness, and debugging via\nediting and pruning of ineffective helper functions.\nGiven a set of demonstrations (q, p) of queries q and gold\nprimitive programs p, we first preprocess the data to cluster\nexamples based on query similarity, described in Sec. 3.1.\nThe training stage then builds abstractions by refactoring\nprimitive programs in batches (Sec. 3.2), while the testing\nstage solves new queries by generating programs that glue\ntogether the learned abstractions with primitive operations\n(Sec. 3.3). We use GPT-3.5 for all our training prompts; at\ntest time we experiment with a range of LLMs, focusing on\nfreely available open-source LLMs.\n3.1. Preprocessing\nBefore training, we preprocess queries and programs (q, p)\nby (optionally) adding comments, clustering them into re-\nlated batches, and sorting them by approximate difficulty.\nAdding Comments.\nWe optionally add comments to align\nthe query with the primitive program, enabling the model\nto generate the correct abstractions. We present each (q, p)\npair to GPT-3.5 independently, with a prompt asking the\nmodel to comment p based on q; we then verify that the\ncommented code executes to the same result.\nClustering Data.\nIn order to form abstractions that are\nshared between examples, the refactoring LLM requires\na multi-instance scope, i.e. it must receive a batch of re-\nlated (q, p) tuples at a time. We implement this by cluster-\ning examples using an embedding of the query q. Specifi-\ncally, we embed each query using OpenAI\u2019s Ada embedding\nmodel (OpenAI, 2022) and hierarchically cluster the em-\nbeddings using Ward\u2019s agglomerative clustering algorithm\n(Ward Jr, 1963), implemented via Scikit-Learn (Pedregosa\net al., 2011). This gives us a tree of related examples, which\nwe topologically sort and group into batches of k related\nexamples, where k is a hyperparameter (see Appendix C for\nall hyperparameter values).\nCurriculum.\nIntuitively, shorter and easier programs\nshould contain abstractions that can be reused in harder,\nmore compositional programs, so we sort examples into a\ncurriculum (Bengio et al., 2009). To approximate difficulty,\nwe sort the batches based on the average length (in tokens)\nof their queries. See Appendix A.1 for preprocessing details.\n3.2. Training\nREGAL\u2019s training data consists pairs of queries q and prim-\nitive programs p. The training phase outputs: 1) the Code\nBank (C): the library of helper functions abstracted out\nduring training and 2) the Demo Bank (D): examples of the\nfunctions being used. As shown in Fig. 2, the training phase\nis an iterative process where the LLM receives as input a\nbatch of queries and primitive programs and then proposes\nhelper functions that can be abstracted (Stage 1). For each\nbatch, candidate helper functions are evaluated based on the\n3\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\nStage 3(b): pruneCodeBank()\nQ: craft yellow  wool\ninventory = check_inventory()\nget_object('8 terracotta')\ninventory = check_inventory()\nget_object('1 dandelion')\ncraft_object('1 yellow dye',\n['1 dandelion'])\ncraft_object('8 yellow\nterracotta',['8 terracotta',\n'1 yellow dye'])\nQ: craft yellow terracotta \nQ: craft light blue terracotta \nStage 1: refactorBatch()\nPrimitive Programs\nPrompt: Refactor this program\nwith reusable helper functions\n def get_ingredient(ingredient):\ndef  craft_and_get_ingredient(target,\ningredients):\n    for ingredient in ingredients:\n...\nreturn inventory\nhelper\nfunctions\nQ: craft yellow  wool\ncraft_and_get_ingredient('1\nyellow dye',\n['1 dandelion'])\ncraft_and_get_ingredient('8\nyellow terracotta',\n['8 terracotta', '1 yellow\ndye'])\nQ: craft yellow terracotta \nQ: craft light blue terracotta \nRefactored\n Programs\nPrompt: The following\nprograms failed with\nerror message...\ndef ...\nCode Bank\nDemo Bank\nadd verified\n helpers\nStage 2a: verify()\nStage 2b: retry()\nPrompt:  Helper function\ncraft_and_get_ingredient()\nis passing 2/3 times, please\nimprove it.\nStage 3(a): editCodeBank()\n def ...\nPrune functions with many failures\nEdit existing functions\nto improve passing rate\ndef ...\nCode Bank\nDemo Bank\nReGAL:\nadd examples of\nhelper usage\nFigure 2. REGAL starts by refactoring a batch of primitive programs to develop a set of modified programs and helper functions (Stage\n1). It then verifies the results of refactored programs, optionally retrying failed programs according to environment feedback. Useful\nhelper functions are added to the Code Bank along with example usage added to the Demo Bank (Stage 2). Periodically, we edit and\nprune the Code Bank to improve its functions (Stage 3). At test time, REGAL agent has access to the Code Bank, the Demo Bank, and\nthe remaining original programs. It is compared against a baseline agent which has access to a larger number of original programs.\ncorrectness of the refactored programs that occur in (Stage\n2a). After verification, failed examples are isolated into\na second batch and re-attempted (Stage 2b). To improve\nthe quality of the resultant Code Bank, we periodically edit\nhelper functions after a fixed number of batches to improve\ntheir pass rate (over unit tests) and prune ineffective helper\nfunctions (Stage 3). At the end of training, the resultant\nlibrary of helper functions \u2013 the code bank C \u2013 is stored\nfor further use during testing along with successful demon-\nstrations of refactored programs using helper functions \u2013\nthe demo bank D. Note that the training process can be re-\npeated over multiple epochs. Below we describe each stage\nin detail, with the overall algorithm detailed in Algorithm 1.\nStage (1): Refactoring Examples (refactorBatch).\nThe main module of the refactoring process takes as input\na batch of examples, a set of instructions, and the current\nset of helper functions in the code bank (if any). It prompts\nthe refactoring LLM for a set of new helper functions Hnew\nalong with refactored versions of each program that uses\nhelpers from Hnew when appropriate.\nStage (2a): Verification (verify).\nTo avoid introducing\nerrors, we need to verify the helper functions and refac-\ntored programs generated by the LLM by executing them\nand comparing the results to the original, i.e. determining\nif \u02c6p() = p(). The refactored program (q, \u02c6p) is stored as\na demonstration for future use by the agent (cf. Sec. 3.3)\nif it passes verification. Only helper functions that pass\nverification are added to C. We also store a record of pro-\ngrams that failed verification, as these will be crucial in\neditCodeBank() and pruneCodeBank(), which improve\nexisting functions and prune functions leading to failures.\nStage (2b): Feedback-based Retrial (retry).\nIf a pro-\ngram fails to pass verification, we optionally retry the refac-\ntoring process. In a follow-up prompt, we present failed\nprograms and their helper functions. We also include envi-\nronment feedback from execution (i.e. the output or error\nmessage produced).2 The refactoring LLM then produces a\nnew version of each failed program; these are verified and\ntheir helpers are added to C if correct.\nStage (3a):\nEditing Code Bank (editCodeBank).\nFrom the verify() module, some helper functions fail to\npass all unit tests because they contain incorrect abstrac-\ntions; for example, a function like draw triangle() might\nstart with a hardcoded value for a small size, leading it to\nfail on medium triangles. To update such functions, we\nconstruct a prompt for each function in D that shows the\nLLM passing and failing unit tests and asks it to propose\nedits to the function; this occurs once every editEvery iter-\nations, where editEvery is a hyperparameter. We replace\na function if it passes more unit tests after editing.\nStage (3b): Pruning Code Bank (pruneCodeBank).\nIn this module, we prune helper functions added to C that\nfail a majority of unit tests and cannot be improved further\nvia editing. For each function, we derive a score based on\nthe success rate of programs using the function; we set a\nthreshold below which functions are pruned (shared by all\ndomains). See Appendix A.2 for further details.\nWe use the dev set to select hyperparameter values, reported\nin Appendix C. All prompts can be found in Appendix D.\n3.3. Testing\nAt test time, we deploy a program synthesis \u2013 or semantic\nparsing \u2013 agent that makes predictions for test examples,\none at a time. Unlike related work on using learned tools\n2We do not include the output for LOGO as it is an image.\n4\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\n(Yuan et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2023),\nwe explore a variety of open-source LLMs, in addition to\na black-box LLM (GPT-3.5). Following effective strate-\ngies in semantic parsing and in-context learning (Shin &\nVan Durme, 2022; Roy et al., 2022; Bogin et al., 2023; Liu\net al., 2022; Yasunaga et al., 2023), for each test example,\nthe agent constructs a prompt with in-context learning (ICL)\nexamples retrieved from a training corpus, followed by a\ntest query. The examples are retrieved from the training data\nusing vector similarity between the training queries and the\ntest query. Further details in Appendix A.3.\nREGAL-augmented Agent. Our agent has access to the\ntraining data and code bank, as well as examples of refac-\ntored programs in the demo bank. The ICL budget (10\nexamples for all experiments) is split between primitive\ntraining examples and refactored ones.3 In addition to these\ndemonstrations, the augmented agent retrieves up to 20 rele-\nvant helper functions from the code bank, where relevance\nis measured by the similarity between the query and the\nfunction name and description. These helper functions are\nconcatenated into the prompt. The final input is a prompt\ncontaining the instructions, the retrieved helper functions,\nthe mixed ICL examples, and the test query. To encourage\nthe model to use helper functions, we include a ReAct-style\nprompt (Yao et al., 2023) that first asks the model to think\nabout which functions might be relevant based on the query\nand then generate the code.4\n4. Experimental Setup\n4.1. Datasets\nWe explore three datasets: LOGO, Date understanding,\nand TextCraft. A common thread through these datasets\nis that they contain heterogenous problems requiring mul-\ntiple helper functions as opposed to problems like sorting,\nwhich are challenging for LLMs but can be solved with a\nsingle function (Dziri et al., 2023). Statistics for the datasets\nare given in Table 4. Note that the number of primitives re-\nflects functions not built into Python \u2013 all models also have\naccess to all Python functions. See Appendix A.5 for further\ndetails about each dataset and its primitive operations.\nLOGO.\nLOGO is based on the Logo Turtle graphics\ndomain-specific language (Abelson & DiSessa, 1986), with\nwhich basic graphics can be drawn by controlling a pen (the\n\u201cturtle\u201d) that draws as it moves through space, using com-\nmands like forward(dist) and left(theta). The data\nwe use is based on the Ellis et al. (2021)\u2019s LOGO dataset,\n3We found it necessary to keep some primitive programs as\nICL examples, as not all test queries can be handled by helper\nfunctions. We treat this ratio of primitive and refactored programs\nas a hyperparameter.\n4Without these additional \u201cthought\u201d statements, we found the\naugmented agent rarely uses any helper functions.\nre-annotated by Wong et al. (2021). For easier prediction\nby LLMs, we parse the data into abstract syntax trees and\nwrite a set of rules for translating these into Python; we\nrelease this rewritten data. We use the \u201csmall\u201d train/test\nsplits (200/111) from Wong et al. (2021) and take 100 dev\nexamples from the \u201clarge\u201d train set.\nDate.\nWe use the date understanding task from BigBench-\nHard (Srivastava et al., 2022; Suzgun et al., 2022), which\nconsists of short word problems requiring date understand-\ning. We obtain silver programs from Lyu et al. (2023)\u2019s\npredictions. Specifically, we split their predicted programs\nfrom GPT-3.5 into train, dev, and test splits (66/113/180)\nand filter the train split by correctness.\nTextCraft.\nTo explore the utility of REGAL in LLMs-\nas-agent settings (Liu et al., 2023), we use the TextCraft\ndataset (Prasad et al., 2023) that requires an agent to craft\nMinecraft items within a text-only environment (C\u02c6ot\u00b4e et al.,\n2019). Each task instance in TextCraft consists of a goal\n(query) and a series of 10 crafting commands that contain\nrecipes for related items including distractors. Unlike Prasad\net al. (2023), who use TextCraft in an interactive setting\nwhere the LLM agent receives textual feedback from the\nenvironment at each step, we ask the agent to generate a\nsingle Python program for executing the entire task at once,\nmaking the task more challenging. We evaluate on the depth\n2 split of the test set used in Prasad et al. (2023) while using\na subset of depth 1 recipe examples for our dev set, giving\nus a train/dev/test split of 190/50/77.\n4.2. Baselines\nBaselines from Prior Work.\nWe compare REGAL\nagainst relevant external baselines from past work. However,\nnote that multiple methodological differences in our work,\nlike the use of ICL examples and the format of the output\nprogramming language, give our agent an inherent advan-\ntage over these baselines. Thus, we refer to these numbers\nprimarily to highlight the strength of our baseline agent. For\nLOGO, we use the \u201coffline synthesis\u201d numbers reported by\nGrand et al. (2023), which resemble our train/test setting;\nhowever, we note that Grand et al. (2023) predict programs\nin their original Lisp format and use a different agent model.\nFor the Date dataset, we run Lyu et al. (2023)\u2019s Faithful-\nCoT method on our custom test split using gpt-3.5-turbo.\nWhile the output format and models used are the same,\nboth our baseline and REGAL use retrieved examples for\nin-context learning, while Lyu et al. (2023) do not. Fur-\nthermore, our ICL examples are based on filtered programs\ngenerated by Lyu et al. (2023), leading to better performance\neven from our baseline agent.

Accuracy of baseline agents predicting primitive programs (Prim.) and\nthose augmented with REGAL helper functions (3 random seeds). Across domains\nand models, REGAL improves over a strong baseline programming agent with\naccess to the same number of ICL examples.\nBaseline Programming Agent.\nFor a more direct com-\nparison, we implement a baseline agent that has access to\nall the same data as REGAL but does not use abstractions,\nthus directly testing the role of REGAL abstractions in per-\nformance. Our baseline agent retrieves primitive programs\nfrom the training data; note that this is exactly the same\ndataset used for refactoring, i.e. the baseline LOGO agent\nretrieves demonstrations from the LOGO training examples.\nThe input to the baseline agent is a prompt with the same\noverall instructions as the REGAL agent (including a de-\nscription of the primitives), the ICL examples, and the test\nquery; the output is a program for the test query. We use a\nfixed budget of 10 ICL examples so that the baseline agent\nsees exactly as many demonstrations as the REGAL agent.\n5. Results\nComparison to External Baselines. Table 1 shows a com-\nparison of the baseline and REGAL agents the external\nbaselines from prior work. We first note that REGAL out-\nperforms the baselines in all cases. Furthermore, because of\nthe methodological differences detailed in Sec. 4, our base-\nline \u201cprimitive-only\u201d agent \u2013 equipped with ICL examples\nand using a code-specific LLM \u2013 also outperforms past base-\nlines on LOGO and Date. On TextCraft, the ReAct baseline\nfrom Prasad et al. (2023) has an advantage in that it receives\nenvironmental feedback, while our baseline does not. Never-\ntheless, even without feedback REGAL outperforms ReAct.\nThus, we compare primarily against our baseline agent, as\nthis provides a direct measure of the impact of abstractions\n(rather than the other changes made).\nREGAL outperforms the baseline agent. Table 2 shows\nREGAL\u2019s performance compared to the baseline agent\nusing primitive programs (described in Sec. 4.2). Over-\nall, for each model type, REGAL generally outperforms\nthe baseline by a wide margin; for example, REGAL pro-\nvides CodeLlama-13B a 11.5% boost on LOGO, allow-\ning it to outperform much larger models. Across datasets,\nCodeLlama-13B generally benefits most from REGAL ab-\nstractions. Table 2 also shows that large models also benefit\nAblation\nLOGO\nDate\nTextCraft\nREGAL\n55.0\n77.0\n34.12\n\u2013 retry\n48.3\n51.9\n30.43\n\u2013 curriculum\n36.3\n56.6\n28.78\n\u2013 pruneCodeBank\n52.0\n65.5\n25.26\n\u2013 editCodeBank\n53.3\n69.6\n27.35\nTable 3. Ablations of each optional REGAL component tested on\ndev splits with CodeLlama-13B. To remove the curriculum, we\nrandomly shuffle example clusters instead of presenting them in\norder of shortest query to longest query.\nfrom REGAL, with large gains for Lemur-70B and GPT-3.5\non LOGO and TextCraft. Finally, the largest models are\nnot necessarily the best: on LOGO and TextCraft, GPT-3.5\nis outperformed by open-source models, especially after\naugmentation, e.g. CodeLlama-13B with REGAL abstrac-\ntions is able to outperform GPT-3.5 without abstractions\nby 19.2% (it also outperforms GPT-3.5 with abstractions).\nThus, by running REGAL\u2019s training process on only \u223c200\nexamples, we can bring a much smaller open-source model\u2019s\naccuracy far beyond that of a (likely) much larger system.\nAblations. In Sec. 3.2 we describe REGAL\u2019s multiple com-\nponents; here we determine the utility of each by removing\neach one in isolation. Table 3 shows the results of these\nablations. We use the CodeLlama-13B agent due to the\nsize of REGAL\u2019s impact on it across tasks. We average\nthe performance across 3 seeds. Table 3 shows that each\ncomponent contributes to performance, with drops when\nany is removed. Across datasets, the largest performance\ndecreases come with the removal of retrials and with re-\nmoval of the curriculum. Retrials can not only increase the\nnumber of useful helper functions but can also help increase\nthe number of examples in the Demo Bank. Replacing\nthe curriculum with a random ordering also severely hurts\nperformance, e.g. leading to an 18.7% drop on LOGO.\nREGAL learns general, reusable functions. In Sec. 1, we\nstressed the importance of reusability. Specifically, gener-\nating programs without shared abstractions means that the\nmodel has to re-generate subprograms that could be reused\n6\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\nacross multiple test instances. We argue that REGAL im-\nproves over this paradigm by learning shared abstractions.\nThe results in Table 2 indicate that REGAL offers large\nimprovements over a baseline agent that lacks abstractions.\nHere, we verify that the abstractions learned are reusable,\ni.e. shared. Fig. 3 shows the number of times the top-5 most\ncommon REGAL functions are called in test programs pro-\nduced by the CodeLlama-13B agent. Across all datasets,\nwe see that the helper functions learned by REGAL are\ncommonly reused, with the most relative reuse in TextCraft.\nAppendix B.1 shows examples of these common functions.\n6. Analysis\n6.1. What kinds of programs are discovered?\nTo further examine what kinds of helper functions are dis-\ncovered, we examine the most frequent helper functions\nfor each domain from Fig. 3, summarizing the results be-\nlow. Refer to Appendix B.1 for function code. We find that\ndistinct trends emerge across domains.\nFor LOGO, REGAL discovers functions that encapsulate\ndifferent types of shapes. This is expected, as the LOGO\ndata was generated with these functionalities in mind, i.e.\nthe larger shapes are composed of objects like semicircles,\npentagons, and circles. For Date, REGAL tends to encap-\nsulate single operations, prioritizing interpretability with\nnames like get date one year ago(). While seemingly\nless complex than LOGO\u2019s functions, this approach aligns\nwith the importance of function naming in synthesis proce-\ndures, as highlighted by Grand et al. (2023). In TextCraft,\nthe functions uncovered by REGAL are more complex and\nreflect the dynamics of the game. Specifically, the func-\ntions include conditional statements for checking ingredi-\nents, reflecting the fact that in TextCraft, having the correct\ncrafting ingredients is a prerequisite for crafting an object\n(see craft and get ingredient() in Fig. 2 and Table 10,\nwhich is taken from the learned code bank C).\n6.2. Error Analysis\nTo better understand how REGAL aids program generation\nand also examine cases where it does not help, we perform\na two-part error analysis. First, we examine cases where the\nREGAL-augmented program was correct and the baseline\nagent\u2019s primitive program was incorrect. We then examine\nthe opposite set of cases, where the baseline program was\ncorrect but the REGAL program was incorrect.\nFig. 1 shows the first kind of comparison on LOGO using\nthe CodeLlama-13B model, where we qualitatively show\nan actual example that highlights the benefits of reuse and\nabstraction. The baseline program makes an error in cal-\nculating the polygon\u2019s interior angle when generating the\nprogram from scratch. This is avoided by the REGAL agent,\n0\n5\ndraw_med_semicircle\ndraw_sm_5gon\ndraw_sm_circle\ndraw_med_circle\ndraw_med_square\nLOGO\n0\n5\n10\nget_date_tdy\nget_date_1_week_ago\nget_date_1_week_fr_tdy\nget_date_1_year_ago\nget_formatted_date\nDate\n0\n20\ncraft_obj_with_ingr\ncheck_and_get_obj\ncraft_with_ingr\ncraft_item\nget_obj_fr_env\nTextCraft\nFigure 3. Function usage for CodeLlama-13B for the top-5 most\ncommon helpers. Functions are reused across programs.\nwhich simply uses a verified helper to generate the polygon\ncorrectly. The example also illustrates the importance of\nabstraction: as queries become more complex, generating\na solution from scratch becomes more challenging. The\nbaseline program reasons incorrectly about code outside\nof the shape, failing to use embed() correctly. Meanwhile,\nthe augmented program offloads reasoning about the shape\nto an easily-matched function, and is able to correctly use\nembed(). To quantify these trends, we manually inspect the\noutput of the baseline CodeLlama-13B on LOGO on the 25\ncases where the REGAL agent was correct, categorizing\nthem into errors involving reasoning (first example in Fig. 1)\nand shape-internal errors (second example); we find 16 rea-\nsoning and 9 shape errors. We also examine REGAL\u2019s\nfailure modes by manually inspecting all cases where the\naugmented agent failed and the baseline succeeded, again\nusing CodeLlama-13B on LOGO; there are 13 such cases.\nWe categorize them into three types:\n\u2022 Incorrect connector code: (7 exs.) the program fails due\nto mistakes in the primitive operations or control flow.\n\u2022 Incorrect/undefined function: (4 exs.) the code refers\nto non-existent functions, or incorrectly calls a function\nsimilar to the correct one.\n\u2022 Verification failure: (2 exs.) the program was correct but\nthe verification function gives a false negative.5\nThus, the most common error is a failure to predict primitive\noperations; here, the REGAL agent is at a disadvantage w.r.t.\nthe baseline agent, since both have the same ICL budget.\nThe baseline agent sees 10 ICL examples with only primitive\ncode, while the REGAL agent sees 5 primitive examples\nand 5 Demo Bank examples.\n5For example, for \u201ca small square next to a small 6 gon\u201d the\nagent generates the hexagon to the left of the square, where in the\nreference it is to the right.\n7\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\n25\n50\n100\n150\nSize of Training Data\n0\n10\n20\nSuccess Rate\nPrimitive Programs\nReGAL Programs\nFigure 4. REGAL programs yield a higher success rate (accuracy)\ncompared to primitive programs on TextCraft for different sizes of\ntraining set X using CodeLlama-13B.\n6.3. Sample Efficiency\nAs mentioned in Sec. 4.2, both baseline and REGAL agents\nrely on demonstrations of queries and gold programs (X) to\nretrieve most similar ICL examples. Additionally, REGAL\nuses the same demonstrations to learn helper functions in\nthe code bank C. We now study how the performance of\nboth agents scales with the size of annotated gold programs\nin train set X using the CodeLlama-13B model on TextCraft.\nFrom Fig. 4, we observe that the REGAL agent consistently\noutperforms the baseline agent as we vary the number of\ntraining examples. Notably, helper functions learned by\nREGAL yield a 2.56% improvement with as few as 25\ndemonstrations and an 8.45% improvement with nearly half\nthe size of the train set used in Sec. 5. Additionally, the per-\nformance of both the baseline and REGAL agents improves\nas the number of demonstrations increases. This is expected\nas both agents benefit from the retrieval of demonstrations\nsimilar to the test query as the training set becomes larger\nand consequently more diverse.\n7. Discussion and Conclusion\nFixed vs. Variable Costs.\nIn Sec. 5, REGAL was es-\npecially effective for open-source LLMs like CodeLlama.\nThis result is encouraging, as it indicates that we can bring\nfreely available and open-source models up to at least the\nsame performance as a proprietary, closed-source model (if\nnot more) using REGAL abstractions. Thus, we can convert\na variable cost \u2013 running an LLM on test data, which scales\nlinearly with the size of the test set \u2013 into the fixed cost of\nrunning REGAL to learn a library of helper functions.\nConnections to Semantic Parsing.\nExecutable semantic\nparsing (Winograd, 1972; Zelle & Mooney, 1996) typically\ninvolves mapping queries to a domain-specific language\n(DSL); the DSL specifies a set of abstractions that are useful\nfor a particular goal, e.g. SQL operations for querying\ndatabases, or spatial abstractions for robotics. These DSLs\nare typically defined by a human; one way to view REGAL\nis as a way of learning a DSL on top of an extremely general\nset of primitives. One of the benefits of REGAL is its\ngenerality: on three different domains, it is able to learn\nuseful abstractions without human intervention, while, in a\nstandard semantic parsing setting, these abstractions would\nneed to be manually specified.\nConnections to Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.\nOne way to view the functions discovered by REGAL is\nas low-level policies \u2013 or skills \u2013 composed of primitive\nactions. In this view, our system is similar to hierarchical\nreinforcement learning (HRL; Barto & Mahadevan, 2003),\nwhere tasks are factorized into skill selection and skills\nthemselves. In hierarchical frameworks, there is typically\na high-level controller policy that selects lower-level poli-\ncies. In our setting, the agent LLM acts as a controller,\nselecting from a set of skills, while REGAL\u2019s training stage\nis responsible for discovering a useful set of skills; this is\nakin to option discovery (Sutton et al., 1999), where closed-\nloop policies for specific skills are learned from a reward\nsignal. While REGAL has a similar hierarchical structure,\nit differs from HRL in that REGAL\u2019s skills are symbolic,\ninterpretable, and editable, as opposed to HRL skill policies,\nwhich typically have none of these features.\nLimitations.\nAs mentioned in connection to HRL, the\nfunctions REGAL learns are code-based. This can make\nthem less flexible than functions parameterized by neural\nnetworks (e.g. Andreas et al. (2016)), especially in domains\nwhere the environment can change dynamically. For in-\nstance, consider a navigation domain where an agent needs\nto get to the kitchen in various homes; depending on the\nprimitive actions, a function that succeeds in one home will\nlikely fail in another. However, REGAL\u2019s verification-based\npruning means that no function would be discovered for this\nnavigation task. Relatedly, not every domain has reusable\nabstractions, and not every example stands to benefit from\nthem. In many cases, the primitives for a domain are the\nright level of abstraction for that domain, e.g. if they already\nform a DSL. The abstractions are also not always ideal; in\nAppendix B.1 we see that REGAL\u2019s abstractions are not\nnecessarily the same as those a human would choose, e.g. a\nhuman would likely write a function like draw 5gon(size)\nrather than draw small 5gon().\nConclusion. We introduce REGAL, a gradient-free ap-\nproach to learning abstractions from a small set of examples.\nOur experimental results show that abstractions from RE-\nGAL improve the accuracy of programs predicted by a\nvariety of LLMs across three diverse domains. Furthermore,\nREGAL abstractions are reusable and general, allowing\nthem to be applied across examples for a given task. In our\nanalysis, we find that the functions learned by REGAL cod-\nify commonly-used subroutines as well as task dynamics.\nOur error analysis indicates that REGAL\u2019s improvements\ncome both from function reuse as well as simplification of\nthe reasoning involved in program prediction.\n8\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\n8. Broader Impacts\nOur work aims to learn symbolic functions given a set of\ndemonstrations; this has the potential to improve LLM pre-\ndictions not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of\ninterpretability and trustworthiness. Unlike the mechanisms\nof an LLM itself, a Python function is natively interpretable\nby a human and can be debugged. Furthermore, results ob-\ntained by executing such a function are inherently faithful,\nin that we can identify the exact trace of operations that gen-\nerated the result (Lyu et al., 2023). Our work does not have\nmore potential for negative use than typical LLM-based sys-\ntems and is subject to the biases inherent to these models and\nthe datasets they are trained on (Weidinger et al., 2021). As\nwith any system generating code, particular caution should\nbe taken before executing snippets with the potential to\ndamage the execution environment (Ruan et al., 2023).\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Yichen Jiang, Justin Chen, Jaehong Yoon, and\nSwarnadeep Saha for their valuable feedback on the paper.\nThis work was supported by NSF-AI Engage Institute DRL-\n2112635, DARPA Machine Commonsense (MCS) Grant\nN66001-19-2-4031, and Accelerate Foundation Models Re-\nsearch program.

Preprocessing\nAdding comments. To add comments, we first use a zero-\nshot prompt to break the query down into its constituent\nparts; for example, a LOGO query like \u201cPlace 4 small semi-\ncircles in a row\u201d is broken down into \u201c1. place semicircles\n2. small semicircles 3. in a row 4. 4 semicircles. We then\ninclude this decomposition in a prompt asking the model\nto add comments to the code. After adding comments, we\nverify the code first with exact match (excluding comment\nstrings) and then use execution accuracy if exact match fails.\nA.2. Training\nCode Bank Editing.\nOur Code Bank editing prompt asks\nthe model to produce a CoT-style output, first specifying\nwhy the failing unit tests failed and then proposing an edit\nfor the function. We then execute the stored demonstrations\nfor that function with the new version; if there are more\npassing cases after refactoring, we replace the function. If\nthe new function\u2019s signature differs from the old, we use a\nsimple prompt to refactor the unit tests to accommodate the\nnew function.\nCode Bank Pruning.\nFor each function, given a set of\npassing programs P and failing programs F, we compute\na score s = |P| \u2212 P\np\u2208F 1/np, where np is the number of\nfunctions used in p. In other words, the function receives +1\nfor each passing program it participates in, and a negative\nscore inversely proportional to the number of functions in\nthe program (since naively, the failure could be attributed\nto any of the functions). Functions are pruned if they have\nbeen used a sufficient number of times and s falls below a\nthreshold \u03b8 (set to 0 for all experiments).\nA.3. Testing\nIn our test-time agent, we use ChromaDB for indexing and\nretrieval6 with OpenAI Ada embeddings. ICL examples are\nretrieved from the training data and from the Demo Bank\nusing query similarity. We limit the number of Code Bank\nfunctions to 20, using the similarity between the query and\nthe function name for retrieval. The Code Bank is pruned\nonce before testing.\nA.4. Models\nFor GPT-3.5, we use the gpt-3.5-turbo version (0613). All\nCodeLlama models use the CodeLlama- \u2217 -Instruct-hf\nversions, and we use the lemur-70b-v1 version of Lemur.\n6https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/\nFor the latter two open-source models, we use the check-\npoints from HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2020).\nAlgorithm 1 REGAL: Training Algorithm\nInput: X = (q, p) // Training data: (query, program)\nParams: editEvery, pruneEvery, threshold \u03b8\nOutput: CodeBank C, DemoBank D\nC \u2190 \u2205, D \u2190 \u2205 // Initialization, i.e., no refactoring\n// Preprocessing data via clustering and sorting by difficulty\nP \u2190 preprocessAndGroupData(X)\nfor index g, batch G \u2208 P do\n// Refactor programs in group G based on the current Code-\nBank C.

We list the number of primitive func-\ntions in the programs (aside from built-in Python functions).\nA.5.1. LOGO\nLOGO data is generated from a synchronous text-code gram-\nmar, and pairs procedurally-generated language commands\nlike \u201cthree small triangles in a row\u201d with a correspond-\ning Turtle graphics program; however, the original LOGO\ndataset is expressed in a Lisp-style functional syntax. While\n12\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\nAlgorithm 2 REGAL: Testing Algorithm\nInput: Q, C, D, X // Test queries Q, Code Bank C, Demo\nBank D, Training data X = (query, program)\nParams: ICL Budget M, ICL Percentage r\nOutput: Predicted programs \u02c6P\nM demo \u2190 r \u2217 M\nM train \u2190 M \u2212 Mdemo\n\u02c6P \u2190 \u2205\nfor q \u2208 X do\nH \u2190 retrieve(q, C, 20) // retrieve up to 20 helper\nfunctions conditioned on the query\nXdemo \u2190 retrieve(q, D, M demo) // retrieve helper\ndemos from D\nXtrain \u2190 retrieve(q, X, M train) // retrieve primi-\ntive demos from X\nI \u2190 createPrompt(H, Xdemo, Xtrain)\n\u02c6p \u2190 LLM(I) // generate program\n\u02c6P \u2190 \u02c6P + \u02c6p\nreturn \u02c6P\nthis facilitates the application of helpful data structures for\nefficient code search (Ellis et al., 2021; Bowers et al., 2023),\nobject-oriented languages like Python are far more common\nin practice. As a result, they are represented more in LLM\npretraining data, which has been shown to contribute to\nparsing performance (Bogin et al., 2023). To account for\nthis, we write an AST-based parsing script to translate the\nLOGO dataset into Python.\nPrimitives.\nTable 5 describes the primitives available in\nthe LOGO library. Note that these are in addition to all\nPython primitives. We also provide all agents with several\nhard-coded values for long loops and small steps so that\nthey can draw round shapes. HALF INF is the number of\nsteps required to draw a semicircle. EPS DIST is a small\ndistance, and EPS ANGLE is a small angle.\nA.5.2. DATE UNDERSTANDING\nDate understanding involves both mathematical reasoning\nand parsing. Each question poses a word problem that re-\nquires reasoning about dates and times. For example, prob-\nlems ask questions like: \u201cOn May 9th, 2017 Jane bought\n40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs.\nWhat is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?\u201d. These\nkinds of questions are especially hard for LLMs to answer\ndirectly. Lyu et al. (2023) approached this task as a program\nprediction task, wherein an LLM predicts a Python script\nthat gives the answer to the question when executed. This\nparadigm is especially helpful for Date, as there are existing\nPython libraries that can perform math on dates, such as\ndatetime and dateutil. While predicting programs with\nthese libraries results in strong performance as compared\nto LLM-based reasoning, Lyu et al. (2023) method predicts\nPrimitive\nDescription\nforward(dist)\nmove forward dist units\nleft(theta)\nrotate left by theta de-\ngrees\nright(theta)\nrotate right by theta de-\ngrees\npenup()\nlift the pen (stop draw-\ning)\npendown()\nput the pen down (start\ndrawing)\nteleport(x, y, theta)\nmove to position (x, y)\nwith angle theta\nheading()\nget the current angle of\nthe turtle\nisdown()\ncheck if the pen is down\nembed(program, vars)\nruns the code in program\nusing the current context\nvars and teleports back\nto the original position.\nTable 5. LOGO Primitives\nprograms one at a time, leaving the benefits of shared sub-\nroutines on the table. We use the programs predicted by\nLyu et al. (2023) as a starting point for our refactoring pro-\ncess. Table 6 describes the Python libraries called by Lyu\net al. (2023)\u2019s programs, which we treat as the primitives\nfor Date.\nPrimitive\nDescription\ndate()\nreturns a date object\ntime()\nreturns a time object\nrelativedelta(time)\nperforms\naddition/sub-\ntraction of time, which\ncan\nbe\ndays,\nweeks,\nmonths, or years.\nstrftime(format)\nprints the date in the spec-\nified format\nTable 6. Date Primitives\nA.5.3. TEXTCRAFT\nTextCraft consists of goal queries paired with crafting\nrecipes. Recipes are presented with distractors, making\nthe parsing task challenging. Furthermore, the agent must\nreason about preconditions, as items can only be crafted\nwhen the requisite ingredients have been collected.\nThe queries ask for a particular item to be crafted. For\nexample the query can be \u201ccraft behive\u201d along with crafting\ncommands:\ncraft 4 oak planks using 1 oak log\ncraft 1 honeycomb block using 4 honeycomb\n13\nREGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions\ncraft 1 beehive using 6 planks and 3 honeycombs\ncraft 1 white bed using 3 white wool, 3 planks,\netc.\nThe environment has three primitives: inventory, craft,\nand get which we convert into Python variants, described\nin Table 7.\nPrimitive\nDescription\ngetObject(obj name)\nget obj name from the\nenvironment\ncraftObject(obj name,\n[ingredients])\ncraft obj name using the\nlist of ingredients\ncheckInventory()\nreturn the contents of the\ninventory\nTable 7.

These issues can limit the model\u2019s effectiveness in accurately interpreting\ncomplex visual information and over-lengthy contextual information. Addressing\nthese challenges is crucial for enhancing the performance and applicability of\nVLMs. This paper proposes the use of ensemble experts technique to synergizes\nthe capabilities of individual visual encoders, including those skilled in image-text\nmatching, OCR, image segmentation, etc. This technique introduces a fusion\nnetwork to unify the processing of outputs from different visual experts, while\nbridging the gap between image encoders and pre-trained LLMs. In addition, we\nexplore different positional encoding schemes to alleviate the waste of positional\nencoding caused by lengthy image feature sequences, effectively addressing the\nissue of position overflow and length limitations. For instance, in our implemen-\ntation, this technique significantly reduces the positional occupancy in models\nlike SAM, from a substantial 4096 to a more efficient and manageable 64 or even\ndown to 1. Experimental results demonstrate that VLMs with multiple experts\nexhibit consistently superior performance over isolated visual encoders and mark a\nsignificant performance boost as more experts are integrated.\nWe have open-sourced the training code used in this report. All of these resources\ncan be found on our project website1.\n1\nIntroduction\nCurrent large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential in tasks requiring\njoint visual and linguistic perception, such as image captioning [1], visual question answering [2],\nvisual grounding [3], and autonomous agents [4, 5]. VLMs harness large language models (LLMs) as\ncognitive foundation models to empower various vision-related tasks, while one vision component,\nsuch as CLIP [6], typically serves as auxiliary modules that provide additional visual perception\n[7]. However, the perception abilities of the individual vision models still lag behind, even in simple\n\u2217 Equal contributions.\n\u2020 Correspondence to: {tgui, qz}@fudan.edu.cn\n1 https://github.com/FudanNLPLAB/MouSi\narXiv:2401.17221v1  [cs.CV]  30 Jan 2024\nFigure 1: Left: Comparing InstructBLIP, Qwen-VL-Chat, and LLaVA-1.5-7B, poly-visual-expert\nMouSi achieves SoTA on a broad range of nine benchmarks.

This gap highlights a significant limitation in these models\u2019 capacity to\nprocess and understand visual information as effectively as they handle linguistic data. According\nto the operation of the vertebrate visual system, with each functional unit encoding different visual\naspects in parallel, retinal ganglion cells transmit distinct features to the brain [11]. This biological\nmechanism suggests a model structure where the varied visual information should be parallelly\nencoded by diverse perception channels.\nTo this end, the community has verified that each model, with its unique approach to vision processing,\ncontributes differently to understanding visual content [12]. CLIP, with its contrastive learning ap-\nproach, excels in aligning images with textual descriptions, providing a robust semantic understanding\n[6]. DINOv2, through its self-supervised learning paradigm at both the image level and patch level,\noffers significant advances in robust and stabilized feature extraction without relying on labeled\ndata [13]. LayoutLMv3\u2019s specialization in document AI tasks demonstrates the power of visual text\nprocessing [14]. [15] empirically investigated different visual tokenizers pre-trained with dominant\nmethods (i.e., DeiT [16], CLIP, MAE [17], Dino [18]), and observed that CLIP could capture more\nsemantics, whereas the other models excelled at fine-grained perception. However, on the multimodal\nleaderboard organized by OpenCompass2, the visual encoders of all open-source VLMs are based\non the pre-trained CLIP encoder family. Many researchers have pointed out the shortcomings of\nthe CLIP encoder, such as the inability to reliably capture even basic spatial factors of images [19],\nsuffering from object hallucination [20], and so on. In light of the distinct capabilities and limitations\nof these diverse vision models, a key question emerges: How can we incorporate the strengths of\nmultiple visual experts so that they work in synergy to improve overall performance?\nDrawing inspiration from biology, we take on the poly-visual-expert perspective and design a\nnovel model, similar to how the vertebrate visual system operates. Consequently, in the process of\ndeveloping VLMs with poly-visual experts, three problems are in major concern: (1) whether the\npoly-visual experts are effective; (2) how to better integrate multiple experts; and (3) how to avoid\nexceeding the LLM\u2019s maximum length with multiple visual experts?\nIn order to verify whether multiple visual experts are effective for VLMs, we construct a candidate\npool consisting of six well-known experts, including CLIP, DINOv2, LayoutLMv3, Convnext [21],\nSAM, and MAE. Using LLaVA-1.5 as the base setup, we explored single-expert, double-expert\ncombinations, and triple-expert combinations in eleven benchmarks. The results, as shown in Figure 1,\nindicate that as the number of visual experts increases, the VLMs acquire richer visual information\n(due to more visual channels), and the upper limit of the multimodal capability improves across the\nboard.\n2 https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal\n2\nEmbedding\nPoly-Expert Fusion Network\nOCR Expert\nSegmentation Expert\nOther Expert\nLayoutLMv3\nImage Encoder\nSAM\nImage Encoder\nAny Modality \nEncoder\nVision-Language Models \nImage Caption\nVQA\nOCR\nOthers\nCLIP\nImage Encoder\nSemantic Expert\nFigure 2: An overview of the MouSi model structure. The poly-vision-expert MouSi model supports\nthe integration of visual experts with various types and capabilities.\nIn existing single visual channel VLMs, the methods for transmitting visual signals are either the\nMLP projection network [22, 23] or the Q-Former network [24, 25]. To accommodate multi-channel\nsignal transmission from multiple experts, we modified both methods for poly-expert fusion networks\nseparately. The proposed method also compresses the local visual information by multi-patch-one-\ntoken for better transmission efficiency and reduces the quadratic computational cost of subsequent\nprocessing of VLMs.\nIn position-aware VLMs, vision tokens consume a staggering amount of positional embeddings.\nTaking a single-turn multimodal dialogue in VQA as an example, with the MAE expert, the number of\nvision tokens (about 4096) is more than 500 times higher than the number of text tokens (about 8.7).\nInspired by the fact that visual experts already have positional encodings, we believe it is redundant\nto again assign a VLM position embedding to each visual token individually. Therefore, we explore\ndifferent positional encoding schemes to effectively address the issue of position encoding waste. The\nresults show that the two schemes: sharing one position for all patches and 2D positional encoding\n(rows plus columns) are able to reduce the position consumption (in the case of CLIP, the PE used\ndrops from 576 to 24 or even 1), while the performance is still comparable.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce a poly-visual-expert VLM that synergistically combines the strengths of various\nvisual encoders to improve the overall capabilities of VLMs.\n\u2022 We tackle the challenge of vision token overflow in VLMs by proposing multi-patch-single-token\nprojection and efficient positional encoding solutions.\n\u2022 By experimenting with different combinations of experts, our results demonstrate enhanced perfor-\nmance (+1.53 with fair comparison) in multimodal tasks.\n2\nArchitecture\n2.1\nThe Overview\nWhen a user uploads an image of wind pollination in a conical inflorescence and asks \u201cWhich cones\nmake pollen?\u201d the image is processed in sequence through the encodings of the CLIP expert, the SAM\nexpert, and the LayoutLM expert, yielding three sets of visual representations.

The user\u2019s question is processed into text tokens by the LLMs\u2019\nEmbedding layer. Finally, MouSi generates the correct answer \u201cMale cones make pollen.\u201d by\nemploying its VQA capabilities to understand the vision-language question, and its OCR capabilities\nto recognize the answer text from the image.\nIn order to accomplish the above task, we propose MouSi, which consists of three fundamental\ncomponents:\n1. a multi-expert visual encoder, which combines the experts selected from a pool;\n2. a poly-expert fusion network, which is implemented as a simple projection fusion method or a\nQ-Former fusion method [26];\n3. a pre-trained open-source LLM (e.g., Vicuna v1.5).\nFigure 2 shows an overview of the MouSi architecture. The core of a Vision-Language Model (VLM)\nis typically an LLM which is pre-trained on large-scale textual corpus. In order to perceive the visual\nsignals, a vision encoder and vision-language connection layer are adopted to separately extract the\nvisual features and align them to the semantic space of LLM.\nThe VLM takes as input a sequence comprised of interleaved text and image segments, denoted as\nX = (. . . , T1, I1, T2, I2, . . . ), where text fragments T are processed by the tokenizer and embedding\nlayer of the LLM, and image segments I are fed to the vision encoder. To ensure the universality and\ngeneralizability of the vision encoder, it is common practice to freeze its pre-trained parameters. In\nthis paper, we rethink the design of the visual encoder in VLMs and aim to improve its capability by\nensembled experts.\n2.2\nMulti-Expert Vision Encoder\nAfter extensive investigation, we choose six vision encoders skilled in different domains, including\nCLIP [6], DINOv2 [13], LayoutLMv3 [14], Convnext [21], SAM [27], and MAE [17]. They differ\nsignificantly from each other in terms of input resolution, hidden size, model type, model size,\npre-training tasks, and training methods, as shown in Table 1.\nCLIP\nlearns the image-text alignment through contrastive learning. It is pre-trained on a large-scale\ndataset consisting of 400M noisy image-text pairs sourced from the internet. The vision encoder of\nCLIP is a Vision Transformer (ViT) with 300M parameters. The input resolution is fixed to 336\u00d7336,\nand the feature dimension is 1024.3\nDINOv2\ntrains a student network to mimic the behavior of a more powerful teacher network,\nwithout the need for any training labels. Two objective functions are utilized for self-supervised\npretraining: an image-level object that constrains the CLS tokens from the student network and\nteacher network, and a patch-level object that is applied to the extracted representations of masked\ninput. The Dinov2 vision encoder is a Vision Transformer (ViT) with 1.1B parameters. The input\nimage is preprocessed to 224\u00d7224 resolution and the hidden dimension is 15364.\n3https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336\n4https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov2-giant\n4\nLayoutLMv3\npre-trains multimodal Transformers for Document AI with unified text and image\nmasking. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-\npurpose model for both text-centric and image-centric Document AI tasks. The LayoutLMv3 vision\nencoder is a ViT architecture with 368M parameters. The input image is first preprocessed to the\nresolution of 224\u00d7224 and then encoded to 1024-dimension patch embeddings.5\nConvnext\nis a purely convolutional network (ConvNet) that introduces a fully convolutional\nmasked autoencoder framework (FCMAE) and a new global response normalization (GRN) layer to\nConvNeXt. ConvNeXt underwent pretraining on the ImageNet-22K dataset, significantly enhancing\nthe performance of the pure ConvNet across various recognition benchmarks. The ConvNeXt vision\nencoder we used has 200M parameters. The input resolution is 384\u00d7384 and the feature dimension\nis 768.6\nSAM\nis trained on a large-scale segmentation dataset, comprising 11 million images and over 1\nbillion masks, and achieves impressive zero-shot generalization. It is designed to efficiently predict\nobject masks from images with different types of prompts, e.g., text or point. SAM also adopts ViT as\na vision encoder with 637M parameters. The input resolution and hidden dimension are both larger,\ni.e., 1024\u00d71024 and 1280, respectively.7\nMAE\naims to reconstruct the original image given only partial observations (25% of the patches).\nThe ViT-Huge encoder paired with MAE achieved a new record at the time on the ImageNet-1K\ndataset with an accuracy of 87.8% and generalized very well. The MAE vision encoder has 630M\nparameters, while input resolution and hidden dimension are 1024\u00d71024 and 1280.8\nGiven a image I in the input sequence and a vision expert encoder ei(\u00b7), we can obtain the represen-\ntation vectors of n image patches:\nvi\n1, vi\n2, . . . , vi\nn = ei(I).\n(1)\nAssuming we have three experts (ei(\u00b7) \u2208 Rni\u00d7di, ej(\u00b7) \u2208 Rnj\u00d7dj, ek(\u00b7) \u2208 Rnk\u00d7dk), the final\nsequence of image representations VI is a concatenation of the three output sequences.\nVI = ei(I) \u2295 ej(I) \u2295 ek(I)\n= [vi\n1, . . . , vi\nni, vj\n1, . . . , vj\nnj, vk\n1, . . . , vk\nnk]\n(2)\nIt is worth noting that each expert outputs a different number (ni vs. nj vs. nk) and dimension (di vs.\ndj vs. dk) of representations, and we will handle these differences in the poly-expert fusion network.\nIn addition, the order of the experts could also have an impact on the results, which we specifically\nevaluate in the ablation experiments (Section 3.2.2).\n2.3\nPoly-Expert Fusion Network\nSince the dimension and number of output sequences are often different for different visual experts, a\nfusion network needs to be designed to unify the processing. Following LLaVA [7] and BLIP [28],\nwe propose an MLP projection fusion network and a Q-Former fusion network, respectively.\nMLP projection\nis a 2-layer (din \u2192 dhidden \u2192 dout) multilayer perceptron network. To simplify\nthe processing and to share the knowledge among multiple experts, we set the hidden dimension\n(dhidden) and the output dimension (dout) equal to the dimension (dmodel) of the LLM, and the\nsecond layer network (MLP(2) : dhidden \u2192 dout) parameters are shared among all experts. Given a\nspecific expert ei(\u00b7), the first layer network is defined as MLP (1)\ni\n: di \u2192 dhidden.\nVI = MLP(2) \u0010\nMLP(1)\ni\n(ei(I)) \u2295 MLP(1)\nj\n(ej(I)) \u2295 MLP(1)\nk\n(ek(I))\n\u0011\n(3)\nIn practice, multiple experts output a large number of vision tokens, which not only increases the\ncomputational cost and memory usage of the VLM but also tends to exceed the maximum length\n5https://huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-large\n6https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-convnext_large_d_320.laion2B-s29B-b131K-ft-soup\n7https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam-vit-huge\n8https://huggingface.co/facebook/vit-mae-huge\n5\nW\n(a) MLP Fusion\n(b) Q-Former Fusion\nW\nExpert i\nExpert i\nExpert j\nExpert j\nMouSi\nMouSi\nQ-Former\nQ-Former\nFigure 3: Examples of two types of multi-expert fusion networks. We show how the MLP method\ncompresses visual information with \u201c2-patches-1-token\u201d, and how the Q-Former method compresses\ninformation with 3 trainable queries. The modules with color gradients represent the sharing of\nparameters among multiple experts to transfer knowledge.\nlimit during inference. Therefore, we propose multi-patches-one-token projection to proportionally\nreduce the number of tokens output by each expert. Since image signals have local or sparse\nproperties, it is reasonable to use one token to represent neighboring patches. Take m-patch-\none-token for example, we make the input dimension of the first layer of the network m times\n(MLP(1) : din \u00d7 m \u2192 dhidden), and its hidden layer output vectors hi\n1, hi\n2, . . . are defined as\nfollows:\nhi\n1 = MLP(1)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nvi\n1\nvi\n2...\nvi\nm\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 ,\nhi\n2 = MLP(1)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nvi\nm+1\nvi\nm+2\n...\nvi\n2m\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 , . . .\n(4)\nwhere the [...] notation denotes concatenation over the vector dimension. The final number of vision\ntokens is reduced to 1\nm of the original. In practice, m is typically set from 2 to 8, which reduces cost\nwhile usually not losing performance on downstream tasks. If m is set too large, the information of\nthe image might be lost.\nQ-Former network\nis a trainable Querying Transformer module and proposed to bridge the gap\nbetween a frozen image encoder and a pre-trained LLM. It extracts a fixed number of output features\nfrom the vision encoder, independent of input image resolution. We create a set number of learnable\nquery embeddings as input to the Q-Former. The queries interact with each other through self-\nattention layers, and interact with frozen image features ei(I) through cross-attention layers. The\noutput queries of the last layer are projected to the input layer of the LLM. We use the pre-trained\nparameters in BLIP-2 as initialization to accelerate convergence and, similar to the second layer MLP\nnetwork, share the parameters among all experts. Since the dimension of query embeddings is equal\nto 768, we add an additional linear transformation (Wi \u2208 Rdi\u00d7768) for each expert.\nVI = Q-Former (Wi (ei(I)) \u2295 Wj (ej(I)) \u2295 Wk (ek(I)))\n(5)\nThe ablation study in Section 3.2.1 shows that the MLP fusion network fuses better than the Q-Former\ndespite having fewer parameters and not being pre-trained.\n2.4\nDifferent Positional Encoding Schemes\nAlthough the m-patch-one-token operation or defining a small number of queries in the Q-Former has\nbeen able to reduce the proportion of vision tokens, the occupation of position embeddings by vision\ntokens should not be underestimated during inference. Inspired by the fact that visual experts already\nhave positional encodings (e.g., 2D position encoding in ViT [29]), we believe it is redundant to again\nassign a VLM position embedding to each visual token individually. As shown in Figure 4, this report\nexplores four positional encoding schemes for improving the assignment of position embeddings\n(PEs):\n6\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n7\n8\n8\n8\n8\n5\u2a011 5\u2a012 5\u2a013 5\u2a014\n6\u2a011 6\u2a012 6\u2a013 6\u2a014\n7\u2a011 7\u2a012 7\u2a013 7\u2a014\n8\u2a011 8\u2a012 8\u2a013 8\u2a014\n\uff08a\uff09original\n\uff08b\uff09share-all\n\uff08c\uff09share-by-row\n\uff08d\uff09share-by-row&col\nP\nPE from LLM\nImage\ntext1 text2 text3 text4\nFigure 4: Diagram of the four positional encoding schemes.

All of them can significantly alleviate\nthe out-of-maximum-length problem, but the question is how much do they affect the performance\nof VLM? We report ablation results in Section 3.2.3.\n3\nExperiments\n3.1\nMain Results\nThe main focus of our experiments is to conduct explorations of single-expert, double-expert, and\ntriple-expert ensembles. Following LLaVA-1.5 [22], our training pipeline consists of two phases. In\nphase 1, or the pre-training phase, we freeze the text-only LLM and the multi-expert encoder, and\ntrain the poly-visual fusion network from scratch to align the representation space of both. After\ntraining on a large-scale weakly-supervised (with noise) dataset, the text-only LLM is already capable\nof multimodal input and comprehension. In phase 2, or the fine-tuning phase, we unfreeze the\nLLM and further train it together with the poly-visual fusion network on diverse and high-quality\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets. The construct of the datasets and the training configuration for\nboth stages are detailed as follows.\nDatasets.\nDuring the pre-training phase, we utilized the LCS-558K dataset, which comprises\n\u223c558K image-text pairs from the LAION-CC-SBU collection, annotated with BLIP-generated\ncaptions. During the fine-tuning phase, we mixed 10 diverse and high-quality SFT datasets containing\nVQA, OCR, region-level VQA, visual conversation, and language conversation data. To reduce\ntraining costs and enhance efficiency, we adopted the same preprocessing strategy as LLaVA-1.5,\nultimately obtaining \u223c665K SFT samples. All data splits are concatenated together and sampled\nwith the same probability. We selected 9 of the 12 evaluation benchmarks for LLaVA-1.5 (excluding\nLLaVA-Bench that rely on unstable GPT4 responses, as well as VisWiz [30] and MME [31] for the\nwebsite crashed), including VQAv2 [32]; GQA [33]; SQAI : ScienceQA-IMG [34]; VQAT: TextVQA\n[35]; POPE [20]; MMB & MMBCN: MMBench & MMBench-Chinese dev results [36]; SEEDI :\nSEED-Bench-IMG [37]; MM-Vet [38]. Detailed statistical information can be found in Appendix A.\nHyperparameters.\nFor main results, we keep all training hyperparameters roughly the same as\nthe LLaVA series [7, 22]. We present a detailed description of the hyperparameters in Appendix B.\nFor the MLP fusion network, we set m in m-patches-one-token from 1 to 16 to avoid exceeding the\nmaximum length for training and inference. For the Q-Former fusion network, we set the number of\nqueries per expert to match the number of outputs from the MLP fusion network. The parameters of\nthe Q-Former fusion network are initialized using the pre-training parameters of BLIP-2 [26].\n7\nModel\nParam.

The CLIP ex-\npert achieves the best performance in all 9 benchmarks, fully explaining why it has become\nthe dominant choice of vision encoder for VLMs. Comparing the different attributes of the ex-\nperts, CLIP ranked 5th in terms of the number of parameters, 3rd in terms of resolution, and 2nd\nabove the size of the pre-training data, none of which had an absolute lead. Therefore, we guess\nthat its main advantage lies in its image-text matching pre-training task, which has multimodal\nalignment capability in advance. Overall, the performance ranking of the six experts is roughly\nCLIP>ConvNeXt>DINOv2>SAM>MAE>LayoutLMv3. In addition, LayoutLMv3 is an undis-\nputed expert in OCR and SAM in image segmentation but performs poorly as a single visual encoder\nin VLM. A natural question is whether multi-expert fusion can activate their capabilities in their\nspecialized fields?\n3.1.2\nDouble Vision Experts\nModel\nParam.

The \u2206-marked rows are\ncompared to the single-expert method. Where blue cells indicate the double-expert model is better,\nand red cells indicate the single-expert model is better.\n8\nThe current mainstream open-source VLMs have only one visual encoder, i.e., a single visual channel.\nHowever, multimodal tasks are diverse, and different tasks require different visual signals. In this\nsubsection, we investigate whether dual-channel, i.e., double visual experts can outperform single\nexperts on various tasks. We combine the strongest CLIP expert with other experts to construct a\ntotal of four double-expert combinations.\nTable 3 shows the performance of the double-expert vision encoder on the nine benchmarks, and rela-\ntive to each single expert belong them (a positive number indicates that the double expert outperforms\nthe single expert). The results show that the \u201cDINOv2+CLIP\u201d experts, \u201cLayoutLMv3+CLIP\u201d experts,\nand \u201cConvNeXt+CLIP experts\u201d three double-expert encoders outperform the arbitrary single encoder\nin almost all cases (23/27). The results indicate that two visual channels do outperform a single visual\nchannel in terms of multimodal capabilities, demonstrating that multi-expert collaboration is feasible.\nFor the \u201cSAM+CLIP\u201d combination, the results are surprising, with the dual expert outperforming the\nsingle expert in only 2/9 benchmarks, and lagging behind the single expert (specifically CLIP) in\nthe remaining 7 benchmarks. The main reason might be that SAM encodes much more signals than\nCLIP (4096 patches vs. 576 patches), and fusion networks require a large information compression\nratio. The most efficient CLIP channel is also compressed at this point, leading to performance\ndecreases. There is a need to develop a more efficient visual information transfer network for experts\nwith massive patches such as SAM.\nComparing the performance between double-expert methods, we found that the best double-expert is\nDINOv2+CLIP, rather than the ensemble of the best single expert and the second-best single expert,\nConvNeXt+CLIP. It indicates that superior performance as a single expert does not necessarily imply\noptimality when ensembled. Since ConvNeXt and CLIP have considerable overlap in their training\nmethods and training corpora, leading to the extraction of similar visual information, whereas the\nself-supervised DINOv2 and the weakly-supervised CLIP complement each other, resulting in a more\neffective ensemble. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that LayoutLMv3, which performed the\nworst as a single expert, shows significant improvement when collaborating with CLIP, performing\nthe best on four benchmarks and ranking overall just behind DINOv2+CLIP. Even SAM, whose\ninformation was compressed, achieved the highest performance on the ScienceQA-IMG benchmark.\nTherefore, we can conclude that when paired with the versatile visual expert CLIP, other experts can\nfocus on capturing supplemental visual information to further enhance performance.\n3.1.3\nTriple Vision Experts\nModel\nParam.

As shown in\nTable 4, the three-expert approach wins in 4/6 cases in comparison with the two-expert at the data\nsize of LLaVA-1.5. The best-performing three-expert is LayoutLMv3+DINOv2+CLIP, followed\nby ConvNeXt+LayoutLMv3+CLIP, and finally ConvNeXt+DINOv2+CLIP. Among them, model\nLayoutLMv3+DINOv2+CLIP has the largest number of parameters, reaching 8.8 billion. We suspect\nthat the main reason limiting the performance of the triple-expert methods is the insufficient amount of\ndata. We train the MouSi on larger (1647K) augmented data and observe more significant performance\ngains in Section 3.4.\n9\n3.2\nAblation Study\n3.2.1\nEffect of Fusion Methods\nModel\nParam.

We exchange the order of experts in\n\u201cDINOv2+CLIP\u201d, and \u201cConvNext+CLIP\u201d.\nDue to the autoregressive and position-aware characteristics of LLMs, even if the visual experts are\nexactly the same, a different order alone could affect the final output. Table 6 presents the effect of\nswapping the order between double experts. The swap results of groups \u201cDINOv2 & CLIP\u201d and\n\u201cConvNeXt & CLIP\u201d indicate that order can cause some fluctuations in performance, with gains (7 of\n22) on some benchmarks and losses (15 of 22) on others. In general, placing CLIP later brings about\nbetter overall performance. Because CLIP is the most effective single expert and the expert placed\nlater is closer to the generation, we speculate that the latter-positioned expert has a slightly greater\neffect on the response. This phenomenon is also consistent with the characteristics of binocular vision\norganisms, such as humans, where one eye is the dominant eye and the other is the non-dominant eye.\nThe brain typically favors the input from the dominant eye when processing visual information [39].\n3.2.3\nEffect of Different Positional Encoding Schemes\nModel\nVQAv2 GQA SQAI VQAT POPE MMB MMBCN SEEDI MM-Vet Avg.\nDifferent Positional Encoding Schemes\nOrigin\n78.5\n62.0\n66.8\n58.2\n85.9\n64.3\n58.3\n66.2\n30.5\n63.4\nShare-all\n79.0\n62.4\n68.4\n58.4\n86.3\n67.4\n58.2\n65.7\n31.7\n64.2\nShare-by-row\n75.0\n57.2\n63.4\n51.7\n86.1\n46.4\n43.4\n55.6\n31.9\n56.7\nShare-by-row&col\n79.0\n62.6\n68.3\n58.1\n86.3\n66.0\n58.8\n66.2\n30.6\n64.0\nTable 7: Comparison of four positional encoding schemes on 9 benchmarks.\n10\nBenchmark\nText Prompt\nLayoutLMv3\nDINOv2\nCLIP\nMMB\n61.1%\n0.14%\n2.76%\n11.1%\nMMBCN\n58.8%\n0.16%\n2.92%\n10.7%\nTable 8: Average attention probability (%) allocation of Mousi\u2019s output on each visual expert.

The 2D positional coding (share-\nby-row&col) also improves the average performance by 0.6. However, share-by-row impairs the\nperformance of the model, probably because row sharing corrupts the position information of the\nvisual coder itself. The experimental results validate our conjecture that it is redundant to re-assign\nLLM positional encoding to each vision token that already has positional information.\n3.3\nAnalysis\nAmong multiple visual encoders, one question worthy of analysis is the contribution of different\nexperts to the model\u2019s output. Attention mechanisms are commonly used interpretive tools in\nTransformer networks. Here, we take a three-expert encoder as an example and analyze the average\ncontribution of each expert across two multilingual benchmarks, MMB-English and MMB-Chinese.\nThe contribution of one sample is the output token\u2019s average attention to each expert\u2019s representation.\nAveraging over the entire dataset yields the overall average contribution.\nTable 8 shows the individual contributions of the text prompt, LayoutLMv3, DINOv2, and CLIP to\nthe output. The results indicate that the contribution of the text prompt to the answer is significantly\nhigher than that of the visual experts. This is as expected. Firstly, the text prompt defines the format\nof the VLM\u2019s response, necessitating attention to the prompt during output, and secondly, the text\nhas a higher information density than images, hence the average attention is usually higher for\ntext. Comparing the three visual experts, we find that their contributions in descending order are\nCLIP, DINOv2, and LayoutLMv3. CLIP still demonstrates the characteristics of being the dominant\neye or the primary visual channel. DINOv2\u2019s contribution is approximately 20% of CLIP\u2019s, while\nLayoutLM\u2019s contribution is minimal, at only 1% of CLIP\u2019s.\nA natural question that follows is, given the existence of visual channels with very low contributions,\nis there a necessity for them to be part of the model? Figure 5 shows our perturbation experiments\non the triple-expert LayoutLMv3+DINOv2+CLIP model. The output tokens of the corresponding\nexpert are fully masked when generating answers, thus exploring the effect of the current expert on\nthe output. In Case 1, the user asks MouSi a simple question: \u201cWhere is the dog in the picture?\u201d. No\nmatter which visual expert\u2019s output signal is masked, the remaining two visual channels are sufficient\nto correctly answer the location question \u201con top of\u201d. More details are provided when CLIP experts\n11\nare present, such as outputting \u201cwooden table\u201d instead of just \u201ctable\u201d. In Case 2, the user asks MouSi\n\u201cHow many dogs are there in the picture? What colors are they?\u201d The perturbation results show that\nonly three experts working together can answer the question correctly. The absence of any one expert\nresults in an incorrect answer, which demonstrates the difference in the information captured by the\nmultiple visual channels of the poly-visual-expert VLM. Some multimodal tasks rely on the synergy\nof multiple channels, which a single channel (i.e., a single expert VLM) does not have.\n3.4\nData Enhancement\nModel\nParam.

Param. indicates the number of\nparameters.\nAfter comprehensively exploring the architecture and effectiveness of the poly-visual-expert VLM,\nwe further augmented the data from LLaVA-1.5 to explore the upper limits of the performance of the\npoly-visual-expert VLM.\nSetting\nDuring the pre-training phase, we used 1.2 million pre-training data to replace the original\n558K data in LLaVA-1.5. Where 100K data were generated by GPT4v, and the remaining data\nwere produced by a supervised trained image captioner, which included the 558K images but with\nhigher quality captions. During the SFT phase, we expanded the 665K SFT data to 1647K. Detailed\nstatistical information can be found in Appendix A. For data enhancement results, we keep all training\nhyperparameters roughly the same as the main results. Besides the number of iterations varies with\nthe increase of data size.\nTable 9 reports the results for LLaVA-1.5 (i.e., single CLIP expert), LLaVA-1.5 after data enhance-\nment, and MouSi (with triple-expert \u201cLayoutLM+ConvNeXt+CLIP\u201d) after data enhancement on\nnine benchmarks. The results show that with data enhancement, the poly-visual expert VLM can\nfurther improve performance (7/9) compared with single-expert VLM. The average performance\nimproved by 1.0, yet the number of parameters increased by only 300M. Comparing the effects of\ndata augmentation, we observe that the single-expert approach improved by 4.4, and the triple-expert\nmethod improved by 3.9. This confirms that the potential of poly-visual-expert VLMs has not yet\nbeen fully tapped and that more data can significantly enhance the capabilities of VLMs. Finally,\ncompared to mainstream VLMs, MouSi performs the best in 8 out of 9 benchmarks while exhibit-\ning the second-best performance in the remaining one, demonstrating strong multimodal assistant\ncapabilities.\n4\nCase Study\nFigure 6 shows the case study of MouSi on seven tasks, including Complex Image Captioning,\nVisual Text Generating, OCR Interpreting Reasoning with World Knowledge, Visual Math Problem\nSolving, Complex Counting, and Visual Grounding. MouSi is able to successfully follow a variety of\nmultimodal instructions, allowing for flexible interaction with humans.\n12\nFigure 6: Qualitative examples generated by Mousi.\n5\nRelated Work\nVision-Language Models (VLMs)\nrepresent the confluence of linguistic and visual processing,\nand they have shown promising results in various applications. Early models such as VisualGPT [45]\nprovided foundational work in image captioning, while the BLIP series [28, 26] extended capabilities\nto include visual question answering. Flamingo [46] and Kosmos-1 [47] demonstrated effective\nmulti-modal understanding within image-text frameworks. LLaMA adaptations like LLaVA [7] and\nMiniGPT-4 [48] utilize projection layers for connecting vision encoders and LLMs. CoGVLM [23]\nreplicated close to double the parameters to build visual experts specializing in visual tokens, while\nsimilar to our exploration of positional encoding, they used share-by-one rather than the original\napproach. Qwen-VL and BLIP series [24, 25] use the Q-Former network to bridge text and image.\nVisual Encoding Experts\nThe success of vision language models pivots upon adept visual encod-\ning; hence, a curated selection of vision encoders, each with its own domain expertise, is crucial\nfor holistic visual understanding. The CLIP model by [6] employs contrastive learning to align\nimages and text, effectively facilitating semantic image understanding. Dinov2 [13] from Meta\n13\nadvances self-supervised learning through a student-teacher network paradigm, developing spatial\nunderstanding with a robust ViT framework. Microsoft\u2019s LayoutLMv3 [14], on the other hand,\npresents a multimodal Transformer adept in document AI by bolstering word-patch alignment in\na ViT model. Convnext [21] reintroduces the efficacy of ConvNets with its FCMAE framework\nand GRN layer, finetuned with ImageNet-22K data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) by [27]\nshowcases exceptional segmentation prowess, trained on a vast dataset to champion zero-shot gener-\nalization in its ViT infrastructure. The MAE [17] demonstrated remarkable denoising self-supervised\ncapabilities, reconstructing images with a high degree of fidelity. Yet these encoders, notably CLIP,\npossess limitations as evidenced by [19] highlighted its struggles with spatial orientation and [20]\u2019s\nfindings on object hallucination. Moreover, [15] recognized a division of competencies, noting\nmore semantics in fully/weakly supervised encoders like CLIP, while others excel in fine-grained\nperception.\nMulti-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nhave been evolving rapidly, with models like\nImageBind-LLM [49] and PandaGPT [42] incorporating richer modality inputs, including audio and\nvideo. There is also a growing focus on region-level parsing [41], text-to-image generation [50],\nand 3D understanding [51]. These models show that MLLMs can achieve meaningful performance\nacross a range of tasks. MouSi, as a poly-visual-expert VLM, is easily adapted to multi-modal-expert\nmodels, which will be our future work.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we push the boundaries of vision-language models (VLMs) by proposing a novel\npolyvisual system that closely mirrors the complex and multi-dimensional nature of biological\nvisual processing. Leveraging the unique attributes of diverse visual encoders, our system unifies\ntheir strengths to enrich the multimodal understanding of VLMs. Furthermore, we address the\nchallenge of efficiently integrating visual information into language models by introducing techniques\nsuch as multi-patch-single-token projection and optimizing positional embeddings. This not only\nallows us to manage the overflow of vision tokens that typically burdens VLMs but also retains\nthe models\u2019 semantic and spatial reasoning capabilities. Through rigorous experiments across a\nsuite of benchmarks, we demonstrate that our polyvisual approach significantly enhances the VLMs\u2019\nperformance, outpacing existing models in accuracy and depth of understanding. These results\nsupport our hypothesis that a well-integrated assembly of expert encoders can lead to a substantial\nimprovement in handling complex multimodal inputs.\nReferences\n[1] Agrawal, H., K.

Sinclair\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nUnited States\nsinclair@cs.wisc.edu\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models increasingly rely on distributed tech-\nniques for their training and inference. These techniques\nrequire communication across devices which can reduce\nscaling efficiency as the number of devices increases. While\nsome distributed techniques can overlap, and thus, hide this\ncommunication with independent computations, techniques\nsuch as Tensor Parallelism (TP) inherently serialize com-\nmunication with model execution. One approach to hide\nthis serialized communication is to interleave it with the\nproducer operation (of the communicated data) in a fine-\ngrained manner. However, this fine-grained interleaving of\ncommunication and computation in software can be difficult.\nFurthermore, as with any concurrent execution, it requires\ncompute and memory resources to be shared between com-\nputation and communication, causing resource contention\nthat reduces overlapping efficacy.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose T3 which ap-\nplies hardware-software co-design to transparently overlap\nserialized communication while minimizing resource con-\ntention with compute. T3 transparently fuses producer op-\nerations with the subsequent communication via a simple\nconfiguration of the producer\u2019s output address space and\nrequires minor software changes. At the hardware level, T3\nadds a lightweight track and trigger mechanism to orches-\ntrate the producer\u2019s compute, and communication. It further\nuses compute-enhanced memories for communication\u2019s atten-\ndant compute. As a result, T3 reduces resource contention,\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

This\ntremendous, transformative effect has been enabled by a\nvirtuous synergy of (1) better hardware systems, (2) larger\ndatasets, and (3) improved ML structures and algorithms\nthat further benefit from more efficient hardware and larger\ndatasets. This is especially true for Transformers, which have\nbecome popular for a wide range of tasks [8] and have shown\nconsiderable strides in artificial general intelligence [73].\nTransformers have had exponential growth in datasets and\nmodel size: parameters have increased from 340 million in\nBERT [14] to 540 billion in PALM [12]. Accordingly, their\nmemory and computational demands have also increased,\nmaking them increasingly reliant on distributed techniques:\nmultiple accelerators (e.g., GPUs) pooling their collective\nmemory capacities and compute capabilities to collabora-\ntively execute a DNN. However, the resulting communication\nbetween devices has become a significant proportion of their\nexecution time and has limited the scaling efficiency with\nincreasing device count [36, 49, 64].\nTransformers frequently use two key distributed tech-\nniques in conjunction: data parallelism (DP) and model par-\nallelism (MP). DP parallelizes training by partitioning the\ndataset and replicating the model across devices, requiring\ncommunication and aggregation (all-reduce) of gradients.\nConversely, MP partitions large models that cannot fit in a\nsingle device\u2019s memory. Tensor-parallelism (TP), a type of\nMP, requires an all-reduce of layer outputs between devices\nas well. Among these distributed techniques, TP\u2019s communi-\ncation typically lies on the critical path of model execution,\nas shown in Figure 1(a) and can be a significant proportion\nof runtime (\u223c45% [64]), resulting in a sub-linear increase in\nthroughput as the number of devices increases.\nWhile some prior works have sped up communication by\nup to 2\u00d7 with in-network computation, they are topology-\ndependent (requiring switches) and further, cannot eliminate\nserialized communication from the critical path [36]. Dis-\ntributed techniques with abundant coarse-grained indepen-\ndent compute (e.g., DP) often overlap (and hide) communica-\ntion with independent computations to improve efficiency.\nAlthough serialized communication scenarios also offer such\npotential, they require a fine-grained overlap of computa-\ntion and communication, which presents its own challenges.\nEnabling their fine-grained overlap in current systems ei-\nther requires expensive fine-grained synchronization [25]\nor changes to matrix multiplication (GEMMs) kernels which\ncan be disruptive to GPU software infrastructure [86] (Sec-\ntion 3.1). Furthermore, overlapped compute and communica-\ntion contend for both compute units and memory bandwidth,\nreducing overlap\u2019s efficacy [25, 86] (Section 3.2). Prior ap-\nproaches that reduce contention only address coarse-grained\noverlap of compute and communication in cases like DP and\nlack support for fine-grained overlap in serialized collec-\ntives [71]. Moreover, they rely on dedicated accelerators.\nTherefore, no existing technique achieves a transparent overlap\nof serialized communication with computation while minimiz-\ning resource contention.\nTo overcome these, we propose T3 (Figure 1(b)). T3 trans-\nparently fuses producer operations with the subsequent com-\nmunication by configuring the producer\u2019s output address space\nto initiate communication directly on the producer\u2019s store,\nrequiring minimal application changes. It uses a lightweight\nand programmable hardware tracker to track the producer/-\ncommunication progress and triggers communication using\npre-programmed DMA commands, requiring no additional\nGPU compute resources for communication. Furthermore,\nto reduce contention for memory bandwidth between the\nproducer and communication, T3 leverages recently pro-\nposed compute-enhanced memories [34, 38] to atomically\nupdate memory on stores, thus reducing memory traffic due\nto communication-related reductions. Finally, T3 employs\na simple yet effective arbitration policy between the pro-\nducer and communication memory streams to minimize any\nremaining contention. Overall, T3 transparently overlaps\nserialized communication with minimal resource contention.\nThis improves compute and network utilization, and in turn,\ncan enable better throughput scaling with increasing device\ncount. We make the following key contributions:\n\u2022 We propose T3 which enables fine-grained overlap of\nserialized communication with its producer computa-\ntion whilst lowering application impact and managing\ncompute and memory interference.\n\u2022 To manage application impact, T3 configures the pro-\nducer\u2019s output address space mapping to initiate com-\nmunication on stores, requiring minor modifications\nto the producer kernels.\n\u2022 To manage compute resources contention, T3 uses\na lightweight programmable tracker that tracks pro-\nducer progress and triggers communication using ex-\nisting DMA engines requiring no additional compute\nresources.\n\u2022 Finally, to tackle memory bandwidth contention be-\ntween computation and communication, T3 harnesses\nemerging near-memory compute technology to reduce\ndata movement due to communication. Further, T3 also\ndevices a simple yet effective memory controller ar-\nbitration policy to better interleave computation and\ncommunication memory traffic.\n\u2022 Similar to prior work [32], we extend Accel-Sim [33] to\naccurately model multi-GPU systems (6% error). Our\nresults show that T3 speeds up sliced Transformer\nT3: Transparent Tracking & Triggering for Fine-grained Overlap of Compute & Collectives\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nSliced GEMM -> AR\n(a) Transformer model, training\n(b) Non-sliced FC layer\n(c) Sliced FC layer\nSelf-attention\nAdd and Normalize\nFeed- forward\nAdd and Normalize\nBackward\npropagation\nForward \npropagation\nWeight \nupdate\nX\nX\n=\n=\nX\nX\nAll-Reduce  \nX\nX\n=\n=\n=\n=\nI/P\nWeight\n(W)\nAct.\nGeLu\nAct.\nWeight\n(W)\nO/p\nW-1\nW-2\nAct.-1\nAct.-2\nGeLu\nGeLu\nAct.-2\nW-2\nPartial \nO/p-2\nO/p\nPartial \nO/p-1\nAct.-1\nW-1\nO/p\nI/P\nI/P\nFigure 2.

Overall, T3 speeds up model training by\nup to 12% and inference (prompt phase) by up to 15%.\n2\nBackground & Motivation\n2.1\nTransformers & Need for Distributed Computing\nTransformers [84] have become the general-purpose archi-\ntecture for a wide range of tasks/domains (e.g., for text, im-\nage) [8]. Models use the Transformer encoder or decoder\nas their basic building block, each with an attention sub-\nlayer and a fully connected (FC) sub-layer (as shown in Fig-\nure 2(a)) which manifest as matrix multiplication operations\n(GEMMs). Each layer also contains a few residual connec-\ntions and layer normalizations which manifest as element-\nwise operations, and are often fused [16, 18, 81, 85] with\nthe GEMMs. As shown in Figure 2(b), these GEMMs entail\nmultiplication of layers\u2019 weight matrices by an input ma-\ntrix (with each vector representing an input token). During\ntraining, the input matrices contain multiple tokens from\none or more (if batched) input sequence(s). During inference,\nthere are two execution phases: a prompt phase to process\nall tokens in the input sequence(s) and a token generation\nphase to iteratively process and generate one token at a time\nfor each input sequence [62]. The prompt phase operations\nare similar to those in training, while the generation phase\nhas GEMMs with small input matrices or matrix-vector op-\nerations (GEMVs) if there is no batching.\nMost Transformer models\u2019 memory capacity requirements\nexceed a single device. Thus, they employ distributed tech-\nniques and use multiple accelerators (e.g., GPUs) collabora-\ntively. Furthermore, the aggregate computational capacity\nof multiple devices also accelerates training by enabling the\nprocessing of large input datasets in parallel. Thus, since\nTransformers and their datasets (usually large corpora of\nunlabeled text) have increased by several orders of magni-\ntude in size, distributed techniques are often mandatory and\nincreasingly require many devices. This scaling will only\nincrease for future models.\n2.2\nDistributed Techniques & Associated Collectives\nTransformers employ many distributed techniques, each\nwith associated communication between devices. Data paral-\nlelism (DP) trains model replicas on multiple devices, each on\na disjoint set of data, and requires a reduction of gradients\nevery iteration. Tensor parallelism (TP) [78] and pipeline\nparallelism (e.g., GPipe) [23] slice the model across multi-\nple devices. While the former slices each layer requiring\nactivation reduction, the latter partitions the model layer-\nwise requiring peer-to-peer transfer of activations. ZeRO-\nbased optimizations [70] also slice model weights or offload\nthem to slower but larger (e.g., CPU) memories, and require\nthem to be gathered before layer executions. Finally expert\nparallelism [35] partitions mixture-of-expert (MoE) mod-\nels [17, 69] such that each device hosts a single expert and\nrequires exchange of input data based on input-to-expert\nmapping. These communication patterns are handled by col-\nlectives such as reduce-scatter, all-reduce, all-gather, all-to-all.\nWhile most of this communication can be hidden by inde-\npendent compute operations [49, 63, 64], albeit with some\nresource contention [36, 71], the all-reduce in TP is not (de-\ntailed in Section 2.4). Thus, we focus on all-reduce in TP and\ndiscuss other techniques/collectives in Sections 7.1 and 7.2.\n2.3\nAll-Reduce & Ring Implementations\nThe all-reduce (AR) collective reduces (element-wise sums)\narrays from each of the devices. Although there are multiple\nimplementations of AR, one of the most bandwidth-efficient,\nand thus most commonly used, implementations is ring-AR.\nRing-AR consists of a ring reduce-scatter (ring-RS) followed\nby a ring all-gather (ring-AG). As shown in Figure 3, ring-RS\nis done in multiple steps. The arrays are chunked on each\ndevice, and during each step, all devices send their copy of a\nunique chunk to their neighbor in the ring. The devices then\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nPati et al.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n4\n1\n2\n3\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\nPartially Reduced\n3\n4\n1\n2\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\n1 2\n3 4\nFully Reduced\nFigure 3.

With \ud835\udc41\ndevices and the array chunked \ud835\udc41 ways, this process requires\n\ud835\udc41 \u22121 steps until each device has a completely reduced copy of\none chunk. Ring-AG is similar but does not have reductions;\nit also requires \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 steps until each device has all the\nreduced chunks. In the remainder of the paper, we use AR,\nRS, and AG to refer to their ring implementations and discuss\nother implementations in Section 7.1.\n2.4\nAll-Reduce is on the Critical Path & can be Large\nTransformers require tensor parallelism (TP) [78] to increase\nthe aggregate memory capacity available to them. However,\nit requires ARs on the critical path (between layers). Fig-\nures 2(b) and 2(c) show the FC sub-layer\u2019s original operations\nversus the operations when sliced across two devices (TP=2\nin Figure 2(c)). Each device (dotted box) only has a slice of\nthe weights. Since the GEMM corresponding to the second\nsliced weight only generates a partial output, it requires an\nAR before the next layer executes (highlighted by \"Sliced\nGEMM\u2192AR\"). These GEMM and AR operations execute as\nseparate kernels and are serialized.\nThese serialized ARs can become a bottleneck. Figure 4\nshows the execution time breakdown of Transformers be-\ntween \"Sliced GEMM\u2192AR\" and other operations for mul-\ntiple current and futuristic Transformers (setup detailed in\nSection 5.1.2, 5.2). For large models (e.g., Mega-GPT-2, T-\nNLG) we consider 8- and 16-device TP. For very large models\n(e.g., PALM, MT-NLG) we consider 32-way slicing, and for\nfuturistic ones with one and ten trillion parameters, we con-\nsider 64-way sharding. The increasing TP slicing is necessary\nbecause these models\u2019 larger sizes cannot fit in 16 GPUs [64]\nand the increased slicing is also enabled by nodes with larger\ndevice counts [59, 86]. Like prior work [36, 49, 64], we find\nthat communication is a considerable fraction of the overall\nruntime: Megatron-GPT-2 (Mega-GPT-2) and T-NLG spend\nup to 34% and 43% of their training and inference (prompt\nphase) time on communication. These trends also hold for\nthe very large and futuristic Transformers: communication\ncan be up to 46% and 44% of their runtime, respectively. Ad-\nditionally, since compute FLOPS scales much more than net-\nwork bandwidth [19], these proportions will only increase\nin the future. For example, if the GEMMs become 2\u00d7 faster,\ncommunication increases to 75% of model execution time \u2013\nmaking scaling to multiple devices extremely inefficient and\npotentially leaving GPUs idle while communication happens.\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTraining\nInference\nTP=8\nTP=16\nTP=8\nTP=16\nTP=32\nTP=32\nTP=32\nTP=64\nTP=64\nMega-GPT-2\nH=3K,\nSLB=16K\nT-NLG\nH=4256,\n SLB=8K\nGPT-3\nH=12K,\nSLB=2K\nPALM\nH=18K,\nSLB=2K\nMT-NLG\nH=20K,\nSLB=2K\nFuture-1\nH=32K,\nSLB=4K\nFuture-2\nH=64K,\nSLB=4K\nCurrent\nFuture\nRuntime Breakdown\nGEMMs-w/-AR\nRS\nAG\nRest\nFigure 4. Transformer time spent on reduce-scatter (RS) and\nall-gather (AG) collectives as well as GEMMs which require\ncollectives.\nThus, addressing serialized AR is critical to Transformer scal-\ning.\n2.5\nEnabling Compute-Communication Overlap\nOverlapping collective kernels with independent compute\nkernels has been key to scaling DNNs in other distributed\napproaches (e.g., DP, GPipe [23]). While TP does not have in-\ndependent kernels to overlap AR with, we observe that it can\nbenefit from a fine-grained overlap with the producer GEMM\nitself. Transformer GEMMs have large outputs, which are\ntiled/blocked and require many GPU workgroups (WGs) to\ncomplete. Consequently, a GEMM cannot always execute all\nits WGs concurrently on the limited number of GPU compute\nunits (CUs). Thus, a GEMM executes and generates output\nin multiple stages, where each stage is a set of WGs that the\nCUs can accommodate. This holds even for sliced GEMMs\nthat require AR. As shown in Figure 5, GEMMs in TP are\nsliced in the \ud835\udc3e (or dot-product) dimension which decreases\ncompute per WG, but the output size, WG count, and WG\nstages remain the same. We utilize this observation to enable\nfine-grained overlap: communication of one stage\u2019s output\ndata can be overlapped with compute of the next stage. How-\never, achieving practical and efficient fine-grained overlap is\nchallenging as we describe in Section 3.\n3\nChallenges With Fine-grained\nCompute-Communication Overlap\nThis section details key challenges with the fine-grained\noverlap of compute and communication.\n3.1\nComplex & Expensive to Implement in Software\nThe producer and collective operations execute as separate\nkernels on GPUs; the producer (GEMM) generates the data,\nafter which the collective orchestrates their bulk communi-\ncation and reduction. Extending the software for their fine-\ngrained interleaving can be complex and expensive. It would\ninvolve breaking the producer and collective into smaller\nkernels or using dynamic parallelism, both of which can\nT3: Transparent Tracking & Triggering for Fine-grained Overlap of Compute & Collectives\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nN\nN\nM\nM\nK\nK\nK/T\nK/T\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSliced\nInput \nmatrices\nOutput \nmatrix\nSliced input \nmatrices\nPartial \noutput \nmatrix\nFigure 5.

Al-\nternatively, it can be achieved by writing fused GEMM and\ncollective kernels, but this can incur significant programming\neffort [16, 18, 81, 85]. First, BLAS libraries have hundreds of\nGEMM kernels optimized for different input sizes and GPU\narchitecture, generated via an expensive tuning process [3].\nSecond, collectives are also of different types, and each has\nimplementations optimized for different topologies. Creating\nfused kernels for every combination of GEMM and collec-\ntive implementations can thus be extremely complex and\nexpensive. Hence, it is imperative to achieve a fine-grained\noverlap of compute and communication without altering\nGEMM implementations.\n3.2\nResource Contention Between Producer &\nCollective\nOverlapped GEMM and AR contend for GPU resources,\nspecifically compute units (CUs) and memory bandwidth,\nwhich slow down overall execution.\n3.2.1\nCompute Sharing. Concurrently executing GEMM\nand AR kernels must share CUs and their components in-\ncluding L1 cache, LDS, and vector registers. This contention\nmay affect their performance relative to their isolated execu-\ntion. Figure 6 evaluates the impact of concurrently executing\nGEMM and AR using our setup in Section 5.1.1 and Table 1.\nSpecifically, Figure 6 shows the (normalized) GEMM and\nAR time for Mega-GPT-2 and T-NLG (with TP=8) sub-layers\n(Attn. and FC-2) when run in isolation with varying CU\ncount splits (e.g., the 72-8 bars show GEMM\u2019s isolated exe-\ncution time with 72 CUs and AR\u2019s with eight CUs). For each\ncase, it also shows potential-overlap-speedup, the speedup\noverlapping AR and GEMM can obtain versus sequentially\nexecuting GEMM and AR when each has all 80 CUs. We\ncalculate the overlapped time as max(GEMM time, AR time).\nThe ideal case assumes no sharing impact: the GEMM has\nall the 80 CUs and the AR is fast but free (evaluated by run-\nning it with all 80 CUs in isolation). As a result, the ideal\ncase has the maximum potential overlap speedup of 1.67\u00d7\ngeomean. However, AR slows down considerably (geomean\n\u223c41% slowdown) when allocated only eight CUs (72-8 case)\ncompared to when it had all CUs.

Ideal\nassumes no sharing, the GEMM has all CUs, and AR is free.\nthe potential-overlap-speedup to 1.18\u00d7 geomean. While AR\nperformance improves with 16 CUs (only \u223c7% slowdown in\n64-16 case), GEMMs slow down (geomean \u223c21% slowdown)\nsince they now only have 64 CUs. Overall, while better than\nthe 72-8 case, potential speedups fall short (1.49\u00d7 geomean)\ncompared to the ideal case. Moreover, this assumes no con-\ntention due to memory bandwidth sharing (discussed next)\nand thus underestimates slowdowns. Overall, sharing of CUs\nreduces overlapping efficacy and it is crucial to preserve the\ncompute resources dedicated to GEMMs.\n3.2.2\nMemory Bandwidth Sharing. GEMM and AR ker-\nnels also compete for memory bandwidth when run con-\ncurrently. As shown in Figure 3, at each step AR kernels a)\nread an array chunk from memory to send it to one neighbor\nGPU and also b) write to memory the chunk it received from\nanother neighbor. Reduce-scatter (RS) additionally requires\na memory read of the local chunk for reduction. Moreover,\nthe memory traffic due to AR communication can be bursty.\nThis additional, bursty memory traffic due to AR can slow\ndown critical memory accesses by the producer GEMM, with\nthe impact higher for GEMMs for which inputs do not fit in\nGPU\u2019s last level cache (LLC) as we will show in our evalua-\ntion in Section 6.1.2 and Figure 17. Thus, to enhance overlap\nefficiency, it is essential to limit memory traffic due to com-\nmunication and/or limit their contention with GEMM.\nPrior work also studied contention between communica-\ntion and computation [71], albeit in DP setups with coarse-\ngrained GEMM and AR overlap. They show that AR slows\ndown by up to 2.4\u00d7 when run concurrently with GEMMs,\nand the slowdown is even higher when run concurrently\nwith memory-intensive embedding lookups in recommen-\ndation models. For TP, they observe a 1.4\u00d7 slowdown when\nexecuted concurrently with GEMMs.\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nPati et al.\nGPU-0\nGPU-1\nGPU-2\nGPU-3\nGPU-0\nGPU-1\nGPU-2\nGPU-3\nGPU-0\nGPU-1\nGPU-2\nGPU-3\nremote_update\nlocal_update\ndma_update\ntime\nGEMM \nStage\nstep 1\nstep 2\nstep 3\nfully reduced\nFigure 7. Overview of fused GEMM and ring reduce-scatter with T3 on a four-GPU node.\n4\nT3: Transparent Tracking & Triggering\nTo overcome the aforementioned challenges of complex soft-\nware and resource contention with fine-grained overlap of\ncompute and communication, we propose T3.\n4.1\nT3 Overview\nModern GPUs first execute the producer GEMMs and store\ntheir outputs in their local memory. Afterwards they initiate\nthe collective operation (Section 3). T3 instead initiates the\ncollective immediately as GEMMs generate data to enable\nfine-grained overlap. It uses a track & trigger mechanism\nto monitor GEMM\u2019s/collective\u2019s progress and to orchestrate\ncommunication, requiring no additional CUs (Section 4.2). It\nleverages near-memory compute for reductions to reduce\nmemory traffic due to communication (Section 4.3). Finally, it\ndoes these transparently, with minor kernel modifications\n(Section 4.4).\nFigure 7 illustrates a four-device reduce-scatter (RS) over-\nlapped with its producer GEMM. This GEMM executes in\nmultiple stages of WGs dictated by its input and kernel imple-\nmentation (Section 2.5), while RS executes in multiple steps\ndictated by the number of devices involved (Section 2.3). For\nsimplicity of illustration, we show the number of GEMM\nstages to be one more than the number of required ring\nsteps. In each step, a GEMM stage\u2019s execution and reduc-\ntion of its output happen in parallel to the communication\nof the previous stage output. In the first step, the output\nis communicated to remote devices directly by the GEMM\n(remote_update). The later, steady state, steps require a DMA\n(dma_update). For \ud835\udc41 devices, this steady state step is per-\nformed \ud835\udc41 \u2212 2 times, on different chunks. Focusing on GPU-0\nin the steady state, step-2, as shown in Figures 7, the GPU\nexecutes/generates output for GEMM stage-3 while also re-\nceiving (via DMA) a copy of stage\u20193 output (blue) from its\nneighbor, GPU-1. This occurs in parallel to GPU-0\u2019s DMA of\nthe reduced copy of GEMM stage-2 data (yellow) to GPU-3,\nthus overlapping communication. T3 leverages near-memory\ncomputing (NMC) to atomically update memory locations\non these local and DMA updates, resulting in a partially\nreduced copy of the stage-3 chunk without requiring addi-\ntional reads or GPU CUs (Section 4.3). Once they complete,\nGPU-0 initiates a dma_update of the chunk to its neighbor\u2019s\n(GPU-3) memory as shown in step-3. This automatic tracking\nof updates and DMA triggering is done using a lightweight\nand programmable hardware Tracker, further reducing de-\npendency on GPU CUs (Section 4.2). These remote / DMA\nupdates are done transparently by configuring the GEMM\u2019s\noutput address mapping, with minor application and kernel\nmodifications (Section 4.4).\nWe also make minor runtime and hardware changes to\nimprove T3\u2019s performance. To enable the perfect overlap\nof GEMM and RS in Figure 7, we stagger the scheduling of\nGEMM workgroups (WGs) across GPUs (Section 4.4). More-\nover, we also augment the memory system with a simple\nyet effective memory controller arbitration (MCA) policy to\nmanage memory contention between compute and commu-\nnication (Section 4.5).\nFigure 8 shows a GPU with T3\u2019s enhancements (in orange)\nexecuting the steady state step described above. The GPU\nexecutes the GEMM to generate local updates for a stage\n( L1 ). Concurrently the GPU receives DMA updates for the\nsame stage ( D1a) and sends DMA updates for the previ-\nous stage ( D1b ). At the memory controller, the modified\nMCA arbitrates between the local and DMA traffic to pre-\nvent contention. Following this, the updates are sent to NMC-\nenhanced DRAM ( L2a , D2a) while the Tracker is updated\nwith their progress ( L2b , D2b ). Once the Tracker observes\nthe required local and DMA updates to a memory region, it\ntriggers their DMA transfer to the neighbor GPU ( L3 ).\nWe use the 4-GPU GEMM-RS overlap as a running exam-\nple to describe T3. RS is more challenging to overlap due\nto reductions and extra memory traffic. Further, the ring\nT3: Transparent Tracking & Triggering for Fine-grained Overlap of Compute & Collectives\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nGPU\nTracker\nCU\nCU\nCU\nCU\nL1\nL1\nL1\nL1\nLLC\nL1\nL2a\nL3\nMem.

Thus, we de-\ntail T3 using ring-RS and discuss additional collectives in\nSection 7.1.\n4.2\nT3 Tracking & Triggering\nT3\u2019s programmable track & trigger mechanism is key to trans-\nparently enabling fine-grained overlap of producer and col-\nlective without using compute resources. As shown in Fig-\nure 9, T3 automatically transfers copies of data between\ndevices when ready (e.g., in Figure 7, T3 triggers DMA up-\ndate of stage-2 data from GPU-0 to GPU-3 once both GPU-0\u2019s\nlocal and GPU-1\u2019s remote updates are complete). This is en-\nabled by a lightweight Tracker at the memory controller, that\ntracks local and remote/DMA accesses to memory regions\nand triggers a DMA transfer once the required accesses are\ncomplete. Since the condition when a DMA is triggered (e.g.,\nnumber of remote and local updates) and DMA transfer de-\ntails (e.g., addresses, operation type) vary per collective type\nand implementation, they are programmed ahead of time\nusing address space configuration (detailed in Section 4.4\nand Figure 12).\n4.2.1\nTracker. The Tracker tracks both local and remote\nmemory updates of a GEMM stage and triggers its DMA. As\nshown in Figure 9(a) and (b), it does so at wavefront (WF, i.e.,\na group of threads that execute in lockstep) granularity 1\n\u2013 i.e., the Tracker tracks the memory region a WF updates.\nThis assumes tiled GEMM implementations and that each\nWF/WG generates a complete tile of data, as is the case in\nall evaluated GEMMs [30, 61]. However, T3 can also handle\nother implementation (Section 7.7). An update increments\nthe counter at its corresponding WF\u2019s (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51) Tracker en-\ntry 2 . This is done by all local, remote, and DMA updates\nthat arrive at the GPU\u2019s memory controller (e.g., GPU-0 does\nnot track GEMM stage-1 as its WFs neither write locally nor\nare its remote updates received). The incremented counter\nvalue is checked for a maximum threshold, which is set to\nthe product of WF output size (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52) and the total\nupdates expected per element 3 . The \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 is deter-\nmined by the GPU driver using the output size and WF count\n((\ud835\udc40 \u2217 \ud835\udc41)/#\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc39). The total updates expected per element for\nring-RS is two but changes with collective type/implementa-\ntion and is thus configurable (detailed in Section 4.4). Once\nthe threshold is reached, the final write triggers the DMA\n( 4 in Figure 9(c) and detailed in Section 4.2.2). The Tracker\nis checked once the accesses are enqueued in the memory\ncontroller queue (MCQ) and thus are not in the critical path.\nWF-based tracking is beneficial as a producer\u2019s (or GEMM\u2019s)\nstage may not update contiguous memory regions. As shown\nin Figure 9(a) this can happen due to column-major allocation\nof arrays in BLAS libraries [2, 61] and row-major scheduling.\nThis makes address-based tracking expensive (requires stor-\ning several addresses or complex table indexing functions)\nwhich WF-based tracking avoids. The Tracker has a total of\n256 entries, indexed using the workgroup (WG) ID\u2019s LSBs,\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc54_\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f (8 bits).

We set the maximum entries based on the maximum\nWGs possible in a producer stage. Each entry has a starting\nvirtual address (smallest address per WF), and an accesses\ncounter, making the Tracker size 19KB. The tracking addi-\ntionally requires the source \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc54_\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 as metadata in\nmemory accesses and forwarding of their virtual addresses to\nthe memory controller (to trigger the DMA in Section 4.2.2).\n4.2.2\nTriggering DMA. Once the required accesses to a\nWF\u2019s memory region are issued, T3 DMAs the data to the\nremote GPU ( 4 in Figure 9(c)). As shown in Figure 9(c), the\nDMA commands are pre-programmed by the GPU driver\nand are configurable (detailed in Section 4.4 and Figure 12) as\nthe DMA regions/operations can differ based on the collec-\ntive type and implementation. The granularity of the DMA\nblock/table entry is set to be equal to or larger than the\nTracker granularity (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52). The memory access which\ncompletes the required accesses at the Tracker entry (Sec-\ntion 4.2.1) marks the corresponding DMA entry ready and\nalso populates it with the \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc54_\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 which are re-\nquired by the destination GPU\u2019s Tracker. If DMA blocks are\na multiple of \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52, an additional counter per DMA entry\ncan track their completion. Using the pre-programmed start-\ning source/destination virtual address, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52, and the\noutput dimensions (M, N), the DMA engine dynamically gen-\nerates the remaining virtual addresses to initiate the DMA.\n4.3\nNear-Memory Reductions\nTo perform reductions on producer and DMA updates with-\nout occupying GPU compute resources, T3 leverages compute-\nenhanced memories.

T3 Track & Trigger.\nproposed by recent works [52, 66]. We envision such com-\npute support to be implemented via ALUs near DRAM banks\nas has recently been proposed by memory vendors [34, 38].\nHowever, T3 can also leverage other reduction substrates\n(Section 7.4).\nT3 leverages this near-memory computing (NMC) capa-\nbility to enable GEMM stores and DMA transfers to directly\nupdate and reduce copies of data, when required by col-\nlectives. For DMA transfers, the operation type (store vs.\nupdates) is directly specified in the command (address space\nconfiguration in Figure 12 and Section 4.4). For GEMMs, we\nutilize two flags. First, we use an \"uncached\" flag during\nmemory allocation to ensure that the output is not cached\nin any GPU\u2019s caches (such allocations are supported in ex-\nisting GPUs). Thus, writes are directly sent to DRAM which\nacts as the point of aggregation for all (local, remote, DMA)\nupdates. The queuing of updates in the memory controller\nqueue guarantees their atomicity; at any given time, only a\nsingle instruction can be issued and executed by near-bank\nALUs. Second, we use an \"update\" flag in the GEMM API\ncall to enable stores of the GEMM to update the DRAM. The\n\"update\" flag is sent (via kernel packets [4]) to the CUs to\ntag the kernel\u2019s stores with one-bit \"update\" info (similar to\nprior work [27, 28, 65]). These are processed by the memory\ncontroller to generate the op-and-store commands.\nIn addition to freeing up CUs for GEMMs, NMC helps re-\nduce memory traffic due to communication. Figure 10 shows\nmemory accesses in a steady-state RS step in baseline and\nwith T3. In baseline RS, CUs read two copies of data (local\ncopy, and received copy from the previous neighbor) and\nwrite the reduced data to the next neighbor\u2019s memory. T3\nonly requires one read of the data to DMA update the neigh-\nbor GPU memory using NMC. Overall, T3 with NMC reduces\nthe dependence on GPU CUs and further reduces (or elimi-\nnates, direct-RS in Section 7.1) data movement required for\ncommunication.\n4.4\nConfiguring Producer\u2019s Output Address Space\nModifying producer kernels, especially for many GEMMs of\ndifferent shapes and sizes, to fuse and overlap collectives, can\nbe impractical (Section 3.1). T3 avoids this by configuring\nthe producer\u2019s output address space mapping which is used\nto program the Tracker and DMA commands. Figures 11\nand 12 show this configuration for GPU-0 from the fused\nGEMM-RS example in Figure 7.\nSince there are four devices, GEMM\u2019s output array is chun-\nked four ways. In GPU-0, the GEMM writes its stage-1 output\ndirectly to GPU-3\u2019s memory (step-1 in Figure 7), while its\nstage-2 and stage-3 output is first written to local memory\nand later DMA\u2019d to GPU-3 (stage-4 is only written locally\nonce and is not DMA\u2019d). Thus, GPU-0 requires memory map-\npings of these chunks with that of GPU-3 as shown in Fig-\nure 11. This configuration differs per collective type and\ntopology-optimized implementation (see Section 7.1) and,\nsimilar to modern collective implementations, can be pre-\ndefined in collective libraries [1, 55]. Figure 12 shows an\nexample of this using pseudo-code.\nThe configuration in Figure 12 defines this mapping for\nthe GEMM output using two different API calls: remote_map\nand dma_map. remote_map is used for fine-grained remote\nwrites/updates (for stage-1), which uses existing GPU sup-\nport for peer-to-peer load/store by threads [57]. Conversely,\ndma_map is used for coarse-grained DMA writes/updates\n(for stage-2,3) which leverages existing support for mem-\nory copies by DMA engines in GPUs (DirectGMA and oth-\ners [50, 51, 57]). A dma_map call also defines the DMA func-\ntionality (store vs. update), and its triggering condition (num-\nber of stores/updates per element). It can also be extended to\nspecify granularity (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52s per DMA block in Figure 9(c)).\nThese calls are used to pre-program the Tracker and DMA\ncommands to enable automatic communication of data when\nready (Section 4.2).\nFusion in ring-based collectives also benefits from pro-\nducers (on different devices) generating data chunks in a\nstaggered manner. In Figure 7, GPUs stagger the generated\ndata by one stage; in step-1, GPU-0 executes stage-1, while\nGPU-1 executes stage-2, and so forth. This is enabled by\nstaggering WG scheduling across devices. Alternatively, it\ncan also be enabled by fetching appropriate implementa-\ntion from BLAS libraries with staggered output tile-to-WG\nT3: Transparent Tracking & Triggering for Fine-grained Overlap of Compute & Collectives\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nHBM\nGPU-0\nHBM\nGPU-1\nwrite \ndest 1\nHBM\nGPU-0\nHBM\nGPU-1\nread src1, \nsrc2\n2\nadd \n3\n2 nmc-update\nread out 1\n(a) GPU reduce-scatter\n(b) NMC reduce-scatter\nFigure 10.

Overall, configuring the\noutput address space mitigates the need to change GEMM\nimplementations to enable fusion with collectives.\n4.5\nCommunication-aware MC Arbitration (MCA):\nFinally, careful scheduling of memory accesses by the pro-\nducer kernel and those resulting from communication is\ncrucial to efficiently overlap them. In Section 6.1 we show\nthat a memory controller (MC) arbitration policy which a)\nround-robins between issuing memory accesses from the\ncompute and communication streams and b) falls back to\nthe other stream if the current stream is empty, results in\nproducer kernel slowdowns. Communication-related mem-\nory accesses appear in bursts and can occupy DRAM queues,\nstalling the compute kernel\u2019s critical memory reads/writes.\nSimply prioritizing producer kernel accesses as they appear\nis also insufficient as prior communication-related memory\naccesses may already occupy DRAM queues. Finally, giving\nthe local compute stream dedicated access results in wasted\ncycles and memory bandwidth underutilization. Thus, an\nefficient overlap of compute and communication requires a\ndynamic arbitration policy that addresses both contention\nand under-utilization.\nWe implement a simple yet dynamic arbitration policy to\novercome this. The MC always prioritizes compute stream ac-\ncesses, but if empty, falls back to communication stream. Ad-\nditionally, it monitors the DRAM queue occupancy and only\nissues communication-related accesses if occupancy is below\na threshold. This ensures sufficient room in the queues for\nfuture compute stream accesses and prevents their stalls. The\noccupancy threshold depends on the memory-intensiveness\nof compute kernels (e.g., smaller if memory-intensive, and\nvice-versa).

Additionally, the communi-\ncation stream is drained at the producer kernel boundary.\n5\nMethodology\n5.1\nSetup\n5.1.1\nMulti-GPU Simulation. Although a number of pop-\nular GPU simulators are publicly available [7, 20, 39, 74], we\nchose to evaluate T3 using Accel-Sim [33] because it provides\nhigh fidelity for modern GPUs [31]. Like prior work [32],\nwe extended Accel-Sim to simulate a multi-GPU system.\nWe observe that in a multi-GPU DNN setup all GPU\u2019s ex-\necutions are homogeneous (Figures 2 and 10). Thus, we\nevaluate both our multi-GPU baseline and T3 by model-\ning all the activities pertaining to a single GPU. This in-\ncludes modeling the Tracker which is accessed/updated in\nparallel with the store/DMA operations and uncached NMC\nupdates. Although we do not model the DMA engine in\nthe simulator, we do model its inter-GPU communication\n(communication resulting from RS both in the baseline and\nT3\u2019s fused GEMM-RS) by executing the compute operations\n(e.g., GEMM [30, 61]) in Accel-Sim and using Accel-Sim\u2019s\nfront-end tracing functionality to inject the additional inter-\nGPU communication traffic. The Tracker\u2019s DMA trigger-\ning overheads are negligible since the DMA commands are\npre-queued during the setup process (Figure 12) as is often\ndone, especially for ML operations which are repetitive [24].\nTable 1 details the GPU configuration we use to evaluate\nT3, which is the latest GPU architecture Accel-Sim com-\npletely supports. Commercial GPUs with such a configura-\ntion support a 150 GB/s interconnection ring bandwidth [53].\nSince recent GPUs frequently scale compute faster than other\nresources, we also evaluate another configuration with in-\ncreased CU count while the other parameters stay the same\nin Section 7.5.\nFigure 13 describes our multi-GPU simulation of RS. In\neach RS step, a GPU performs a reduction of a sub-array and\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nPati et al.\nSystem\n#GPUs\n8, 16\nInter-GPU\nInterconnect\nRing, 150 GB/s bi-directional\n500 ns link latency\nPer-GPU Config\n#CUs\n80, 1.4 GHz\nPer-CU Config\n2K threads, 128KB unified LDS + L1 cache\n(with no write-allocate), 256KB RF\nL2\n16MB, 64 banks, 1.4 GHz\nHBM2\n1 TB/s, 1 GHz, CCDWL=4,\nBank Grp.=4, rest [11]\nTable 1.

The simulator executes\nthe reduction of the array as-is. Simulating the incoming\nnetwork traffic requires: (a) determining packet addresses,\n(b) generating packets at the appropriate rate, and (c) model-\ning the interconnect costs. Packet addresses are determined\nusing the store trace of WGs from the reduction kernel. Next,\nsince GPU executions are homogeneous, remote traffic is\ngenerated at the same rate as the GPU generates the reduc-\ntion output (which is filtered out to be sent to remote GPU).\nThis also implicitly includes slowdowns due to compute/-\ncommunication interference at the remote GPU. Finally, we\nadd the interconnect costs to these packets as they arrive,\nassuming a simple link bandwidth and latency model of the\ninterconnect. To validate this setup, we compare simulated\nRS times on four GPUs with hardware measurements from\na four-GPU node with AMD Instinct\u2122 MI210 GPUs [5] with\nsame ring network bandwidth as simulated (Table 1). Fig-\nure 14 shows that simulation closely follows hardware trends\nfor a range of sizes (6-192 MB): 6% geomean error versus the\nideal dotted line.\nNear-Memory Computing: We modify the simulator\u2019s\nHBM to model NMC updates. Further, memory vendor pro-\nposals indicate that NMC operations can be issued without\na significant increase in DRAM timings; back-to-back NMC\noperations can be issued to the same bank group with the\nsame column-to-column access (CCDL) delay [34]. To model\nthe additional cost of NMC op-and-store operations (Sec-\ntion 4.3), we modify the simulator\u2019s HBM to use a 2\u00d7 higher\nCCDL delay (termed CCDWL) following those operations\n(see Table 1).\n5.1.2\nEnd-to-End Transformer Iteration. To evaluate\nend-to-end iterations with T3, we scale the GEMMs and\nRS times in the baseline Transformer breakdown (shown\nin Figure 4) by their simulated speedups (described in Sec-\ntion 5.1.1). We leverage a combination of hardware data and\nanalytical modeling as done by prior works [49, 64] to get\nthe end-to-end breakdowns of models in their distributed\nsetups. We use a single-GPU mixed-precision [45] execution\nof MLPerf v1.1 [48] BERT on an AMD Instinct\u2122 MI210 ac-\ncelerator (GPU) [5] and scale its operation times based on\nHBM\nGPU\nNetwork\nTraffic\nStore trace (to sub-array-2)\nGeneration rate from sim.\nNetwork: size / BW + Lat.\nsub-array-1\nFigure 13.

Our projections further match those mea-\nsured by prior works. For example, AR\u2019s percentage runtime\ncontribution projected for Mega-GPT-2 with TP-16 matches\nprior works\u2019 measurements on a similar system configura-\ntion [36].\n5.2\nApplications, Deployment & GEMMs\nModels and their deployment: Since Transformers are\nfast-evolving, we evaluate T3\u2019s impact on a range of Trans-\nformer models and TP degrees (Table 2). For Megatron-GPT-2\n(Mega-GPT-2) [78] and T-NLG [47] we use 16K and 8K input\ntokens (= input-length * batch-size) and TP degrees of eight\nand 16, given their modern intra-node setups [25, 36, 47, 78].\nFor larger Transformers like PALM [12], GPT-3 [9], and MT-\nNLG [80]) we use a higher slicing degree of 32 given their\nincreasingly large memory capacity requirements [64] and\navailability of nodes with larger device counts that can en-\nable this slicing [29, 59, 76]. We evaluate mixed-precision\ntraining which entails half-precision (FP16) forward and\nbackpropagation and single-precision (FP32) weight updates.\nSimilarly, we evaluate FP16 inference.\nGEMMs: GEMMs from the aforementioned applications are\nsimulated using implementations from state-of-the-art BLAS\nlibraries [30, 61]. Most GEMMs (including all GEMMs we\nevaluate) use a tiled GEMM implementation where each WG\ngenerates a complete tile of data (other implementations\ndiscussed in Section 7.7). Further, we evaluate GEMMs with\nboth non-transposed (e.g., backward GEMMs) and trans-\nposed (e.g., forward GEMMs) input tensors, as observed in\nMLPerf\u2019s BERT [44, 72].\n5.3\nConfigurations\nTo evaluate T3\u2019s efficacy we use the following configurations:\n\u2022 Sequential: is the baseline configuration.

Thus, its performance is max(GEMM,\nRS+NMC) over Ideal-GEMM-RS-Overlap.\n6\nResults\n6.1\nExecution Time Distribution & Speedups\nFigures 15 and 16 show results for all sliced sub-layers in\nTransformers which require an AR: output projection (OP)\nand fully-connected-2 (FC-2) in forward pass (fwd) and fully-\nconnected-1 (FC-1) and input projection (IP) in backprop\n(bwd). We show these for Mega-GPT-2 and T-NLG, as well\nas two TP setups (TP of 8 and 16). Figure 15 shows each\ncase\u2019s runtime distribution between the GEMM, RS, and\nAG. Figure 16 shows their speedup over sequential using\nT3, T3-MCA, as well as their speedups assuming an ideal\noverlap of GEMM with RS (Ideal-GEMM-RS-Overlap) and\nadditional speedups resulting from a faster RS with NMC\n(Ideal RS+NMC).\n6.1.1\nIdeal Speedups. Figure 16 shows the ideal possible\nspeedups and breaks them into two parts: first from overlap-\nping the GEMM and RS kernels (Ideal-GEMM-RS-Overlap)\nand second from improved RS performance due to NMC\n(Ideal RS+NMC).\nIn Figure 16 Ideal-GEMM-RS-Overlap (without resource\nand data-dependency constraints) shows considerable ben-\nefits from overlapping the producer GEMM and following\nRS: 50% max speedup and 35% geomean versus Sequential.\nModel Name\nHyperparams\nInputs\nTP degree\nMega-GPT-2\nH=3072, L=74\nSL=1K, B=16\n8, 16\nT-NLG\nH=4256, L=78\nSL=1K, B=8\n8, 16\nGPT-3\nH=12K, L=96\nSL=1K, B=2\n32\nPALM\nH=18K, L=118\nSL=1K, B=2\n32\nMT-NLG\nH=20K, L=105\nSL=1K, B=2\n32\nTable 2. Studied models, their hyperparameters & setup.\nSpeedups vary both within and across models and depend\non the isolated execution times of GEMM and RS (Figure 15).\nThe situations where the GEMM and RS runtimes are similar\n(similar proportions in Figure 15) have the maximum poten-\ntial since the GEMM hides all of RS\u2019s cost. For example, FC-1\nin T-NLG with TP=16 obtains 50% speedup. Alternatively, the\ncases in which the GEMM and RS times are skewed show the\nleast benefit since most of the GEMM or RS cost is exposed.\nFor example, Ideal-GEMM-RS-Overlap speedup is only 15%\nfor OP in Mega-GPT with TP=16. However, the latter is un-\ncommon and is a consequence of slicing a very small layer\n(OP is the smallest among all). It does not hold for other sub-\nlayers within the same model, or larger models as shown\nin the figures (also see Section 6.4). For a given hardware\nsetup, these execution time ratios, and thus Ideal-GEMM-RS-\nOverlap speedups are dictated by layer parameters [64].\nIn Figure 16 Ideal-RS+NMC shows that additional speedup\nis possible beyond what perfect overlap provides. Besides\nfreeing all the CUs for GEMMs, performing RS reductions\nnear memory also lowers RS\u2019s memory traffic (described in\nSection 4.3). This speeds up RS by 7% and 3% with TP=8\nand TP=16, respectively. NMC only reduces RS\u2019s final step\ntime as interconnect costs dominate all prior steps and thus\nits runtime benefit decreases as TP, and thus total steps,\nincreases. As shown in Figure 16, this faster RS can reduce\noverlapped time and provide additional speedups of up to 4%.\nIntuitively, the impact of a faster RS is only evident in layers\nin which RS is longer running than GEMM and is otherwise\nhidden when overlapped.\n6.1.2\nT3 Speedups. T3 transparently overlaps GEMMs\nwith their corresponding consumer RS in a fine-grained man-\nner. Moreover, T3\u2019s lightweight track-&-trigger mechanism\nand use of near-memory compute frees all CUs for GEMMs\nand reduces DRAM traffic (Figure 18 and Section 6.2), re-\nspectively. Thus, T3 achieves speedups of up to 39% (20%\ngeomean, yellow bars, Figure 16).\nIndividual speedups vary considerably and are largely\nimpacted by the extent of contention between DRAM traf-\nfic from the GEMM and the concurrent, RS (details in Sec-\ntion 6.2). For OP layers, T3 achieves close to the Ideal-GEMM-\nRS-Overlap speedups, and even exceeds them in certain cases.\nThis happens because the OP GEMMs are small and fit largely\nin the LLC, having very small DRAM read traffic in Sequen-\ntial (shown in Figure 18). Thus, the additional DRAM traf-\nfic from the overlapped RS in T3 has little impact on the\nGEMMs\u2019 progress/execution. Instead, T3 further improves\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nPati et al.\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nOP FC-2 FC-1\nIP\nOP FC-2 FC-1\nIP\nOP FC-2 FC-1\nIP\nOP FC-2 FC-1\nIP\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nTP=16\nTP=8\nTP=16\nTP=8\nMega-GPT-2(H=3K_SLB=16K)\nT-NLG(H=4256_SLB=8K)\nRuntime Proportion\nGEMM\nRS\nAG\nFigure 15.

Finally, although the\ntrack & trigger mechanism operates at a small WF granular-\nity, generally data from multiple WFs/WGs of a GEMM stage\nare ready to be sent concurrently, resulting in high network\nbandwidth utilization. Furthermore, even when this is not\ntrue, T3 can tolerate this because compute/GEMM execution\nand communication are overlapped, hiding the latency.\nIn many other cases, and especially the much larger FC\nlayers, the benefits are far from those with Ideal-GEMM-RS-\nOverlap (>15% slower). Figure 17 shows the DRAM traffic\n(Y-axis) and the GEMM slowdown (X-axis) with fine-grained\noverlapping, compared to the GEMM\u2019s isolated execution.\nAn isolated GEMM as shown in Figure 17(a) executes in\nmultiple stages (Section 2.5), each with a read phase (blue)\nfollowed by a bursty write phase, which limit read traffic.\nOverlapping RS induces additional DRAM traffic, as shown\nin Figure 17(b). Besides additional traffic, in T3, GEMM, and\nRS writes directly update memory using NMC (Section 4.3).\nThese additional bursts of reads (RS_reads for a stage are\nissued as soon as both the local and neighbors\u2019 copies have\nupdated the memory) and updates (RS_updates for the next\nstage from the previous neighbor) can further stall local\nGEMM reads as shown, causing GEMM to slow down con-\nsiderably.\n6.1.3\nT3-MCA Speedups. T3-MCA (Section 4.5) limits\nGEMM reads stalls due to bursty RS traffic (Section 6.1.2,\nFigure 17) using a simple arbitration logic. It prevents RS\ntraffic from completely occupying DRAM queues by limiting\ncommunication-related accesses when a DRAM queue occu-\npancy reaches a threshold (5, 10, 30, or no limit) determined\nby the memory intensity of the GEMM kernel. T3-MCA pro-\nvides considerable benefits over sequential execution; maxi-\nmum of 47% and geomean of 30% (29% maximum and 13%\ngeomean over T3). Furthermore, the geomean speedup with\nT3-MCA is only 5% smaller than Ideal-GEMM-RS-Overlap.\nThere are individual cases where T3-MCA is far from ideal\n(e.g., FC-1 in T-NLG with TP=16). These represent cases\nwhere L2 bypassing (for near-memory update) of GEMM\nwrites hurts the GEMM\u2019s performance. Consequently, the\noverall overlapped runtime also increases.\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\nOP FC-2 FC-1 IP\nOP FC-2 FC-1 IP\nOP FC-2 FC-1 IP\nOP FC-2 FC-1 IP\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nT\nT\nTP=16\nTP=8\nTP=16\nTP=8\nMega-GPT-2(H=3K_SLB=16K)\nT-NLG(H=4256_SLB=8K)\nGeomean\n% Speedup over Sequential GEMM->RS\nT3\nT3-MCA\nIdeal RS+NMC\nIdeal GEMM-RS-Overlap\nTP=16\nTP=8\nFigure 16.

Figure 18 shows\nthe total memory accesses and their detailed breakdown\n(amongst GEMM, RS and AG reads/writes) for a single GPU\nacross all cases. While the AG reads/write remain constant\nbetween baseline (sequential) and T3-MCA, there is a combi-\nnation of reasons which impact the rest: (a) fusion of GEMM\nand RS eliminates local writes from GEMM\u2019s first stage and\nreads from RS\u2019s first step, (b) near-memory reductions elimi-\nnate reading of partial copies every RS step, as well as the\nreads and writes in the final step\u2019s reduction, and (c) LLC\nbypassing of GEMM\u2019s output writes improves input read\ncaching for cache-sensitive GEMMs, reducing GEMM\u2019s local\nreads. These impacts also vary depending on the TP degree:\nthe one-time reductions (in the first and last RS step) have a\nmuch higher impact with smaller TP degrees due to fewer\noverall RS steps. Conversely, GEMM read caching impact\nis higher with a larger TP degree; larger TP/slicing leads to\nsmaller, more LLC-amenable GEMMs. Overall, RS\u2019s reads\nreduce by 2.4\u00d7 geomean (2.5\u00d7 for TP=8, 2.2\u00d7 for TP=16),\nboth GEMM\u2019s and RS\u2019s writes reduce by 10% geomean (14%\nfor TP=8, 7% for TP=16), and finally GEMM\u2019s reads decrease\nby 1.56\u00d7 geomean (1.2\u00d7 for TP=8, 2\u00d7 for TP=16).\n6.3\nEnd-to-end Model Speedups\nAs shown in Figure 19, T3 and T3-MCA speed up model\ntraining by a maximum of 9% and 12%, and geomean of 7%\nand 10%, respectively. Benefits are higher at larger TPs due to\nthe overall higher proportion of the sliced sub-layers requir-\ning AR (Section 4). Similarly, prompt processing and/or large\ninput token processing during inference is also sped up by a\nmaximum of 12% and 15%, and geomean of 9% and 12% with\nT3 and T3-MCA, respectively. Inference speedups are better\ndue to the overall higher proportion of sliced sub-layers re-\nsulting from no backprop compute. Finally, the MLPerfv1.1\nimplementation we evaluate does not include a key fusion\noptimization [13], which makes the non-sliced attention op-\nerations a significant 40-45% of execution time.

These lead to up to 12% and 14%\nend-to-end speedup in their training and prompt phase of\ninference, respectively. Thus, T3-MCA also effectively speeds\nup larger models.\n7\nDiscussion\n7.1\nOther Collectives Implementation & Types\nT3 supports other collectives and implementations via the\nconfiguration of GEMM\u2019s output address space (Section 4.4).\nOther implementations: Collectives can have multiple im-\nplementations optimized for different topologies. We focus\non ring since it is commonly used in intra-node setups where\ntensor slicing is employed [26]. T3 can also support the di-\nrect RS implementation in a fully-connected topology. At\nevery GEMM stage, the output from each device is scattered\nacross the remaining devices using dedicated links and re-\nduced at the destination. This is accomplished by changing\nthe configuration in Figure 12 to slice each GEMM stage\noutput and remote_map each slice to a remote device. In this\ncase T3 eliminates memory accesses by the collective as it\nis completely orchestrated using GEMM stores. Similarly,\nit can also support other, inter-node implementations via\nappropriate programming of the track & trigger mechanism.\n0.E+00\n5.E+06\n1.E+07\n2.E+07\n2.E+07\n3.E+07\n3.E+07\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nBaseline\nT3-MCA\nOP\nFC-2\nFC-1\nIP\nOP\nFC-2\nFC-1\nIP\nOP\nFC-2\nFC-1\nIP\nFC-2\nFC-2\nOP\nIP\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nfwd\nbwd\nTP=16\nTP=8\nTP=16\nTP=8\nMega-GPT-2(H=3K_SLB=16K)\nT-NLG(H=4256_SLB=8K)\nDRAM Accesses\nAG Reads\nAG Writes\n GEMM Reads\nGEMM Writes\nRS Reads\nRS Writes\nFigure 18. DRAM access per sub-layer.\nOther types: Similarly, T3 also supports other collectives.\nA ring/direct all-gather (AG) reuses ring-RS\u2019s configuration\nand setup, except the GEMMs and DMA transfers do not\nupdate memory locations. Similar to AG, T3 can also support\nan all-to-all collective where devices exchange sub-arrays,\nexcept here the remote/dma_mapped GEMM output is not\nwritten to local memory.\n7.2\nOther Distributed Techniques\nAlthough we focus on communication in tensor-parallel (TP)\nsetups, T3 is also applicable in other distributed setups where\na producer\u2019s output is communicated via a collective.\nExpert Parallelism: Similar to TP, expert parallelism in\nMixture-of-experts (MoEs) [17, 69] require serialized all-to-\nall communication which can be fused with T3 as discussed\nin Section 7.1.\nData & Pipeline Parallelism: T3 also applies to data-parallel\nand pipeline-parallel setups which require RS, and peer-to-\npeer transfers, respectively. While T3\u2019s overlapping benefits\nmay not provide additional benefits in such cases (these\ncommunications can be overlapped with other independent\nkernels), T3\u2019s NMC and MCA techniques can help reduce\nmemory bandwidth contention in these cases as well.\nTP with All-gather: T3 can be extended for distributed\nsetups where the collective\u2019s output requires overlapping\nwith a long-running consumer operation. This is required if\nthe producer is short-running (e.g., TP which all-gather\u2019s ac-\ntivations). Overlapping collective-consumer pairs is similar\nin principle to overlapping producer-collective and requires\nsimilar tracking/triggering mechanisms. The Tracker would\ntrack \u201call-gathered-input\u2192GEMM-WG\u201d instead of \u201cGEMM-\nWG\u2192all-reduced-output\u201d. Moreover, instead of triggering\na DMA, it would trigger a WG scheduling event (such as in\nLustig & Martonosi [42]). This can be challenging since the\n\u201call-gathered-input\u2192GEMM-WG\u201d mapping can be kernel\nimplementation dependent. However, additional program-\nming hints could overcome this.\n7.3\nGenerative Inference\nWhile we focus on the communication-heavy training and\nprompt phase of inference, T3 is also applicable in the gener-\nation phase of inference.

T3 on future hardware with 2\u00d7 com-\npute.\n(Section 2.1), these phases are bound by memory accesses of\nmodel weights and can benefit from the aggregate memory\nbandwidth of multiple devices that TP provides [6]. The re-\nsulting all-reduce of activations, while smaller than those in\ntraining and thus potentially latency-bound (due to small to-\nken counts), can still be overlapped and hidden with GEMM\nexecutions using T3.\n7.4\nOther Reduction Substrates\nWhile T3 leverages NMC for atomic updates required in\nreduction-based collectives (e.g., RS, AR), it is not a require-\nment. Such updates could also be handled via system-wide\natomics on uncached data without significant loss in perfor-\nmance. Similarly, T3 can also leverage switches for reduc-\ntions as shown by prior works [36].\n7.5\nFuture Hardware & Lower Precision\nSince compute FLOPS have scaled much more than network\nlink bandwidths across hardware generations [19, 54, 56, 60],\ncommunication will likely be a larger proportion of the end-\nto-end execution both in more recent systems than the one\nwe evaluate and in the future. Similarly, lowering preci-\nsion [46, 75] decreases compute time much more (quadrati-\ncally) than communication (linearly). Thus, the benefits of\nhiding communication with techniques like T3 will also ap-\nply to other GPU configurations and datatypes besides 16b.\nTo evaluate T3\u2019s hiding capability in future systems, we\nstudy a system configuration where compute FLOPS scale\nmore than network link bandwidth (2\u00d7), which we term\nGPU-2X-CU. While the scaling GPU FLOPs across genera-\ntions largely result from more powerful CUs (larger/faster\ntensor processing), we simulate it by scaling the number of\nCUs and keeping the underlying network the same. This\nenables us to use the latest/validated GPU model and GEMM\ntraces that Accel-Sim supports [33]. Figure 20 shows that for\nlarger layers (FC-2) where compute time dominates, com-\npute becomes faster with 2\u00d7 CUs which lowers the com-\npute:communication ratio across the models. This short-\nens the critical path and leads to larger benefits with over-\nlapping compute and communication with T3. Conversely,\nfor smaller layers (OP), where compute and communica-\ntion are more balanced, faster compute exposes communica-\ntion on critical path, lowering T3\u2019s benefits. Note that, for\nsuch scenarios, communication optimizations will be nec-\nessary [10, 77]. Nevertheless, the larger layers have a more\nprominent impact on overall execution and for these, T3\u2019s\nbenefits only improve.\n7.6\nNMC for Following Operations\nCollectives, specifically all-reduce in Transformers, are usu-\nally followed by other memory-intensive operations on all de-\nvices (e.g., parameter updates in DP [63] or residual/dropout\nlayers in TP). These operations redundantly operate on the\nentire all-reduced array on each device. With T3, these fol-\nlowing memory-intensive operations can be executed us-\ning NMC [63] on (reduced) sub-arrays of data before they\nare all-gathered/broadcasted to the remaining devices, thus\nreducing redundancy, and further accelerating distributed\nTransformer models.\n7.7\nOther GEMM Implementations\nT3 focuses on the most common tiled GEMM implementation\nwith a WG/WF responsible to generate an entire tile/sub-tile\nof data. However, T3 can support other implementations,\nsuch as split-K [58]. A split-K implementation slices work in\nthe accumulation or \ud835\udc3e dimension, such that multiple WGs\nare responsible for a single tile, each generating a partial\ntile that is reduced after. Split-K increases parallelism when\nthe output size (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc41) is small but the \ud835\udc3e dimension is large.\nHowever, tensor-sliced GEMMs, which require AR, have\nlarge output sizes and small \ud835\udc3e dimensions. Naively, T3 with\na split-K implementation (with more than one update to an\nelement) will cause multiple local and remote updates per\nmemory location. To prevent this, T3 can use the kernel\npackets\u2019 tile-size metadata to deduce split-k degree (=(#WGs\n* tile-size)/(M*N)), i.e., the number of updates per element.\nThe virtual addresses in the tracker (Section 4.2.1) can be\nused to determine WFs/WGs/tracker entries that update the\nsame tile, allowing the tracker to trigger remote DMA only\nafter all updates to the tile are complete.\nT3: Transparent Tracking & Triggering for Fine-grained Overlap of Compute & Collectives\nASPLOS \u201924, April 27-May 1, 2024, La Jolla, CA, USA\nApproach /\nFeatures\nGPU\nSupport\nTransparent\nCommunication\nOverlap\nCommunication\nReduce\nContention\nNo Additional\nAccelerator\nTopology-\nindependent\nIn-switch [36]\nX\nX\nX\nX\nACE [71]\nX\nX\nX\nX\nCoCoNet [25]\nX\nX\nGoogle Decomposition [86]\nX\nX\nX\nT3-MCA\nTable 3. Comparing T3-MCA to prior work.\n7.8\nMulti-node Setups\nTensor-parallelism, with serialized communication is usually\nemployed within a node, which generally has high-speed\nhomogeneous links. However, T3 can also be applied to seri-\nalized communication in inter-node setups with slower and\noften heterogeneous links. Consequently, communication\ncosts can be much larger than GEMM executions, poten-\ntially limiting the benefits from fine-grained overlap: once\nthe computation is completely overlapped, the remaining\ncommunication costs will be exposed [86]. Nevertheless, T3\ncan still provide benefits from hiding the GEMM execution\ncost as much as possible.\n8\nRelated Work\nTable 3 compares T3-MCA with prior works across several\nkey metrics. Some prior work has designed in-switch col-\nlectives to speed up communication by up to 2\u00d7 [36]. How-\never, this cannot eliminate serialized communication from\nthe critical path. Furthermore, they are topology-dependent,\nrequiring switches. Enabling fine-grained overlap of com-\npute and communication is essential to effectively hide the\ncost of communication. Existing attempts to do this, like\nCocoNet[25] and Google Decomposition [86], have limitations.\nGoogle Decomposition requires changes to matrix multipli-\ncation (GEMMs) kernels which can be disruptive to GPU\nsoftware infrastructure (Section 3.1).\nFurthermore, both approaches can suffer from hardware\nresource contention between compute and communication\n(Section 3.2). Works that reduce contention only address\ncoarse-grained overlap of compute and communication in\ncases like DP, lacking support for fine-grained overlap in\nserialized collectives [71]. Moreover, they rely on dedicated\naccelerators. Other recent work fuses communication within\nthe computation kernel to enable fine-grained overlap, such\nthat a GPU kernel performs both computation and depen-\ndent communication at the WG level [67]. However, this\nrequires explicit changes to the compute kernels and is not\nreadily applicable for collectives involving simple arithmetic\noperation such as reduce-scatter \u2013 which will still be lim-\nited by inter-GPU synchronization. Finally, other work like\nSyndicate increases coarse-grained overlap opportunities\nand efficiency in distributed training. However, Syndicate\ncannot hide serialized communication [43]. T3-MCA over-\ncomes these shortcomings and achieves a transparent overlap\nof serialized communication with compute, while minimizing\nresource contention.\n9\nConclusion\nTransformer models increasingly rely on distributed tech-\nniques, requiring communication between multiple devices.\nThis communication can limit scaling efficiency, especially\nfor techniques like Tensor Parallelism (TP) which serialize\ncommunication with model execution. While a fine-grained\noverlap of the serialized communication with its producer\ncomputation can help hide the cost, realizing it with GPUs is\nchallenging due to software complexities and resource con-\ntention between compute and communication. To overcome\nthis, we propose T3, which transparently and efficiently fuses\nand overlaps serialized inter-device communication with the\nproducer\u2019s compute. It orchestrates communication on the\nproducer\u2019s stores by configuring the producer\u2019s output ad-\ndress space mapping and using a programmable track and\ntrigger mechanism in hardware. This reduces application\nimpact and also eliminates contention for GPU compute re-\nsources. T3 additionally uses near-memory computing and\na memory-controller arbitration policy to reduce memory-\nbandwidth contention. Overall, T3 improves performance\nby 30% geomean (max 47%) and reduces data movement by\n22% geomean (max 36%) over state-of-the-art approaches.\nMoreover, T3\u2019s benefits hold as models and hardware scale.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank our shepherd, Saeed Maleki, and the\nanonymous reviewers for their feedback that helped improve\nthis paper.

Our approach, named instruction backtranslation, starts with a language\nmodel finetuned on a small amount of seed data, and a given web corpus. The seed\nmodel is used to construct training examples by generating instruction prompts\nfor web documents (self-augmentation), and then selecting high quality examples\nfrom among these candidates (self-curation). This data is then used to finetune\na stronger model. Finetuning LLaMa on two iterations of our approach yields a\nmodel that outperforms all other LLaMa-based models on the Alpaca leaderboard\nnot relying on distillation data, demonstrating highly effective self-alignment.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nAligning large language models (LLMs) to perform instruction following typically requires finetuning\non large amounts of human-annotated instructions or preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron\net al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2022a) or distilling outputs from more powerful models (Wang et al., 2022a;\nHonovich et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023).\nRecent work highlights the importance of human-annotation data quality (Zhou et al., 2023; K\u00f6pf\net al., 2023). However, annotating instruction following datasets with such quality is hard to scale.\nIn this work, we instead leverage large amounts of unlabelled data to create a high quality instruction\ntuning dataset by developing an iterative self-training algorithm. The method uses the model itself\nto both augment and curate high quality training examples to improve its own performance. Our\napproach, named instruction backtranslation, is inspired by the classic backtranslation method from\nmachine translation, in which human-written target sentences are automatically annotated with\nmodel-generated source sentences in another language (Sennrich et al., 2015).\nOur method starts with a seed instruction following model and a web corpus. The model is first used\nto self-augment its training set: for each web document, it creates an instruction following training\nexample by predicting a prompt (instruction) that would be correctly answered by (a portion of) that\ndocument. Directly training on such data (similarly to K\u00f6ksal et al. (2023)) gives poor results in our\nexperiments, both because of the mixed quality of human written web text, and noise in the generated\ninstructions. To remedy this, we show that the same seed model can be used to self-curate the set of\nnewly created augmentation data by predicting their quality, and can then be self-trained on only the\nhighest quality (instruction, output) pairs. The procedure is then iterated, using the improved model\nto better curate the instruction data, and re-training to produce a better model.\nOur resulting model, Humpback, outperforms all other existing non-distilled models on the Alpaca\nleaderboard (Li et al., 2023). Overall, instruction backtranslation is a scalable method for enabling\nlanguage models to improve their own ability to follow instructions.\n2\nMETHOD\nOur self-training approach assumes access to a base language model, a small amount of seed data,\nand a collection of unlabelled examples, e.g. a web corpus. The unlabelled data is a large, diverse set\n1\narXiv:2308.06259v3  [cs.CL]  12 Mar 2024\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nUnlabelled Data \nLLaMA\nSeed Data\nAugmented Data\nStep 0.\nInitialization\nAugmented Data\nAugmented Data\nStep 1.

We start from a base language\nmodel, e.g. LLaMa, a small amount of seed examples of (instruction, output) pairs, and a collection\nof unlabelled documents which are considered candidate outputs for unknown instructions. Self-\naugmentation: the base model is finetuned with (output, instruction) pairs from the seed examples as\nan instruction prediction model Myx, which is used to generate candidate instructions for outputs\nfrom the unlabelled data. Self-curation: starting from an intermediate instruction-following model\nM0 finetuned from seed examples only, it selects high-quality (instruction, output) pairs A(1)\nk\nfrom\nthe candidates from the previous step, and uses them as finetuning data for the next intermediate\nmodel M1, which is in turn used to select training data for obtaining M2.\nof human-written documents which includes writing about all manner of topics humans are interested\nin \u2013 but crucially is not paired with instructions. A first key assumption is that there exists some\nsubset of this very large human-written text that would be suitable as gold generations for some user\ninstructions. A second key assumption is that we can predict instructions for these candidate gold\nanswers that can be used as high quality example pairs to train an instruction following model.\nOur overall process, which we call instruction backtranslation, thus performs two core steps:\n1. Self-augment: Generate instructions for unlabelled data, i.e. the web corpus, to produce candidate\ntraining data of (instruction, output) pairs for instruction tuning.\n2. Self-curate: Self-select high quality demonstration examples as training data to finetune the\nbase model to follow instructions. This approach is done iteratively where a better intermediate\ninstruction-following model can improve on selecting data for finetuning in the next iteration.\nWe describe these steps in more details below. An overview of the approach is illustrated in Figure 1.\n2.1\nINITIALIZATION\nSeed data.\nWe start with a seed set of human-annotated (instruction, output) examples that will be\nused to fine-tune language models to give initial predictions in both directions: predicting an output\ngiven an instruction, and an instruction given an output.\nUnlabelled data.\nWe use a web corpus as a source of unlabelled data. For each document, we\nperform preprocessing to extract self-contained segments {yi}, which are portions of text following\nan HTML header. We further run deduplication, length filtering, and remove potential low quality\nsegments with several heuristics such as the proportion of capitalized letters in the header.\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n2.2\nSELF-AUGMENTATION (GENERATING INSTRUCTIONS)\nWe finetune the base language model with (output, instruction) pairs {(yi, xi)} from the seed data\nto obtain a backward model Myx := p(x|y). For each unlabelled example yi, we run inference\non the backward model to generate a candidate instruction \u02c6xi from which we derive the candidate\naugmented paired data A := {( \u02c6xi, yi)}. As we will see in experiments, not all of these candidate\npairs are of high quality, and in that case using them all for self-training may not be beneficial. We\nthus consider the important next step of curation of a high quality subset.\n2.3\nSELF-CURATION (SELECTING HIGH-QUALITY EXAMPLES)\nWe select high quality examples using the language model itself. We start with a seed instruction\nmodel M0 finetuned on (instruction, output) seed examples only. We then use M0 to score each\naugmented example {(\u02c6xi, yi)} to derive a quality score ai. This is done using prompting, instructing\nthe trained model to rate the quality of a candidate pair on a 5-point scale. The precise prompt we use\nis given in Table 19. We can then select a subset of the augmented examples with score ai \u2265 k to\nform a curated set A(1)\nk .\nIterative self-curation\nWe further propose an iterative training method to produce higher quality\npredictions. On iteration t we use the curated augmentation data A(t\u22121)\nk\nfrom the previous iteration,\nalong with the seed data as training data to finetune an improved model Mt. This model in turn can\nbe used to rescore the augmented examples for quality, resulting in an augmentation set A(t)\nk . We\nperform two iterations of data selection and finetuning to get the final model M2.\nWhen combining both seed data and augmented data for finetuning, we use tagging to distinguish\nthese two data sources. Specifically, we append an additional sentence to examples (called \u201csystem\nprompt\"). We use Sa := \u201cAnswer in the style of an AI Assistant.\" for seed data, and Sw := \u201cAnswer\nwith knowledge from web search.\" for augmented data. This approach is similar to methods used to\ntag synthetic data for backtranslation in machine translation (Caswell et al., 2019).\n3\nEXPERIMENTS\n3.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nSeed data.\nWe use 3200 examples from the Open Assistant dataset (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023) as human-\nannotated seed data to train our models. Each example is an (instruction, output) pair {(xi, yi)},\nchosen from the first turn of the conversation tree. We only sample English language responses that\nare high quality, based on their human annotated rank (rank 0).\nBase model & finetuning.\nWe use the pretrained LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023a) with 7B,\n33B and 65B parameters as the base models for finetuning. During training, we only optimize the\nloss on the output tokens, not the input tokens, thus deviating from the standard language modeling\nloss. We use the same hyperparameters as existing supervised finetuning (SFT) methods (Zhou\net al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a) for most models: learning rate 1e \u2212 5 which linearly decays\nto 9e \u2212 6 at the end of training, weight decay 0.1, batch size 32 (examples) and dropout 0.1. For\nfinetuning with less than 3000 examples we use batch size 8 (more details in Table 18). We refer to\nour trained Llama-based instruction backtranslation model as Humpback1. For generation, we use\nnucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019) with temperature T = 0.7, p = 0.9.\nUnlabelled data.\nWe use the English portion of the Clueweb corpus as the source of unlabelled\ndata (Overwijk et al., 2022). Among those, we sampled 502k segments.\nBaselines.\nThe main baselines we compare to are the following approaches:\n\u2022 text-davinci-003 (Ouyang et al., 2022): an instruction following model based on GPT-3 finetuned\nwith instruction data from human-written instructions, human-written outputs, model responses\nand human preferences using reinforcement learning (RLHF).\n1Due to its relation to camel\u2019s backs, but also the large scale nature of whales (\n>\n).\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 1: Statistics of seed, self-augmentation and self-curation finetuning data. Instruction and output\nlengths are given as the number of characters.\n# examples\nInstruction Length\nOutput Length\nSeed data\n3200\n148 \u00b1 322\n1072 \u00b1 818\nAugmented data, A(2)\n5\n41821\n115 \u00b1 175\n1663 \u00b1 616\nAugmented data, A(2)\n4\n195043\n206 \u00b1 298\n1985 \u00b1 649\nAugmented data, all\n502133\n352 \u00b1 134\n1722 \u00b1 653\n\u2022 LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023): LLaMA models finetuned with 1000 manually selected instruction\nexamples from a mixture of community question & answering (e.g. StackOverflow, WikiHow, etc.)\nand human expert-written instruction and responses.\n\u2022 Guanaco (Dettmers et al., 2023): LLaMA models finetuned with 9000 examples from the Ope-\nnAssistant dataset. The difference from the 3200 seed examples used in this paper is that Guanaco\nincludes (instruction, output) pairs from all turns while we only used the first-turn.\nWe additionally report comparisons to various other models, e.g. which use data distilled from larger\nand more powerful models such as GPT-4, but do not consider them as directly comparable to our\nLlaMa-based approach.\nEvaluation.\nWe evaluate on test prompts from several sources: Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) (80\nprompts), Self-instruct (Zhang & Yang, 2023) (252 prompts), Open Assistant (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023) (188\nprompts), Koala (Geng et al., 2023) (156 prompts), HH_RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) (129 prompts),\nLIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) (300 prompts), crowdsourced from authors (64 prompts). In total there are\n1130 unique prompts, providing a good coverage on a variety of task categories, e.g. writing, coding,\nmathematical reasoning, information seeking, advice, roleplay, safety, etc. We sample 256 prompts\nfrom them excluding those in the AlpacaEval test set as a dev set. We ran both automatic evaluation\nusing AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023), which computes the win rate against baseline models based on\nGPT-4 judgements, as well as human preference evaluation.\n3.2\nSEED AND AUGMENTATION DATA STATISTICS\nData statistics.\nIn Table 1 we provide the statistics of the seed data as well as various versions of\nthe augmented data. We can see that augmented data tends to have longer outputs compared to the\nseed data, and self-curated higher quality training data (A(2)\n4\nand A(2)\n5 ) has both shorter instructions\nand outputs among all augmented data, closer to the length of the original seed instruction data.\nGenerated Instructions.\nWe conduct the task diversity analysis of the seed data and augmented\ndata using the approach from Wang et al. (2022a). Figure 6 visualizes the distribution of the verb-noun\nstructure of instructions in the seed data and augmented data (A(2)\n5\ncategory) respectively. Similar to\nthe seed data, there are a few head tasks related to writing, information seeking and advice, although\nthe type of content from unlabeled data (article, recipe, description, release, etc.) complements those\nin the seed data (essay, script, code, story, etc.). The augmented data increases the task diversity\nespecially in the long tail.\n3.3\nSCALING ANALYSIS\nData quality vs. data quantity.\nIn order to understand the importance of data quality vs. data\nquantity in learning to follow instructions, we compared finetuning on augmented data of different\nquality. Specifically, we compared finetuning on augmented data without quality-based selection\n(w/o curation), self-selected data in A(2)\n4\n(score \u2265 4) and A(2)\n5\n(score \u2265 4.5) categories. Results are\nshown in Figure 2. We find that training on augmented data without self-curation does not improve\ninstruction following performance despite scaling up data quantity. However, training on the high\nquality portion of the augmented data leads to increasing instruction following performance, with\nsteady improvement as we continue to scale up the amount of augmented data.

The\ny-axis is the win rate against text-davinci-003 when finetuning 7B LLaMa with the given data size\nand quality. We compare three augmentation datasets: without self-curation, A(2)\n4\nand A(2)\n5\nthat are\nprogressively smaller augmentation sets but of higher data quality (see Table 1 for statistics). Similar\nto observations in LIMA using human-annotated data (Zhou et al., 2023), improving the quality of\nthe training data dramatically improves the quality of the model, despite the smaller dataset size.\nthe \u201csuperficial alignment hypothesis\", that only a few thousands of high-quality instruction following\nexamples are sufficient for aligning a pretrained base model to follow instructions Zhou et al. (2023).\nOur results provide a contrasting observation that increasing the quantity of high-quality data provides\nfurther gains (whereas increased quantities of low-quality data does not).\nData scaling efficiency.\nWe compare the performance of various instruction-following models as\nwe alter the amount of instruction following finetune data they use. We measure the win rate of each\nmodel against text-davinci-003 when finetuning 7B LLaMa with the given finetune dataset. We also\nreport an estimate of this efficiency using the data scaling coefficient \u03b1, which is calculated by fitting\nempirical data with w = \u03b1 log N + C, where w is the win rate measuring generation quality of the\nmodel finetuned on N examples.\nWe compare our instruction backtranslation method (self-augmentation and self-curation with k = 5,\n2 iterations) to methods using instruction datasets created from different sources.\nTable 2: Scaling coefficient \u03b1 of representive instruction datasets created using differnet methods and\ndata sources.\nSource\n\u03b1 \u2191\nHumpback (this work)\nOA, self-augmented and self-curated\n6.95\nWizardLLM2 (Xu et al., 2023)\nDistilled from ChatGPT, GPT-4 (June 2023)\n5.69\nAlpaca-GPT4 (Peng et al., 2023)\nDistilled from GPT-4 (April 2023)\n5.40\nVicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\nDistilled from ChatGPT, GPT-4 (June 2023)\n4.53\nOpen Assistant (OA) (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023)\nHuman Annotation\n4.43\nLIMA (Zhou et al., 2023)\nHuman Annotation, Community QA\n2.86\nAlpaca (Taori et al., 2023)\nDistilled from ChatGPT (March 2023)\n1.99\nFLAN v2 (Chung et al., 2022)\nInstruction data for NLP tasks\n0.22\nResults are shown in Figure 3, with the estimated scaling coefficient \u03b1 summarized in Table 2.

We provide further\nanalysis on jointly scaling data and model size in Appendix B.\n3.4\nMODEL QUALITY\nAlpacaEval.\nWe use the automatic evaluation (using GPT-4) from AlpacaEval to evaluate genera-\ntion quality on 805 prompts from the Alpaca Leaderboard. AlpacaEval compares the pairwise win\nrate against the reference model text-davinci-003. We compare our method\u2019s performance among\nthree categories of instruction models:\n\u2022 Non-distilled: LLaMa models trained without relying on any external model (e.g. ChatGPT,\nGPT-4, etc.) for any form of supervision. Most models in this category heavily rely on human\nannotated data.\n\u2022 Distilled: models trained with a more powerful external model in the loop, e.g. using data distilled\nfrom an external model.\n\u2022 Proprietary: models trained with proprietary data and techniques.\nResults are given in Table 3. Our method is the top-performing model among non-distilled models at\nboth 65B and 33B model scales. We note that Guanaco and OASST are trained on the same data\nsource as our seed data, but with more annotated examples. We also evaluated Humpback based on\nLLaMa 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) 70B to verify its performance further improves with stronger base\nmodel.\nHuman Evaluation.\nWe also conduct human evaluation on the general quality of the model\nresponses on the combined test set described in Section 3.1, which covers several existing benchmarks.\nFor each prompt, we present outputs from two models side-by-side, comparing our method to a\ngiven baseline model, and ask the human evaluator to choose from three options: 1) output from\nthe first model is significantly better than the second model; 2) output from the second model is\nsignificantly better than the first model; 3) there is no significant difference between the two outputs.\nWe randomize the order the models are presented in to avoid position bias. Figure 4 summarizes the\ncomparison with both open source and proprietary models. We can see that the human preference\ndistribution is roughly consistent with the preference distribution using GPT-4 as the judge from\nAlpacaEval, corroborating observations from Li et al. (2023), Zhou et al. (2023) and Zheng et al.\n(2023).\nCommonsense Reasoning and MMLU.\nWe evaluate on five commonsense reasoning benchmarks,\nSIQA (Sap et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), Arc-Easy (Clark et al., 2018), Arc-Challenge\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 3: Results on the Alpaca leaderboard (win rate over text-davinci-003 evaluated by GPT-4).\nHumpback outperforms other non-distilled models by a wide margin with efficient data scaling\nbeyond human annotated data.\nAnnotated Examples\nTotal Examples\nWin Rate %\nNon-\ndistilled\nHumpback 33B\n3k\n45k\n79.84\nOASST RLHF 33B\n161k\n161k\n66.52\nGuanaco 33B\n9k\n9k\n65.96\nOASST SFT 33B\n161k\n161k\n54.97\nNon-\ndistilled\nHumpback 65B\n3k\n45k\n83.71\nGuanaco 65B\n9k\n9k\n71.80\nLIMA 65B\n1k\n1k\n62.70\nNon-\ndistilled\nHumpback 70B\n3k\n45k\n87.94\nLLaMa2 Chat 70B\n1.4m\n5.7m\n92.66\nDistilled\nVicuna 33B\n140k\n140k\n88.99\nWizardLLM 13B\n190k\n190k\n86.32\nairoboros 65B\n17k\n17k\n73.91\nFalcon Instruct 40B\n100k\n100k\n45.71\nProprietary\nGPT-4\n95.28\nClaude 2\n91.36\nChatGPT\n89.37\nClaude\n88.39\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nWin rate (%)\nHumpback \nvs. Falcon-Instruct\nHumpback\nvs. davinci-003\nHumpback\nvs. Guanaco\nHumpback\nvs. Claude\nHumpback\nvs. LIMA\n81.4\n66.7\n59.6\n59.4\n55.6\n3.8\n13.5\n11.0\n7.5\n6.7\n14.9\n19.8\n29.4\n33.1\n37.8\nHumpback wins\nTie\nHumpback loses\nFigure 4: Humpback is preferred to both open source (e.g. LIMA(Zhou et al., 2023) (65B), Guanaco\n(Dettmers et al., 2023) (65B),Falcon-Instruct(Almazrouei et al., 2023)) (40B) and proprietary (e.g.\ndavinci-003(Ouyang et al., 2022) and Claude(Bai et al., 2022a)) instruction-tuned models in pairwise\nhuman preference judgements.\n(Clark et al., 2018), and Openbook QA (OBQA) (Mihaylov et al., 2018), which measures reasoning\nranging from social interactions to grade 3 to 9 science questions.

However, training on the higher quality self-curated data\nbrings improvements as training set size increases. While this self-curated data does not outperform\nseed training data scaling alone, when joint training with both seed and self-augmented data we\nobserve large improvements. This indicates that seed data and augmented data are complimentary,\nwhere the seed data has the same distribution as the target domain (AI assistant response), while\nthe data from web corpus may enlarge the diversity of the instructions and outputs. In Appendix B\nprovides further qualitative analysis to illustrate the improvement over training with seed data alone.\nSystem prompts.\nIn Table 5, we disentangle the effects of system prompts in joint finetuning\nand during inference. We found adding system prompts to distinguish augmented data from seed\ndata is helpful. Interestingly, using a combined system prompt {Sa, Sw} at inference time, which\nconcatenates the one for the seed data with the one for augmented data, is better than either no system\nprompt or using the seed data prompt, despite that the concatenation was not seen during training.\n4\nRELATED WORK\nInstruction tuning for LLMs.\nOur work shares the same goal as the broad category of efforts on\nfinetuning large language models to follow instructions. Early work on instruction tuning mainly\nfocused on NLP tasks, with the finding that finetuning with NLP datasets formatted as instruction-\noutput pairs improves cross-task generalization (Wei et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2021; Sanh et al.,\n2021; Wang et al., 2022b). Recent work Ouyang et al. (2022) extends instruction tuning to a broader\nrange of general tasks, especially incorporating instructions from users of language models.\nInstruction generation and curation.\nA key challenge to enable LLMs to perform general\ninstruction-following is gathering demonstration examples for finetuning. Existing high-quality\ninstruction-following LLMs rely on human annotations in various steps, including writing instruc-\ntions, writing model responses, providing preferences to indicate desired response, etc. Those\ninstruction sets are often proprietary, one exception being the recent OpenAssistant datasets (K\u00f6pf\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 5: Effect of system prompt. We report mean win rate and its standard error.\nTrain\nInference\nWin Rate (%)\nSa for seed data, Sw for augmented data\n{Sa, Sw}\n66.47 \u00b13.04\nno system prompt\nno system prompt\n59.96 \u00b13.09\nSa for seed data, Sw for augmented data\nSa\n62.69 \u00b13.06\nSa for seed data, Sw for augmented data\nno system prompt\n62.70 \u00b13.07\net al., 2023). Overall, the human annotation approach is difficult to scale since collecting annotations\non a wide range of tasks is expensive, time consuming and requires expertise in different domains.\nSeveral works have explored using LLMs to generate instructions. Unnatural instructions prompts\nGPT-3 to generate more instructions given a few in-context seed instructions (Honovich et al., 2022).\nSelf-instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) uses the same approach to generate instructions, as well as outputs\nfor those instructions. They further perform manually engineered filtering rules to remove low-quality\ninstruction-output pairs. Xu et al. (2023) generates more complex instructions by creating variants of\nuser instructions sent to ChatGPT.\nAll these approaches use model-generated responses for training data. More similar to our method is\nthe concurrent work of K\u00f6ksal et al. (2023), which takes human-written text as a natural response,\nand uses the LLM to generate the corresponding instruction conditioning on the response. A critical\ndifference in our work is that we show that the self-curation step is vital to improve such a procedure.\nA further difference is that they use distillation via an instruction tuned LLM (InstructGPT) to\ngenerate instructions, while our approach does not rely on distilling from a more powerful model in\nthe loop, and is instead an instance of self-alignment.\nSelf-alignment.\nOur work is an instance of the growing body of work on self-alignment, i.e.\nutilizing the model to improve itself and align its response with desired behaviors such as model-\nwritten feedback, critique, explanations, etc. Differently to our work, many of these works either\nconstruct training data in an unsupervised way (Sun et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022b), whereas we\naugment human-written web pages, or they use the model to generate additional context to condition\non at inference time to improve the output (Saunders et al., 2022; Zhang & Yang, 2023; Madaan et al.,\n2023).\nData quality.\nSeveral approaches have shown that curating high-quality human-written data results\nin strong performance, for example PALMS (Solaiman & Dennison, 2021) and LIMA (Zhou et al.,\n2023). Instead of manually curating high-quality data, our work focus on selecting high-quality using\nthe model itself. In concurrent work, Chen et al. (2023) also provides an algorithmic approach to\nselect high quality data. They differ from our work in that they prompt a stronger model (ChatGPT)\nto score the quality of model generated responses from distillation, while this work scores the quality\nof human-written data as a response to a self-generated instruction.\nDistillation.\nMost finetuned LLaMA models are based on knowledge distillation from ChatGPT or\nGPT-4, such as Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Alpaca-GPT 4(Peng et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al.,\n2023), FalconInstruct (Almazrouei et al., 2023), OpenChat (Wang et al., 2023), UltraChat (Ding et al.,\n2023). Hence, these approaches require that you already have a strong model, but do not provide a\nrecipe for building a strong model from scratch. Drawbacks of these approaches are also discussed in\nGudibande et al. (2023).\n5\nCONCLUSION\nWe proposed a scalable approach to finetune large language models to follow instructions. Our\nmethod leverages large amounts of unlabeled data by developing an iterative self-training algorithm\nthat we dub instruction backtranslation. Our method uses the model itself to both augment and curate\nhigh quality training examples to improve its own performance. On the Alpaca leaderboard, our\nfinetuned models outperform all other non-distilled instruction-following models, while using fewer\nhuman annotated examples. Future work should scale this method further by considering larger\nunlabeled corpora, which our analysis suggests should yield further gains.\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nREFERENCES\nEbtesam Almazrouei, Hamza Alobeidli, Abdulaziz Alshamsi, Alessandro Cappelli, Ruxandra Co-\njocaru, Merouane Debbah, Etienne Goffinet, Daniel Heslow, Julien Launay, Quentin Malartic,\nBadreddine Noune, Baptiste Pannier, and Guilherme Penedo.

We evaluate on the CrowS-Pairs dataset Nangia et al.\n(2020) to measure the model\u2019s performance in recognizing potential bias. Specifically, we evaluate\nthe accuracy in detecting biased statements in nine categories: gender, religion, race/color, sexual\norientation, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance and socioeconomic status. Compared to\nthe base model, our model has improved accuracy in detecting biases as is summarized in Table 6.\nHowever, this does not mean our model is less likely to generate responses that contain biases.\nTable 6: Accuracy of detecting various types of biases in the CrowS-Pair benchmark.\nHumpback\nLLaMA\nrace-color\n60.27\n48.64\nsocioeconomic\n60.47\n54.65\ngender\n45.42\n50.0\ndisability\n80.0\n45.0\nnationality\n66.67\n50.94\nsexual-orientation\n58.33\n52.38\nphysical-appearance\n58.73\n44.44\nreligion\n73.33\n50.48\nage\n66.67\n51.72\nAverage\n60.28\n50.0\nA.2\nSAFETY\nSince neither the seed data nor the augmented data intentionally include \u201cred teaming\" demonstration\nexamples nor does the finetuning stage optimize for detecting and reducing potential harm, we\nevaluate the model on 30 potentially sensitive prompts to understand our model\u2019s safety implications.\nWe found that for these set of prompts the model tends to produce a cautious response, or even refuses\nto provide information to fulfill the instruction. Further, we compared responses using different\nsystem prompts and found that using the seed data\u2019s system prompt Sa tends to yield safer responses.\nThis indicates that leveraging system prompts could be an effective solution to enhance safety. Table\n15 provides representative examples. Incorporating red teaming or other safety measures into our\naugmentation procedure could be a further avenue to explore, in particular existing work has shown\nthat instruction following models are capable of \u201cmorally self-correcting\" to mitigate producing\nharmful responses when instructed to do so Ganguli et al.

As is shown in Figure 7, the 65B seed model is a strong baseline,\nhowever adding high quality augmented data A5 brings further improvement.\nMMLU.\nTable 7 summarizes results on massive multitask language understanding (MMLU)\n(Hendrycks et al., 2020). Compared to the base model, our finetuned model has improved zero-shot\naccuracy across all domains, while underperforming the base model with 5-shot in-context examples.\nImprovement over seed model.\nAdding self-augmented data improved the failure cases of the\nseed model for 16% of test prompts (41 out of 251). We observe improved responses for several\ncategories: reasoning, information seeking, giving detailed advice, etc. as shown in Table 8. Table 11,\n12, 13 and 14 provides qualitative examples how adding augmented improves the response quality.\n14\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 7: Results on MMLU by domains.\nHumanities\nSTEM\nSocial Sciences\nOther\nAverage\nLLaMA 65B, 5-shot\n61.8\n51.7\n72.9\n67.4\n63.4\nLLaMA 65B, 0-shot\n63.0\n42.5\n62.3\n57.5\n54.8\nHumpback 65B, 0-shot\n65.6\n47.6\n68.1\n60.8\n59.0\nTable 8: Adding self-augmented and self-curated instruction data improves generation quality over\nthe seed model for 41 out of 251 test prompts.

As shown in Table 9,\nself-curation performance is improved in the second iteration (using M1 vs. M0) in terms of selecting\nhigh quality data (Precision/Recall). Further, this also corresponds to better instruction following\nwhen finetuning on the selected data, as shown by the Win Rate. A key observation is that although\nthe intermediate models do not have very high precision, training on the selected data still improves\ninstruction following. This helps explain the effectiveness of our method.\nC\nGENERATION SAMPLES\nGenerated instructions.\nTable 10 includes examples of the generated instructions.\nSample outputs with improvement over the seed model.\nTable 11, 12, 13 and 14 provides\nexamples in categories of mathematical reasoning, general information seeking, providing advice and\nwriting, etc.\nSample outputs for safety prompts.\nTable 15 and 16 provides examples of responding to sensitive\nprompts.\nFailure cases.\nOverall, we found our method could not generate high quality responses for instruc-\ntions which specify some specific formats, e.g. ASCII art. Table 17 includes a few representative\ninstructions. Future work should improve coverage of long tail categories of outputs, by larger scale\nbacktranslation, or upsampling some distributions of unlabelled data.\nD\nHUMAN EVALUATION\nWe carry out our human evaluation using the Mephisto platform 3 with Mturk workers. As identified\nin Bai et al. (2022a), we note that while Mturk workers are often able to produce data at a faster rate,\nthere is typically a trade-off in terms of quality. Consequently, it necessary to implement a rigorous\nselection process for these workers.\n3https://mephisto.ai/\n15\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 9: Comparison of data selection methods. Precision and recall of selecting high quality data is\ncomputed on a 250 dev set labelled by an expert human (author) as high or low quality. Win rate is\nagainst text-davinci-003, from a 7B LLaMa finetuned on 100 examples of the selected data.

We set the approved rate to be equal or larger than 99%. (ii) Number HITs Approved:\nThe total number of HITs submitted by a Worker that have been approved. We set the number to\nbe equal or larger than 1000. (iii) Locale: The location of the Worker, as specified in the Worker\u2019s\nmailing address. We set the locations requirement to be the United States of America, Great Britain,\nAustralia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland. (iv) Master Qualification: Initially, we mandated that only\nworkers have a Master Qualification could complete our HITs. However, upon evaluation, we found\nthat the quality of work provided by masters was not significantly superior, yet it incurred higher\ncosts. Consequently, we have decided not to include this as a qualification requisite in our final\nconfigurations.\nScreening Tests\nIn the process of our screening test, we selected 200 prompts from the Pushshift\nReddit and Stack Exchange datasets, and then utilized LIMA-7B Zhou et al. (2023) to generate\ntwo distinct responses per prompt. Subsequently, an in-house evaluation was conducted, involving\nfour of our team\u2019s researchers, who were asked to express their preference as depicted in Figure 8.\nNotably, this process deviates from our live launch procedure. During these screening tests, we\nrequire annotators to not only select a preferred response but also provide written rationale for their\nchoice.\nWe curated a selection of 10 examples adhering to the following criteria: (i) 100% agreement within\n4 annotators; (ii) the assigned label from our in-house human raters should not fall under the \"neither\"\ncategory; (iii) the samples should present a discerning choice for the annotators, meaning they should\nnot contain any random words or be straightforward to decide upon. It\u2019s essential for the annotators\nto thoroughly read and analyze before making a choice.\nWe conducted a screening test using 10 examples and selected annotators based on the following\ncriteria: (i) those who achieved an agreement rate exceeding 85% with our in-house annotators\n(considering \u2019neither\u2019 choices as half agreements). The distribution of agreement during the screening\ntest is illustrated in Figure 9.

construct a steam engine using an empty beer can:\nGather materials:\nTo build this project, you\u2019ll need an empty beer can, a cork that\nfits snugly in the opening of the can, a plastic straw, a rubber band, duct tape, and\nfins made from cardboard or plastic.\nPrepare the can:\nCut off the top of the can, and use a file or sandpaper to smooth\nthe edges.\nThen, cut out a rectangle from the bottom of the can, and attach fins to\nthe sides with duct tape.\nMake the piston:\nCut a piece of plastic straw to fit inside the can, and attach a\ncork to one end of it.\nUse duct tape to seal the other end of the straw, leaving\nenough space for air to flow through.\nAssemble the engine:\nInsert the piston into the can, and place the cork side down.\nThen, use a rubber band to connect the straw to the outside of the can.\nWhen you\nblow into the straw, the cork will move up and down, causing the piston to move in\nand out of the can.\nThis movement simulates a real steam engine.\nTest the engine:\nAfter assembling the engine, test it by blowing into the straw.\nThe cork should move up and down, and the piston should move in and out of the can.\nIf everything works correctly, you\u2019ve successfully built a steam engine using an\nempty beer can!\n+A5\nConverting an empty beer can into a working steam engine may sound complicated, but\nit\u2019s actually an easy and fun project.\nAll you need is an empty beer can, a few\nhousehold items, and some basic tools.\nWith a little time and patience, you can have\na fully operational miniature steam engine to show off to friends and family.\nHere are the steps required to construct the project:\nGather Materials:\nFirst, gather all the materials needed for the project.\nYou\u2019ll\nneed an empty beer can, a small metal container (such as a tin can or Altoids box), a\ncork that fits snugly in the can, a small plastic straw, duct tape, glue, scissors,\nand a drill.\nYou\u2019ll also need some water and a heat source such as a candle or a hot\nplate.\nPrepare the Can:\nUse the scissors to remove the top of the beer can, and use the\ndrill to make four holes in the bottom of the can.\nTwo of the holes should be\nslightly smaller than the diameter of the cork, and the other two should be slightly\nlarger than the diameter of the straw.\nMake the Piston:\nCut off the top of the small metal container and use the glue to\nattach it to the bottom of the beer can, with the open side facing downwards.\nThis\nwill act as the piston chamber.\nInsert the Cork and Straw:\nInsert the cork into one of the smaller holes in the\nbottom of the can.\nThe cork should fit snugly but be able to move freely.\nInsert\nthe straw through one of the larger holes, making sure that the opening of the straw\nis facing upwards toward the piston chamber.\nFill with Water:\nFill the beer can with water until it reaches just below the level\nof the straw.\nLeave some room at the top of the can for the steam to accumulate.\nHeat the Can:\nPlace the can on a heat source such as a hot plate or candle flame.\nThe water will eventually begin to boil, generating steam.\nObserve the Steam Engine in Action:\nAs the steam builds up in the can, it will push\nthe piston upwards, forcing the straw to move with it.\nBecause the straw is bent,\nit will move in a circular motion, effectively converting the linear motion of the\npiston into rotary motion.\nExperiment with Different Design Elements:\nTry experimenting with different designs\nto see how they affect the operation of the steam engine.\nFor example, changing\nthe dimensions of the piston chamber or the angle of the straw may produce different\nresults.\nConclusion:\nBy following these steps, you can construct a simple steam engine using\nan empty beer can and a few basic materials.\nThis project is a great way to learn\nabout the principles of steam engines and how they work.\n21\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 13:

How-\never, existing conversational and role-playing datasets often fail to capture the diverse and\nnuanced interactions typically exhibited by real-world role-play participants. To address\nthis limitation and contribute to the rapidly growing field, we introduce a partially-synthetic\ndataset named PIPPA (Personal Interaction Pairs between People and AI). PIPPA is a re-\nsult of a community-driven crowdsourcing effort involving a group of role-play enthusiasts.\nThe dataset comprises over 1 million utterances that are distributed across 26,000 conver-\nsation sessions and provides a rich resource for researchers and AI developers to explore\nand refine conversational AI systems in the context of role-play scenarios.\nKeywords:\nconversational dataset; role-play dataset; fine-tuning; large language model\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, the field of natural language processing has experienced a significant trans-\nformation, primarily driven by the remarkable advancements in large language models\n(LLMs). These models, fueled by extensive pre-training data and computational resources,\nexhibit an extraordinary ability to comprehend and generate human-like text. In order\nto harness their full potential and tailor them to specific domains, a set of high quality\ndomain-specific samples are typically required during the supervised fine-tuning process\n(Zhou et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022).\nA promising application of LLMs, which is somewhat overshadowed by others in academia,\nis to build dialogue agents specialized in role-play (Shanahan et al., 2023). Specifically, given\na text-based description of some character or persona, the agent can simulate this character\nwhile users interact with the agent for the purposes of entertainment.\nSimilar to numerous applications that necessitate the intricate capabilities of LLMs,\neffectively fine-tuning an LLM into a proficient role-play agent demands a substantial corpus\nof conversation and role-play centered texts. This is particularly crucial when employing\nsmall base models, which offer greater convenience and cost-effectiveness in deployment and\n\u2217. Tear Gosling and Alpin Dale were primarily responsible for curating and assembling the PIPPA dataset,\nas well as formulating the preliminary version of the paper. Yinhe Zheng contributed to the refinement\nof the paper through substantive revisions.\n1\narXiv:2308.05884v1  [cs.CL]  11 Aug 2023\ninference. However, despite the importance of such datasets, there is a notable scarcity of\nopen-source datasets tailored to serve this purpose.\nTo address the above issue and mitigate this gap, we introduce a novel dataset, named\nPersonal Interaction Pairs between People and AI (PIPPA). PIPPA is a large-scale dataset,\ncomprising approximately 1 million messages exchanged between humans and dialogue\nagents across nearly 26,000 unique conversations. Notably, each conversation session fea-\ntures a designated persona, which serves as the emulation target for the dialogue agent.\nThe persona of each character is delineated through free text descriptions, and optional\nexample dialogues are also supplied to facilitate accurate simulation of each character. The\nintroduction of PIPPA aims to support future research and development in the fine-tuning\nof models to generate persona-driven, contextually rich conversations.\nWe make PIPPA publicly available on the HuggingFace platform at https://huggingface.\nco/datasets/PygmalionAI/PIPPA allowing anyone to utilize it freely for their respective\npurposes.\n2. Dataset Compilation\nThe PIPPA dataset was assembled through the voluntary contributions of community mem-\nbers who actively engaged in our initiative to develop conversational models that are acces-\nsible to all. We leveraged a userscript to gather chatlogs and character descriptions from\nthe Character.AI website 1 (Figure 1). This script enables users to extract interactions and\npersona details of dialogue agents on Character.AI, who were instructed to submit their\nchatlog data to a centralized server for the purpose of constructing the PIPPA dataset\n(Figure 5).\nInitially, PIPPA was primarily conceived to furnish a fine-tuning dataset for the Pyg-\nmalion2 conversational models, a series of fine-tuned LLMs aimed at creating role-play\nagents. The collection of PIPPA began in December 2022, when the availability of high\nquality dialogue data was notably scarce. This endeavor, however, also encountered a chal-\nlenge in regards to striking a balance between supporting the community and safeguarding\npersonal information within the logs. As a result, we implemented a submission process\nthat allowed users to opt out of including their conversations in the public release. PIPPA\nsolely contains logs for which users have explicitly granted permission for public distribu-\ntion. Furthermore, we diligently performed comprehensive scans to detect and redact/mod-\nulate personally identifiable information (PII) within the publicly accessible portion of the\ndataset, to the best of our ability, ensuring the protection of submitter identities.\n3. Dataset Analysis\nThe PIPPA dataset encompasses a substantial collection of conversational data, encom-\npassing 25,940 conversations that involve 1,254 distinct personas and 1,049,015 dialogue\nsessions.\n1. Due to subsequent changes to the Character.AI website, the userscript is no longer functional. The script\ncan be found at https://github.com/0x000011b/characterai-dumper.\n2.

Swipes refer to discarding the current\nbot generation and prompting for a new one.\nEach sample in PIPPA dataset comprises a dialogue session and a diverse set of associ-\nated metadata. Additionally, we also provide the information about the bot, which includes\ncategories assigned by bot creators, a bot description offering a succinct overview of the\nbot\u2019s persona and traits, an optional bot definition that further fleshes out the bot\u2019s\npersonality through example conversations, and the bot\u2019s greeting to the user. The bot\u2019s\ngreeting serves as the initial entry in every conversation. Furthermore, we maintain a times-\ntamp to document when the dialogue is submitted to us. It is important to note that that\nwe cannot access information regarding when the conversations themselves were generated,\nas this information is not provided by the Character.AI website.\nThe statistical analysis of the PIPPA dataset offers valuable insights into three crucial\naspects: the number of turns in a conversation, the length of a singular message and the\ndistribution of bot personalities. In this section, we present key statistical findings.\n3.1 Conversation Length\nConversations in PIPPA exhibits a diverse range of lengths, displaying a notable skewed dis-\ntribution. While the median conversation length is 10 turns, the mean conversation length\nis remarkably higher at 40.41 turns. However, the presence of a large standard deviation of\n145 turns indicates substantial dispersion in the data. This discrepancy can be attributed to\nthe diverse conversational behavior of users interacting with bots on Character.AI. While a\nconsiderable number of users engage in shorter individual conversations with the bots, some\nusers participate in remarkably extensive conversations, with the longest conversation in the\n3\nFigure 2: The distribution of conversation length (defined as the amount of \u201dturns\u201d in\na conversation). We have limited the display range to 0-250 turns in order to\nenhance readability.\nFigure 3: Distribution of message length in the PIPPA dataset for both human inputs and\nbot responses.\ndataset containing a staggering 11,491 turns. Figure 2 depicts the log scale distribution of\nturn lengths up to 250 turns.\n4\nFigure 4: Distribution of categories of characters in the PIPPA dataset. Note that each bot\nmay be assigned multiple categories or none at all.\n3.2 Message Verbosity\nWe also analyze the verbosity (i.e., length) of messages generated by both human users and\nbots within the PIPPA dataset. As evidenced by Figure 3, the verbosity distribution of all\nmessages in PIPPA can be characterized by a power-law distribution, indicating a higher\nprevalence of shorter messages compared to longer ones. It is also worth noting that the\nLLM\u2019s responses generally exhibit greater verbosity than human inputs. This observation\nmay be attributed to Character.AI\u2019s LLM potentially being trained or fine-tuned on a\nhigh-quality role-play corpus, which typically contains longer messages comparing to casual\nconversations.\n3.3 Bot Personality Categories\nWithin the PIPPA dataset, each bot is assigned a set of category labels by its creator. An\nanalysis of bot personality categories in PIPPA reveals an uneven, Pareto-like distribution\n(see Figure 4). Notably, the categories \u201cAnime\u201d, \u201cFantasy\u201d, and \u201cAction\u201d emerge as\nthe most prevalent among the bot personas. This distribution can be attributed to the\ncharacteristics of the source community, PygmalionAI, from which these logs are collected.\nThe community exhibits a significant number of anime3 enthusiasts, resulting in a con-\nsiderable proportion of bots classified under the \u201cAnime\u201d category. Additionally, due to\nthe community\u2019s interest in role-play and conversational interactions, many bots are nat-\nurally assigned to categories related to prevalent role-playing themes, thus explaining the\nprominent presence of bots tagged with \u201cAction\u201d and \u201cFantasy\u201d labels.\n3. Anime refers to animated media produced in Japan.\n5\n4. Related Works\nAlthough conversational and role-play datasets represent a developing subset of common\ntraining datasets for fine-tuning LLMs, there have been some similar datasets prior to the\ndevelopment of PIPPA. Additionally, certain instructional datasets can frame role-playing\nas an instruction for the model to follow. In this section, we investigate these datasets,\ndelineate their limitations, and compare them to PIPPA.\n4.1 Role-Play Datasets\nThe availability of role-play datasets in the academic domain is limited, with only a hand-\nful of notable publications. Notably, the LIGHT dataset (Urbanek et al., 2019) and its\nsubsequent extension, MultiLIGHT (Wei et al., 2023), present collections of conversations\nsimulating interactions within the context of a text-adventure fantasy game. These datasets,\ncomprised of dialogue exchanges from crowdsourced users, offer valuable insights into the\ndynamics of role-play scenarios. Moreover, the FIREBALL dataset (Zhu et al., 2023), al-\nthough not accessible during PIPPA\u2019s development, contains approximately 25,000 sessions\nof Dungeons and Dragons conducted via the Discord online platform. While these datasets\nexhibit commendable quality, their applicability is somewhat restricted, as they primarily\nfocus on specific role-play scenarios within defined settings, rather than encompassing a\ndiverse range of personas and immersive worlds.\n4.2 Conversational Datasets\nIn contrast to role-play datasets, pure conversational datasets are more abundant. Li et al.\npresents DailyDialog, a multi-turn conversational dataset containing discussions and chats\nabout mundane, daily topics. This dataset, however, lacks any personas or backgrounds\nto the speakers. Some datasets also try to explicitly model personas (Zhang et al., 2018;\nZheng et al., 2019), nevertheless, these dialogues are not designed for role-play scenarios\nand thus are more suited for casual conversation.\nThe Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011), derived\nfrom a compilation of 617 movies, has been commonly utilized as a standard dataset for\nconversational modeling. However, it is not optimally suited for the purpose of simulating\nchat-based interactions and role-play scenarios, as movie dialogue often relies on visual cues\nand can encompass relatively brief exchanges that may not be optimal for training large\nlanguage models.\nFor a more extensive conversational model, large-scale datasets can serve as a valuable\nfoundation (Wang et al., 2020). Henderson et al. has successfully curated a vast corpus\nby scraping hundreds of millions of dialogue turns from platforms like Reddit and Open-\nSubtitles. Although this dataset offers considerable volume, it often necessitates trimming\nor partitioning. Similar to the DailyDialog dataset, a notable limitation lies in the pre-\ndominance of short and casual conversations rather than comprehensive, persona-driven\nrole-play interactions. Additionally, the OpenSubtitles subset of the dataset shares com-\nparable challenges with the Cornell corpus, such as the absence of visual context and brief\ndialogue responses.\n6\n4.3 Instructional Datasets\nIn recent years, instructional datasets have garnered significant attention as comprehensive\nresources for chatbot development. Notably, Stanford\u2019s Alpaca model (Taori et al., 2023)\nunderwent fine-tuning using a synthetically generated dataset, comprising single-exchange\ninteractions produced by ChatGPT. Remarkably, the total cost associated with dataset\ncuration and model fine-tuning amounted to less than $600, yet resulted in impressive\nperformance outcomes.\nMotivated by the success achieved by Alpaca, a growing number of instructional datasets\nhave emerged, often relying on synthetic generation techniques to enhance model training.\nAmong these, notable advancements have been observed in the realm of multi-turn complex\ninstructional datasets, as exemplified by datasets such as Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023) and\nthe OpenAssistant dataset (K\u00a8opf et al., 2023). These datasets exhibit greater complexity,\nencompassing diverse and intricate instructional scenarios, thereby offering richer contexts\nfor training and refining models.\nHowever, instructional datasets generated by OpenAI\nmodels may not necessarily align with the interests of role-players and may additionally\nexhibit limitations during role-play.\nLimitations\nThe current iteration of the dataset is primarily tailored for supervised fine-tuning applica-\ntions. Any endeavor to apply the PIPPA dataset to unsupervised fine-tuning objectives may\nnecessitate a comprehensive overhaul of the dataset\u2019s structure and content presentation.\nAdditionally, models fine-tuned with the PIPPA dataset might necessitate specific prompt-\ning to make the role-play agent adhere to the context and generate the desirable response.\nEthics Statement\nThe creation of the PIPPA dataset is the result of a collective and participatory curation\nprocess, involving contributions from a diverse group of anonymous individuals within the\ncommunity. This approach brings a rich and varied array of language samples, reflecting\nreal-world linguistic nuances and usage patterns.\nDue to the nature of the community-driven approach and the large-scale collaboration\ninvolved, exhaustive validation of the submitted logs has not been undertaken. Because of\nthis, the absence of comprehensive validation implies that the dataset may contain variations\nin data quality and potential instances of unsuitable or inappropriate material.\nSensitive personal information has been diligently expunged to the extent of our capa-\nbilities; however, residual instances might persist owing to inadvertent human oversights.\nWhile the de-identification process was not obligatory for the publicly submitted dataset,\nwe deemed it a moral imperative to proceed with the redaction of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) as a matter of ethical prudence.\nAcknowledgements\nThe release of the PIPPA dataset to the wider public marks a significant milestone that\nhas been eagerly anticipated, and this achievement is the result of collaborative efforts.\n7\nWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to a dedicated individual known by the pseudonym\n\u201c0x000011b,\u201d whose remarkable dedication and diligent work in devising the userscript\nplayed an instrumental role in enabling users to contribute their logs to the dataset. Fur-\nthermore, we thank him for his invaluable contributions extends to the broader development\nof the Pygmalion models, embodying a spirit of commitment and innovation.\nWe would also like to express our sincere appreciation to Dr.\nYinhe Zheng for his\ninvaluable guidance and unwavering support throughout the process of crafting this research\npaper.\nHis insightful advice and assistance have been indispensable, and it is with his\nguidance that this paper has come to fruition.\nLast but not least, a debt of gratitude is owed to all individuals who generously shared\ntheir logs, playing an essential part in the creation of this dataset. The collective efforts of\nthese enthusiastic contributors, along with the passionate members of our community, have\nbeen the driving force behind the existence of both PIPPA and PygmalionAI. We extend\nour heartfelt thanks to each and every individual who has contributed, ensuring that these\nendeavors have thrived and flourished.

Formatting Notes\nBecause PIPPA consists of logs scraped from Character.AI, the messages follow the general\nformat of the site which should be handled during pre-processing of the dataset. PIPPA\nshould not be fed into a LLM without prior pre-processing of the dataset. Par-\nticular attention should be paid to the bot description field, as it follows a specific format\nand should be parsed if one does not wish to follow the example chat format of Character.AI.\nThe sequence \u201c{{user}}\u201d is a placeholder in both messages and bot descriptions for the\nname of whichever human user interacted with the bot. If it is not necessary to explicitly\nmodel the user\u2019s name, one can replace any instances of \u201c{{user}}\u201d with a random name.4\nSimilarly, bot definitions will often contain the sequence \u201c{{random user n}}\u201d, where n\nrepresents some number. This should be treated the same way as \u201c{{user}}\u201d, where each\nrandom user can be replaced by a unique name.\nBot definitions may also contain the sequence \u201c{{char}}\u201d, representing the name of the\ncharacter. In this case, \u201c{{char}}\u201d should be replaced by the bot name if one has no special\nplans to deal with this sequence. We do not replace it ourselves for the sake of preserving\nthe entries as they are.\nFinally, example chats in the bot description field are separated by the term \u201cEND OF DIALOG\u201d.\nThis sequence should be marked as the end of an example chat and the beginning of a new\none, if one is found after it. This is not an EOS token.\nAppendix B. Dataset Sample\nEach entry in PIPPA is represented as a single line and all entries form a JSONL file.

    "text": "COMPOSABLE FUNCTION-PRESERVING EXPANSIONS\nFOR TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURES\nAndrea Gesmundo1, Kaitlin Maile1,2\n1 Google DeepMind, 2 IRIT, University of Toulouse,\n{agesmundo,kmaile}@google.com\nABSTRACT\nTraining state-of-the-art neural networks requires a high cost in terms of compute\nand time. Model scale is recognized to be a critical factor to achieve and improve\nthe state-of-the-art. Increasing the scale of a neural network normally requires\nrestarting from scratch by randomly initializing all the parameters of the model,\nas this implies a change of architecture\u2019s parameters that does not allow for a\nstraightforward transfer of knowledge from smaller size models.\nIn this work, we propose six composable transformations to incrementally increase\nthe size of transformer-based neural networks while preserving functionality, al-\nlowing to expand the capacity of the model as needed. We provide proof of exact\nfunction preservation under minimal initialization constraints for each transfor-\nmation. The proposed methods may enable efficient training pipelines for larger\nand more powerful models by progressively expanding the architecture throughout\ntraining. 1\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nTransformer-based neural networks have gained widespread attention in recent years due to their im-\npressive performance. The Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), has become\nthe standard for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text\ngeneration, and question answering. The success of transformer-based models is not limited to NLP:\nthey have also been applied to various other domains, including computer vision, speech recognition,\nand recommendation systems. The largest and most performant of these models, large language\nmodels (LLMs) and vision and multimodal foundation models, are reaching billions to trillions of\nparameters (Dehghani et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Rae et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020).\nHowever, each new model is generally trained from scratch, without reusing the capabilities acquired\nby previously trained smaller models. Furthermore, the size of the model is constant throughout\ntraining. The computational cost of training scales quadratically with model size due to the necessary\nincrease in amount of training data (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Google, 2023; Kaplan et al., 2020). The\nability to reuse parameters of a pretrained model or dynamically increase a model\u2019s size during\ntraining could thus reduce the overall cost of training, but how to accomplish parameter reuse\neffectively without losing training progress is not straightforward.\nTo address these limitations, we propose parameter expansion transformations for transformer-based\nmodels that are exactly function preserving. These transformations increase the model size and\nthus the potential capacity of the model without changing its functionality, permitting continued\ntraining. These composable transformations operate on independent dimensions of the architecture,\nallowing for fine-grained architectural expansion.\nSome previous works have also proposed function preserving parameter expansion transformations\nfor transformer-based models (Chen et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Mazzawi\net al., 2023), extending from techniques for smaller convolutional and dense models (Chen et al.,\n2016; Evci et al., 2022). Our framework is so far the most comprehensive and composable set\nof function preserving transformations.\n1Implementation of the proposed transformations and empirical tests of the function preservation property\nare available at: http://goo.gle/TransformerExpansions.\n1\narXiv:2308.06103v1  [cs.LG]  11 Aug 2023\nN \u2715\nInput\nInput\nEmbedding\nPositional\nEncoding\nMulti Head \nAttention\nNormalization\nNormalization\nMulti Layer\nPerceptron\nHead\nTransformer Layer\nOutput\nLinear\nFigure 1: Representation of a standard Neural Network based on the Transformer architecture.\nThe contributions of this paper are six composable function preserving transformations applicable\nto Transformer architectures: 1) size of MLP internal representation, 2) number of attention heads,\n3) size of the attention heads output representation, 4) size of the attention input representation, 5)\nsize of the transformer layers input/output representations, 6) number of layers, summarized in Table\n1. For each transformation, we provide proof of how the exactly function preserving property is\nachieved with a minimal set of constraints on the initialization of the added parameters.\n2\nTRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE FORMALIZATION\nThis presentation is based on a particular instantiation of the transformer architecture: applica-\ntions to variants (e.g. Encoder+Decoder, different normalization placement) can be obtained with\nsimple extensions.\nFigure 1 represents the standard Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). The Input Embedding\nmodule maps the arbitrary input modality (e.g. image, text) into a bidimensional tensor I\ns\u00d7h, where s is\nthe sequence dimension and h is the hidden dimension. The TransformerArchitecture(\u00b7) is defined\nas a function that maps:\nI\ns\u00d7h \u2192 O\ns\u00d7o, where o is the hidden dimension of the output representation.\nThe Head component represents the output modality specific logic that maps O\ns\u00d7o into a specific\noutput (e.g. a distribution over classes or text tokens).\nTransformerArchitecture(\u00b7) is defined as:\nTransformerArchitecture( I\ns\u00d7h) = TransformerLayer\u25e6N( I\ns\u00d7h+ P\ns\u00d7h) \u00d7 Wout\nh\u00d7o ,\n(1)\nwhere Wout\nh\u00d7o are the parameters of the final linear projection, P\ns\u00d7h are the positional embedding\nparameters, and TransformerLayer\u25e6N(\u00b7) represents the recursive application of N transformer\n2\nlayers. The nth transformer layer is defined as:\nTransformerLayern( In\ns\u00d7h\n) = I\n\u2032\nn\ns\u00d7h\n+ MLPn(NormMLP\nn\n(I\n\u2032\nn\ns\u00d7h\n)),\nI\n\u2032\nn\ns\u00d7h\n= In\ns\u00d7h\n+ MHAn(NormMHA\nn\n( In\ns\u00d7h\n))\n\u2200 n \u2208 [1, N].\n(2)\nMLPn(\u00b7) is the Multi Layer Perceptron (i.e. feed forward layers), defined as:\nMLPn( X\ns\u00d7h) = ReLU( X\ns\u00d7h \u00d7 Wl1\nn\nh\u00d7p\n+ Bl1\nn\ns\u00d7p\n) \u00d7 Wl2\nn\np\u00d7h\n+ Bl2\nn\ns\u00d7h\n,\n(3)\nwhere Wl1\nn is the matrix of parameters of the first fully connected layer and Bl1\nn are its bias parameters\nbroadcasted along the sequence dimension: Bl1\nn\ns\u00d7h\n= 1\ns\u00d71 \u00d7 bl1\nn\n1\u00d7h\n. Wl2\nn and Bl2\nn are the parameters of\nthe second fully connected layer. The broadcast operator applied to the bias parameters is omitted\nfor simplicity. The size of the internal dimension of the MLP component is represented with p.\nThe considered architecture instantiation assumes the uses of ReLU(\u00b7) (Glorot et al., 2011) as a\nnon-linearity function as this is a common choice. The proposed transformations also maintain the\nfunction preserving property with alternative choices such as GELU(\u00b7) (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016).\nMHAn(\u00b7) is the Multi Head Attention defined as:\nMHAn( X\ns\u00d7h) =\n\u0014\nH1\ns\u00d7v \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 HE\ns\u00d7v\n\u0015\n\u00d7 WO\nn\n(E\u00b7v)\u00d7h\n,\nHe\ns\u00d7v = Attention( X\ns\u00d7h\u00d7WQ\nn,e\nh\u00d7k\n, X\ns\u00d7h\u00d7WK\nn,e\nh\u00d7k\n, X\ns\u00d7h\u00d7WV\nn,e\nh\u00d7v\n)\n\u2200 e \u2208 [1, E],\nAttention( Q\ns\u00d7k\n, K\ns\u00d7k, V\ns\u00d7v) = Softmax( 1\n\u221a\nk \u00b7 Q\ns\u00d7k\n\u00d7 K\u22a4\nk\u00d7s) \u00d7 V\ns\u00d7v,\n(4)\nwhere E is the number of heads, k is the hidden dimension of key, K, and query, Q, and v is the hidden\ndimension of value, V. K\u22a4 represents the transpose of K. The concatenation of the representations\nproduced by the attention heads is represented with the block notation: C = [A B].\nAs the normalization function in each component, we use RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019). The\noriginal definition of the transformer architecture uses LayerNorm, but RMSNorm has become a more\ncommon design choice in large language models (Raffel et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Touvron et al.,\n2023). The key difference is only scaling the variance of the inputs and using scaling parameters,\nrather than also subtracting their mean and using bias parameters. Thus, we define Norm(\u00b7) as:\nNormc\nn( X\ns\u00d7h) =\n\u0014\nxi,j \u00b7 gc\nn,j\nq\n1\nh\nPh\n\u03b3=1(xi,\u03b3)2\n| i\u2208[1, s] \u2227 j \u2208[1, h]\n\u0015\n\u2200n\u2208[1, N] \u2227 c\u2208{MHA, MLP}, (5)\nwhere gc\nn\n1\u00d7h\nidentifies the vector of the scaling parameters of the Norm(\u00b7) instance of component\nc in the nth layer.\n3\nFUNCTION PRESERVING TRANSFORMATIONS\nIn this section, we define six function preserving transformations that can be applied to extend a\ntransformer architecture to increase its scale while keeping its function unaltered, thus allowing to\nintroduce new parameters to store additional knowledge while preserving the knowledge acquired\nso far. Each transformation is defined to target the expansion of one of the hyper-parameters of the\narchitecture: p, E, v, k, h, and N, each controlling a distinct dimension of the scaling. The proposed\ntransformations are summarized in Table 1.\n3\nName\nTransformation\nFunction preserving constraint\nSec. 3.1:\nMLP\nexpansion\nDef. 3.1: to increase the MLP internal dimension p to \u02c6p, add \u02c6p \u2212 p\ncolumns to the the first MLP weight matrix and bias vector and add\n\u02c6p \u2212 p rows to the second MLP weight matrix.\nThrm. 3.1: zero initialize the new \u02c6p \u2212 p rows\nof the second MLP weight matrix.\nSec. 3.2:\nHead\naddition\nDef. 3.2: to increase the number of attention heads E, per head added,\nadd v rows to the MHA output weight matrix.\nThrm. 3.2: zero initialize the new v rows of the\nMHA output weight matrix.\nSec. 3.3:\nHeads\nexpansion\nDef. 3.3: to increase the attention head representation dimension v to\n\u02c6v, add \u02c6v \u2212 v columns to the value weight matrix and insert \u02c6v \u2212 v rows\nto each of E splits of the MHA output weight matrix.\nThrm. 3.3: zero initialize the new \u02c6v \u2212 v rows\ninserted to each of E splits of the MHA output\nweight matrix.\nSec. 3.4:\nAttention\nexpansion\nDef. 3.4: to increase the key/query representation dimension k to \u02c6k,\nadd \u02c6k \u2212 k columns to the key/query weight matrices and scale the key\nweight matrix by\np\n\u02c6k/\n\u221a\nk.\nThrm. 3.4: zero initialize the new \u02c6k\u2212k columns\nof the key weight matrix.\nSec. 3.5:\nHidden\ndimension\nexpansion\nDef. 3.5: to increase the transformer hidden dimension h to \u02c6h, add\n\u02c6h \u2212 h columns to the positional encoding matrix, norm scaling vector,\nsecond MLP weight matrix and bias vector, MHA output weight matrix,\nand input representation matrix; add \u02c6h \u2212 h rows to the transformer\noutput weight matrix, first MLP weight matrix, and key/query/value\nweight matrices; scale norm scaling vector by\n\u221a\nh/\np\n\u02c6h.\nThrm. 3.5: zero initialize the new \u02c6h\u2212h columns\nof the positional encoding matrix, norm scaling\nvector, second MLP weight matrix and bias\nvector, and MHA output weight matrix.\nSec. 3.6:\nLayer\naddition\nDef. 3.6: to increase the number of layers N to \u02c6\nN, per layer added,\ninsert new layer at position n and increment index of all following\nlayers.\nThrm. 3.6: zero initialize the new layer\u2019s MHA\noutput weight matrix and weight matrix and\nbias vector of the second MLP layer.\nTable 1: Summary of proposed function preserving transformations.\nFor each transformation, we define how the existing parameters must be expanded and propose a set\nof minimal initialization constraints to obtain the function preserving property with proof.\nThe presented transformations can be combined to allow the joint extension of multiple dimen-\nsions of the transformer architecture. Furthermore, different subsets of such transformations can\nbe applied incrementally, interleaving training iterations, as well as independently to different\nparts of the architecture.\nSymbols denoting parameters, representations, and functions resulting from the application of the\ntransformation discussed in each of the following subsection are indicated with the \u201chat\u201d symbol: \u02c6.\n3.1\nMLP EXPANSION\nThe MLP expansion transformation can be applied to expand the scale of the MLP by expanding the\ndimension of its internal representation.

A new TransformerLayer(\u00b7) whose parameters allow to input and\noutput matrices of x \u00d7 h can be inserted in the sequence of the pre-existing N layers. The new\ntransformer layer can be inserted at any position n \u2208 [1, N +1]. The index of the downstream layers\nis incremented by one.\nTheorem 3.6 (Function preserving layer addition).

Bert2BERT (Chen et al., 2022) proposes function\npreserving width expansions of the MLP internal dimension, hidden dimension, and number of\nattention heads. Shen et al. (2022) achieve function preserving width expansion, although constrained\nto doubling of all matrix and vector dimensions, and depth expansion via zero initialization of\nLayerNorm and bias parameters. Yao et al. (2023) use masking on new hidden MLP neurons, attention\nheads, and layers to achieve function preservation. Wang et al. (2023) use an inner optimization\nto learn a linear mapping for parameter expansion in depth and width, but without constraints for\nfunction preservation. Notably, our transformations form a function preserving subspace of their\nlearnable space. Deep Fusion (Mazzawi et al., 2023) extends the concept of expansion to multiple\nsource models, where the special case of self-fusion achieves function preserving width expansion.\nOf these works, some methods are nearly function preserving but admit gaps due to LayerNorm\ndiscrepancies (Chen et al., 2022; Mazzawi et al., 2023). No known works consider scaling factors,\nas we address in Equations 19 and 24, nor RMSNorm.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nWe have defined six transformations that can be applied to a transformer model to increase the\nscale of all the different aspects of the architecture: 1) size of MLP internal representation, 2)\nnumber of attention heads, 3) size of the attention heads output representation, 4) size of the\nattention input representation, 5) size of the transformer layers input/output representations, 6)\nnumber of layers. For each of these transformations, we have provided a proof of exact function\npreservation given a minimal set of constraints on the initialization of the added parameters. These\nsix transformations are composable to permit many different ways to scale a transformer-based\nmodel while preserving its function.\nWe note that, there exist alternative definitions to such transformations that achieve function-\npreservation without requiring zero initialization. However, the form of the proposed transformations\nis intended to be simple yet minimally constraining. The space of possible initialization strategies\nmay be explored with the aim to optimize for training in an empirical context.\nIn future work, these transformations may be applied in the training of a new large model by initializ-\ning a smaller model, training it under reduced data and computational complexity requirements, and\nincrementally scaling it to larger sizes throughout training to the desired final size. They may also\nbe used to generate a family of models that are trained for the same task but at different sizes: all\nmodels within the family can begin from the same checkpoint from training the smallest model, then\n10\neach successively sized model can be branched and finetuned at its final size. Finally, neural archi-\ntecture search (NAS) techniques could be applied to determine optimal transformation scheduling\nand architectural progression for a given task and compute budget.\n6\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Jeffrey Pennington and Utku Evci for their input to this work.\nREFERENCES\nCheng Chen, Yichun Yin, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Yujia Qin, Fengyu Wang, Zhi Wang, Xiao\nChen, Zhiyuan Liu, and Qun Liu. bert2BERT: Towards reusable pretrained language models.

An LAA is able\nto generate actions with its core LLM and interact with environments, which fa-\ncilitates the ability to resolve complex tasks by conditioning on past interactions\nsuch as observations and actions. Since the investigation of LAA is still very re-\ncent, limited explorations are available. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive\ncomparison of LAA in terms of both agent architectures and LLM backbones.\nAdditionally, we propose a new strategy to orchestrate multiple LAAs such that\neach labor LAA focuses on one type of action, i.e. BOLAA, where a controller\nmanages the communication among multiple agents. We conduct simulations on\nboth decision-making and multi-step reasoning environments, which comprehen-\nsively justify the capacity of LAAs. Our performance results provide quantitative\nsuggestions for designing LAA architectures and the optimal choice of LLMs, as\nwell as the compatibility of both. We release our implementation code of LAAs\nto the public at https://github.com/salesforce/BOLAA.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nRecent booming successes of large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023)\nmotivate emerging exploration of employing LLM to tackle various complex tasks (Zhang et al.,\n2023), amongst which LLM-augmented Autonomous Agents (LAAs) (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan\net al., 2023b; Huang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023a) stand with\nmost spotlights. LAA extends the intelligence of LLM to sequential action executions, exhibiting su-\nperiority in interacting with environments and resolving complex tasks via collecting observations.\nTo name a few, BabyAGI1 proposes an AI-powered task management system, which leverages Ope-\nnAI LLM2 to create, prioritize, and execute tasks. AutoGPT3 is another popular open-source LAA\nframework that enables the API calling capability of LLMs. ReAct (Yao et al., 2023a) is a recently\nproposed LAA method to interact with environments then consecutively generate the next action.\nLangchain4 is a recently released open-source framework for developing LAA.\nDue to the initial investigation, LAA is rather under-explored. Firstly, the optimal agent architecture\nis undetermined. ReAct (Yao et al., 2023a) prompts the agents with pre-defined examples such that\nthe LLM learns to generate the next action via in-context learning. Moreover, ReAct argues that\nan agent should have intermediate reasoning steps before action executions. ReWOO (Xu et al.,\n2023) introduces additional planning steps for LAA. Langchain generalizes the ReAct agent with\n\u2217zhiweiliu@salesforce.com\n1https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi\n2https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference\n3https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT\n4https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain\n1\narXiv:2308.05960v1  [cs.AI]  11 Aug 2023\nPREPRINT\nzero-shot tool usage ability. Intrinsically, the optimal architecture of agents should be aligned with\nboth tasks and the associated LLM backbone, which is less explored in the existing works.\nSecondly, understanding the efficacy of the existing LLMs in LAA is far from comprehensive.\nThe existing preliminary works only compare the performances of a few LLM backbones. Re-\nAct adopts the PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) as the backbone LLM. ReWOO employs OpenAI\ntext-davinci-003 model for instruction-tuning Alpaca model (Taori et al., 2023) for agent planning.\nMIND2Web (Deng et al., 2023) compares Flan-T5 and OpenAI GPT3.5/4 for generalist web agent.\nNevertheless, few current works comprehensively compare the performance of LAA with regard to\nvarious pre-trained LLMs. A very recent work (Liu et al., 2023) releases a benchmark for evaluat-\ning LLMs as Agents. Nevertheless, they fail to jointly consider the agent architectures along with\ntheir LLM backbones. Selecting the optimal LLMs from both efficacy and efficiency perspectives\nadvances the current exploration of LAA.\nThirdly, the increasing complexity of tasks may require the orchestration of multiple agents. Re-\nWOO recently identifies that decoupling reasoning from observation improves the efficiency for\nLAA. In this paper, we argue that as the task complexity increases, especially in open-domain envi-\nronments, it is better to coordinate multiple agents to complete one task. For example, regarding the\nweb navigation task, we could employ one click agent to interact with clickable buttons and request\nanother search agent to retrieve additional resources. Nonetheless, there are few works discussing\nhow to orchestrate multiple agents and investigating the impacts of orchestration.\nTo address these research gaps, this paper proposes to comprehensively compare the performances\nof LAAs. We dive deep into the agent architecture of LAAs and the LLM backbones. Specifically,\nwe construct agent benchmarks from the existing environments to evaluate the performances of\nvarious agent architectures built upon various LLM backbones. The tasks in our agent benchmarks\nare associated with different task complexity levels, which enables the agent performance analyses\nw.r.t. task complexity. Those agent architectures are designed to extensively verify the existing\ndesign choices. Regarding the orchestration of multiple LAAs, we propose a novel LAA architecture\nBOLAA5, which has a controller module on top of multiple collaborated agents, for enabling the\nselection and communication between multiple labor LAA.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We develop 6 different LAA agent architecture. We combine them with various backbone LLMs\nto justify the designing intuition of LAA from prompting, self-thinking, and planning. We also\ndevelop BOLAA for orchestrating multi-agent strategy, which enhances the action interaction\nability of solo agents.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on both decision-making web navigation environment and\nknowledge reasoning task environment. We report the performance in terms of final sparse re-\nwards and intermediate recalls, which provides qualitative indications for the optimal choice of\nLAAs as well as their compatible LLMs.\n\u2022 BOLAA on the WebShop environment consistently yields the best performance compared with\nother LAA architectures. Our results demonstrate that the importance of designing specialist\nagents to collaborate on resolving complex task, which should be as equally important as training\na large LLM with high generalization ability.\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nAUGMENTED LANGUAGE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nThe completion of a complex task typically entails multiple stages. An agent must possess an under-\nstanding of these stages and plan accordingly. Chain-of-Thoughts, also known as CoT (Wei et al.,\n2022), is a groundbreaking work that prompts the agent to deconstruct challenging reasoning tasks\ninto smaller, more manageable steps. On the other hand, ReAct (Yao et al., 2023a) proposes lever-\naging this aptitude for reasoning and action within Language and Learning Models (LLMs) to foster\ninteractive engagement with the environment, such as utilizing the Wikipedia search API, by map-\nping observations to the generation of reasoning and action traces or API calls in natural language.\n5For easy memorizing, we intentionally name it the same as paper title.\n2\nPREPRINT\nThis agent architecture has given rise to various applications, including HuggingGPT (Shen et al.,\n2023), Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), AutoGPT (Gravitas,\n2023), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), and Langchain (Chase, 2023).\nHowever, these approaches neglect to incorporate valuable feedback, such as environment rewards,\nto enhance the agent\u2019s behaviors, resulting in performances that rely solely on the quality of the pre-\ntrained Language and Learning Model (LLM). Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023a) tackles this limita-\ntion by employing a single LLM as a generator, refiner, and provider of feedback, enabling iterative\nrefinement of outputs. However, it is not specifically tailored for real-world task-based interaction\nwith the environment. On the other hand, REX (Murthy et al., 2023) and RAP (Hao et al., 2023) re-\npurpose the LLM to function as both a comprehensive world model and a reasoning agent. They in-\ncorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search for strategic exploration within the vast realm of reasoning with\nenvironment rewards. This approach facilitates effective navigation and decision-making in intricate\ndomains. Shinn et al. (2023) presents Reflexion, a framework that equips agents with dynamic mem-\nory and self-reflection capabilities, enhancing their reasoning skills. Self-reflection plays a pivotal\nrole, allowing autonomous agents to iteratively refine past actions, make improvements, and prevent\nrepetitive errors. Recently, Yao et al. (2023b) proposes a framework, namely Retroformer, which\nleverages policy gradient optimization to align the agent\u2019s behaviors with environment-specific re-\nwards by learning a plug-in retrospective language model.\n2.2\nWEB AGENT\nWeb navigation is the foundation for humans to collect information and communicate. Before the\nboom of LLM, previous endeavours (Liu et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017) already explored how to train\nweb agent in a web simulation environment. Very recently, a series of works have been devoted to\ndeveloping LAA to tackle complex web navigation tasks. Though action space of web navigation\nis almost infinite due to numerous available elements online, these action can be divided into a\nfew operation types, such as click, type and select. MIND2Web (Deng et al., 2023) collects a web\nbrowser data to fine-tune LLM to generate executable actions, which functions as a Web LAA.\nWebAgent (Gur et al., 2023) is able to decompose task instruction into sub-tasks, which directly\ngenerates executable python program for web navigation. WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023) supports\nrealistic tasks simulation for designing Web LAA. Langchain and ChatGPT both provide convenient\nweb plugin such that the LLM behaves as Web LAA. We believe that the web navigation is the next\nfundamental task for LAA to shine its superiority.\n2.3\nTOOL AGENT\nThe evolution of LLM and their interactions with various tools has been a focal point of recent re-\nsearch. The concept of a \u201cTool Agent\u201d encapsulates the idea of LLMs leveraging external tools to\nenhance their capabilities and solve complex tasks. One of the pioneering works in this domain is\nthe introduction of \u201cGorilla\u201d (Patil et al., 2023). This model is adept at writing API calls and exhibits\nthe ability to adapt test-time document changes. Another noteworthy work is the \u201cToolLLM\u201d frame-\nwork (Qin et al., 2023). This open-source framework incorporates LLMs to efficiently engage with\na myriad of tools, particularly APIs, to execute intricate tasks. The framework encompasses Tool-\nBench, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for tool utilization More recently, a paradigm shift in\nteaching LLMs to use new tools has been discussed in (Hsieh et al., 2023), which champions the use\nof tool documentation. The authors present empirical evidence suggesting that tool documentation\noffers detailed descriptions of tool usage, which is a more effective and scalable approach. Notably,\ntheir research indicates that zero-shot prompts, which are exclusively based on tool documentation,\ncan rival the performance of few-shot prompts.\n3\nAGENT ARCHITECTURES\nIn this section, we compare various LAA architectures. We first present how to design different solo\nLAA based on the intuition of existing work. We then present the our orchestration designing of\nmultiple LAAs, i.e. BOLAA.\n3\nPREPRINT\nMemory\nLLM\nAction Parser\nZeroshot\nPrompt\nEnvironment\nAction\nObservation\nMemory\nLLM\nAction Parser\nFewshot\nPrompt\nThought\nTask Instruction\nMemory\nLLM\nAction Parser\nZeroshot\nPrompt\nThought\nTask Instruction\nEnvironment\nAction\nObservation\nEnvironment\nAction\nObservation\nTask Instruction\n(a) Zeroshot LAA\n(b) ZeroshotThink LAA\n(c) ReAct LAA\nthink\nthink\nFigure 1: The LAA architectures for Zeroshot-LAA (ZS-LAA), ZeroshotThink LAA (ZST-LAA)\nand ReAct LAA. ZS-LAA generates actions from LLM with zeroshot prompt. ZST-LAA extends\nZS-LAA with self-think. ReAct LAA advances ZST-LAA with fewshot prompt. They all resolve a\ngiven task by interacting with environment via actions to collect observations. Better view in colors.\n3.1\nSOLO AGENTS\nHereafter, we present 5 different LAAs. Each type of LAA is able to interact with the environment\nwith its own interaction strategy.\nZeroshot LAA (ZS-LAA) directly extends the LLM to be action executor. Specifically, the prompt\nfor LLMs to function as the action executor consists of detailed descriptions for those actions. For\nexample, if we prompt LAA to understand the click action with \u201cclick: using this action to click\nobserved [button], the clickable buttons are in [].\u201d, it may behave as a web navigation agent. We\npresent the architecture of ZS-LAA in Figure 1(a). The working flow is as follows:\n\u2022 Initial step: firstly, the ZS-LAA receives the task instruction and constructs the zeroshot prompt.\nThen, the LLM layer generates a possible response, which is parsed to output a feasible action.\nAfter that, the observation from environment is appended into the agent memory.\n\u2022 Working teps: the agent checks whether the task is finished. If not, ZS-LAA retrieves the previous\nactions and observations from memory, and constructs the prompts for LLM to generate the next\nexecutable actions. ZS-LAA continues the working stage until reaching the maximum steps or\ncompleting the task.\nZS-LAA is a minimum LAA architecture. It enables the action generation ability of LLM via\nzeroshot prompt layer, which is easy to generalize to new environments and requires no examples.\nZeroshotThink LAA (ZST-LAA) is an extended version of ZS-LAA. Different from ZS-LAA, ZST-\nLAA has an additional self-think flow. The architecture of ZST-LAA is presented in Figure 1(b),\nwhere we denote the self-think flow as in pink arrow lines. Self-think is running in intermediate\nsteps of action generations flow, which enables the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning ability.\n\u2022 Self-think Step: before generating the next action, ZST-LAA collect observations and previous\nactions to construct the think prompt. Then, the thought is stored into memory.\nSelf-think step is generally useful when given reasoning tasks. Note that the think prompt is also in\na zero-shot format, such as \u201cthink: using this action to plan your actions and reasoning\u201d.\nReAct LAA additionally advances ZST-LAA in the prompt layer, where fewshot examples are\nprovided. The architecture of ReAct LAA is illustrated in Figure 1(c). ReAct LAA is able to\nleverage successful running examples to improve the action generation ability of LLM and enhance\nthe environment interaction of LAA, because those fewshot examples endows the in-context learning\nability of LLM. However, the drawback for ReAct LAA is that, due to the limited context length,\nfewer token spaces are available after the occupancy of fewshot examples in the prompt.\nPlanAct LAA is designed to facilitate the planning ability of LAA. PlanAct LAA differs from ZS-\nLAA in two parts: 1) the planning flow and 2) the fewshot prompt. The architecture is depicted\n4\nPREPRINT\nMemory\nLLM\nAction Parser\nFewshot\nPrompt\nPlan\nTask Instruction\nPlan\nPrompt\nMemory\nLLM\nAction Parser\nFewshot\nPrompt\nThought\nPlan\nTask Instruction\nPlan\nPrompt\nEnvironment\nAction\nObservation\nEnvironment\nAction\nObservation\nthink\nPlan\nPlan\n(a) PlanAct LAA\n(a) PlanReAct LAA\nFigure 2: The LAA architectures for PlanAct LAA and PlanReAct LAA.\nin Figure 2. The planning flow is executed before the initial action generation step, which has\nadditional plan prompt to construct the input for the core LLM.\n\u2022 Planning Step: PlanAct LAA generates a plan for a given task before interacting with environ-\nments. The plan is memorized and will be retrieved to construct prompts.\nIt is worth noting that the plan prompt in this paper is in fewshot way, which allows LAA to generate\nplans based on previous successful plans.\nPlanReAct LAA extends PlanAct LAA with additional self-think flow, which also enables the CoT\nability. The architecture of PlanReAct LAA is presented in Figure 2. Intuitively, since the Planning\nflow is executed before the LAA observes the environment, self-think flow alleviates the hallucina-\ntion incurred from incorrect plans.\nNext, we introduce our multi-agent orchestrating architecture, i.e. BOLAA.\n3.2\nBOLAA: ORCHESTRATING MULTIPLE AGENTS.\nMemory\nLLM\nAction Parser\nAgents Message\nTask Instruction\nEnvironment\nAction\nObservation\nAgent\nPrompt\nAgents\nSelection\nLLM\nAgent\nPrompt\nLAA 1\nLAA 2\nLLM\nAgent\nPrompt\nLAA m\n\u2026\nLabor Agents Pool\nCommunicate\nController\nFigure 3: The BOLAA architecture, which employs a controller to orchestrate multiple LAAs.\nThough the success of the existing LLMs in completing various language understanding tasks, plenty\nof issues are still under-explored, such as the context length constraints, in-context learning and\ngeneralization ability, and etc. Hence, it is challenging to employ a solo LAA to complete all tasks,\nespecially when tasks are of high complexity. Therefore, we propose a new agent architecture for\norchestrating multiple LAAs, which is illustrated in Figure 3. BOLAA has two main modules, the\nlabor agents pool and the controller. The labor agents pool manages multiple LAAs. Each LAA may\nonly focus on generating one type of actions. For example, in the web navigation environment, we\ncould establish click LAA and search LAA. In this way, the former only generates the next button to\nclick, while the later only outputs search query, which divides a complex task into feasible tasks. The\ncontroller is devised to selectively call LAAs from agents pool. Controller has the agents selection\n5\nPREPRINT\nlayer for choosing the most relevant LAA to call. Then, the controller constructs the message for\nthe selected LAA and builds the communication. After obtaining the response from the labor LAA,\nthe controller parses it to an executable action and then interacts with the environment. Note that we\ncan also design those labor LAAs to be think/plan agent. In this way, the self-think and plan work\nflows are also retained.\n4\nEXPERIMENT\n4.1\nENVIRONMENT BENCHMARK\nWe construct the evaluation benchmarks from two environments, i.e., the WebShop (Yao et al.,\npreprint) and HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018) with Wikipedia API usage (Yao et al., 2023a).\nWebShop is a recently proposed online shopping website environment with 1.18M real-world prod-\nucts and human instructions. Each instruction is associated with one ground-truth product, and\ncontains attribute requirements, e.g. I\u2019m looking for a travel monopod camera tripod with quick\nrelease and easy to carry, and price lower than 130.00 dollars. This instruction includes 3 attribute\nrequirements i.e. \u201cquick release\u201d, \u201ccamera tripod\u201d and \u201ceasy carry\u201d attributes. We define the com-\nplexity of an instruction using the number of attribute requirements. Thus, this instruction example\nabove is of complexity 3. We equally sample 150 instructions regarding each complexity level.\nSince we have fewer than 150 instructions for complexity larger than 6, we only include instruc-\ntions from complexity in {1, 2, . . . , 6}, which sums up to 900 tasks for benchmark evaluation in the\nWebShop environment. In the WebShop environment, an agent operates either SEARCH[QUERY] or\nCLICK[ELEMENT] actions to interact the environment, for evaluating the interactive decision mak-\ning ability of LAA. The observation from WebShop is simplified web browser, which includes the\nclickable buttons and associated page content. LAA interacts with the WebShop environment as a\nweb navigation agent.\nHotPotQA with Wikipedia API is another environment considered in this paper, which contains\nmulti-hop questions answering tasks that requires reasoning over two or more Wikipedia passages.\nThis simulation environment serves as a powerful tool for evaluating the multi-step planning and\ncomprehension capabilities and information retrieval skills of AI models, ensuring they are profi-\ncient in sourcing reliable information from vast online resources. With its unique blend of real-world\ninternet browsing scenarios and text analysis, HotpotQA is an invaluable asset for the advancement\nof augmented large language agent systems. In HotPotQA environment, an agent has three types\nof actions, i.e., SEARCH[ENTITY], LOOKUP[STRING] and FINISH[ANSWER] to interact with Hot-\nPotQA environment. HotPotQA environment aims at evaluate the knowledge reasoning ability of\nLAA. We randomly sample 100 questions from easy, medium and hard levels, which constitutes the\nfinal 300 benchmark questions for evaluating LAAs.\n4.2\nEVALUATION METRICS\nWe mainly use the reward score in each environment to evaluate the performances of LAAs. In the\nWebShop environment, the reward is defined as the attribute overlapping ratio between the bought\nitem and ground truth item. In HotPotQA environment, the reward is defined as the F1 score grading\nbetween agent answer and ground-truth answer. Additionally, we develop the Recall performance\nfor WebShop environment, which is defined as 1 if the ground truth item is retrieved and 0 if not\nduring one task session. The Recall is reported as the average recall scores across all tasks in\nWebShop environment.\n4.3\nLLM UTILIZATION\nThe core component of LAA is the LLM backbone. We compare different LLMs with various\nchoices of model size and context length. We reported the results w.r.t. open LLM models such as\nfastchat-3b, vicuna-3b/13b/33b (Zheng et al., 2023), Llama-2-7b/13b/70b6 (Touvron et al., 2023),\nMPT-7b/30b (Team, 2023), xgen-8k-7b, longchat-16k-7b/13b and OpenAI API LLMs, including\ntext-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-3.5-turbo-16k.\n6All Llama-2 models are -chat-hf version.\n6\nPREPRINT\nTable 1: Average reward in the WebShop environment.

The performance regarding the average reward is reported in Table 1. The agent\nprompts are constructed based on the maximum context length of different LLM models. Regarding\nBOLAA, we devise one search LAA and one click LAA to generate search query and click elements,\nrespectively. We have the following observation:\n\u2022 BOLAA performs the best compared with the other LAA architectures, especially when built on\nthe high performing LLMs. BOLAA is able to actively select the appropriate LAA and yield\nqualitative communication, which stabilizes the action generation. We observe that BOLAA,\nwhen paired with a 3b fastchat-t5 LLM, performs comparably to other LAA architectures with\nmore powerful LLMs. The superiority of BOLAA indicates that orchestrating multiple smaller-\nsized LAAs is a better choice if the computing resources are limited. This further exemplifies the\npotential for fine-tuning multiple smaller-sized specialised LAAs rather than fine-tuning one large\ngeneralized LAA.\n\u2022 Pairing the LLM with the optimal LAA architecture is crucial. For example, Llama-2-13b per-\nforms best under PlanAct LAA arch while Llama-2-70b performs best under the BOLAA arch.\nAlso, Longchat-13b-16K performs best when using PlanAct and PlanReAct, which may indicate\nthe extraordinary planning ability of longchat-13b-16k models.\n\u2022 Increasing the context length alone may not necessarily improve the LAA performances. For\nexample, when comparing longchat-13b-16k with llama-2-13b models, the latter yields better\nperformances though with less context length. By checking the running log of those LAAs, we\nobserve more occurrence of hallucinated generation when the LAA runs for more steps, which in\nthe end degrades the benefits of longer context.\n\u2022 A powerful LLM is able to generalize under the zeroshot LAA arch. The best performance of\nOpenAI API-based models are actually under ZS and ZST arch. This indicates the great po-\ntential of developing a generic LAA with powerful LLM. Actually, this is currently what open-\nsource projects are working towards, directly calling OpenAI API and tuning the zeroshot agent\nprompt instead. Our benchmark results quantitatively justify that using only a ZS LAA can already\nachieve comparable or even better performances than LAA arch with additional Plan or Self-think\nflow. However, for other less powerful LLMs, fewshot prompts are necessary for LAAs.\n\u2022 Plan flow generally improves the performances when the agent is built on open-source LLMs. By\ncomparing the performances of ReAct, PlanAct and PlanReAct, we observe a performance gain\n7\nPREPRINT\nTable 2: Average recall in the WebShop environment.

However, planning and thinking require the LLM to\nbe able to reason in steps, which may be challenging for small size LLMs. For example, fastchat-\nt5-3b performs above average on ZS LAA arch. But the performance degrades by a large margin\nunder PlanReAct arch.\nWe also report the intermediate Recall performances for all LAAs, which are illustrated in Table 2.\nRecall is mainly related to the search action. High recall performances indicate that the LAA is\ncapable of generating a precise search query. High recalls usually lead to better rewards. But they\nare not tightly related. For example, Llama-2-70b has a recall performance of nearly 0.3344 on\nZS LAA, which is comparable to the best LAA. However, the reward performance in Table 1 of ZS\nLAA Llama-2-70b is only 0.0122. The reason is that generating the search query requires a different\nLLM ability from generating the correct click action, where the latter is more challenging. Another\nobservation is that our proposed BOLAA generally performs the best on all LLMs, which indicates\nthat separating the search agent from the click agent improves the accuracy of the search action,\nleading to a higher recall value.\nLAA performance w.r.t. Complexity. After the overall performances of those LAAs and LLMs\nare compared, we conduct more details investigation of the performance w.r.t. the task complexity.\nDue to the space limitation, we only report the performance of text-davinci-003 and llama-2-70b.\nThe reward performance is illustrated in Figure 4. The BOLAA model consistently performs better\non all complexity levels. We also observe the degraded performances when the task complexity\nis increased, which follows the intuition.\nSurprisingly, we find out that further increasing the\ncomplexity of tasks greater than 4 will not further degrade the performances. The reason is that\nthe recall performance increases when the task is of higher complexity, which we demonstrated\nin Figure 5. This is due to the fact that high-complexity task instruction provides more additional\ncontext information for the LAA. As such, the search action can be more specific and accurate under\nhigh complexity levels.\n4.5\nKNOWLEDGE REASONING SIMULATION\nWe benchmark on the HotPotQA environment to evaluate the multi-step reasoning ability of LAAs.\nSince the available search, lookup and finish operations are all related to knowledge reasoning in\nthis environment and hard to separate, we therefore leave the BOLAA arch for future work and\nonly compare the performance on other agent arch. The results are in Table 3. In general, ReAct\nagent arch achieves the best performances, which can be interpreted in twofold. Firstly, fewshot\nprompt is necessary to enable the action generation and reasoning ability for LAA, especially when\n8\nPREPRINT\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nComplexity of Task Instructions\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nReward\nZS\nZST\nReAct\nPlanAct\nPlanReAct\nBOLAA\n(a) text-davinci-003\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nComplexity of Task Instructions\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nReward\nZS\nZST\nReAct\nPlanAct\nPlanReAct\nBOLAA\n(b) Llama-2-70b\nFigure 4: The reward w.r.t. task complexity in WebShop.

Secondly, comparing ReAct, PlanAct, and\nPlanReAct, we would conclude that planning flow of LAA hinders performance the in knowledge\nreasoning environment and tasks. The reason is that knowledge reasoning tasks require contextu-\nalized information to conduct reasoning, whereas planning flow is executed ahead of interactions.\nThus, those generated plans tend to lead to more hallucination of LAA. Thirdly, regarding this\nknowledge reasoning task, model size is much more important than the context length. Large-sized\nmodel has better abilities in reasoning, thus performing better. Additionally, the superior reasoning\nability of OpenAI gpt-3.5 models is again verified. We also observe the best performance of Llama-\n2-70b on all open-source LLMs, which suggests that potential future fine-tuning can be applied on\nLlama-2 models.\nLAA performance w.r.t. Complexity. Since we have easy, medium, and high level tasks, we com-\npare the performance of Llama-2-70b and regarding different levels of complexity, as illustrated in\nFigure 6. We observe degrading performance if increasing the complexity of tasks. In HotPotQA\ntasks, the hardness is defined as the question answer hops. Therefore, hard question requires more\ncontext understanding and reasoning ability of LAA. Though OpenAI text-davinci-003 model con-\nsistently outperforms Llama-2-70b on all levels of complexity, their difference is of smaller margin\nin hard questions. Since hard questions requires more resoning efforts, we can conclude that Llama-\n2-70b posses comparable reasoning ability with text-davinci-003.\n9\nPREPRINT\nTable 3: Average reward in the HotPotQA environment.

We also provide one novel orchestrating method for multiple agents,\ni.e. BOLAA. The benchmarking results provide experimental justification for the LAA investigation\nand verify the potential benefits of BOLAA architecture. During the investigation, we also identify\nthe challenge of designing BOLAA architecture for environments with compounding actions. In\nthe future, we will explore whether we can harness LLMs in the controller such that selection and\ncommunication with labor agents is also fully autonomous. We will continue developing more LAA\narchitectures and include more LLMs and environments for evaluations.\n10\nPREPRINT\nREFERENCES\nHarrison Chase.

Sainath2,\nMichael Picheny1, Kyunghyun Cho1\n1Center for Data Science, New York University, New York City, USA\n2Google Inc., U.S.A\ncpeyser@google.com\nAbstract\nThe last year has seen astonishing progress in text-prompted\nimage generation premised on the idea of a cross-modal repre-\nsentation space in which the text and image domains are rep-\nresented jointly. In ASR, this idea has found application as\njoint speech-text encoders that can scale to the capacities of\nvery large parameter models by being trained on both unpaired\nspeech and text. While these methods show promise, they have\nrequired special treatment of the sequence-length mismatch in-\nherent in speech and text, either by up-sampling heuristics or\nan explicit alignment model. In this work, we offer evidence\nthat joint speech-text encoders naturally achieve consistent rep-\nresentations across modalities by disregarding sequence length,\nand argue that consistency losses could forgive length differ-\nences and simply assume the best alignment. We show that such\na loss improves downstream WER in both a large-parameter\nmonolingual and multilingual system.\n1. Introduction\nThe power of very large models trained on vast unsupervised\ncorpora in a single modality has become increasingly clear. This\nhas been demonstrated in the text domain where language mod-\nels have achieved unprecedented zero-shot capabilities [1, 2], as\nwell as in the audio domain, in which a single model has been\nshown to be adaptable to a surprisingly wide array of acoustic\ntasks [3, 4]. These successes have given rise to the question of\nhow to apply these methods for problems involving two modali-\nties, which historically have depended on manually paired data.\nOne very promising solution to this problem is to train a\nlarge encoder on both modalities, such that either modality may\nbe provided as an unpaired example, but which learns to map\npaired examples to similar points in representation space. In the\nimage/text domain, such a representation has proved achievable\nand capable of attaining state-of-the-art performance on many\nimage and text comprehension tasks in a single model [5, 6].\nIn the audio/text domain, joint speech and text models have\nbeen utilized for a wide range of tasks [7, 8, 9]. In speech recog-\nnition, the past few years has seen a trend toward models with\na joint speech and text encoder to allow pretraining on unpaired\nspeech and text data [10, 11, 12, 13]. However, speech recog-\nnition presents the particular challenge of two sequence modal-\nities, one of which (speech) is typically represented by a much\nlonger sequence than the other (text). This complicates the task\nof representing both modalities in the same embedding space,\nsince we cannot make a direct, frame-wise comparison of an\nencoder\u2019s speech representation to its text representation.\nThis complication has largely been handled either by up-\nsampling or an explicit alignment model. Fixed upsampling of\nthe text inputs has been applied successfully for ASR in [13]\nand SLU in [14], proving that an approximate alignment is suf-\nficient for learning a joint representation. On the other hand,\n[15] addresses the problem with a separately-trained alignment\nmodel that aims for perfect alignment. In [12], it\u2019s shown that\nsuch an alignment model permits the use of \u201cconsistency\u201d reg-\nularization in which the encoder\u2019s outputs on corresponding\nspeech and text are compared frame-wise and pushed together\nin representation space. [12] goes on to show that \u201cconsistency\u201d\nregularization yields a more closely joined representation space\nleading to better WER.\nConsistency regularization itself follows naturally from the\nliterature on generative models. Systems like autoencoders ap-\nplied to augmented data (e.g. [16]) explicitly push representa-\ntions of matched examples together, while contrastive systems\nlike [17] do the same implicitly. The success of the same idea\nin speech using an explicit alignment begs the question of if\nthe same can be done with an implicit alignmentment; that is,\nwithout knowing the particular alignment between speech and\ntext.\nIn this paper, we ask if consistency regularization may be\napplied using the implicit alignments learned in upsampling\nsystems like [13] to achieve the performance improvements\nseen with the explicit alignments in [12]. To this end, we de-\nvelop an algorithm inspired by dynamic time warping [18] that\nfinds the best possible alignment between an encoder\u2019s repre-\nsentation of a paired speech and text example. We measure\nthe quality of this best alignment in a system without an ex-\nplicit alignment model and show that that it is not only learned\nduring training but in fact improves at deeper layers of the net-\nwork. Inspired by the improvements shown in [15] and [12],\nwe then show that by changing the criteria of the consistency\nregularization to encourage consistency under some alignment,\ninstead of a direct frame-wise comparison, we can achieve ro-\nbust WER improvements against strong, semi-supervised base-\nlines in both a monolingual and multilingual setting, all without\nany learned alignment model. Our results suggest that enforc-\ning consistency in cross-modal representations can be done by\nsimply forgiving misalignment.\nThe rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 spec-\nifies our setup for joint speech/text modeling and consistency\nregularization, and the details of our best-alignment algorithm.\nSection 3 specifies details of our data and training. Section 4\npresents our analysis of the best alignment in an unregularized\nmodel and the results of optimizing that alignment with our con-\nsistency loss. We conclude in Section 5.\n2. Methods\nIn this section we present our setup for semi-supervised ASR\nby joint speech/text modeling, for which we mostly follow [13].\narXiv:2308.06125v1  [cs.CL]  11 Aug 2023\nWe then present our proposed best-alignment algorithm and de-\nfine a corresponding consistency loss inspired by [15].\n2.1. Model Architecture\nFigure 1 gives our model architecture. Essentially, we perform\nsupervised ASR with streaming and non-streaming decoders,\nwhere the encoder is split into \u201caudio-only\u201d/\u201ctext-only\u201d and\n\u201cshared\u201d components to permit text injection. The simultaneous\nASR and text-injection tasks give rise to a joint representation\nin the shared encoder. Specifically, given a corpus of supervised\nexamples (x, y) \u2208 S and an unpaired text corpus y \u2208 U, our\nmodel contains the following components:\n\u2022 Ea: The audio encoder, which embeds audio features x.\n\u2022 Et: The text encoder, which embeds text features y.\n\u2022 Estream\ns\n: The shared streaming encoder, which may consume\neither Ea(x) or Et(y) and maps them to a joint representa-\ntion. Since this encoder is \u201cstreaming\u201d, it only receives past\nacoustic frames.\n\u2022 Efull-context\ns\n: The full-context encoder, which consumes the\noutputs of Estream\ns\nand which is given forward acoustic frames.\n\u2022 Dstream: The streaming decoder, which consumes the outputs\nof Estream\ns\nand emits streaming ASR hypothesis.\n\u2022 Enon-streaming\ns\n: The non-streaming decoder, which consumes\nthe outputs of Efull-context\ns\nand emits non-streaming ASR hy-\npothesis.\nOur model is trained simultaneously on two tasks: ASR,\nand masked text reconstruction. For ASR, audio is passed into\naudio encoder, and hypothesis are compared against ground\ntruth text with the conventional cross-entropy loss. Masked text\nreconstruction makes use of unpaired text data. A mask (15%\nof the transcript) is applied to a phonemic representation of text,\nwhich is then passed into the text encoder. The hypothesis is\ncompared to the masked portion of the input again with a cross-\nentropy loss.\nFigure 1: Our architecture for semi-supervised ASR, adapted\nfrom [13] and [12].\n2.2. Consistency Loss\nConsider a paired example (x, y), where x = (x0, ..., xn) are\nspeech inputs and y = (y0, ..., ym) are text inputs and where\nn > m. Let us define the shared representations of audio and\ntext as\nRa = Es(Ea(x))\nRt = Es(Et(y))\nwhere Es can represent either the application of only\nEstream\ns\n(for a streaming representation) of Estream\ns\nfollowed by\nEnon-streaming\ns\n(for a non-streaming representation).\nA \u201ccon-\nsistency loss\u201d, as developed in [15] and [12], is some loss\nLconsistency(Ra, Rt) that measures the similarity of the two rep-\nresentations.\nSince the audio x and the text y are sequences of differ-\nent lengths, we require some notion of an alignment to define a\nmeaningful consistency loss. By alignment, we mean a specific\nup-sampling of y such that each audio frame x[i] will corre-\nspond to some text frame y[j]. With this in mind, we define\nan alignment A = (a0, a1, ..., an) as a list of indexes into y,\nsuch that for any audio frame i, x[i] corresponds to y[ai] in the\nalignment. We will also add the constraint that ai \u2264 ai+1 for\nall i. That is, we constrain A to be monotonically increasing, so\nthat so that sequential audio frames may not correspond to text\nbackwards.\nThis formulation is one of many conceivable ways to define\nan \u201calignment\u201d and we\u2019ve chosen it for the practicality it of-\nfers in efficiently computing the best alignment (see Section 2.3\nbelow). We note that in this formulation, each audio frame is\nconsidered exactly once, while each text frame can be repeated\nor skipped over entirely.\nWith this definition in mind, we define the consistency loss\nfor a given alignment as\nLconsistency\nA\n(Ra, Rt) =\nn\nX\nx=0\nLframe(Ra[x], Rt[A[x]])\nn\nwhere Lframe is some frame-wise similarity measure (in this\nwork, we use L2). That is, Lconsistency\nA\n(Ra, Rt) gives the average\nframe-wise similarity between Ra and the specific up-sampling\nof Rt given by A.\nThe setups in [15] and [12] use such a consistency loss suc-\ncessfully, taking A from a neural alignment model. We propose,\nas an alternative, to optimize the consistency over the best pos-\nsible alignment:\nLconsistency(Ra, Rt) = min\nA Lconsistency\nA\n(Ra, Rt)\nIn order to train with such a loss, we require an efficient\nalgorithm to compute the best alignment.\n2.3. Computing the Best Alignment\nDynamic time warping [18] relies on an inductive rule in order\nto define a recursive algorithm to match two sequences based\non a cost function. We do the same, specifying the cost:\nC(i, j) = min\nA Lconsistency(Ra[: i], Rt[: j])\nThat is, the cost C(i, j) gives the consistency loss under the\nbest alignment between the prefix of the audio representation\nup to the index i and the prefix of the text representation up to\nthe index j. We may then specify a inductive rule:\nC(i, j) = min\nk\u2264j\nh\nC(i, k \u2212 1) + Lframe(Ra[i], Rt[k])\ni\nThat is, the best alignment for the prefixes Ra[: i] and Rt[:\nj] aligns the previous i \u2212 1 audio frames to some shorter prefix\nRt[: k], and then appends to it the specific alignment of Ra[i]\nto Rt[k].\nWe may back out the indexes of the best alignment from this\ncomputation. This rule gives rise to a dynamic programming\nalgorithm for finding the best alignment in O(nm2) time and\nmemory.\nWe note that the minimization across all alignments pre-\ncludes differentiation of the alignment-finding.\nInstead, we\ncompute the best alignment during forward-propagation, and\nthen differentiate Lframe as applied to the aligned frames. That\nis, we use the pass-through approximation of the gradient:\n\u2202Lconsistency(Ra, Rt)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2248 \u2202Lconsistency\nA\u2217\n(Ra, Rt)\n\u2202\u03b8\nwhere\nA\u2217 = arg min\nA Lconsistency\nA\n(Ra, Rt)\n3. Experiments\nIn this section, we provide details of our model settings and\ndata.\n3.1. Model Settings\nWe specify component\u2019s parameterizations according to the list\nin Section 2.1:\n\u2022 Ea: The audio encoder consists of a single conformer [19]\nlayer with 8 attention heads and dimension 2048. The audio\nencoder consumes 128 dimensional log-mels spanning 32ms\neach and spaced apart by 10ms. We then stack each frame\nwith the frame before it and the two frames after it to yield\n512 dimensional representations. Finally, we subsample by\ntaking each third frame, yielding a final frame rate of 30ms.\n\u2022 Et: The text encoder consists of a embedding projection fol-\nlowed by a conformer layer. As in [13], we find it necessary\nto supply the text encoder with phonemic representations of\ntext transcripts. We then continue to follow [13] by repeating\neach phoneme twice as an alignment heuristic.\n\u2022 Estream\ns\n: The shared streaming encoder consists of five con-\nformer layers, with layer-norm applied at the end.\n\u2022 Efull-context\ns\n: The full-context shared encoder consists of nine\nadditional conformer layers, with layer-norm applied at the\nend.\n\u2022 Dstream: The streaming decoder is a HAT decoder [20] in\nwhich both the prediction and joint layers have dimension\n640.\n\u2022 Enon-streaming\ns\n: The non-streaming decoder, is identical to the\nstreaming decoder.\nTogether, our model contains about 165M parameters.\nTraining is done in two phases. First, the audio encoder, joint\nencoders, and decoders are all trained on paired data for 800k\nsteps with a batch size of 2048. The text encoder is then added\nand the model is further trained with equally weighted super-\nvised and unsupervised loss as described in Section 2.1, with\nthe best alignment loss from Section 2.3 optionally included.\nThe model trains in this manner for 100k further steps with a\nbatch size of 2048 for both the supervised and unsupervised\ndata.\nAll models are implemented in Tensorflow, with the best\nalignment algorithm itself implemented as a CPU kernel. We\nfind that the addition of the best alignment computation does\nnot significantly increase training time over the baseline model.\n3.2. Datasets\nText-injection methods in ASR have historically been applied\nin two broad settings.\nStrong baselines are often fine-tuned\nwith very large text corpora to improve performance on diffi-\ncult words. Alternatively, text-injection may be used for models\ntrained on limited supervised data may be used to improve the\ninternal language model and get closer to a viable system. With\nthese two settings in mind, we study the best alignment loss in\ntwo setups:\n\u2022 A large English corpus consisting of about 200k hours of su-\npervised speech, together with an unsupervised text dataset\nof about 200B examples.\nWe report results for a Main test set derived from the same\ndistribution as the training examples, and a Noisy test set of\nespecially noisy examples.\n\u2022 A multilingual corpus consisting of the following eleven lan-\nguages: English (En), French (Fr), Spanish (Sp), Arabic\n(Ar), Portuguese (Po), German (De), Russian (Ru), Hindi\n(Hi), Italian(It), Mandarin, and Japanese.\nThis setting involves no unsupervised text, with the MLM\nobjective applied instead to the supervised transcripts. The\ndataset consists of about 140M paired examples.\nBolded abbreviations are given above for languages for\nwhich we are able to report WER in 1. For simplicity with\nthe large number of test sets, we report only non-streaming\nWER from this model.\nAll datasets are anonymized and human transcribed.\n4. Results\nIn this section, we seek to demonstrate that even without con-\nsistency regularization, our model learns an alignment between\npaired speech and text examples. We then seek to show that op-\ntimizing this alignment with our proposed best-alignment con-\nsistency regularization improves WER.\n4.1. Best-Alignment in an Unregularized Model\nFor this analysis, we use our baseline model from the monolin-\ngual setup as described in Section 3.1. Our objective is to mea-\nsure Lconsistency on a small set of random development examples\nfor Rs and Rt taken at each of the first five conformer layers\nof the streaming joint encoder. We interpret a lower value for\nLconsistency as reflecting a stronger implicit alignment between\nspeech and text.\nFor each layer l we sample 2000 random pairs of audio and\ntext embeddings and compute the mean \u00b5l and standard devia-\ntion \u03c32\nl of the distribution of distances between pairs. We then\ncompare two alignments: the naive frame-wise alignment and\nour computed best alignment. For each of these alignments A,\nwe report:\n\u00b5l \u2212 Lconsistency\nA\n(Rs, Rt)\n\u03c32\nl\nThat is, we report the consistency in terms of the number\nstandard deviations away from the mean, such that a result of 0\nsuggests that the alignment is no better than random and a result\nbelow 0 suggests that the alignment is stronger than random.\nTable 2 presents these measurements. We see that while\nthe consistency of the frame-wise alignment is close to that of\nthe random alignment, the best alignment is considerably better\nthan random. Furthermore, the quality of the best alignment\nimproves steadily as we progress deeper into the model. That\nis, while text and speech are not modeled jointly at the frame\nlevel, there is some alignment for which paired speech and text\nEn\nFr\nSp\nAr\nPo\nDe\nRu\nHi\nIt\nM 0\n9.1\n10.6\n6.4\n12.6\n7.9\n14.8\n13.0\n19.7\n10.3\nM 10\n8.5\n10.4\n5.8\n11.8\n7.7\n13.4\n12.5\n19.4\n9.8\nM 1\n8.5\n10.5\n6.1\n11.9\n8.1\n13.9\n12.7\n19.3\n10.0\nM 0.1\n8.6\n10.3\n6.2\n12.1\n8.0\n13.9\n12.9\n19.5\n9.9\nM 0.01\n8.8\n10.5\n6.3\n12.2\n7.9\n14.0\n13.0\n19.6\n10.3\nTable 1: Evaluation Results for the Multilingual Setting.\nTable 2: Consistency of the linear and best alignments at layers\nof the shared encoder.\nLayer\nFrame-wise Alignment\nBest Alignment\n1\n-0.06\n-1.47\n2\n-0.23\n-2.15\n3\n-0.29\n-2.61\n4\n-0.37\n-2.67\n5\n-0.49\n-3.06\nare mapped to similar points in the embedding space, and this\nalignment improves with the depth of the network.\nTo illustrate the presence of this alignment, we visualize\nthe relationship between shared encoder\u2019s final representations\nof the speech and text from a single test example.

Consistency Regularization Results\nWe present results for the best-alignment loss at different inter-\npolation weights and for both of the settings specified in Section\n3.2. For ease of reading, we specify each experiment by a let-\nter and a number. The letter is either E for the English-only\nsetting of M for the multilingual setting. The number is the\ninterpolation weight of the best-alignment loss as a percentage.\nFor example, E 0 is the baseline English-only model with un-\nregularized semisupervised finetuning, while M 0.1 is a mul-\ntilingual model with the best alignment loss interpolated during\nfinetuning at 0.1 percent.\nTable 3 gives our results in the high-resource, English-only\nsetting. There, we see small but consistent WER improvements\nwith the best-alignment loss, although we note the necessity of\nselecting the correct interpolation weight.

We believe that the strength of the method in the multi-\nlingual setting is due to the increased difficulty of the problem\nand the smaller dataset leaving more room for the model to im-\nprove.\n5. Conclusions\nWe\u2019ve shown that a semi-supervised speech/text encoder learns\na joint representation of the two modalities that can observed\nby choosing the best alignment. We\u2019ve exploited that fact to\nenforce domain consistency with an extra loss term which opti-\nmizes the modality match for the best alignment. We show con-\nsistent improvements over an unregularized joint model across\nmultiple setups without adding any parameters.\n6. References\n[1] T. B. Brown, B. Mann, N. Ryder, M. Subbiah, J.

This method tackles\nthe challenges of explainability, scalability, and privacy by\nallowing network operators to inspect the generated code,\neliminating the need to share network data with LLMs, and\nconcentrating on application-specific requests combined with\ngeneral program synthesis techniques. We design and evaluate\na prototype system using benchmark applications, showcasing\nhigh accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and the potential for fur-\nther enhancements using complementary program synthesis\ntechniques.\n1\nIntroduction\nA critical aspect of contemporary network management in-\nvolves analyzing and performing actions on network topolo-\ngies and communication graphs for tasks such as capacity\nplanning [39], configuration analysis [5,17], and traffic anal-\nysis [24, 25, 60]. For instance, network operators may pose\ncapacity planning questions, such as \u201cWhat is the most cost-\nefficient way to double the network bandwidth between these\ntwo data centers?\u201d using network topology data. Similarly,\nthey may ask diagnostic questions like, \u201cWhat is the required\nnumber of hops for data transmission between these two\nnodes?\u201d using communication graphs. Network operators\ntoday rely on an expanding array of tools and domain-specific\nlanguages (DSLs) for these operations [17,39]. A unified ap-\nproach holds significant potential to reduce the learning curve\nand minimize errors and inefficiencies in manual operations.\nThe recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\n[1,6,12,46,53] provide a valuable opportunity to carry out net-\nwork management tasks using natural language. LLMs have\ndemonstrated exceptional proficiency in interpreting human\nlanguage and providing high-quality answers across various\ndomains [16,33,50,54]. The capabilities of LLMs can poten-\ntially bridge the gap between diverse tools and DSLs, leading\nto a more cohesive and user-friendly approach to handling\nnetwork-related questions and tasks.\nUnfortunately, while numerous network management oper-\nations can be represented as graph analysis or manipulation\ntasks, no existing systems facilitate graph manipulation us-\ning natural language. Asking LLMs to directly manipulate\nnetwork topologies introduces three fundamental challenges\nrelated to explainability, scalability, and privacy. First, ex-\nplaining the output of LLMs and enabling them to reason\nabout complex problems remain unsolved issues [59]. Even\nstate-of-the-art LLMs suffer from well-established problems\nsuch as hallucinations [35] and making basic arithmetic mis-\ntakes [7,13]. This complicates the process of determining the\nmethods employed by LLMs in deriving answers and eval-\nuating their correctness. Second, LLMs are constrained by\nlimited token window sizes [57], which restrict their capacity\nto process extensive network topologies and communication\ngraphs. For example, state-of-the-art LLMs such as Bard [20],\nChatGPT [44], and GPT-4 [46] permit only 2k to 32k tokens\nin their prompts, which can only accommodate small network\ntopologies comprising tens of nodes and hundreds of edges.\nThird, network data may consist of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), such as IP addresses [55], raising privacy\nconcerns when transferring this information to LLMs for pro-\ncessing. Addressing these challenges is crucial to develop\na more effective approach to integrating LLMs in network\nmanagement tasks.\nVision and Techniques. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach to enhance network management by leveraging the\npower of LLMs to create task-specific code for graph analysis\nand manipulation, which facilitates a natural-language-based\nnetwork administration experience. Figure 1 depicts an exam-\nple of how this system generates and executes LLM-produced\ncode in response to a network operator\u2019s natural language\nquery. This approach tackles the explainability challenge by\nallowing network operators to examine the LLM-generated\ncode, enabling them to comprehend the underlying logic and\nprocedures to fulfill the natural language query. Addition-\nally, it delegates computation to program execution engines,\nthereby minimizing arithmetic inaccuracies and LLM-induced\nhallucinations. Furthermore, this approach overcomes the\nscalability and privacy concerns by removing the necessity\nto transfer network data to LLMs, as the input for LLMs is\n1\narXiv:2308.06261v1  [cs.NI]  11 Aug 2023\nOriginal communication graph \nUpdated communication graph \nFigure 1: An example of how a natural-language-based network management system generates and executes a program\nin response to a network operator\u2019s query: \u201cAssign a unique color for each /16 IP address prefix\u201d. The system displays\nthe LLM-generated code and the updated communication graph.\nthe natural language query and the output solely comprises\nLLM-generated code.\nThe primary technical challenge in this approach lies in\ngenerating high-quality code that can reliably accomplish\nnetwork management tasks. Although LLMs have demon-\nstrated remarkable capabilities in general code generation\n[2,7,33], they lack an understanding of domain-specific and\napplication-specific requirements. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a novel framework that combines application-\nspecific requests with general program synthesis techniques\nto create customized code for graph manipulation tasks in\nnetwork management. Our architecture divides the process\nof generating high-quality code into two key components: (1)\nan application-specific element that provides context, instruc-\ntions, or plugins, which enhances the LLMs\u2019 comprehension\nof network structures, attributes, and terminology, and (2) a\ncode generation element that leverages suitable libraries and\ncutting-edge program synthesis techniques [2, 9\u201311, 48, 49]\nto produce code. This architecture fosters independent in-\nnovation of distinct components, and our preliminary study\nindicates substantial improvements in code quality.\nImplementation and Evaluation. We design a prototype sys-\ntem that allows network operators to submit natural-language\nqueries and obtain code to handle network topologies and\ncommunication graphs (Figure 1). To systematically assess\neffectiveness, we establish a benchmark, NeMoEval, con-\nsisting of two applications that can be modeled as graph\nmanipulation: (1) network traffic analysis using communi-\ncation graphs [24,25,60], and (2) network lifecycle manage-\nment based on Multi-Abstraction-Layer Topology represen-\ntation (MALT) [39]. To assess generalizability, we evaluate\nthese applications using three code generation approaches\n(SQL [14], pandas [41], and NetworkX [15]) and four distinct\nLLMs [10,20,44,46]. Our preliminary investigation shows\nthat our system is capable of producing high-quality code\nfor graph manipulation tasks. Utilizing the NetworkX-based\napproach, we attain average code correctness of 68% and 56%\nacross all tasks for the four LLMs (up to 88% and 78% with\nGPT-4) for network traffic analysis and network lifecycle man-\nagement, respectively. In comparison, the strawman baseline,\nwhich inputs the limited-sized graph data directly into LLMs,\nonly reaches an average correctness of 23% for the traffic\nanalysis application. Our method significantly improves the\naverage correctness by 45%, making it a more viable option.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that integrating our system with\ncomplementary program synthesis methods could further en-\nhance code quality for complex tasks. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat our approach is cost-effective, with an average expense\nof $0.1 per task, and the LLM cost stays constant regardless\nof network sizes. Our study indicates that this is a potentially\npromising research direction. We release NeMoEval1, our\nbenchmark and datasets, to foster further research.\nContributions. We make the following contributions:\n\u2022 Towards enabling natural-language-based network adminis-\ntration experience, we introduce a novel approach that uses\nLLMs to generate code for graph manipulation tasks. This\nwork is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate\nthe utilization of LLMs for graph manipulation and network\nmanagement.\n\u2022 We develop and release a benchmark that encompasses\ntwo network administration applications: network traffic\nanalysis and network lifecycle management.\n\u2022 We evaluate these applications with three code generation\ntechniques and four distinct LLMs to validate the capability\nof our approach in generating high-quality code for graph\nmanipulation tasks.\n2\nPreliminaries\nWe examine graph analysis and manipulation\u2019s role in network\nmanagement, followed by discussing recent LLM advances\nand their potential application to network management.\n1https://github.com/microsoft/NeMoEval\n2\n2.1\nGraph Analysis and Manipulation in Net-\nwork Management\nNetwork management involves an array of tasks such as net-\nwork planning, monitoring, configuration, and troubleshoot-\ning. As networks expand in size and complexity, these tasks\nbecome progressively more challenging. For instance, net-\nwork operators are required to configure numerous network\ndevices to enforce intricate policies and monitor these devices\nto guarantee their proper functionality. Numerous operations\ncan be modeled as graph analysis and manipulation for net-\nwork topologies or communication graphs. Two examples of\nthese tasks are described below.\nNetwork Traffic Analysis. Network operators analyze net-\nwork traffic for various reasons, including identifying bottle-\nnecks, congestion points, and underutilized resources, as well\nas performing traffic classification. A valuable representation\nin traffic analysis is traffic dispersion graphs (TDGs) [25] or\ncommunication graphs [19], in which nodes represent network\ncomponents like routers, switches, or devices, and edges sym-\nbolize the connections or paths between these components\n(e.g., Figure 1). These graphs offer a visual representation of\ndata packet paths, facilitating a comprehensive understanding\nof traffic patterns. Network operators typically utilize these\ngraphs in two ways: (1) examining these graphs to under-\nstand the network\u2019s current state for network performance\noptimization [25], traffic classification [52], and anomaly de-\ntection [29], and (2) manipulating the nodes and edges to\nsimulate the impact of their actions on the network\u2019s perfor-\nmance and reliability [30].\nNetwork Lifecycle Management. Managing the entire life-\ncycle of a network entails various phases, including capacity\nplanning, network topology design, deployment planning, and\ndiagnostic operations. The majority of these operations ne-\ncessitate an accurate representation of network topology at\ndifferent abstraction levels and the manipulation of topology\nto achieve the desired network state [39]. For example, net-\nwork operators might employ a high-level topology to plan\nthe network\u2019s capacity and explore different alternatives to\nincrease bandwidth between two data centers. Similarly, net-\nwork engineers may use a low-level topology to determine the\nlocation of a specific network device and its connections to\nother devices.\nHence, graph analysis and manipulation are crucial parts\nof network management. A unified interface capable of com-\nprehending and executing these tasks has the potential to\nsignificantly simplify the process, saving network operators\nconsiderable time and effort.\n2.2\nLLMs and Program Synthesis\nAutomated program generation based on natural language de-\nscriptions, also known as program synthesis, has been a long-\nstanding research challenge [3,23,34]. Until recently, program\nsynthesis had primarily been limited to specific domains, such\nas string processing [22], program generation based on input-\noutput examples [4], and natural language for database queries\n(e.g., [26,28,31]). In contrast, general program synthesis was\nconsidered to be out of reach [2]. The breakthrough emerged\nwith the advancement of LLMs [6,10,18,20,32,46], which\nare trained on extensive corpora of natural language text from\nthe internet and massive code repositories such as GitHub.\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in learning\nthe relationship between natural language and code, achiev-\ning state-of-the-art performance in domain-specific tasks such\nas natural language to database query [40, 51], as well as\nhuman-level performance in tasks like programming compe-\ntitions [33] and mock technical interviews [7]. Just recently,\nthese advancements have led to experimental plugins designed\nto solve mathematical problems and perform data analysis\nthrough code generation [43].\nThe recent breakthrough in program synthesis using LLMs\nhas ignited a surge of research aimed at advancing the state\nof the art in this field. These techniques can generally be\nclassified into three approaches: (1) code selection, which in-\nvolves generating multiple samples with LLMs and choosing\nthe best one based on the consistency of execution results [48]\nor auto-generated test cases [9]; (2) few-shot examples, which\nsupply LLMs with several examples of the target program\u2019s\ninput-output behavior [2]; and (3) feedback and self-reflection,\nwhich incorporates a feedback or reinforcement learning outer\nloop to help LLMs learn from their errors [8,11,49]. These\nadvanced techniques continue to expand the horizons of pro-\ngram synthesis, empowering LLMs to generate more complex\nand accurate programs.\nAs Section 1 discusses, LLM-generated code can tackle\nexplainability, scalability, and privacy challenges in LLM-\nbased network management. However, our initial study shows\nthat merely applying existing approaches is inadequate for\nnetwork management tasks, as existing techniques do not\ncomprehend the domain-specific and application-specific re-\nquirements. The key technical challenge lies in harnessing\nrecent advancements in LLMs and general program synthesis\nto develop a unified interface capable of accomplishing net-\nwork management tasks, which forms the design requirements\nfor our proposed solution.\n3\nSystem Framework\nWe present a novel system framework designed to enhance net-\nwork management by utilizing LLMs to generate task-specific\ncode. Our framework is founded on two insights. First, we can\ntransform many network management operations into graph\nanalysis and manipulation tasks (Section 2.1), which allows\nfor a unified design and a more focused task for code gen-\neration. Second, we can divide prompt generation into two\naspects: domain-specific requirements and general program\nsynthesis. By combining the strengths of domain specializa-\ntion with recent advances in program synthesis techniques\n(Section 2.2), we can generate high-quality code for network\nmanagement tasks. Figure 2 illustrates our system framework.\nThe framework we propose consists of an application wrap-\nper ( 1 in Figure 2) that uses domain-specific knowledge,\n3\nApplication \nPrompt \nGenerator\nGenerated code\nExtract code \n& Validate\nRaw data or logs\nUser query\nApplication\nApplication and \nGraph description\nExecution\nsandbox\nComplete \nprompt\nSync state\nFormat \noutput\nChosen LLM\n1\nGraphs\nCode-Gen \nPrompt \nGenerator\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nUX interface\nApplication Wrapper\nFigure 2: A general framework for network management systems using natural language and LLM-generated code\nsuch as the definitions of nodes and edges, to transform the\napplication data into a graph representation. This information,\ntogether with user queries in natural language, is processed by\nan application prompt generator ( 2 ) to create a task-specific\nprompt for the LLM. Subsequently, the task-specific prompt\nis combined with a general code-gen prompt generator ( 3 )\nto instruct the LLM ( 4 ) to produce code. The generated\ncode utilizes plugins and libraries to respond to the user\u2019s nat-\nural language queries in the constructed graph. An execution\nsandbox ( 5 ) executes the code on the graph representation\nof the network. The code and its results are displayed on a\nUX interface ( 6 ). If the user approves the results, the UX\nsends the updated graph back to the application wrapper ( 1 )\nto modify the network state and record the input/output for\nfuture prompt enhancements [2,11,49]. We describe the key\ncomponents below.\nApplication Wrapper ( 1 ). The application wrapper offers\ncontext-specific information related to the network manage-\nment application and the network itself. For instance, the\nMulti-Abstraction-Layer Topology representation (MALT)\nwrapper [39] can extract the graph of entities and relation-\nships from the underlying data, describing entities (e.g., packet\nswitches, control points, etc.) and relationships (e.g., contains,\ncontrols, etc.) in natural language. This information assists\nLLMs in comprehending the network management applica-\ntion and the graph data structure. Additionally, the application\nwrapper can provide application-specific plugins [42] or code\nlibraries to make LLM tasks more straightforward.\nApplication Prompt Generator ( 2 ). The purpose of the\napplication prompt generator is to accept both the user query\nand the information from the application wrapper as input, and\nthen generate a prompt specifically tailored to the query and\ntask for the LLM. To achieve this, the prompt generator can\nutilize a range of static and dynamic techniques [37,56,58].\nFor instance, when working with MALT, the prompt genera-\ntor can dynamically select relevant entities and relationships\nbased on the user query, and then populate a prompt template\nwith the contextual information. Our framework is designed\nto offer flexibility regarding the code-gen prompt generator\n( 3 ) and LLMs ( 4 ), enabling the use of various techniques\nfor different applications.\nExecution Sandbox ( 5 ). As highlighted in previous re-\nsearch [10], it is crucial to have a secure environment to run\nthe code generated by LLMs. The execution sandbox can be\nestablished using virtualization or containerization techniques,\nensuring limited access to program libraries and system calls.\nAdditionally, this module provides a chance to enhance the\nsecurity of both code and system by validating network invari-\nants or examining output formats.\n4\nImplementation and Evaluation\n4.1\nBenchmark\nWe design a general benchmark, NeMoEval, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of LLM-based network management systems.\nFigure 3 illustrates the architecture of our benchmark, which\nconsists of three primary components:\nGolden answer \nSelector\nEvaluation  \n& analysis\nLLM generated code \nexecution\nGolden code \nexecution\nOur Prototype\nUser \nquery\nFigure 3: Benchmark design\nGolden Answer Selector.

The system executes the LLM-generated\ncode on network data, comparing outcomes with the golden\nanswer\u2019s results. If they match, the LLM passes; otherwise, it\nfails, and we document the findings for further analysis.\nResults Logger. To facilitate the analysis of the LLM\u2019s perfor-\nmance and the identification of potential improvement, we log\nthe results of each query, including the LLM-generated code,\nthe golden answer, and the comparison results. The results\nlogger also records any code execution errors that may have\noccurred during the evaluation process.\n4.2\nExperimental Setup\nApplications and Queries. We implement and evaluate two\napplications, network traffic analysis and network lifecycle\nmanagement (Section 2.1):\n\u2022 Network Traffic Analysis. We generate synthetic commu-\nnication graphs with varying numbers of nodes and edges.\nEach edge represents communication activities between two\nnodes with random weights in bytes, connections, and pack-\nets. We develop 24 queries by curating trial users\u2019 queries,\nencompassing common tasks such as topology analysis,\ninformation computation, and graph manipulation.\n\u2022 Network Lifecycle Management. We use the example MALT\ndataset [21] and convert it into a directed graph with 5493\nnodes and 6424 edges. Each node represents one or more\ntypes in a network, such as packet switches, chassis, and\nports, with different node types containing various attributes.\nDirected edges encapsulate relationships between devices,\nlike control or containment associations. We develop 9\nnetwork management queries focusing on operational man-\nagement, WAN capacity planning, and topology design.\nThe queries are categorized into three complexity levels\n(\u201cEasy\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d, and \u201cHard\u201d) based on the complexity of\ntheir respective golden answers. Table 1 displays an example\nquery from each category due to page limits. We release the\ncomplete list of queries, their respective golden answers, and\nthe benchmark to facilitate future research2.\nLLMs. We conduct our study on four state-of-the-art LLMs,\nincluding GPT-4 [46], GPT-3 [6], Text-davinci-003 (a variant\nof GPT 3.5) [45], and Google Bard [20]. We further explore\ntwo open LLMs, StarCoder [32] and InCoder [18]. However,\nwe do not show their results here because of inconsistent an-\nswers. We intend to report their results once they achieve\n2https://github.com/microsoft/NeMoEval\nTable 2: Accuracy Summary for Both Applications\nTraffic Analysis\nMALT\nStrawman\nSQL\nPandas\nNetworkX\nSQL\nPandas\nNetworkX\nGPT-4\n0.29\n0.50\n0.38\n0.88\n0.11\n0.56\n0.78\nGPT-3\n0.17\n0.13\n0.25\n0.63\n0.11\n0.44\n0.44\ntext-davinci-003\n0.21\n0.29\n0.29\n0.63\n0.11\n0.22\n0.56\nGoogle Bard\n0.25\n0.21\n0.25\n0.59\n0.11\n0.33\n0.44\nTable 3: Breakdown for Trafic Analysis\nStrawman\nSQL\nPandas\nNetworkX\nE(8)/M(8)/H(8)\nE(8)/M(8)/H(8)\nE(8)/M(8)/H(8)\nE(8)/M(8)/H(8)\nGPT-4\n0.50/0.38/0.0\n0.75/0.50/0.25\n0.50/0.50/0.13\n1.0/1.0/0.63\nGPT-3\n0.38/0.13/0.0\n0.25/0.13/0.0\n0.50/0.25/0.0\n1.0/0.63/0.25\ntext-davinci-003\n0.38/0.25/0.0\n0.63/0.25/0.0\n0.63/0.25/0.0\n1.0/0.75/0.13\nGoogle Bard\n0.50/0.25/0.0\n0.38/0.25/0.0\n0.50/0.13/0.13\n0.88/0.50/0.38\nconsistent performance in future investigation. With all Ope-\nnAI LLMs, we set their temperature to 0 to ensure consistent\noutput across multiple trials. Since we cannot change the\ntemperature of Google Bard, we send each query five times\nand calculate the average passing probability [10].\nApproaches. We implement three code generation meth-\nods using well-established data/graph manipulation libraries,\nwhich offer abundant examples in public code repositories for\nLLMs to learn from:\n\u2022 NetworkX. We represent the network data as a NetworkX [15]\ngraph, which offers flexible APIs for efficient manipulation\nand analysis of network graphs.\n\u2022 pandas. We represent the network data using two pan-\ndas [41] dataframes: a node dataframe, which stores node\nindices and attributes, and an edge dataframe, which en-\ncapsulates the link information among nodes through an\nedge list. Pandas provides many built-in data manipulation\ntechniques, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping.\n\u2022 SQL. We represent the network data as a relational database\nqueried through SQL [14], consisting of a table for nodes\nand another for edges. The table schemas are similar to\nthose in pandas. Recent work has demonstrated that LLMs\nare capable of generating SQL queries with state-of-the-art\naccuracy [40,51].\nWe also evaluate an alternative baseline (strawman) that di-\nrectly feeds the original network graph data in JSON format to\nthe LLM and requests it to address the query. However, owing\nto the token constraints on LLMs, we limit our evaluation of\nthis approach to synthetic graphs for network traffic analysis,\nwhere data size can be controlled.\n5\nTable 4: Breakdown for MALT\nSQL\nPandas\nNetworkX\nE(3)/M(3)/H(3)\nE(3)/M(3)/H(3)\nE(3)/M(3)/H(3)\nGPT-4\n0.33/0.0/0.0\n0.67/0.67/0.33\n1.0/1.0/0.33\nGPT-3\n0.33/0.0/0.0\n0.67/0.67/0.0\n0.67/0.67/0.0\ntext-davinci-003\n0.33/0.0/0.0\n0.33/0.33/0.0\n0.67/0.67/0.33\nGoogle Bard\n0.33/0.0/0.0\n0.67/0.33/0.0\n0.67/0.33/0.33\nTable 5: Error Type Summary of LLM Generated Code\nLLM\u2019s error type (NetworkX)\nTraffic Analysis (35)\nMALT (17)\nSyntax error\n9\n0\nImaginary graph attributes\n9\n1\nImaginary files/function arguments\n3\n2\nArguments error\n7\n8\nOperation error\n4\n2\nWrong calculation logic\n2\n3\nGraphs are not identical\n1\n1\n4.3\nCode Quality\nTable 2 summarizes the benchmark results for network traf-\nfic analysis and network lifecycle management, respectively.\nWe observe three key points. First, utilizing LLMs for gen-\nerating code in network management significantly surpasses\nthe strawman baseline in both applications, as the generated\ncode reduces arithmetic errors and LLM hallucinations. Sec-\nond, employing a graph library (NetworkX) greatly enhances\ncode accuracy compared to pandas and SQL, as LLMs can\nleverage NetworkX\u2019s graph manipulation APIs to simplify\nthe generated code. This trend is consistent across all four\nLLMs. Finally, pairing NetworkX with the state-of-the-art\nGPT-4 model produces the highest results (88% and 78%,\nrespectively), making it a promising strategy for network man-\nagement code generation.\nTo understand the impact of task difficulty, we break down\nthe accuracy results in Tables 3 and 4. We observe that the\naccuracy of LLM-generated code decreases as task complex-\nity increases. This trend is consistent across all LLMs and\napproaches, with the performance disparities becoming more\npronounced for network lifecycle management (Table 4).\nOur analysis of the LLM-generated code reveals that the\ncomplex relationships in the MALT dataset make LLMs more\nprone to errors in challenging tasks, and future research should\nfocus on improving LLMs\u2019 ability to handle complex network\nmanagement tasks.\n4.4\nCase Study on Potential Improvement\nFor the NetworkX approach across all four LLMs, there are\n35 failures out of 96 tests (24 \u00d7 4) for network traffic analysis\nand 17 failures out of 36 tests (9 \u00d7 4) for network lifecycle\nTable 6: Improvement Cases with Bard on MALT\nBard + Pass@1\nBard + Pass@5\nBard + Self-debug\nNetworkX\n0.44\n1.0\n0.67\n(a) CDF of LLM cost per query\n(80 nodes and edges)\n(b) Cost analysis on graph size\nFigure 4: Cost and scalability Analysis\nmanagement, respectively. Table 5 summarizes the error types.\nMore than half of the errors are associated with syntax errors\nor imaginary (non-existent) attributes. We conduct a case\nstudy to see whether using complementary program synthesis\ntechniques (Section 2.2) could correct these errors.\nWe assess two techniques: (1) pass@k [10], where the LLM\nis queried k times with the same question, and it is deemed\nsuccessful if at least one of the answers is correct. This method\nreduces errors arising from the LLM\u2019s inherent randomness\nand can be combined with code selection techniques [9, 10,\n48] for improved results; (2) self-debug [11], which involves\nproviding the error message back to the LLM and encouraging\nit to correct the previous response.\nWe carry out a case study using the Bard model and three\nunsuccessful network lifecycle queries with the NetworkX\napproach. Table 6 shows that both pass@k (k = 5) and self-\ndebug significantly enhance code quality, resulting in improve-\nments of 100% and 67%, respectively. These results indicate\nthat applying complementary techniques has considerable po-\ntential for further improving the accuracy of LLM-generated\ncode in network management applications.\n4.5\nCost and Scalability Analysis\nWe examine the LLM cost utilizing GPT-4 pricing on Azure\n[36] for the network traffic analysis application. Figure 4a\nreveals that the strawman approach is three times costlier than\nour method for a small graph with 80 nodes and edges. As\nthe graph size expands (Figure 4b), the gap between the two\napproaches grows, with the strawman approach surpassing the\nLLM\u2019s token limit for a moderate graph containing 150 nodes\nand edges. Conversely, our method has a small cost (<$0.2\nper query) that remains unaffected by graph size increases.\n5\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nRecent advancement in LLMs has paved the way for new\nopportunities in network management. We introduce a system\nframework that leverages LLMs to create task-specific code\nfor graph manipulation, tackling issues of explainability, scala-\nbility, and privacy. While our prototype and preliminary study\nindicate the potential of this method, many open questions\nremain in this nascent area of research.\nCode Quality for Complex Tasks. As our evaluation demon-\nstrates, the LLM-generated code is highly accurate for easy\n6\nand medium tasks; however, the accuracy decreases for more\ncomplex tasks. This is partially due to the LLMs being trained\non a general code corpus without specific network manage-\nment knowledge. An open question is how to develop domain-\nspecific program synthesis techniques capable of generating\nhigh-quality code for complex network management tasks,\nsuch as decomposing the task into simpler sub-tasks [56], in-\ncorporating application-specific plugins [42], or fine-tuning\nthe model with application-specific code examples.\nCode Comprehension and Validation. Ensuring correct-\nness and understanding LLM-generated code can be challeng-\ning for network operators. While general approaches like\nLLM-generated test cases [9] and code explanation [38] exist,\nthey are insufficient for complex tasks. Developing robust,\napplication-specific methods to aid comprehension and vali-\ndation is a crucial challenge.\nExpanding Benchmarks and Applications. Extending our\ncurrent benchmark to cover more network management tasks\nraises questions about broader effectiveness and applicability\nto other applications, such as network failure diagnosis [27,47]\nand configuration verification [5,17]. Addressing these chal-\nlenges requires exploring new network state representation,\ncode generation strategies, and application-specific libraries\nand plugins.\nIn summary, we take a pioneering step in introducing a\ngeneral framework to use LLMs in network management,\npresenting a new frontier for simplifying network operators\u2019\ntasks. We hope that our work, along with our benchmarks and\ndatasets, will stimulate continued exploration in this field.\n6\nReferences\n[1] R. Anil, A. M. Dai, O. Firat, M. Johnson, D. Lepikhin, A.

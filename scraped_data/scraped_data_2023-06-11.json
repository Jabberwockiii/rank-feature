We introduce MUSICGEN, a sin-\ngle Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete\nmusic representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MUSICGEN is comprised of\na single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns,\nwhich eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or up-\nsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MUSICGEN can generate\nhigh-quality samples, both mono and stereo, while being conditioned on textual\ndescription or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output.\nWe conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human\nstudies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a\nstandard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over\nthe importance of each of the components comprising MUSICGEN. Music samples,\ncode, and models are available at github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft.\n1\nIntroduction\nText-to-music is the task of generating musical pieces given text descriptions, e.g., \u201c90s rock song with\na guitar riff\u201d. Generating music is a challenging task as it requires modeling long range sequences.\nUnlike speech, music requires the use of the full frequency spectrum [M\u00fcller, 2015]. That means\nsampling the signal at a higher rate, i.e., the standard sampling rates of music recordings are 44.1\nkHz or 48 kHz vs. 16 kHz for speech. Moreover, music contains harmonies and melodies from\ndifferent instruments, which create complex structures. Human listeners are highly sensitive to\ndisharmony [Fedorenko et al., 2012, Norman-Haignere et al., 2019], hence generating music does not\nleave a lot of room for making melodic errors. Lastly, the ability to control the generation process in\na diverse set of methods, e.g., key, instruments, melody, genre, etc. is essential for music creators.\nRecent advances in self-supervised audio representation learning [Balestriero et al., 2023], sequential\nmodeling [Touvron et al., 2023], and audio synthesis [Tan et al., 2021] provide the conditions to\ndevelop such models. To make audio modeling more tractable, recent studies proposed representing\naudio signals as multiple streams of discrete tokens representing the same signal [D\u00e9fossez et al.,\n2022]. This allows both high-quality audio generation and effective audio modeling. However, this\ncomes at the cost of jointly modeling several parallel dependent streams.\nKharitonov et al. [2022], Kreuk et al. [2022] proposed modeling multi-streams of speech tokens in\nparallel following a delay approach, i.e., introduce offsets between the different streams. Agostinelli\net al. [2023] proposed representing musical segments using multiple sequences of discrete tokens at\ndifferent granularity and model them using a hierarchy of autoregressive models. In parallel, Donahue\net al. [2023] follows a similar approach but for the task of singing to accompaniment generation.\nRecently, Wang et al. [2023] proposed tackling this problem in two stages: (i) modeling the first\n\u2217Yossi Adi is Affiliated with both The Hebrew University of Jerusalem & MetaAI.\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2306.05284v3  [cs.SD]  30 Jan 2024\n0\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nt2\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ns1\nk2\nk3\nk4\nk1\ns2\ns3\ns4\ns5\ns\u2026\n0\n0\nt2\n0\n0\nt2\n0\n0\nt2\n0\n0\n0\ns6\ns7\ns8\n0\n0\n0\ntn\ns4n-3\n0\n0\ntn\n0\n0\ntn\n0\n0\ntn\n0\n0\n0\ns4n-2 s4n-1 s4n\nFlattening Pattern\n0\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\nt1\nt2\n0\nt1\nt2\nt3\nt1\nt2\nt3\nt4\nt2\nt3\nt4\nt5\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-4\ntn-3\ntn-2\ntn-1\ntn-3\ntn-2\ntn-1\ntn\ns1\nk2\nk3\nk4\nk1\ns2\ns3\ns4\ns5\ns\u2026\nsn-1\nsn\nt3\nt4\nt5\nt6\ns6\nDelay Pattern\nt1\nt1\nt1\nt1\nt2\nt2\nt2\nt2\nt3\nt3\nt3\nt3\nt4\nt4\nt4\nt4\nt5\nt5\nt5\nt5\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn\ntn\ntn\ntn\ns1\nk2\nk3\nk4\nk1\ns2\ns3\ns4\ns5\ns\u2026\nsn-1\nsn\nt6\nt6\nt6\nt6\ns6\nParallel Pattern\nResidual codebooks\nResidual codebooks\nResidual codebooks\nResidual codebooks\nSequence steps\nSequence steps\nSequence steps\nSequence steps\nCoarse First Pattern\n0\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\n0\nt2\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n0\n0\n0\ntn-1\nt1\nt1\nt1\n0\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn-1\n0\ntn\ntn\ntn\n0\ns1\nk2\nk3\nk4\nk1\ns2\ns\u2026\nsn-1\nsn+1\ns\u2026 s2n-1 s2n\nt2\nt2\nt2\n0\nsn+2\n0\n0\n0\ntn\nsn\n0\n0\n0\nt3\ns3\nt3\nt3\nt3\n0\nsn+3\nFigure 1: Codebook interleaving patterns presented in Section 2.2. Each time step t1, t2, . . . , tn is\ncomposed of 4 quantized values (corresponding to k1, . . . , k4). When doing autoregressive modelling,\nwe can flatten or interleave them in various ways, resulting in a new sequence with 4 parallel streams\nand steps s1, s2, . . . , sm. The total number of sequence steps S depends on the pattern and original\nnumber of steps T. 0 is a special token indicating empty positions in the pattern.\nstream of tokens only; (ii) then, apply a post-network to jointly model the rest of the streams in a\nnon-autoregressive manner.\nIn this work, we introduce MUSICGEN, a simple and controllable music generation model, which\nis able to generate high-quality music given textual description. We propose a general framework for\nmodeling multiple parallel streams of acoustic tokens, which serves as a generalization of previous\nstudies (see Figure 1). We show how this framework allows to extend generation to stereo audio at\nno extra computational cost. To improve controllability of the generated samples, we additionally\nintroduce unsupervised melody conditioning, which allows the model to generate music that matches\na given harmonic and melodic structure. We conduct an extensive evaluation of MUSICGEN and\nshow the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines by a large margin, with a subjective\nrating of 84.8 out of 100 for MUSICGEN against 80.5 for the best baseline. We additionally provide\nan ablation study which sheds light on the importance of each of the components on the overall model\nperformance. Lastly, human evaluation suggests that MUSICGEN yields high quality samples which\nare better melodically aligned with a given harmonic structure, while adhering to a textual description.\nOur contribution: (i) We introduce a simple and efficient model to generate high quality music at\n32 kHz. We show that MUSICGEN can generate consistent music with a single-stage language model\nthrough an efficient codebook interleaving strategy. (ii) We present a single model to perform both\ntext and melody-conditioned generation and demonstrate that the generated audio is coherent with\nthe provided melody and faithful to the text conditioning information. (iii) We provide extensive\nobjective and human evaluations on the key design choices behind our method.\n2\nMethod\nMUSICGEN consists in an autoregressive transformer-based decoder [Vaswani et al., 2017], condi-\ntioned on a text or melody representation. The (language) model is over the quantized units from\nan EnCodec [D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022] audio tokenizer, which provides high fidelity reconstruction\nfrom a low frame rate discrete representation. Compression models such as [D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022,\nZeghidour et al., 2021] employ Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) which results in several parallel\nstreams. Under this setting, each stream is comprised of discrete tokens originating from different\nlearned codebooks. Prior work, proposed several modeling strategies to handle this issue [Kharitonov\net al., 2022, Agostinelli et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023]. In this work, we introduce a novel modeling\nframework, which generalizes to various codebook interleaving patterns, and we explore several\n2\nvariants. Through patterns, we can leverage the internal structure of the quantized audio tokens.\nFinally, MUSICGEN supports conditional generation based on either text or melody.\n2.1\nAudio tokenization\nWe use EnCodec [D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022], a convolutional auto-encoder with a latent space quantized\nusing Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) [Zeghidour et al., 2021], and an adversarial reconstruction\nloss. Given a reference audio random variable X \u2208 Rd\u00b7fs with d the audio duration and fs the sample\nrate, EnCodec encodes it into a continuous tensor with a frame rate fr \u226a fs. This representation\nis then quantized into Q \u2208 {1, . . . , M}d\u00b7fr\u00d7K, with K being the number of codebooks used in RVQ\nand M being the codebook size. Notice, after quantization we are left with K parallel discrete tokens\nsequences, each of length T = d \u00b7 fr, representing the audio sample. In RVQ, each quantizer encodes\nthe quantization error left by the previous quantizer, thus quantized values for different codebooks\nare in general not independent, and the first codebook is the most important one.\n2.2\nCodebook interleaving patterns (see Figure 1)\nExact flattened autoregressive decomposition. An autoregressive model requires a discrete random\nsequence U \u2208 {1, . . . , M}S with S the sequence length. By convention, we will take U0 = 0,\na deterministic special token indicating the beginning of the sequence. We can then model the\ndistribution\n\u2200t > 0, pt (Ut\u22121, . . . , U0) \u225c P [Ut|Ut\u22121, . . . , U0] .\n(1)\nLet us build a second sequence of random variables \u02dcU using the auto-regressive density p, e.g. we\ndefine recursively \u02dcU0 = 0, and for all t > 0,\n\u2200t > 0, P\nh\n\u02dcUt| \u02dcUt\u22121 . . . , \u02dcU0\ni\n= pt\n\u0010\n\u02dcUt\u22121, . . . , \u02dcU0\n\u0011\n.\n(2)\nThen, we immediately have that U and \u02dcU follow the same distribution. This means that if we can fit a\nperfect estimate \u02c6p of p with a deep learning model, then we can fit exactly the distribution of U.\nAs stated before, the main issue with the representation Q we obtained from the EnCodec model is\nthat there are K codebooks for each time step. One solution would be to flatten out Q, thus taking\nS = d \u00b7 fr \u00b7 K, e.g. first predicting the first codebook of the first time step, then the second codebook\nof the first time step, etc. Then, using eq. (1) and eq. (2), we could theoretically fit an exact model\nof the distribution of Q. The downside however is the increased complexity, with part of the gain\ncoming from the lowest sample rate fr being lost.\nMore than one possible flattening exists, and not all the \u02c6pt functions need to be estimated through a\nsingle model. For instance, MusicLM [Agostinelli et al., 2023] uses two models, one modeling the\nflattened first K/2 codebooks, and a second one the other K/2 flattened codebooks, conditioned on\nthe decision of the first model. In that case, the number of autoregressive steps is still dfr \u00b7 K.\nInexact autoregressive decomposition. Another possibility is to consider an autoregressive de-\ncomposition, where some codebooks are predicted in parallel. For instance, let us define another\nsequence with V0 = 0 and for all t \u2208 {1, . . . , T}, k \u2208 {1, . . . , K}, Vt,k = Qt,k. When dropping the\ncodebook index k, e.g. Vt, we mean the concatenation of all the codebooks at time t.\npt,k (Vt\u22121, . . . , V0) \u225c P [Vt,k|Vt\u22121, \u00b7, . . . , V0] .\n(3)\nLet\u2019s define again recursively \u02dcV0 = 0 and for all t > 0,\n\u2200t > 0, \u2200k, P\nh\n\u02dcVt,k\ni\n= pt,k\n\u0010\n\u02dcVt\u22121, . . . , \u02dcV0\n\u0011\n.\n(4)\nUnlike in (2), we no longer have in the general case that \u02dcV follows the same distribution as V ,\neven assuming we have access to the exact distribution pt,k. In fact, we would only have a proper\ngenerative model if for all t, (Vt,k)k are independent conditionally on Vt\u22121, . . . , V0. As t increases,\nthe errors will compound and the two distributions can grow further apart. Such a decomposition\nis inexact, but allows to keep the original frame rate which can considerably speed up training and\ninference, especially for long sequences.\n3\nArbitrary codebook interleaving patterns. In order to experiment with various such decompositions,\nand measure exactly the impact of using an inexact decomposition, we introduce codebook interleav-\ning patterns. Let us consider \u2126 = {(t, k) : {1, . . . , d \u00b7 fr}, k \u2208 {1, . . . , K}} be the set of all pairs of\ntime steps and codebook indexes. A codebook pattern is a sequence P = (P0, P1, P2, . . . , PS), with\nP0 = \u2205, and for all 0 < s \u2264 S, Ps \u2282 \u2126, such that P is partition of \u2126. We model Q by predicting in\nparallel all the positions in Ps, conditionally on all the positions in P0, P1, . . . , Ps\u22121. Pragmatically,\nwe restrict ourselves to patterns where each codebook index appears at most once in any of the Ps.\nWe can now easily define a number of decompositions, for instance the \u201cparallel\u201d pattern given by\nPs = {(s, k) : k \u2208 {1, . . . , K}}.\n(5)\nIt is also possible to introduce a \u201cdelay\u201d between the codebooks, as in Kharitonov et al. [2022], e.g.,\nPs = {(s \u2212 k + 1, k) : k \u2208 {1, . . . , K}, s \u2212 k \u2265 0}.\n(6)\nThrough empirical evaluations, we show the benefits and drawbacks of various codebook patterns,\nshedding light on the importance of exact modeling of the parallel codebook sequences.\n2.3\nModel conditioning\nText conditioning. Given a textual description matching the input audio X, we compute a condi-\ntioning tensor C \u2208 RTC\u00d7D with D being the inner dimension used in the autoregressive model.\nGenerally, there are three main approaches for representing text for conditional audio generation.\nKreuk et al. [2022] proposed using a pretrained text encoder, specifically T5 [Raffel et al., 2020].\nChung et al. [2022] show that using instruct-based language models provide superior performance.\nLastly, Agostinelli et al. [2023], Liu et al. [2023], Huang et al. [2023a], Sheffer and Adi [2023]\nclaimed that joint text-audio representation, such as CLAP [Wu* et al., 2023], provides better-quality\ngenerations. We experiment with all of the above, respectively: T5 encoder, FLAN-T5, and CLAP.\nMelody conditioning. While text is the prominent approach in conditional generative models\nnowadays, a more natural approach for music is conditioning on a melodic structure from another\naudio track or even whistling or humming. Such an approach also allows for an iterative refinement\nof the model\u2019s output. To support that, we experiment with controlling the melodic structure via\njointly conditioning on the input\u2019s chromagram and text description. In preliminary experiments, we\nobserved that conditioning on the raw chromagram often led to reconstructing the original sample,\nresulting in overfitting. To reduce it, we introduce an information bottleneck by choosing the dominant\ntime-frequency bin in each time step. While a similar capability was shown in Agostinelli et al.\n[2023], the authors used supervised proprietary data, which is tedious and costly to collect. In this\nwork, we take an unsupervised approach, eliminating the requirement for supervised data.\n2.4\nModel architecture\nCodebook projection and positional embedding. Given a codebook pattern, only some codebooks\nare present at each pattern step Ps. We retrieve from Q the values corresponding to the indices in Ps.\nAs noted in Section 2.2, each codebook is present at most once in Ps or not at all. If it is present,\nwe use a learned embedding table with N entries and dimension D to represent the associated value\nfrom Q. Otherwise, we use a special token indicating its absence. We sum the contribution from each\ncodebook after this transformation. As P0 = \u2205, the first input is always the sum of all the special\ntokens. Finally, we sum a sinusoidal embedding to encode the current step s [Vaswani et al., 2017].\nTransformer decoder. The input is fed into a transformer with L layers and a dimension D. Each\nlayer consists of a causal self-attention block. We then use a cross-attention block that is fed with the\nconditioning signal C. When using melody conditioning, we instead provide the conditioning tensor\nC as a prefix to the transformer input. The layer ends with a fully connected block consisting of a\nlinear layer from D to 4\u00b7D channels, a ReLU, and a linear layer back to D channels. The attention and\nfully connected blocks are wrapped with a residual skip connection. Layer normalization [Ba et al.,\n2016] is applied to each block before being summed with the residual skip connection (\u201cpre-norm\u201d).\nLogits prediction. The output from the transformer decoder at pattern step Ps is transformed into\nlogits prediction for the values of Q taken at the indices given by Ps+1. Each codebook is present at\nmost once in Ps+1. If a codebook is present, the logits prediction is obtained by applying a codebook\nspecific linear layer from D channels to N.\n4\n3\nExperimental setup\n3.1\nModels and hyperparameters\nAudio tokenization model. We use a non-causal five layers EnCodec model for 32 kHz monophonic\naudio with a stride of 640, resulting in a frame rate of 50 Hz, and an initial hidden size of 64, doubling\nat each of the model\u2019s five layers. The embeddings are quantized with a RVQ with four quantizers,\neach with a codebook size of 2048. We follow D\u00e9fossez et al. [2022] to train the model on one-second\naudio segments cropped at random in the audio sequence.\nTransformer model. We train autoregressive transformer models at different sizes: 300M, 1.5B,\n3.3B parameters. We use a memory efficient Flash attention [Dao et al., 2022] from the xFormers\npackage [Lefaudeux et al., 2022] to improve both speed and memory usage with long sequences. We\nstudy the impact of the size of the model in Section 4. We use the 300M-parameter model for all of\nour ablations. We train on 30-second audio crops sampled at random from the full track. We train\nthe models for 1M steps with the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017], a batch size of\n192 examples, \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.95, a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping of 1.0.\nWe further rely on D-Adaptation based automatic step-sizes [Defazio and Mishchenko, 2023] for the\n300M model as it improves model convergence but showed no gain for the bigger models. We use\na cosine learning rate schedule with a warmup of 4000 steps. Additionally, we use an exponential\nmoving average with a decay of 0.99. We train the 300M, 1.5B and 3.3B parameter models, using\nrespectively 32, 64 and 96 GPUs, with mixed precision. More specifically, we use float16 as bfloat16\nwas leading to instabilities in our setup. Finally, for sampling, we employ top-k sampling [Fan et al.,\n2018] with keeping the top 250 tokens and a temperature of 1.0.\nText preprocessing. Kreuk et al. [2022] proposed a text normalization scheme, in which stop words\nare omitted and the remaining text is lemmatized. We denote this method by text-normalization.\nWhen considering musical datasets, additional annotations tags such as musical key, tempo, type\nof instruments, etc. are often available. We also experiment with concatenating such annotations\nto the text description. We denote this approach by condition-merging. Finally, we explored using\nword dropout as another text augmentation strategy. For the final models, we used condition-merging\nwith a probability of 0.25. Upon merging, we apply a text description dropout with a probability of\n0.5. We use a word dropout with a probability of 0.3 on the resulting text. A full comparison of the\ndifferent text preprocessing strategies can be found in Appendix A.2.\nCodebook patterns and conditioning. We use the \u201cdelay\u201d interleaving pattern from Section 2.2,\nThis translates 30 seconds of audio into 1500 autoregressive steps. For text conditioning, we use\nthe T5 [Raffel et al., 2020] text encoder, optionally with the addition of the melody conditioning\npresented in Section 2.3. We also experiment with FLAN-T5 [Chung et al., 2022], and CLAP [Wu*\net al., 2023] and compare the performance of MUSICGEN using each of these text encoders in the\nAppendix A.2. For melody conditioning, we compute the chromagrams with a window size of 214\nand a hop size of 212. Using a large window prevents the model from recovering fine temporal\ndetails. We further quantize the chromagram by taking the argmax at each time step. We follow a\nsimilar approach to Kreuk et al. [2022] and implement classifier-free guidance when sampling from\nthe model\u2019s logits. Specifically, during training we drop the condition with a probability of 0.2 and\nduring inference we use a guidance scale of 3.0.\n3.2\nDatasets\nTraining datasets. We use 20K hours of licensed music to train MUSICGEN. Specifically, we rely on\nan internal dataset of 10K high-quality music tracks, and on the ShutterStock and Pond5 music data\ncollections2 with respectively 25K and 365K instrument-only music tracks. All datasets consist of\nfull-length music sampled at 32 kHz with metadata composed of a textual description and information\nsuch as the genre, BPM, and tags. We downmix the audio to mono unless stated otherwise.\nEvaluation datasets. For the main results and comparison with prior work, we evaluate the proposed\nmethod on the MusicCaps benchmark [Agostinelli et al., 2023]. MusicCaps is composed of 5.5K\nsamples (ten-second long) prepared by expert musicians and a 1K subset balanced across genres. We\nreport objective metrics on the unbalanced set, while we sample examples from the genre-balanced\n2www.shutterstock.com/music and www.pond5.com\n5\nTable 1: Text-to-Music generation. We compare objective and subjective metrics for MUSICGEN\nagainst a number of baselines. We report both mean and CI95 scores. The Mousai model is retrained\non the same dataset, while for MusicLM we use the public API for human studies. We report the\noriginal FAD on MusicCaps for Noise2Music and MusicLM. \u201cMUSICGEN w. random melody\u201d refers\nto MUSICGEN trained with chromagram and text. At evaluation time, we sample the chromagrams at\nrandom from a held-out set.\nMUSICCAPS Test Set\nMODEL\nFADvgg \u2193\nKL \u2193\nCLAPscr \u2191\nOVL. \u2191\nREL. \u2191\nRiffusion\n14.8\n2.06\n0.19\n79.31\u00b11.37\n74.20\u00b12.17\nMousai\n7.5\n1.59\n0.23\n76.11\u00b11.56\n77.35\u00b11.72\nMusicLM\n4.0\n-\n-\n80.51\u00b11.07\n82.35\u00b11.36\nNoise2Music\n2.1\n-\n-\n-\n-\nMUSICGEN w.o melody (300M)\n3.1\n1.28\n0.31\n78.43\u00b11.30\n81.11\u00b11.31\nMUSICGEN w.o melody (1.5B)\n3.4\n1.23\n0.32\n80.74\u00b11.17\n83.70\u00b11.21\nMUSICGEN w.o melody (3.3B)\n3.8\n1.22\n0.31\n84.81\u00b10.95\n82.47\u00b11.25\nMUSICGEN w. random melody (1.5B)\n5.0\n1.31\n0.28\n81.30\u00b11.29\n81.98\u00b11.79\nset for qualitative evaluations. For melody evaluation and the ablation studies, we use samples from\nan in-domain held out evaluation set of 528 music tracks, with no artist overlap with the training set.\n3.3\nEvaluation\nBaselines. We compare MUSICGEN to two baselines for text-to-music generation: Riffusion [Fors-\ngren and Martiros] and Mousai [Schneider et al., 2023]. We use the open source Riffusion model\nto run inference 3. For Mousai, we train a model using our dataset for a fair comparison, using the\nopen source implementation provided by the authors4. Additionally, when possible, we compare to\nMusicLM [Agostinelli et al., 2023] and Noise2Music [Huang et al., 2023b].\nEvaluation metrics. We evaluate the proposed method using objective and subjective metrics. For\nthe objective methods, we use three metrics: the Fr\u00e9chet Audio Distance (FAD), the Kullback-Leiber\nDivergence (KL) and the CLAP score (CLAP). We report the FAD [Kilgour et al., 2018] using the\nofficial implementation in Tensorflow with the VGGish model 5. A low FAD score indicates the\ngenerated audio is plausible. Following Kreuk et al. [2022], we use a state-of-the-art audio classifier\ntrained for classification on AudioSet [Koutini et al., 2021] to compute the KL-divergence over the\nprobabilities of the labels between the original and the generated music. The generated music is\nexpected to share similar concepts with the reference music when the KL is low. Last, the CLAP\nscore [Wu* et al., 2023, Huang et al., 2023a] is computed between the track description and the\ngenerated audio to quantify audio-text alignment, using the official pretrained CLAP model 6.\nFor the human studies, we follow the same setup as in Kreuk et al. [2022]. We ask human raters to\nevaluate two aspects of the audio samples (i) overall quality (OVL), and (ii) relevance to the text input\n(REL). For the overall quality test, raters were asked to rate the perceptual quality of the provided\nsamples in a range of 1 to 100. For the text relevance test, raters were asked to rate the match between\naudio and text on a scale of 1 to 100. Raters were recruited using the Amazon Mechanical Turk\nplatform. We evaluate randomly sampled files, where each sample was evaluated by at least 5 raters.\nWe use the CrowdMOS package7 to filter noisy annotations and outliers. We remove annotators who\ndid not listen to the full recordings, annotators who rate the reference recordings less than 85, and the\nrest of the recommended recipes from CrowdMOS [Ribeiro et al., 2011]. For fairness, all samples\nare normalized at \u221214dB LUFS [ITU-R, 2017].\n3Using riffusion-model-v1 from github.com/riffusion/riffusion-app (on May 10, 2023)\n4Implementation from github.com/archinetai/audio-diffusion-pytorch (March 2023)\n5github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/frechet_audio_distance\n6https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP\n7http://www.crowdmos.org/download/\n6\nTable 2: We report cosine similarity between reference and generated melody (SIM.) and subjective\nmetrics including alignment with the melody (MEL.).

Next, we evaluate the ability of the proposed method\nto generate music conditioned on melodic features. We further show how to simply extend our\ncodebook patterns for stereo audio generation. We conclude with an ablation study. Music samples,\ncode, and models are available at github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft.\n4.1\nComparison with the baselines\nTable 1 presents the comparison of the proposed method against Mousai, Riffusion, MusicLM,\nand Noise2Music. As there is no official implementation of Noise2Music, nor pre-trained model,\nwe report only FAD on MusicCaps, which is reported in the Noise2Music manuscript. Similarly,\nMusicLM implementation is not public. We use the MusicLM public demo8 for our subjective tests\nwhile reporting the FAD as reported by the authors. While the original MusicLM model is trained\non data with vocals, the model behind the API is instrument-only. For the human study, we restrict\nourselves to 40 instrument-only samples from MusicCaps. To prevent leakage in MUSICGEN trained\nwith chromagram, we sample chromagrams at random from a held-out set during test time.\nResults suggest that MUSICGEN performs better than the evaluated baselines as evaluated by human\nlisteners, both in terms of audio quality and adherence to the provided text description. Noise2Music\nperforms the best in terms of FAD on MusicCaps, followed by MUSICGEN trained with text condi-\ntioning. Interestingly, adding a melody conditioning degrades the objective metrics, however, it does\nnot significantly affect human ratings, while still being superior to the evaluated baselines.\nWe notice that for the worst rated model, the FAD is correlated with the overall subjective rating,\nbut it is not the case for the best rated models. We noticed that a large number of samples in\nMusicCaps [Agostinelli et al., 2023] contains a description stating that the recording is \"noisy\". It is\npossible that due to those noisy samples, improvements in the quality of the generated audio might\ndeteriorate the FAD on MusicCaps once a certain quality threshold is achieved.\n4.2\nMelody evaluation\nWe evaluate MUSICGEN, conditioned jointly on textual and melodic representations, using objective\nand subjective metric on the held out evaluation set. For the objective evaluation, we introduce a\nnew metric: chroma cosine-similarity, which measures the average cosine-similarity between frames\ncorresponding to the same time steps, taken from the quantized chroma of the reference and the\ngenerated samples. We evaluate using 1000 randomly sampled files from a held-out set. To better\nevaluate the relation between the conditioned melody to the generated music, we introduce another\nhuman study. To that end, we present human raters with a reference musical piece, followed by a set\nof generated pieces. For each generated sample, the listeners are asked to rate how well the melody\nof the generated piece matches that of the reference on a scale of 1 to 100. We use 40 samples of\n10 seconds at random from the held-out set. Results are reported in Table 2. Results suggest that\nMUSICGEN trained with chromagram conditioning successfully generates music that follows a given\nmelody. Thus, allowing for better control over the generated output. Interestingly, MUSICGEN is\nrobust to dropping the chroma at inference time with both OVL. and REL. staying roughly the same.\n8https://blog.google/technology/ai/musiclm-google-ai-test-kitchen/\n7\n0\n0\n0\nt1\n0\n0\nt1\nt2\n0\nt1\nt2\nt3\nt1\nt2\nt3\nt4\nt2\nt3\nt4\nt5\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-4\ntn-3\ntn-2\ntn-1\ntn-3\ntn-2\ntn-1\ntn\ns1\nk1_R\nk2_L\nk2_R\nk1_L\ns2\ns3\ns4\ns5\ns\u2026\nsn-1\nsn\nt3\nt4\nt5\nt6\ns6\nStereo Delay Pattern\nResidual codebooks\nSequence steps\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nt1\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-8\ntn-7\ntn-6\ntn-5\ntn-7\ntn-6\ntn-5\ntn-4\nk3_R\nk4_L\nk4_R\nk3_L\n0\n0\n0\nt2\n0\n0\nt1\nt1\nt1\nt1\nt2\nt2\nt2\nt2\nt3\nt3\nt3\nt3\nt4\nt4\nt4\nt4\nt5\nt5\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-2\ntn-2\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn-1\ntn\ntn\ns1\nk1_R\nk2_L\nk2_R\nk1_L\ns2\ns3\ns4\ns5\ns\u2026\nsn-1\nsn\nt5\nt5\nt6\nt6\ns6\nStereo Partial Delay Pattern\nResidual codebooks\nSequence steps\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nt1\nt1\nt1\nt1\nt2\nt2\nt2\nt2\nt3\nt3\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\ntn-4\ntn-4\ntn-3\ntn-3\ntn-3\ntn-3\ntn-2\ntn-2\nk3_R\nk4_L\nk4_R\nk3_L\nt3\nt3\nt4\nt4\n(a) Visualizing codebook patterns for stereo models with two pos-\nsible interleaving of the left (blue) and right (red) codebooks.

We use the same EnCodec\ntokenizer, which we applied independently to the left and right channels, providing 2 \u00b7 K = 8\ncodebooks per frame. Starting from a pre-trained monophonic MUSICGEN model, we fine tune\nit for 200K batches the same dataset with stereo audio. We reuse the \u201cdelay\u201d pattern, with two\npossible variations: (i) \u201cstereo delay\u201d introduces a delay between the left and right channels for\nthe same codebook level, while (ii) \u201cstereo partial delay\u201d apply the same delay to the left and right\nchannel codebooks for a given level, as depicted in Figure 2a. Note that using this simple strategy,\nwe can generate stereo audio at no extra computational cost. We provide in Table 3 the subjective\nevaluations for those models. We notice that when downmixing the stereo output to mono, we are\nalmost equivalent in perceived quality to a mono model. Stereo audio was overall rated higher than\nthe mono counterpart, and the \u201cstereo partial delay\u201d benefits from a small boost both in overall quality\nand text relevance compared with the \u201cstereo delay\u201d pattern.\n4.4\nAblation\nThis section provides an ablation study for the different codebook patterns, together with results\nfor model scales and a memorization study. Additionally, we present results for different text\naugmentation strategies, text encoders, and audio tokenization models in Appendix A.2. All ablations\nare performed using 1K samples of 30 seconds, randomly sampled from the held-out evaluation set.\nThe effect of the codebook interleaving patterns. We evaluate various codebook patterns using the\nframework from Section 2.2, with K = 4, given by the audio tokenization model. Table 1 reports\nresults with the \u201cdelay\u201d pattern. The \u201cpartial delay\u201d consists in delaying by the same amount the\ncodebooks 2, 3, and 4. The \u201cparallel\u201d pattern predicts all the codebooks from the same time step in\nparallel. The \u201ccoarse first\u201d pattern first predicts codebook 1 for all steps, then predicts in parallel\ncodebooks 2, 3, and 4. Thus, this pattern has twice the steps compared to other patterns. \u201cPartial\n8\nTable 4: Codebook patterns. We compare different codebook interleaving patterns on 30-seconds,\naudio sequences. The \u201cflattening\u201d pattern achieves the best scores. The \u201cdelay\u201d and \u201cpartial flattening\u201d\npatterns achieve similar scores, while \u201cparallel\u201d obtains worse scores.\nIn Domain Test Set\nCONFIGURATION\nNb. steps\nFADvgg \u2193\nKL \u2193\nCLAPscr \u2191\nOVL. \u2191\nREL. \u2191\nDelay\n1500\n0.96\n0.52\n0.35\n79.69\u00b11.46\n79.67\u00b11.41\nPartial delay\n1500\n1.51\n0.54\n0.32\n79.13\u00b11.56\n79.67\u00b11.46\nParallel\n1500\n2.58\n0.62\n0.27\n72.21\u00b12.49\n80.30\u00b11.43\nPartial flattening\n3000\n1.32\n0.54\n0.34\n78.56\u00b11.86\n79.18\u00b11.49\nCoarse first\n3000\n1.98\n0.56\n0.30\n74.42\u00b12.28\n76.55\u00b11.67\nFlattening\n6000\n0.86\n0.51\n0.37\n79.71\u00b11.58\n82.03\u00b11.1\nTable 5: Model scale.

In terms of\nobjective metrics we observe a continuous improvement of the metrics, although subjective quality\nstop improving at 1.5B parameters.

Finally, the \u201cflattening\u201d pattern consists in flattening\nall the codebooks, similar to MusicLM [Agostinelli et al., 2023]. We report objective and subjective\nevaluations in Table 4. While flattening improves generation, it comes at a high computational cost\nand similar performance can be reached for a fraction of this cost using a simple delay approach.\nThe effect of model size. In Table 5 we report results for different model sizes, namely 300M, 1.5B,\nand 3.3B parameter models. As expected, scaling the model size results in better scores, however this\ncomes at the expense of longer training and inference time. Regarding subjective evaluations, the\noverall quality is optimal at 1.5B, but a larger model can better understand the text prompt.\nMemorization experiment. Following [Agostinelli et al., 2023], we analyze the memorization\nabilities of MUSICGEN. We only consider the first stream of codebooks from MUSICGEN as it\ncontains the coarser-grain information. We randomly select N = 20, 000 examples from our training\nset and for each one we feed the model with a prompt of EnCodec codebooks corresponding to the\noriginal audio and the conditioning information. We generate a continuation of 250 audio tokens (5\nsecond-long audio) using greedy decoding. We report exact matches as the fraction of examples for\nwhich the generated audio tokens and source audio tokens are identical over the whole sequence. In\naddition, we report partial matches as the fraction of the training examples for which the generated\nand source sequences have at least 80% of the audio tokens matching. We present the memorization\nresults for the different model sizes when varying the length of the audio prompt in Figure 2b.\n5\nRelated work\nAudio representation. In recent years, the prominent approach is to represent the music signals in a\ncompressed representation, discrete or continuous, and apply a generative model on top of it. Lakhotia\net al. [2021] proposed quantizing speech representation using k-means to construct speech language\nmodels. Recently, D\u00e9fossez et al. [2022], Zeghidour et al. [2021] proposed to apply a VQ-VAE\ndirectly on the raw waveform using residual vector quantization. Later, several studies used such\nrepresentation for text-to-audio generation. Next, we discuss the recent research in audio generation.\nMusic generation. Music generation has been long studied under various setups. Dong et al. [2018]\nproposed a GAN-based approach for symbolic music generation. Bassan et al. [2022] proposed an\nunsupervised segmentation for symbolic music which can be later used for generation. Ycart et al.\n9\n[2017] proposed modeling polyphonic music modeling using recurrent neural networks. Ji et al.\n[2020] conducted a comprehensive survey therein for deep learning methods for music generation.\nDhariwal et al. [2020] proposed representing music samples in multiple streams of discrete represen-\ntations using a hierarchical VQ-VAE. Next, two sparse transformers applied over the sequences to\ngenerate music. Gan et al. [2020] proposed generating music for a given video, while predicting its\nmidi notes. Recently, Agostinelli et al. [2023] proposed representing music using multiple streams\nof \u201csemantic tokens\u201d and \u201cacoustic tokens\u201d. Then, they applied a cascade of transformer decoders\nconditioned on a textual-music joint representation [Huang et al., 2022]. Donahue et al. [2023]\nfollowed a similar modeling approach, but for the task of singing-to-accompaniment generation.\nAn alternative approach is using diffusion models. Schneider et al. [2023], Huang et al. [2023b],\nMaina [2023], Forsgren and Martiros proposed using a latent diffusion model for the task of\ntext-to-music. Schneider et al. [2023] proposed using diffusion models for both audio encoder-decoder\nand latent generation. Huang et al. [2023b] proposed a cascade of diffusion model to generate\naudio and gradually increase its sampling rate. Forsgren and Martiros proposed fine-tuning Stable\nDiffusion Rombach et al. [2022] using spectrograms to generate five-second segments, then, using\nimage-to-image mapping and latent interpolation to generate long sequences.\nAudio generation. Several studies were proposed for text-to-audio (environmental sounds) genera-\ntion. Yang et al. [2022] proposed representing audio spectrograms using a VQ-VAE, then applying a\ndiscrete diffusion model conditioned on textual CLIP embeddings for the generation part [Radford\net al., 2021]. Kreuk et al. [2022] proposed applying a transformer language model over discrete audio\nrepresentation, obtained by quantizing directly time-domain signals using EnCodec [D\u00e9fossez et al.,\n2022]. Sheffer and Adi [2023] followed a similar approach to Kreuk et al. [2022] for image-to-audio\ngeneration. Huang et al. [2023a], Liu et al. [2023] proposed using latent diffusion models for the task\nof text-to-audio, while extending it to various other tasks such as inpainting, image-to-audio, etc.\n6\nDiscussion\nWe introduced MUSICGEN, a state-of-the-art single stage controllable music generation model that\ncan be conditioned on text and melody. We demonstrated that simple codebook interleaving strategies\ncan be used to achieve high quality generation, even in stereo, while reducing the number of autore-\ngressive time steps compared to the flattening approach. We provided a comprehensive study of the\nimpact of model sizes, conditioning methods, and text pre-processing techniques. We also introduced\na simple chromagram-based conditioning for controlling the melody of the generated audio.\nLimitations Our simple generation method does not allow us to have fine-grained control over\nadherence of the generation to the conditioning, we rely mostly on CF guidance. Also, while it\nis relatively straightforward to do data augmentation for text conditioning, conditioning on audio\nwarrants further research on data augmentation, types and amount of guidance.\nBroader impact. Large scale generative models present ethical challenges. We first ensured that\nall the data we trained on was covered by legal agreements with the right holders, in particular\nthrough an agreement with ShutterStock. A second aspect is the potential lack of diversity in the\ndataset we used, which contains a larger proportion of western-style music. However, we believe\nthe simplification we operate in this work, e.g., using a single stage language model and a reduced\nnumber of auto-regressive steps, can help broaden the applications to new datasets. Generative\nmodels can represent an unfair competition for artists, which is an open problem. Open research can\nensure that all actors have equal access to these models. Through the development of more advanced\ncontrols, such as the melody conditioning we introduced, we hope that such models can become\nuseful both to music amateurs and professionals.\nAcknowledgements.\nThe authors would like to thank Mary Williamson, Rashel Moritz and Joelle Pineau for supporting\nthis project, thank Justin Luk, Prash Jain, Sidd Srinivasan, Rod Duenes, and Philip Woods for the\ndataset, and thank the xformers team: Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, and Michael Ramamonjisoa\nfor the technical discussions.\nAuthors note.

The \u201cpartial delay\u201d pattern consists in delaying by the same\namount the codebooks 2, 3, and 4, in our case we use a delay of 1. The total number of steps of the\ninterleave sequences is N (excluding the last step for simplicity).\nA.1\nExperimental details\nCodebook interleaving patterns. Figure A.1 provides a visual description of the additional codebook\npatterns introduced for the ablation in Section 4, namely \u201cpartial flattening\u201d and \u201cpartial delay\u201d\npatterns. The intuition behind such patterns is driven by the fact that the first codebook from RVQ is\nthe most important one and predicting the rest of the codebooks in parallel would allow to limit the\nintroduced flattening or delay while maintaining good modeling performance.\nMelody conditioning. In this work, we provide an unsupervised approach for melody conditioning\nthrough conditioning on the chromagram representation. As shown in Figure A.2, chromagram-based\nconditioning successfully preserves the melodic structure when generating novel music samples.\nIn preliminary experiments, we noticed that the chromagram tends to be dominated by the lower\nfrequency instruments, mainly by the drums and bass. To mitigate that, we used Demucs [D\u00e9fossez\net al., 2019] to first decompose the reference track into four components: drums, bass, vocals, and\nother. Next, we omit the drums and bass to recover the melodic structure of the residual waveform.\nFinally, we extract the quantized chromagram to create the conditioning that is later fed to the model.\nDistribution of genres. We provide in Figure A.3 a histogram of the top 50 musical genres present\nin the dataset. We notice a clear dominance of the Dance/EDM genre, which in our experience is\nalso one of the genres that is best generated by MUSICGEN. While we tried to explore a number\nof resampling scheme to boost the importance of other genres, we observed that oversampling less\nrepresented genres would often lead to a worse model overall.\nA.2\nAdditional experimental results\nWe provide further ablation studies on the core components of MUSICGEN, namely the text encoder\nused for text conditioning described in Section 2.3, text augmentation strategies presented in Sec-\ntion 3.1, and the used audio tokenization model. We report results on the MusicCaps dataset to\nbetter understand out-of-domain generalization abilities of the different approaches. Finally, we share\nadditional experimental results on optimization methods.\nThe effect of text encoder. We investigate the impact of the text encoder, comparing three different\nencoders: T5 [Raffel et al., 2020] 9, Flan-T5 [Chung et al., 2022]10 and CLAP [Wu* et al., 2023] 11\nwith a quantization bottleneck. For the CLAP-based encoder, similarly to Agostinelli et al. [2023]\nwe rely on the music embeddings during training and the text embeddings at inference time and\n9https://huggingface.co/t5-base\n10https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base\n11https://huggingface.co/lukewys/laion_clap/blob/main/music_audioset_epoch_15_esc_\n90.14.pt\n14\nTable A.1: Text encoder results. We report results for T5, Flan-T5, and CLAP as text encoders.\nWe observe similar results for T5 and Flan-T5 on all the objective metrics. Note that T5 is the text\nencoder used for the main MUSICGEN models. CLAP encoder performs consistently worse on all\nthe metrics but CLAP score. All comparisons are done with a 300M MUSICGEN model using text\nconditioning only.\nMUSICCAPS Test Set\nMODEL\nFADvgg \u2193\nKL \u2193\nCLAPscr \u2191\nOVL. \u2191\nREL. \u2191\nT5\n3.12\n1.29\n0.31\n85.04\u00b11.23\n87.33\u00b11.9\nFlan-T5\n3.36\n1.30\n0.32\n85.54\u00b11.01\n85.00\u00b11.63\nCLAP\n4.16\n1.36\n0.35\n82.13\u00b11.29\n83.56\u00b11.54\nCLAP (no normalization)\n4.14\n1.38\n0.35\n84.87\u00b11.25\n85.06\u00b11.72\nCLAP (no quantization)\n5.07\n1.37\n0.37\n84.13\u00b11.02\n84.67\u00b11.42\nTable A.2: Text augmentations strategies results. We report objective metrics using only the original\ntext description (no augmentation) and for different text augmentation strategies: using condition\nmerging to augment the text description with metadata, using text-normalization (text-norm.) and\napplying word dropout on the resulting text. We use 300M MUSICGEN models trained for 500K\nsteps. Condition merging improves the result over training only over the original text description.\nOther augmentations perform worst on all metrics.

More specifically, we first normalize the\nembeddings and use RVQ with 12 quantizers, each with a codebook size of 1024. Quantizing the\nCLAP embeddings leads to a homogeneous representation with the discrete tokens further reducing\nthe gap between the audio encoding used at train time and text encoding at test time. We report\nresults for the different text encoders in Table A.1. Both T5 and Flan-T5 perform similarly in terms\nof objective metrics, the overall quality being slighly better for T5. The CLAP-based model however\nsuffers worse objective and subjective metrics, with the exception of the CLAP score which rely on\nthe same underlying audio and text encoder.\nThe effect of text augmentations. We examine the impact of text augmentation strategies for the\nproposed method. In particular, we study the use of condition merging (i.e. concatenating additional\nmetadata to the text description), text normalization (text-norm.) and word dropout. We report\nobjective metrics for the different augmentation strategies in Table A.2. We observe a gain in FAD\nand KL when leveraging the additional metadata with condition merging. However, neither text\nnormalization or word dropout improves the results in terms of objective metrics.\nThe effect of the audio tokenizer. We experiment with replacing EnCodec with Descript Audio\nCodec (DAC) [Kumar et al., 2023]12, a similar audio compression models, that uses a different\ntraining set, a similar adversarial loss enhanced with multiband discriminators, but performs\nquantization in a lower dimension space to improve codebook usage. DAC compresses audio at\n44.1 kHz with 9 codebooks, and a framerate of 86 Hz. We trained a small (300M parameters) and\na medium (1.5B parameters) MUSICGEN model using both DAC and EnCodec as an audio tokenizer,\non a vocal-free version of our dataset. The results provided in Table A.3 show a worse FAD and\nKL on our in domain test set. On MusicCaps, the FAD is improved by using DAC, although the KL\nis worse, as well as the subjective evaluations. The EnCodec model used in this work was specifically\n12Using the public implementation github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec.\n15\nTable A.3: We test replacing EnCodec with DAC [Kumar et al., 2023] using their implementation.\nDAC is a 44.1 kHz model with 9 codebooks and a frame rate of 86 Hz. Those models are trained on\na vocal-free version of our dataset, hence the objective metrics will not match those reported in the\nother tables. We report objective metrics both on our in domain test set and MusicCaps [Agostinelli\net al., 2023], and subjective metrics only on MusicCaps.\nIn Domain Test Set\nMUSICCAPS Test Set\nMODEL\nFADvgg \u2193\nKL \u2193\nFADvgg \u2193\nKL \u2193\nOVL. \u2191\nMUSICGEN + DAC small\n3.45\n0.58\n4.46\n1.35\n83.32\u00b10.95\nMUSICGEN + DAC medium\n2.42\n0.57\n4.32\n1.30\n84.46\u00b10.97\nMUSICGEN + EnCodec small\n0.67\n0.54\n5.26\n1.27\n84.69\u00b10.90\nMUSICGEN + EnCodec medium\n0.49\n0.52\n5.05\n1.23\n86.09\u00b10.88\ndesigned to operate at a lower frame rate (50 Hz) than DAC (86 Hz), thus reducing by 40% the\ninference runtime for producing the same audio. Note finally that DAC was trained on a different\ndataset than EnCodec, and further experiments would be required to understand exactly what\ninfluences the fitness of such compression models to be used with auto-regressive language models.\nEffect of D-Adaptation.\nD-Adaptation is a novel automated way of selecting the overall learning rate of the Adam optimizer,\ni.e. its \u03b1 parameter, dynamically throughout the training, introduced by Defazio and Mishchenko\n[2023]. We observed improved convergence for the 300M parameter model, although for larger\nmodels, e.g. 1.5B and 3.3B, we observed the automated rule led to deteriorated performance, both\non the train and validation set. Further investigation is required to better understand the effect of\nD-Adaptation, and whether it can scale to the largest model. The convergence for both methods can\nbe observed on the train and validation set in Figure A.4.\n16\nFigure A.2: Visualization of quantized chromagram bins over time from reference melody (left),\ngenerated music conditioned on chroma and text (middle) and generated music with text-only\nconditioning (right).

For interactive\nvision-language tasks involving intricate visual scenes, a large quantity of di-\nverse and creative instruction-response pairs should be imperative to tune vision-\nlanguage models (VLMs). Nevertheless, the current availability of vision-language\ninstruction-response pairs in terms of quantity, diversity, and creativity remains lim-\nited, posing challenges to the generalization of interactive VLMs. Here we present\nMultI-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-IT), a dataset comprising\n2.8 million multimodal instruction-response pairs, with 2.2 million unique instruc-\ntions derived from images and videos. Each pair is accompanied by multi-modal\nin-context information, forming conversational contexts aimed at empowering\nVLMs in perception, reasoning, and planning. The instruction-response collection\nprocess, dubbed as Syphus, is scaled using an automatic annotation pipeline that\ncombines human expertise with GPT\u2019s capabilities. Using the MIMIC-IT dataset,\nwe train a large VLM named Otter. Based on extensive evaluations conducted\non vision-language benchmarks, it has been observed that Otter demonstrates re-\nmarkable proficiency in multi-modal perception, reasoning, and in-context learning.\nHuman evaluation reveals it effectively aligns with the user\u2019s intentions. We release\nthe MIMIC-IT dataset, instruction-response collection pipeline, benchmarks, and\nthe Otter model.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe recent advancements in artificial intelligence have focused on conversational assistants [42,\n31, 30, 13, 17] that possess a strong ability to understand user intentions [35] and then execute\nactions [5, 51]. In addition to the strong generalization ability of large language models (LLMs), the\nnotable achievements of these conversational assistants can be attributed to the practice of instruction\ntuning [47, 14, 46, 45, 42, 13, 34]. It involves fine-tuning LLMs on a range of tasks specified through\ndiverse and high-quality instructions [14, 45]. By incorporating instruction tuning, LLMs acquire\na heightened comprehension of user intentions [35], enabling them to exhibit improved zero-shot\ncapabilities even in previously unseen tasks [47]. One potential reason for the zero-shot performance\ngain by instruction tuning is that it internalizes the context [40], which is preferred in user interactions\nespecially when user input skips commonsense context.\nConversational assistants that excel in language tasks have achieved remarkable success. However, an\noptimal conversational assistant should be able to address tasks involving multiple modalities. This\n\u2217Equal Contribution\n\u2660Project Lead\nBCorresponding Author\nPreprint.

The MIMIC-IT dataset comprises 2.8M multi-modal instruction-\nresponse pairs spanning fundamental capabilities: perception, reasoning, and planning. Each instruc-\ntion is accompanied by multi-modal conversational context, allowing VLMs trained on MIMIC-IT to\ndemonstrate strong proficiency in interactive instruction following with zero-shot generalization.\nrequires access to a diverse and high-quality multi-modal instruction-following dataset. The LLaVA-\nInstruct-150K dataset [28], also known as LLaVA, is the pioneering vision-language instruction-\nfollowing dataset. It is constructed using COCO [27] images, instructions and responses obtained\nfrom GPT-4 [30] based on image captions and object bounding boxes.\nAlthough inspiring, LLaVA-Instruct-150K exhibits three limitations. (1) Limited visual diversity:\nThe dataset\u2019s visual diversity is constrained due to its exclusive reliance on the COCO image.\n(2) Single image as visual data: it utilizes a single image as visual data, while a multi-modal\nconversational assistant should possess the capability to process multiple images or even extensive\nvideos. For instance, it should effectively provide answers when a user presents a collection of images\n(or a sequence of images, such as a video) alongside the instruction: \"Help me think of an album title\nfor these images.\" (3) Language-only in-context information: it depends solely on language for\nin-context information, whereas a multi-modal conversational assistant should integrate multi-modal\nin-context information to better comprehend user instructions. For example, an assistant could more\naccurately align its description of an image with the tone, style, or other aspects if the human user\nprovides a concrete image example of the desired attributes.\nAddressing these limitations, we introduce MultI-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-\nIT). MIMIC-IT is characterized by: (1) Diverse visual scenes, incorporating images and videos\nfrom general scenes, egocentric view scenes, and indoor RGB-D images across various datasets. (2)\nMultiple images (or a video) as visual data, supporting instruction-response pairs accompanied\nby any number of images or videos. (3) Multi-modal in-context information, featuring in-context\ninformation formulated in multi-modal formats, including multiple instruction-response pairs and\nmultiple images or videos (see Fig. 2 for data format clarification). To efficiently generate instruction-\nresponse pairs, we introduce Sythus, an automated pipeline for instruction-response annotation\ninspired by the self-instruct method [45]. Sythus employs system message, visual annotation, and\nin-context examples to direct the language model (GPT-4 or ChatGPT) in generating instruction-\nresponse pairs based on visual context, including timestamps, captions, and object information,\ntargeting three fundamental capabilities of vision-language models: perception, reasoning, and\nplanning (refer to Fig. 1). Additionally, instructions and responses are translated from English into\nseven languages to support multi-lingual usage.\n2\nOn MIMIC-IT, we train a multi-modal model Otter based on OpenFlamingo [6]. We evaluate\nOtter\u2019s multi-modal capabilities in two aspects: (1) ChatGPT evaluation on the MMAGIBench-\nmark [43], comparing Otter\u2019s perception and reasoning abilities with other recent vision-language\nmodels (VLMs), where Otter demonstrates the strongest performance. (2) Human evaluation on\nthe Multi-Modality Arena [32], where Otter outperforms other VLMs, achieving the highest Elo\nrating. Furthermore, we assess Otter\u2019s few-shot in-context learning ability using the COCO Caption\ndataset [12], with results showing Otter\u2019s superior performance over OpenFlamingo in all few-shot\nsettings. In summary, our contributions include:\n\u2022 MultI-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-IT) dataset, a dataset comprising ~\n2.8M multi-modal in-context instruction-response pairs, with 2.2 million unique instructions,\nacross various real-life scenes.\n\u2022 Syphus, an automatic pipeline built with LLMs to generate high-quality and multi-lingual\ninstruction-response pairs based on visual context.\n\u2022 Otter, a multi-modal model demonstrates robust multi-modal perception and reasoning ca-\npabilities, effectively following human intent while exhibiting adeptness in-context learning.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nMulti-modal Instruction Tuning Dataset\nThe notion of instruction tuning in multi-modal models was initially introduced in the work called\nMulti-Instruct [50], which encompassed a wide range of multi-modal tasks [18, 56, 41, 27, 12]\ninvolving visual understanding and multi-modal reasoning, such as Visual Question Answering [18,\n56, 23]. Similarly, Mini-GPT4 [54] created its instruction-based dataset by merging Conceptual\nCaption [38, 8], SBU [33], and LAION [36] with handwritten instruction templates. More recently,\nLLaVA-Instruct-150K [28] has elevated the quality of instruction tuning datasets by utilizing self-\ninstruct and GPT-4 [30], along with handwritten seed instructions on COCO images [27]. While\nthese previous works on multi-modal instruction tuning primarily focused on general scene images,\nour approach categorizes our data sources into indoor scenes, outdoor scenes, conversations, and\negocentric videos. Additionally, drawing inspiration from the image-text interleaved structure of\nthe MMC4 dataset [55], our approach further distinguishes itself by incorporating a multi-modal\nin-context format into instruction tuning.\n2.2\nMulti-modal Foundation Models\nWith the recent success of ChatGPT [31], GPT-4 [30], and other LLMs [44, 42, 13], recent studies\nstart to explore incorporating information from other modalities into pretrained language models.\nThese studies extend the capabilities of LLM to more tasks and modalities and can be categorized\ninto two classes: (i) Multi-model Aggregation. These approaches [48, 39, 11, 57, 57, 52] take an\nLLM as a dispatch scheduler and connect different expert models through it to allow for different\ntasks. Language serves as an interface to call expert visual-language models within their respective\ntask domains. However, this approach is limited that each model cannot be trained individually on\nnew tasks. (ii) End-to-End Trainable Models. These approaches [2, 6, 25, 30, 3, 37, 7, 54, 53, 28]\nconnect models from different modalities into integrated end-to-end trainable models, also known as\nmulti-modal foundation models. Among them, based on large-scale image-text interleaved pretrained\nmodel OpenFlamingo [6], Otter is the first open-sourced model to further demonstrate the power of\nmulti-modal in-context instruction tuning.\n3\nMulti-modal In-context Instruction Tuning Dataset\nWe aim to build MIMIC-IT dataset to support more VLMs in acquiring the ability to comprehend\nthe real world. In this section, we provide an overview of the MIMIC-IT dataset, starting with the\ndata format in Sec. 3.1 and our automatic instruction generation pipeline, Sythus, in Sec. 3.2.\n3\nMIMIC-IT: Language-only In-context\nUp->Down: Ego4D->Spot The Difference\nLLaVA-Instruct-150K: Language-only In-context\nInstruction: What type of traffic \ndevice can be seen in the image?\nResponse: There is a street sign and \na traffic light above a city road.\nMIMIC-IT: Multi-modal In-context\nUp->Down: LLaVA-Interleaved->TV Show Captions\nInstruction: What is \nthe difference between \nthese two images?\nResponse: The first one \nshows an outhouse with \na toilet, while the \nsecond one shows\u2026\nInstruction:What the reason for the \ndog's current expression and outfit?\nResponse:\u2026 wearing a festive \nChristmas hat and possibly panting, \u2026,\nmaking a cute and memorable moment \nwith\ntheir pet during the holiday \nseason.\nInstruction: Why teddy bear \nornament on the Christmas tree?\nResponse: The teddy bear ornament \nhanging on the Christmas tree \nconveys a sense of \u2026 children and \nadults during the festive season.\n# In-context:\nInstruction: What is the current color of the traffic \nlights in the image?\nResponse: All the traffic lights in the image are showing \nthe color red at the same time.\n# Query:\nInstruction: What task is the woman performing?\nResponse: The woman is vacuuming the rug area between \nchairs and couches.\nInstruction: At what time of day is?\nResponse: As the bedside lam is opening and the light\nin this room is dark, it is in the night.\n\u2248\n\u2248\nInstruction: What color of jersey does my teammates wear?\nResponse: Black, as you pass the ball to a player\nwearing black jersey.\nInstruction: Does our team goal?\nResponse: Unfortunately, does not.

Image two has \na white sink, a bathtub, a mirror, and other \nbathroom items, which are not mentioned in image one.\nFigure 2: Data Format Comparison: LLaVA-Instruct-150K vs. MIMIC-IT. (a) LLaVA-Instruct-\n150K consists of a single image with corresponding language-only in-context information (yellow\nbox). (b) MIMIC-IT accommodates multiple images or videos within the input data and supports\nmulti-modal in-context information, i.e., considering both images/videos and language inputs as\nin-context information.\n3.1\nMIMIC-IT Data Format\nEach instance i in the MIMIC-IT dataset comprises an instruction-response pair and a set of N\nimages. We regard it as query example with a tuple: (Iq, Rq, Xq), where\n\b\nxN\nj=1\n\t\n\u2208 Xq. Here, Iq\ndenotes the q-th instruction in our dataset, Rq represents the response, and Xq refers to the images or\nvideos 1. Our primary objective is to develop a visual language model p\u03b8(Rq | (Iq, Xq)) parametrized\nby trainable parameters \u03b8, the model generates the response Ri for each query (Iq, Xq). With above\nexample denotes the standard instruction tuning process of a visual language model. Further, we\ncould define a set of in-context examples as (Ik, Rk, Xk)M\nk=1, where M is the number of the set.\nWe then define a context function C\u03c8 : (Iq, Xq) 7\u2192 {(Ik, Xk)}M\nk=1 to represent the in-context\nexamples with current query example. In summary, all data in the MIMIC-IT dataset will be\nrepresented in the following format, query example with its corresponding in-context examples.\ndq = (Iq, Rq, Xq, C\u03c8(Iq, Xq)),\ndq \u223c DMIMIC-IT\n(1)\nNow the visual language model that incorporates in-context examples can be denoted as p\u03b8(Rq |\n(Iq, Xq, C\u03c8(Iq, Xq))). C\u03c8 is task-dependent, we apply different approaches to organize the in-\n1Videos can be viewed as ordered sequences of images.\n4\nStep 1\nSystem Message\n+ visual annotation\nStep 2\nGenerate \ninstruction-\nresponse pairs\nStep 3\nFiltering\nStep 4\nTranslation\nChatGPT\nPrompt\nIn-context\nexamples\nCold Start\nChatGPT\nFigure 3: Sythus overview.

Subsequently, Sythus,\nspanning steps 1 to 4, generates high-quality instruction-response pairs in eight languages.\nTable 1: Comparison between MIMIC-IT and other multi-modal instruction datasets. MIMIC-\nIT stands out with the following features: (1) The largest vision-language instruction dataset. (2) The\nfirst instruction dataset including video data. (3) Supporting multi-modal in-context scenarios (see\nFig. 2 for the data format). (4) Supporting eight languages including: English, Chinese, Spanish,\nJapanese, French, German, Korean, and Arabic. The data source of MIMIC-IT includes seven\ndatasets: COCO [27], Spot-the-diff [21] (SD), ScanNetV2 [15] (SN), VisualStorytelling [20] (VIST),\nDenseCaption/Activity caption [22] (DC), TVCaption [24] (TVC), and Ego4D [19] (E4D). lang.\nindicates language and vis. indicates vision.\nDataset\nVisual Data (Scenes)\nIn-context Video #Clips/Images #Instruct. #Instance.

The details will be presented in Sec. 3.3 and\nillustrative examples will be showcased in Fig. 2.\n3.2\nSythus: Automatic Instruction-Response Generation Pipeline\nWe present Sythus (see Figure 3), an automated pipeline for generating high-quality instruction-\nresponse pairs in multiple languages. Building upon the framework proposed by LLaVA [28],\nwe utilize ChatGPT to generate instruction-response pairs based on visual content. To ensure the\nquality of the generated instruction-response pairs, our pipeline incorporates system messages,\nvisual annotations, and in-context examples as prompts for ChatGPT. System messages define the\ndesired tone and style of the generated instruction-response pairs, while visual annotations provide\nessential image information such as bounding boxes and image descriptions. In-context examples\nassist ChatGPT in learning within the context. Since the quality of coreset impacts subsequent\ndata collection process [10], we employ a cold-start strategy to enhance in-context examples before\nthe large-scale query. During the cold-start stage, in-context examples are collected by prompting\nChatGPT solely through system messages and visual annotations, employing a heuristic approach.\nThis stage concludes only when satisfactory in-context examples are identified. In step 4, once the\ninstruction-response pairs are obtained, the pipeline expands them into Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja),\n5\nSpanish (es), German (de), French (fr), Korean (ko), and Arabic (ar). For further details, please refer\nto Appendix C, and task-specific prompts can be found in Appendix D.\n3.3\nVisual Data Exploration\nAcknowledging the importance of high-quality visual annotations and the need for diverse vision-\nlanguage instructions that align with the distribution of real-world visual content, we curate a\ncollection of seven image and video datasets spanning a wide spectrum of scenes, from general to\nspecific. Encompassing various topics, the MIMIC-IT dataset includes general scene understanding\nand reasoning, spoting general and subtle differences, as well as facilitating egocentric view compre-\nhension to assist VLMs in future AR headsets, etc. In the subsequent sections, we will present the\napplication scenarios of our dataset: General Scene Understanding in Sec. 3.3.1 and General Scene\nUnderstanding in Sec. 3.3.2. In each sub-task, we elaborate on the process of organizing various data\ninto an in-context instruction tuning format, based on the previously established guidelines.\n3.3.1\nGeneral Scene Understanding\nFor understanding the general scenes, we include four tasks: (1) LLaVA-Interleaved. (2) Spot The\nDifference. (3) Visual Story Telling. (4) Dense Captions.\nLLaVA-Interleaved (LA-I). Learning with in-context examples is essential for effective instruction\ntuning. To achieve this, we refine the LLaVA-Instruct-150K [28] dataset by retrieving ten in-context\nexamples for each instruction-response pair in LLaVA-Instruct-150K, building LLaVA-Interleaved\n(LA-I). We identify each data\u2019s in-context examples based on instruction text-to-text similarity or\nimage-image similarity. Further details on locating in-context examples and the data sources for LA-I\ncan be found in the Appendix.\nSpot The Difference (SD). Learning to discern differences between images is vital for understanding\nreal-world changes. Our study encompasses two interrelated task types in Scene Difference (SD),\naddressing varying complexity levels in difference identification. The first type, General Scene\nDifference, involves creating a pair of images by determining the most similar one to the current\nimage, utilizing image-to-image similarity relationships from the COCO2017 [27]. The second\ntype, Subtle Difference, features pairs of similar images with subtle distinctions sourced from the\nSpot-the-Diff[21], extracted from surveillance footage. For the first type, we prompt ChatGPT using\noriginal image captions and object detection annotations, while for the second type, we employ\nnatural language difference descriptions as annotations. The resulting instruction-response pairs\nfocus on identifying differences between the paired images.\nVisual Story Telling (VIST). Beyond traditional scene understanding, the ability to generate coherent\nand engaging narratives based on visual input expands the context comprehension of Visual Language\nModels (VLMs). To enable this, we propose a task using the Visual Storytelling datase [20], which\nincludes event-based image sequences and corresponding inquiry questions. Given that image\nannotations often contain narratives and timelines not directly observable, we instruct ChatGPT to act\nas a viewer answering questions about the images. The prompts also incorporate thought-provoking\ninquiries to promote creativity. Each task instance comprises multiple images and instruction-response\npairs, providing in-context examples.\nDense Captions (DC). Expanding the scope of video understanding, DC features dense captions\nfrom [22] corresponding to clips within longer videos. The instructions pose a diverse set of questions,\naddressing the general visual content of the video, human actions, and behaviors, the chronological\nsequence of events, and causal relationships. This approach encourages VLMs to delve deeper into\nthe intricacies of video content.\nTV Show Captions (TVC). The primary purpose of incorporating TV show clips with high-level\ncaptions into the training process of VLMs is to enhance their social reasoning abilities and deepen\ntheir understanding of complex character dynamics. By organizing drama clips from [24] to analyze\ncharacter relationships and motivations, we aim to challenge VLMs to move beyond mere perception\nand demonstrate their reasoning capabilities within the context of TV show narratives. This focused\napproach is crucial for fostering advanced VLMs capable of effectively handling diverse real-world\nsituations and user queries.\n6\nidentify\nsuggest\nsee\ntake\ndescribe\nprovide\nhave\ndo\nface\nuse\ngive\nobserve\npick\nplay\nrecommend\nnotice\naffect\nexplain\nput\nfind\nobject\nitem\ntype\nhazard\nway\noption\nrecipe\nitem\nobject\nitem\nsign\ntool\naction\nprecaution\nplace\npicture\nsurrounding\nappearance\natmosphere\nobject\ninformation\ndetail\ninsight\ntip\nconversation\nimpact\ntrouble\nkind\ncharacter\nactivity\nkind\nperson\nchallenge\nrisk\ndifficulty\nissue\ntool\ntype\nequipment\nphone\nadvice\ninstruction\ninformation\noverview\nperson\nobject\nitem\nuser\nitem\nkind\nobject\ntype\nrole\ngame\nbook\nway\noption\nitem\nperson\nobject\nitem\nbottle\nperformance\nexperience\natmosphere\ndifference\nrole\nimportance\nsignificance\nitem\nbook\nbook\nprovide\nsee\ndetermine\nhave\nwear\ntake\nplay\nobserve\nhold\nfeature\nidentify\nuse\nshow\ndepict\ncapture\nnotice\npick\nplace\nput\ninclude\ninformation\nview\ndetail\nanswer\nobject\nperson\nitem\nbook\ntype\nlocation\ncontent\npurpose\ninformation\nconversation\nimpact\nbenefit\nshirt\ngear\nglove\njacket\nplace\nprecaution\npicture\nphoto\ngame\nrole\ncard\ntennis\nperson\nobject\nplant\nbottle\nphone\nbook\ncup\npiece\ngroup\nman\ntable\nwoman\ntype\nobject\nbrand\nhazard\nhand\nknife\ntrowel\nphone\nman\nperson\ngroup\nwoman\nscene\ngroup\nstreet\nman\nscene\nmoment\ngroup\ngame\nhazard\nobject\nsign\nitem\nbook\npiece\nbottle\ncard\nhand\nbook\ntray\ncard\nhand\nphone\nbook\npaper\nbottle\ncup\nchair\nbook\n(a) Instructions\n(b) Responses\n(c) Statistics of instructions and responses.\nFigure 4: The data statistics of multi-modal in-context instruction-response pairs.

Emphasizing the planning capabilities of virtual assistants, we utilize\nvisual inputs consisting of a collection of 2D photos depicting a room. We gather indoor scene\nRGB-D images from ScanNetv2 [15] and sample them into multiple 2D visual inputs, representing\na room\u2019s layout from a first-person perspective. We prompt ChatGPT to generate instructions that\ndirect humans to perform various activities in indoor spaces. Initially, we have ChatGPT create a\npersonality for the room owner. Subsequently, the planning should be intimately related to the room\u2019s\nlayout and the generated room owner, underlining the importance of context awareness in VLMs.\nThis approach ensures that models can effectively support users across diverse indoor scenarios.\nEgo4D (E4D) [19]. Utilizing E4D\u2019s egocentric videos, we strive to enable VLMs to function\neffectively as augmented reality (AR) assistants in real-life scenarios. By prompting ChatGPT to\ngenerate instructions based on visual descriptions, our goal is to simulate practical interactions\nbetween users and AR assistants. To this end, we devise assistant-related questions and tasks that\ndemand context-aware responses. For instance, Instruction: What should I do now? Response: Based\non my observation, you can now proceed to do.... This focused approach underscores the potential of\nVLMs in providing valuable insights and assistance across a diverse range of daily life situations.\n3.4\nDataset Statistics\nTable 1 presents the essential statistics pertaining to the generated data. Our dataset comprises over\n2.8 million instruction-response pairs, wherein each pair includes at least one multi-modal in-context\nexample and one language-only in-context example. Among these pairs, there are 2.2M unique\ninstructions. Furthermore, to examine the characteristics and diversity of the instructions (refer to\nFig. 4 (a)) and responses (refer to Fig. 4 (b)), we analyze the verb-noun structure present in them,\nrefering to [45]. Specifically, we employ spaCy for parsing the instructions, extracting the verb closest\n7\n(1st)Instruction: What could happen if drivers \nbecome confused by the traffic signals at this \nintersection?\nOtter: Confusion at traffic signals can \nnegatively impact road safety, traffic flow, \nand driver well-being.\n(2nd)Instruction: Please list a few potential\nrisks.\nOtter: It could lead to various potential risky\nscenarios: 1.

We plot the top 20 most frequently occurring\nroot verbs alongside their top 4 direct noun objects. Our findings reveal that the sentence structure\nof responses exhibits greater diversity compared to that of instructions. Moreover, we demonstrate\ndiversity in terms of the length of instructions/responses, the number of images per instruction, and\nthe number of in-context examples per instruction, as depicted in Fig. 4 (c).\n4\nEmpricial Evaluation\nIn this section, we showcase the diverse applications of the MIMIC-IT dataset and the potential\ncapabilities of a vision-language model (VLM) trained on it. Firstly, in Sec. 4.1, we introduce Otter,\nan in-context instruction-tuned model developed using the MIMIC-IT dataset. Next, in Sec. 4.2, we\nexplore various methods for training Otter on the MIMIC-IT dataset and discuss numerous scenarios\nin which Otter can be effectively employed. Finally, in Sec. 4.3 to Sec. 4.5, we present a comparative\nanalysis of Otter\u2019s performance against other VLMs across an array of benchmarks.\n4.1\nOtter: A Multi-Modal In-context Instruction Tuned Model\nOtter is designed to support multi-modal in-context instruction tuning based on the OpenFlamingo [6]\nmodel, which involves conditioning the language model on the corresponding media, such as an\nimage that corresponds to a caption or an instruction-response pair.\n4.2\nUsage Examples and Demonstrations\nScene Understanding and Reasoning. The MIMIC-IT dataset comprises approximately 2.8 million\nin-context instruction-response pairs, which are structured into a cohesive template to facilitate various\ntasks. The following template encompasses images, user instructions, and model-generated responses,\nutilizing the Human and Assistant role labels to enable seamless user-assistant interactions.\n<image>Human:{instruction} Assistant:<answer>{response}<endofchunk>\n2https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/tag/en_core_web_\nmd-3.5.0\n8\nTable 2: MMAGIBench evaluation results.

Trained on the LA task, the model exhibits exceptional scene\ncomprehension, reasoning abilities, and multi-round conversation capabilities. Meanwhile, on the SD\ntask, the model can acquire the ability to adeptly spot general differences or subtle distinctions within\ndaily scenes.\nWe showcase response examples from the Otter after training on the MIMIC-IT dataset in Fig. 5,\nhighlighting its ability to understand situations and reasoning in a multi-round conversation style.\nLearning with In-context Examples. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, regarding the concept of organizing\nvisual-language in-context examples, we demonstrate here the acquired ability of the Otter model to\nfollow inter-contextual instructions after training on the LA-T2T task (refer to Appx. for other tasks).\nThe organized input data format is as follows:\n# Multiple in-context example with similar instructions\n<image>Human:{instruction} Assistant:<answer>{response}<|endofchunk|>\n# ....\n<image>Human:{instruction} Assistant:<answer>{response}<|endofchunk|>\n# Query example\n<image>Human:{instruction} Assistant:<answer>\nThe Otter model\u2019s demonstration of regulating its expressions by referencing in-context examples is\nillustrated in Fig. 5.\nEgocentric Visual Assistant. A distinctive feature of the MIMIC-IT dataset is its inclusion of a\ncomprehensive collection of videos and sequential images in an egocentric view, derived from the\nIEP, E4D scenarios. In the IEP scenario, the content emphasizes understanding and planning within\nindoor environments, incorporating instructions and responses designed to guide the model in event\nplanning based on interior layouts.\nThe E4D scenario, on the other hand, tailors instructions and responses specifically for first-person\naugmented reality (AR) headset assistant applications. These two datasets collectively serve to bolster\nthe model\u2019s proficiency in perceiving scenes from a first-person viewpoint, strategizing for impending\ntasks, and providing valuable insights and suggestions to AR headset users. Tailored this part of data,\nwe train an egocentric visual assistant, termed Otter-E, which is specifically designed for AR headset\napplications. MIMIC-IT bolsters the model\u2019s proficiency in perceiving scenes from a first-person\nviewpoint, strategizing for impending tasks, and providing valuable insights and suggestions to\nAR headset users. As a result, the Otter-E model emerges as an exceptional and visionary Visual\nLanguage Model for AR headsets, paving the way for a groundbreaking and immersive experience.\nIn the bottom image of Fig. 5, Otter-E demonstrates its ability to perceive the first-person view and\nrespond to users\u2019 questions, such as guiding users to land a small aircraft (In real-life scenarios, you\nare not encouraged to consult visual assistants for such hazardous actions).\n4.3\nChatGPT Evaluation\nIn Tab. 2, we utilize the MMAGIBench framework [43] to provide an extensive evaluation of the\nperception and reasoning capabilities of vision-language models.

The reasoning benchmark, on the other hand, is performed across three\ndimensions: attribute reasoning, relation reasoning, and future prediction.\nCurrent evaluation metrics for vision-language models, like VQAv2 [4], exhibit shortcomings in\nterms of robustness. For instance, VQAv2 primarily assesses single-word or phrase responses, while\nmany modern models generate sentence outputs. To bridge this gap, we evaluate the models by\nasking ChatGPT to compare their label predictions with the ground truth labels for each input. A\ntest sample is considered correct if ChatGPT\u2019s response indicates that the prediction aligns with the\ncorresponding label. For a more in-depth understanding of MMAGIBench, we recommend referring\nto the original source [43]. Fig. 6 (a) demonstrates that Otter outperforms VideoChatGPT [26]\nby 6.8% accuracy and 1.8% on MSVD [9] 0-shot question answering and captioning benchmarks\nrespectively. Similar substantial margins are also observed on the MSRVTT [49] dataset.\n4.4\nHuman Evaluation\nMulti-Modality Arena [32] uses an Elo rating system to evaluate the usefulness and alignment of\nVLM responses. The Elo rating system calculates the relative skill levels of players, as commonly\nused in chess and other competitive games. The difference in Elo ratings between the two models\npredicts the outcome if they were matched against each other. This system works well for evaluating\nconversational AI models, because multiple models can have pairwise \"battles\" responding to the\nsame inputs in a user-blind evaluation. Fig. 6(b) shows that Otter demonstrates superior usefulness\nand alignment, achieving the highest Elo rating among recent VLMs.\n4.5\nFew-shot In-context Learning Metric Evaluation\nOtter is finetuned based on OpenFlamingo, an architecture designed for multi-modal in-context\nlearning. Finetuned with the MIMIC-IT dataset, Otter outperforms OpenFlamingo by a substantial\nmargin on COCO caption (CIDEr) [27] few-shot evaluation (see Fig. 6(c)). As expected, the\nfinetuning also brings marginal performance gain on zero-shot evaluation.\n5\nDiscussion\nLimitations. Though we have iteratively refined the system message and instruction-response\nexamples, ChatGPT is prone to language hallucinations therefore it might generate incorrect responses.\nGenerally, more trustworthy language models are desired for self-instruct data generation.\nFuture Works. In the future, we plan to support more embodied AI datasets such as Language-\nTable [29] and SayCan [1]. We also consider improving the instruction collection with more trustwor-\nthy language models or generation techniques.\nConclusion. In this work, we propose MIMIC-IT, a large-scale multi-modal in-context instruction\ntuning dataset. We leverage an automatic pipeline, Syphus, to enable this dataset to cover a diverse\nset of visual scenes and creative instructions in eight languages. MIMIC-IT empowers our model,\nOtter, to achieve state-of-the-art performances in perception and reasoning benchmarks as well as\nhuman evaluations.\n10\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nThis study is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2\n(MOE-T2EP20221- 0012), NTU NAP, and under the RIE2020 Industry Alignment Fund \u2013 Industry\nCollaboration Projects (IAF-ICP) Funding Initiative, as well as cash and in-kind contribution from the\nindustry partner(s).

For clarity, we only show sparse trajectories for foreground objects, though our method computes motion for\nall pixels. Our method yields accurate, coherent long-range motion even for fast-moving objects, and robustly tracks through occlusions as\nshown in the dog and swing examples. For context, in the second row we depict the moving object at different moments in time.\nAbstract\nWe present a new test-time optimization method for esti-\nmating dense and long-range motion from a video sequence.\nPrior optical flow or particle video tracking algorithms typi-\ncally operate within limited temporal windows, struggling to\ntrack through occlusions and maintain global consistency of\nestimated motion trajectories. We propose a complete and\nglobally consistent motion representation, dubbed OmniMo-\ntion, that allows for accurate, full-length motion estimation\nof every pixel in a video. OmniMotion represents a video\nusing a quasi-3D canonical volume and performs pixel-wise\ntracking via bijections between local and canonical space.\nThis representation allows us to ensure global consistency,\ntrack through occlusions, and model any combination of\ncamera and object motion. Extensive evaluations on the\nTAP-Vid benchmark and real-world footage show that our\napproach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a\nlarge margin both quantitatively and qualitatively. See our\nproject page for more results: omnimotion.github.io.\n1. Introduction\nMotion estimation methods have traditionally followed\none of two dominant approaches: sparse feature tracking\nand dense optical flow [55]. While each type of method\nhas proven effective for their respective applications, neither\nrepresentation fully models the motion of a video: pairwise\noptical flow fails to capture motion trajectories over long\ntemporal windows, and sparse tracking does not model the\nmotion of all pixels.\nA number of approaches have sought to close this gap,\ni.e., to estimate both dense and long-range pixel trajectories\nin a video. These range from methods that simply chain\ntogether two-frame optical flow fields, to more recent ap-\nproaches that directly predict per-pixel trajectories across\nmultiple frames [23]. Still, these methods all use limited\ncontext when estimating motion, disregarding information\nthat is either temporally or spatially distant. This locality can\nresult in accumulated errors over long trajectories and spatio-\ntemporal inconsistencies in the motion estimates. Even when\nprior methods do consider long-range context [55], they op-\n1\narXiv:2306.05422v2  [cs.CV]  12 Sep 2023\nerate in the 2D domain, resulting in a loss of tracking during\nocclusion events. All in all, producing both dense and long-\nrange trajectories remains an open problem in the field, with\nthree key challenges: (1) maintaining accurate tracks across\nlong sequences, (2) tracking points through occlusions, and\n(3) maintaining coherence in space and time.\nIn this work, we propose a holistic approach to video\nmotion estimation that uses all the information in a video\nto jointly estimate full-length motion trajectories for every\npixel. Our method, which we dub OmniMotion, uses a quasi-\n3D representation in which a canonical 3D volume is mapped\nto per-frame local volumes through a set of local-canonical\nbijections. These bijections serve as a flexible relaxation of\ndynamic multi-view geometry, modeling a combination of\ncamera and scene motion. Our representation guarantees cy-\ncle consistency, and can track all pixels, even while occluded\n(\u201cEverything, Everywhere\u201d). We optimize our representa-\ntion per video to jointly solve for the motion of the entire\nvideo \u201cAll at Once\u201d. Once optimized, our representation\ncan be queried at any continuous coordinate in the video to\nreceive a motion trajectory spanning the entire video.\nIn summary, we propose an approach that: 1) produces\nglobally consistent full-length motion trajectories for all\npoints in an entire video, 2) can track points through occlu-\nsions, and 3) can tackle in-the-wild videos with any combi-\nnation of camera and scene motion. We demonstrate these\nstrengths quantitatively on the TAP video tracking bench-\nmark [15], where we achieve state-of-the-art performance,\noutperforming all prior methods by a large margin.\n2. Related Work\nSparse feature tracking.\nTracking features [4,42] across\nimages is essential for a wide range of applications such as\nStructure from Motion (SfM) [1, 56, 59] and SLAM [17].\nWhile sparse feature tracking [13,43,57,67] can establish\nlong-range correspondence, this correspondence is limited\nto a set of distinctive interest points, and often restricted\nto rigid scenes. Hence, below we focus on work that can\nproduce dense pixel motion for general videos.\nOptical flow.\nOptical flow has traditionally been formu-\nlated as an optimization problem [6, 7, 24, 75]. However,\nrecent advances have enabled direct prediction of optical\nflow using neural networks with improved quality and ef-\nficiency [20,25,26,61]. One leading method, RAFT [66],\nestimates flow through iterative updates of a flow field based\non 4D correlation volumes. While optical flow methods\nallow for precise motion estimation between consecutive\nframes, they are not suited to long-range motion estimation:\nchaining pairwise optical flow into longer trajectories re-\nsults in drift and fails to handle occlusions, while directly\ncomputing optical flow between distant frames (i.e., larger\ndisplacements) often results in temporal inconsistency [8,75].\nMulti-frame flow estimation methods [27,29,52,70] can ad-\ndress some limitations of two-frame optical flow, but still\nstruggle to handle long-range motion.\nFeature matching.\nWhile optical flow methods are typi-\ncally intended to operate on consecutive frames, other tech-\nniques can estimate dense correspondences between dis-\ntant pairs of video frames [41].\nSeveral methods learn\nsuch correspondences in a self- or weakly-supervised man-\nner [5,10,13,37,53,71,73,78] using cues like cycle consis-\ntency [28,74,83], while others [18,30,62,68,69] use stronger\nsupervision signals such as geometric correspondences gen-\nerated from 3D reconstruction pipelines [39,56]. However,\npairwise matching approaches typically do not incorporate\ntemporal context, which can lead to inconsistent tracking\nover long videos and poor occlusion handling. In contrast,\nour method produces smooth trajectories through occlusions.\nPixel-level long-range tracking.\nA notable recent ap-\nproach, PIPs [23], estimates multi-frame trajectories through\nocclusions by leveraging context within a small temporal\nwindow (8 frames). However, to produce motion for videos\nlonger than this temporal window, PIPs still must chain cor-\nrespondences, a process that (1) is prone to drift and (2) will\nlose track of points that remain occluded beyond the 8-frame\nwindow. Concurrent to our work, several works develop\nlearning-based methods for predicting long-range pixel-level\ntracks in a feedforward manner. MFT [46] learns to select\nthe most reliable sequences of optical flows to perform long-\nrange tracking. TAPIR [16] tracks points by employing a\nmatching stage inspired by TAP-Net [15] and a refinement\nstage inspired by PIPs [23]. CoTracker [31] proposes a\nflexible and powerful tracking algorithm with a transformer\narchitecture to track points throughout a video. Our contri-\nbution is complementary to these works: the output of any\nof these methods can be used as the input supervision when\noptimizing a global motion representation.\nVideo-based motion optimization.\nMost conceptually re-\nlated to our approach are classical methods that optimize mo-\ntion globally over an entire video [2,12,36,54,55,60,63,72].\nParticle video, for instance, produces a set of semi-dense\nlong-range trajectories (called particles) from initial optical\nflow fields [55]. However, it does not track through occlu-\nsions; an occluded entity will be treated as a different particle\nwhen it re-appears. Rubinstein et al. [54] further proposed a\ncombinatorial assignment approach that can track through\nocclusion and generate longer trajectories. However, this\nmethod only produces semi-dense tracks for videos with\nsimple motion, whereas our method estimates long-range\nmotion for all pixels in general videos. Also related is Parti-\ncleSfM [82], which optimizes long-range correspondences\nfrom pairwise optical flows. Unlike our approach, Parti-\ncleSfM focuses on camera pose estimation within an SfM\nframework, where only correspondences from static regions\n2\nare optimized, and dynamic objects are treated as outliers.\nNeural video representations.\nWhile our method shares\nsimilarities with recent methods that model videos using\ncoordinate-based multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [44,58,65],\nprior work has primarily focused on problems such as novel\nview synthesis [38, 40, 47, 48, 77] and video decomposi-\ntion [32,81]. In contrast, our work targets the challenge of\ndense, long-range motion estimation. Though some methods\nfor dynamic novel view synthesis produce 2D motion as\na by-product, these systems require known camera poses\nand the resulting motion is often erroneous [21]. Some dy-\nnamic reconstruction methods [9,76,79,80] can also produce\n2D motion, but these are often object-centric with a focus\non articulated objects. Alternatively, video decomposition-\nbased representations such as Layered Neural Atlases [32]\nand Deformable Sprites [81] solve for a mapping between\neach frame and a global texture atlas. Frame-to-frame cor-\nrespondence can be derived by inverting this mapping, but\nthis process is expensive and unreliable. Furthermore, these\nmethods are limited to representing videos using a limited\nnumber of layers with fixed ordering, restricting their ability\nto model complex, real-world videos.\n3. Overview\nWe propose a test-time optimization approach for esti-\nmating dense and long-range motion from a video sequence.\nOur method takes as input a collection of frames and pair-\nwise noisy motion estimates (e.g., optical flow fields), and\nuses these to solve for a complete, globally consistent mo-\ntion representation for the entire video. Once optimized, our\nrepresentation can be queried with any pixel in any frame\nto produce a smooth, accurate motion trajectory across the\nfull video. Our method identifies when points are occluded,\nand even tracks points through occlusions. In the following\nsections, we describe our underlying representation, dubbed\nOmniMotion (Sec. 4), then describe our optimization pro-\ncess (Sec. 5) for recovering this representation from a video.\n4. OmniMotion representation\nAs discussed in Sec. 1, classical motion representations,\nsuch as pairwise optical flow, lose track of objects when\nthey are occluded, and can produce inconsistencies when\ncorrespondences are composed over multiple frames. To\nobtain accurate, consistent tracks even through occlusion,\nwe therefore need a global motion representation, i.e., a\ndata structure that encodes the trajectories of all points in a\nscene. One such global representation is a decomposition of\na scene into a set of discrete, depth-separated layers [32,81].\nHowever, most real-world scenes cannot be represented as\na set of fixed, ordered layers: e.g., consider the simple case\nof an object rotating in 3D. At the other extreme is full 3D\nreconstruction that disentangles 3D scene geometry, camera\npose and scene motion. This, however, is an extremely ill-\nposed problem. Thus, we ask: can we accurately track real-\nworld motion without explicit dynamic 3D reconstruction?\nWe answer this question using our proposed represen-\ntation, OmniMotion (illustrated in Fig. 2). OmniMotion\nrepresents the scene in a video as a canonical 3D volume\nthat is mapped to local volumes for each frame through\nlocal-canonical bijections. The local-canonical bijections\nare parametrized as neural networks and capture both camera\nand scene motion without disentangling the two. As such,\nthe video can be considered as a rendering of the resulting\nlocal volumes from a fixed, static camera.\nBecause OmniMotion does not explicitly disentangle\ncamera and scene motion, the resulting representation is\nnot a physically accurate 3D scene reconstruction. Instead\nwe call it a quasi-3D representation. This relaxation of\ndynamic multi-view geometry allows us to sidestep ambi-\nguities that make dynamic 3D reconstruction challenging.\nYet we retain properties needed for consistent and accurate\nlong-term tracking through occlusion: first, by establishing\nbijections between each local frame and a canonical frame,\nOmniMotion guarantees globally cycle-consistent 3D map-\npings across all local frames, which emulates the one-to-one\ncorrespondences between real-world, metric 3D reference\nframes. Second, OmniMotion retains information about all\nscene points that are projected onto each pixel, along with\ntheir relative depth ordering, enabling points to be tracked\neven when they are temporarily occluded from view.\nIn the following sections, we describe our quasi-3D\ncanonical volume and 3D bijections, and then describe how\nthey can be used to compute motion between any two frames.\n4.1. Canonical 3D volume\nWe represent a video\u2019s content using a canonical volume\nG that acts as a three-dimensional atlas of the observed scene.\nAs in NeRF [44], we define a coordinate-based network F\u03b8\nover G that maps each canonical 3D coordinate u \u2208 G to\na density \u03c3 and color c. The density stored in G is key, as\nit tells us where the surfaces are in canonical space. To-\ngether with the 3D bijections, this allows us to track surfaces\nover multiple frames as well as reason about occlusion re-\nlationships. The color stored in G allows us to compute a\nphotometric loss during optimization.\n4.2. 3D bijections\nWe define a continuous bijective mapping Ti that maps\n3D points xi from each local coordinate frame Li to the\ncanonical 3D coordinate frame as u = Ti(xi), where i is\nthe frame index. Note that the canonical coordinate u is\ntime-independent and can be viewed as a globally consistent\n\u201cindex\u201d for a particular scene point or 3D trajectory across\ntime. By composing these bijective mappings and their in-\nverses, we can map a 3D point from one local 3D coordinate\n3\nFor a given  \n:\n\ud835\udc3f!\nFrame \ud835\udc56\nFrame j\n\ud835\udc96\n\ud835\udc99#\n(\ud835\udc84, \ud835\udf0e)\n\ud835\udc3f#\n\ud835\udc99!\n\ud835\udf0e\n\ud835\udc99!\n\"\n\ud835\udc99!\n# \ud835\udc99!\n$\n\"\ud835\udc99!\n\"\ud835\udc91!\n\ud835\udc99%\n# \ud835\udc99%\n$\n\u2026\n\ud835\udc99%\n\"\n\u2026\nAlpha composite\nProject \n\ud835\udc91!\n*\ud835\udc91#\n\ud835\udc91%\ncanonical 3D volume \ud835\udc3a\n(a) OmniMotion representation\n(b) Computing 2D motion\nFigure 2: Method overview. (a) Our OmniMotion representation is comprised of a canonical 3D volume G and a set of bijections Ti\nthat map between each frame\u2019s local volume Li and the canonical volume G. Any local 3D location xi in frame i can be mapped to its\ncorresponding canonical location u through Ti, and then mapped back to another frame j as xj through the inverse mapping T \u22121\nj\n. Each\nlocation u in G is associated with a color c and density \u03c3, computed using a coordinate-based MLP F\u03b8. (b) To compute the corresponding\n2D location for a given query point pi mapped from frame i to j, we shoot a ray into Li and sample a set of points {xk\ni }K\nk=1, which are then\nmapped first to the canonical space to obtain their densities, and then to frame j to compute their corresponding local 3D locations {xk\nj }K\nk=1.\nThese points {xk\nj }K\nk=1 are then alpha-composited and projected to obtain the 2D corresponding location \u02c6pj.\nframe (Li) to another (Lj):\nxj = T \u22121\nj\n\u25e6 Ti(xi).\n(1)\nBijective mappings ensure that the resulting correspondences\nbetween 3D points in individual frames are all cycle consis-\ntent, as they arise from the same canonical point.\nTo allow for expressive maps that can capture real-world\nmotion, we parameterize these bijections as invertible neural\nnetworks (INNs). Inspired by recent work on homeomor-\nphic shape modeling [35,49], we use Real-NVP [14] due to\nits simple formulation and analytic invertibility. Real-NVP\nbuilds bijective mappings by composing simple bijective\ntransformations called affine coupling layers. An affine cou-\npling layer splits the input into two parts; the first part is left\nunchanged, but is used to parametrize an affine transforma-\ntion that is applied to the second part.\nWe modify this architecture to also condition on a per-\nframe latent code \u03c8i [35,49]. Then all invertible mappings\nTi are parameterized by the same invertible network M\u03b8, but\nwith different latent codes: Ti(\u00b7) = M\u03b8(\u00b7; \u03c8i).\n4.3. Computing frame-to-frame motion\nGiven this representation, we now describe how we can\ncompute 2D motion for any query pixel pi in frame i. Intu-\nitively, we \u201clift\u201d the query pixel to 3D by sampling points\non a ray, \u201cmap\u201d these 3D points to a target frame j using\nbijections Ti and Tj, \u201crender\u201d these mapped 3D points from\nthe different samples through alpha compositing, and finally\n\u201cproject\u201d back to 2D to obtain a putative correspondence.\nSpecifically, since we assume that camera motion is sub-\nsumed by the local-canonical bijections Ti, we simply use a\nfixed, orthographic camera. The ray at pi can then be defined\nas ri(z) = oi+zd, where oi = [pi, 0] and d = [0, 0, 1]. We\nsample K samples on the ray {xk\ni }, which are equivalent to\nappending a set of depth values {zk\ni }K\nk=1 to pi. Despite not\nbeing a physical camera ray, it captures the notion of multiple\nsurfaces at each pixel and suffices to handle occlusion.\nNext we obtain densities and colors for these samples\nby mapping them to the canonical space and then querying\nthe density network F\u03b8. Taking the k-th sample xk\ni as an\nexample, its density and color can be written as (\u03c3k, ck) =\nF\u03b8(M\u03b8(xk\ni ; \u03c8i)). We can also map each sample along the\nray to a corresponding 3D location xk\nj in frame j (Eq. 1).\nWe can now aggregate the correspondences xk\nj from all\nsamples to produce a single correspondence \u02c6xj. This ag-\ngregation is similar to how the colors of sample points are\naggregated in NeRF: we use alpha compositing, with the\nalpha value for the k-th sample as \u03b1k = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c3k). We\nthen compute \u02c6xj as:\n\u02c6xj =\nK\nX\nk=1\nTk\u03b1kxk\nj , where Tk =\nk\u22121\nY\nl=1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1l)\n(2)\nA similar process is used to composite ck to get the image-\nspace color \u02c6\nCi for pi. \u02c6xj is then projected using our sta-\ntionary orthographic camera model to yield the predicted 2D\ncorresponding location \u02c6pj for the query location pi.\n5. Optimization\nOur optimization process takes as input a video sequence\nand a collection of noisy correspondence predictions (from\nan existing method) as guidance, and generates a complete,\nglobally consistent motion estimate for the entire video.\n4\n5.1. Collecting input motion data\nFor most of our experiments, we use RAFT [66] to com-\npute input pairwise correspondence. We also experimented\nwith another dense correspondence method, TAP-Net [15],\nand demonstrate in our evaluation that our approach consis-\ntently works well given different types of input correspon-\ndence. Taking RAFT as an example, we begin by exhaus-\ntively computing all pairwise optical flows. Since optical\nflow methods can produce significant errors under large dis-\nplacements, we apply cycle consistency and appearance con-\nsistency checks to filter out spurious correspondences. We\nalso optionally augment the flows through chaining, when\ndeemed reliable. Additional details about our flow collection\nprocess are provided in the supplemental material. Despite\nthe filtering, the (now incomplete) flow fields remain noisy\nand inconsistent. We now introduce our optimization method\nthat consolidates these noisy, incomplete pairwise motion\ninto complete and accurate long-range motion.\n5.2. Loss functions\nOur primary loss function is a flow loss. We minimize\nthe mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted flow\n\u02c6\nfi\u2192j = \u02c6pj \u2212 pi from our optimized representation and the\nsupervising input flow fi\u2192j derived from running optical\nflow:\nLflo =\nX\nfi\u2192j\u2208\u2126f\n|| \u02c6\nfi\u2192j \u2212 fi\u2192j||1\n(3)\nwhere \u2126f is the set of all the filtered pairwise flows. In\naddition, we minimize a photometric loss defined as the\nmean squared error (MSE) between the predicted color \u02c6\nCi\nand the observed color Ci in the source video frame:\nLpho =\nX\n(i,p)\u2208\u2126p\n|| \u02c6\nCi(p) \u2212 Ci(p)||2\n2\n(4)\nwhere \u2126p is the set of all pixel locations over all frames. Last,\nto ensure temporal smoothness of the 3D motion estimated\nby M\u03b8, we apply a regularization term that penalizes large\naccelerations. Given a sampled 3D location xi in frame i,\nwe map it to frame i\u22121 and frame i+1 using Eq. 1, yielding\n3D points xi\u22121 and xi+1 respectively, and then minimize\n3D acceleration as in [38]:\nLreg =\nX\n(i,x)\u2208\u2126x\n||xi+1 + xi\u22121 \u2212 2xi||1\n(5)\nwhere \u2126x is the union of local 3D spaces for all frames. Our\nfinal combined loss can be written as:\nL = Lflo + \u03bbphoLpho + \u03bbregLreg\n(6)\nwhere weights \u03bb control the relative importance of each term.\nThe intuition behind this optimization is to leverage the\nbijections to a single canonical volume G, photo consis-\ntency, and the natural spatiotemporal smoothness provided\nby the coordinate-based networks M\u03b8 and F\u03b8 to reconcile\ninconsistent pairwise flow and fill in missing content in the\ncorrespondence graphs.\n5.3. Balancing supervision via hard mining\nThe exhaustive pairwise flow input maximizes the use-\nful motion information available to the optimization stage.\nHowever, this approach, especially when coupled with the\nflow-filtering process, can result in an unbalanced collection\nof motion samples in dynamic regions. Rigid background re-\ngions typically have many reliable pairwise correspondences,\nwhile fast-moving and deforming foreground objects often\nhave many fewer reliable correspondences after filtering, es-\npecially between distant frames. This imbalance can lead the\nnetwork to focus entirely on dominant (simple) background\nmotions, and ignore the challenging moving objects that\nrepresent a small portion of the supervisory signal.\nTo address this issue, we propose a simple strategy for\nmining hard examples during training. Specifically, we peri-\nodically cache flow predictions and compute error maps by\ncalculating the Euclidean distance between the predicted and\ninput flows. During optimization, we guide sampling such\nthat regions with high errors are sampled more frequently.\nWe compute these error maps on consecutive frames, where\nwe assume our supervisory optical flow is most reliable.\nPlease refer to the supplement for more details.\n5.4. Implementation details\nNetwork.\nOur mapping network M\u03b8 consists of six affine\ncoupling layers. We apply positional encoding [44,65] with\n4 frequencies to each layer\u2019s input coordinates before com-\nputing the scale and translation. We use a single 2-layer\nMLP with 256 channels implemented as a GaborNet [19] to\ncompute the latent code \u03c8i for each frame i. The input to\nthis MLP is the time ti. The dimensionality of latent code \u03c8i\nis 128. The canonical representation F\u03b8 is also implemented\nas a GaborNet, but with 3 layers of 512 channels.\nRepresentation.\nWe normalize all pixel coordinates pi\nto the range [\u22121, 1], and set the near and far depth range\nto 0 and 2, defining a local 3D space for each frame as\n[\u22121, 1]2 \u00d7[0, 2]. While our method can place content at arbi-\ntrary locations in the canonical space G, we initialize mapped\ncanonical locations given by M\u03b8 to be roughly within a unit\nsphere to ensure well-conditioned input to the density/color\nnetwork F\u03b8. To improve numerical stability during training,\nwe apply the contraction operation in mip-NeRF 360 [3] to\ncanonical 3D coordinates u before passing them to F\u03b8.\nTraining.\nWe train our representation on each video se-\nquence with Adam [33] for 200K iterations. In each train-\ning batch, we sample 256 correspondences from 8 pairs of\nimages, for a total of 1024 correspondences. We sample\n5\nK = 32 points on each ray using stratified sampling. More\ntraining details can be found in the supplemental material.\n6. Evaluation\n6.1. Benchmarks\nWe evaluate our method on the TAP-Vid benchmark [15],\nwhich is designed to evaluate the performance of point track-\ning across long video clips. TAP-Vid consists of both real-\nworld videos with accurate human annotations of point tracks\nand synthetic videos with perfect ground-truth point tracks.\nEach point track is annotated through the entire video, and\nis labeled as occluded when not visible.\nDatasets.\nWe evaluate on the following datasets from TAP-\nVid: 1) DAVIS, a real dataset of 30 videos from the DAVIS\n2017 validation set [50], with clips ranging from 34-104\nframes and an average of 21.7 point track annotations per\nvideo. 2) Kinetics, a real dataset of 1,189 videos each with\n250 frames from the Kinetics-700-2020 validation set [11]\nwith an average of 26.3 point track annotations per video.\nTo make evaluation tractable for test-time optimization ap-\nproaches like ours, we randomly sample a subset of 100\nvideos and evaluate all methods on this subset. 3) RGB-\nStacking [34], a synthetic dataset of 50 videos each with\n250 frames and 30 tracks. We exclude the synthetic Kubric\ndataset [22] as it is primarily intended for training. For\nquantitative evaluation, we adhere to the TAP benchmark\nprotocol and evaluate all methods at 256\u00d7256 resolution, but\nall qualitative results are run at a higher resolution (480p).\nEvaluation metrics.\nFollowing the TAP-Vid benchmark,\nwe report both the position and occlusion accuracy of pre-\ndicted tracks. We also introduce a new metric measuring\ntemporal coherence. Our evaluation metrics include:\n\u2022 < \u03b4x\navg measures the average position accuracy of visible\npoints across 5 thresholds: 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 pixels. The\naccuracy < \u03b4x at each threshold \u03b4x is the fraction of points\nthat are within \u03b4x pixels of their ground truth position.\n\u2022 Average Jaccard (AJ) evaluates both occlusion and po-\nsition accuracy on the same thresholds as < \u03b4x\navg. It cat-\negorizes predicted point locations as true positives, false\npositives, and false negatives, and is defined as the ratio\nof true positives to all points. True positives are points\nwithin the threshold of visible ground truth points. False\npositives are points that are predicted as visible, but where\nthe ground truth is occluded or beyond the threshold. False\nnegatives are ground truth visible points that are predicted\nas occluded or are beyond the threshold.\n\u2022 Occlusion Accuracy (OA) evaluates the accuracy of the\nvisibility/occlusion prediction at each frame.\n\u2022 Temporal Coherence (TC) evaluates the temporal coher-\nence of the tracks by measuring the L2 distance between\nthe acceleration of groundtruth tracks and predicted tracks.\nThe acceleration is measured as the flow difference be-\ntween two adjacent frames for visible points.\n6.2. Baselines\nWe compare OmniMotion to various types of dense corre-\nspondence methods, including optical flow, feature matching,\nand multi-frame trajectory estimation as follows:\nRAFT [66] is a state-of-the-art two-frame flow method. We\nconsider two ways to use RAFT to generate multi-frame\ntrajectories at test time: 1) chaining RAFT predictions be-\ntween consecutive frames into longer tracks, which we call\nRAFT-C, and 2) directly computing RAFT flow between any\n(non-adjacent) query and target frames (RAFT-D). When\ngenerating trajectories using RAFT-D, we always use the pre-\nvious flow prediction as initialization for the current frame.\nPIPs [23] is a method for estimating multi-frame point tra-\njectories that can handle occlusions. By default, the method\nuses a temporal window of 8 frames, and longer trajectories\nmust be generated through chaining. We used the official\nimplementation of PIPs to perform chaining.\nFlow-Walk [5] uses a multi-scale contrastive random walk\nto learn space-time correspondences by encouraging cycle\nconsistency across time. Similar to RAFT, we report both\nchained and direct correspondence computation as Flow-\nWalk-C and Flow-Walk-D, respectively.\nTAP-Net [15] uses a cost volume to predict the location of\na query point in a single target frame, along with a scalar\nocclusion logit.\nDeformable Sprites [81] is a layer-based video decomposi-\ntion method. Like our method, it uses a per-video test-time\noptimization. However, it does not directly produce frame-\nto-frame correspondence, as the mapping from each frame to\na canonical texture image is non-invertible. A nearest neigh-\nbor search in texture image space is required to find corre-\nspondence. Layered Neural Atlases [32] shares similarities\nto Deformable Sprites, but requires semantic segmentation\nmasks as input, so we opt to compare to Deformable Sprites.\nPIPs, TAP-Net and Deformable Sprites directly predict\nocclusion, but RAFT and Flow-Walk do not. Therefore we\nfollow prior work [15,78] and use a cycle consistency check\nwith a threshold of 48 pixels to produce occlusion predictions\nfor these methods. For our method, we detect occlusion\nby first mapping the query point to its corresponding 3D\nlocation in the target frame, then checking the transmittance\nof that 3D location in the target frame.\n6.3. Comparisons\nQuantitative comparisons.\nWe compare our method to\nbaselines on the TAP-Vid benchmark in Tab. 1. Our method\nachieves the best position accuracy, occlusion accuracy, and\n6\nRAFT-C\nOurs\nOurs\nPIPs\nOurs\nTAP-Net\nSwing\nIndia\nLab-coat\nFigure 3: Qualitative comparison of our method and baselines on DAVIS [50]. The leftmost image shows query points in the first frame, and\nthe right three images show tracking results over time. Notably, our method tracks successfully through the occlusion events in swing and\nindia, while baseline methods fail. Our method additionally detects occlusion (marked as cross \u201c+\u201d) and gives plausible location estimates\neven when a point is occluded. Please refer to the supplemental video for better visualizations of tracking accuracy and coherence.\ntemporal coherence consistently across different datasets.\nOur method works well with different input pairwise corre-\nspondences from RAFT and TAP-Net, and provides consis-\ntent improvements over both of these base methods.\nCompared to approaches that directly operate on (non-\nadjacent) pairs of query and target frames like RAFT-D,\nTAP-Net, and Flow-Walk-D, our method achieves signifi-\ncantly better temporal coherence due to our globally con-\nsistent representation. Compared to flow chaining methods\nlike RAFT-C, PIPs, and Flow-Walk-C, our method has better\ntracking performance, especially on longer videos. Chaining\nmethods accumulate errors over time and are not robust to oc-\nclusion. Although PIPs considers a wider temporal window\n(8 frames) for better occlusion handling, it fails to track a\npoint if it stays occluded beyond the entire temporal window.\nIn contrast, OmniMotion can track points through extended\nocclusions. Our method also outperforms the test-time op-\ntimization approach Deformable Sprites [81]. Deformable\nSprites decomposes a video using a predefined two or three\nlayers with fixed ordering and models the background as a\n2D atlas with a per-frame homography, limiting its ability to\nfit to videos with complex camera and scene motion.\nQualitative comparisons.\nWe compare our method quali-\ntatively to our baselines in Fig. 3.

We refer to our method as Ours, and\npresent two variants, Ours (TAP-Net) and Ours (RAFT), which are optimized using input pairwise correspondences from TAP-Net [15]\nand RAFT [66], respectively. Both Ours and Deformable Sprites [81] estimate global motion via test-time optimization on each individual\nvideo, while all other methods estimate motion locally in a feed-forward manner. Our method notably improves the quality of the input\ncorrespondences, achieving the best position accuracy, occlusion accuracy, and temporal coherence among all methods tested.\nMethod\nAJ \u2191\n< \u03b4x\navg \u2191\nOA \u2191\nTC \u2193\nNo invertible\n12.5\n21.4\n76.5\n0.97\nNo photometric\n42.3\n58.3\n84.1\n0.83\nUniform sampling\n47.8\n61.8\n83.6\n0.88\nFull\n51.7\n67.5\n85.3\n0.74\nTable 2: Ablation study on DAVIS [50].\nidentify and track through (long) occlusion events while also\nproviding plausible locations for points during occlusion, as\nwell as handling large camera motion parallax. Please refer\nto the supplementary video for animated comparisons.\n6.4. Ablations and analysis\nAblations.\nWe perform ablations to verify the effective-\nness of our design decisions in Tab. 2. No invertible is a\nmodel variant that replaces our invertible mapping network\nM\u03b8 with separate forward and backward mapping networks\nbetween local and canonical frames (i.e., without the strict\ncycle consistency guarantees of our proposed bijections).\nWhile we additionally add a cycle consistency loss for this\nablation, it still fails to construct a meaningful canonical\nspace, and can only represent simple motions of the static\nbackground. No photometric is a version that omits the\nphotometric loss Lpho; the reduced performance suggests\nthe importance of photoconsistency for refining motion esti-\nmates. Uniform sampling replaces our hard-mining sampling\nstrategy with a uniform sampling strategy, which we found\nleads to an inability to capture fast motion.\nAnalysis.\nIn Fig. 4, we show pseudo-depth maps generated\nfrom our model to demonstrate the learned depth ordering.\nNote that these maps do not correspond to physical depth,\nnonetheless, they demonstrate that using only photometric\nand flow signals, our method is able to sort out the relative\nFigure 4: Pseudo-depth maps extracted from our representation,\nwhere blue indicates closer objects and red indicates further.\nordering between different surfaces, which is crucial for\ntracking through occlusions. More ablations and analyses\nare provided in the supplemental material.\n7. Limitations\nLike many motion estimation methods, our method strug-\ngles with rapid and highly non-rigid motion as well as thin\nstructures. In these scenarios, pairwise correspondence meth-\nods can fail to provide enough reliable correspondences for\nour method to compute accurate global motion.\nIn addition, due to the highly non-convex nature of the\nunderlying optimization problem, we observe that our opti-\nmization process can be sensitive to initialization for certain\ndifficult videos. This can result in sub-optimal local min-\nima, e.g., incorrect surface ordering or duplicated objects\nin canonical space that can sometimes be hard to correct\nthrough optimization.\nFinally, our method in its current form can be computa-\ntionally expensive. First, the flow collection process involves\ncomputing all pairwise flows exhaustively, which scales\nquadratically with respect to the sequence length. However,\nwe believe the scalability of this process can be improved by\n8\nexploring more efficient alternatives to exhaustive matching,\ne.g., vocabulary trees or keyframe-based matching, drawing\ninspiration from the Structure from Motion and SLAM liter-\nature. Second, like other methods that utilize neural implicit\nrepresentations [44], our method involves a relatively long\noptimization process. Recent research in this area [45,64]\nmay help accelerate this process and allow further scaling to\nlonger sequences.\n8. Conclusion\nWe proposed a new test-time optimization method for esti-\nmating complete and globally consistent motion for an entire\nvideo. We introduced a new video motion representation\ncalled OmniMotion which includes a quasi-3D canonical\nvolume and per-frame local-canonical bijections. OmniMo-\ntion can handle general videos with varying camera setups\nand scene dynamics, and produce accurate and smooth long-\nrange motion through occlusions. Our method achieves\nsignificant improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively.\nAcknowledgements.\nWe thank Jon Barron, Richard\nTucker, Vickie Ye, Zekun Hao, Xiaowei Zhou, Steve Seitz,\nBrian Curless, and Richard Szeliski for their helpful input\nand assistance.

Preparing pairwise correspondences\nOur method uses pairwise correspondences from existing\nmethods, such as RAFT [66] and TAP-Net [15], and con-\nsolidates them into dense, globally consistent, and accurate\ncorrespondences that span an entire video. As a preprocess-\ning stage, we exhaustively compute all pairwise correspon-\ndences (i.e., between every pair of frames i and j) and filter\nthem using cycle consistency and appearance consistency\nchecks.\nWhen computing the flow field between a base frame\ni and a target frame j as i \u2192 j, we always use the flow\nprediction for the previous target frame (i \u2192 j \u2212 1) as ini-\ntialization for the optical flow model (when possible). We\nfind this improves flow predictions between distant frames.\nStill, the flow predictions between distant frames can contain\nsignificant errors, and therefore we filter out flow vector esti-\nmates with cycle consistency errors (i.e., forward-backward\nflow consistency error) greater than 3 pixels.\nDespite this filtering process, we still frequently observe\na persistent type of error that remains undetected by cycle\nconsistency checks. This type of spurious correspondence,\nillustrated in Fig. 5, occurs because flow networks can strug-\ngle to estimate motion for regions that undergo significant\ndeformation between the two input frames, and instead opt\nto interpolate motion from the surrounding areas. In the ex-\nample in Fig. 5, this leads to flow on the foreground person\n\u201clocking on\u201d to the background layer instead. This behavior\nresults in incorrect flows that survive the cycle consistency\ncheck, since they are consistent with a secondary layer\u2019s\nmotion (e.g., background motion). To address this issue,\nwe additionally use an appearance check: we extract dense\nfeatures for each pixel using DINO [10] and filter out cor-\nrespondences whose features\u2019 cosine similarity is < 0.5.\nIn practice, we apply the cycle consistency check for all\npairwise flows and supplement it with an appearance check\nwhen the two frames are more than 3 frames apart. We found\nthis filtering process consistently eliminates major errors in\nflow fields across different sequences without per-sequence\ntuning. The results of our filtering approach, after both cycle\nand appearance consistency checks, are illustrated in Fig. 6.\nOne drawback of such a filtering process is that it will\nalso remove correct flows for regions that become occluded\nin the target frame. For certain correspondence methods\n(such as RAFT), including these motion signals during oc-\nclusion events can result in better final motion estimates.\nTherefore, we devise a simple strategy for detecting reliable\nflow in occluded regions. For each pixel, we compute its\nforward flow to a target frame (a), cycle flow (flow back to\nthe source frame from the target pixel) (b), and a second for-\nward flow (c). This process effectively amounts to a 2-pass\ncycle consistency check: the consistency between (a) and\n(b) forms a standard cycle consistency check, and the consis-\ntency between (b) and (c) forms a secondary, supplementary\nFigure 5: Erroneous correspondences after cycle consistency\ncheck. The red bounding box highlights a common type of incorrect\ncorrespondences from flow networks like RAFT [66] that remains\nundetected by cycle consistency check. The left images are query\nframes with query points and the right images are target frames\nwith the corresponding predictions. Only correspondences on the\nforeground object are shown for better clarity.\nFigure 6: Correspondences from RAFT [66] after both cycle and\nappearance checks. The left column shows a single query frame,\nand the right column displays target frames with increasing frame\ndistances to the query frame from top to bottom. The filtered\ncorrespondences are reliable without significant errors.\none. We identify pixels where (a) and (b) are inconsistent\nbut (b) and (c) are consistent and deem these to be occluded\npixels. We found this approach effective in identifying reli-\nable flows for occluded regions\u2014particularly when the two\nframes are close to each other. Therefore, we allow these\ncorrespondences to bypass cycle consistency checks if they\nspan a temporal distance of less than 3 frames. Our exper-\niments use this added signal for the variant of our method\nthat uses RAFT flow, but not for the TAP-Net variant, as we\nfound the predicted correspondences from the latter were\n13\nMethod\nAJ \u2191\n< \u03b4x\navg \u2191\nOA \u2191\nTC \u2193\nPlain 2D\n11.6\n19.8\n76.7\n1.25\nNo invertible\n12.5\n21.4\n76.5\n0.97\nNo flow loss\n23.9\n37.3\n70.8\n1.75\nNo photometric\n42.3\n58.3\n84.1\n0.83\nUniform sampling\n47.8\n61.8\n83.6\n0.88\n#Samples K = 8\n48.1\n63.5\n84.6\n0.75\n#Samples K = 16\n49.7\n65.0\n85.6\n0.84\nFull\n51.7\n67.5\n85.3\n0.74\nTable 3: Ablation study on DAVIS [50].\nless reliable near occlusion events.\nWe can also optionally augment the supervising input flow\nby chaining sequences of correspondences that are deemed\nreliable (i.e., those that satisfy the cycle consistency and\nappearance consistency checks). This helps densify the set\nof correspondences, creating supervision between distant\nframes where the direct flow estimates were deemed unreli-\nable and therefore discarded during filtering. We found this\nprocess to be beneficial especially for challenging sequences\nwith rapid motion or large displacements, where optical flow\nestimates between non-adjacent frames are less reliable.\nB. Additional ablations\nIn addition to the ablations in the main paper, we provide\nthe following ablations and report the results in Table 3: 1)\nPlain 2D: Rather than using a quasi-3D representation with\nbijections to model motion, we utilized a simple 8-layer MLP\nwith 256 neurons that takes the query pixel location, query\ntime, and target time as input and outputs the corresponding\nlocation in the target frame. Although we applied positional\nencoding with 8 frequencies to the input to enable better fit-\nting, this ablation failed to capture the holistic motion of the\nvideo, instead only capturing simpler motion patterns for the\nrigid background. 2) No flow loss: we remove the flow loss\nand only rely on photometric information for training. We\nfind this approach is effective only for sequences with small\nmotion, where a photometric loss can provide useful signals\nto adjust motion locally. For sequences with relatively large\nmotion, this method fails to provide correct results. 3) We\nalso vary the number of samples K for each ray from 32 to\n16 and 8. The resulting ablations, named #Samples K=8 and\n#Samples K=16, demonstrate that using a denser sampling\nstrategy tends to produce better results.\nC. Additional implementation details\nWe provide additional implementation details below and\nwill release our code upon acceptance.\nError map sampling.\nWe cache the flow predictions gen-\nerated by our model every 20k steps and use them to mine\nhard examples for effective training. Specifically, for each\nframe in the video sequence, we compute the optical flow\nbetween that frame and its subsequent frame, except for the\nfinal frame where we compute the flow between it and the\nprevious frame. We then compute the L2 distance between\nthe predicted flow and supervising input flow, where each\npixel in the video is now associated with a flow error. In\neach training batch, we randomly sampled half of the query\npixels using weights proportional to the flow errors and the\nother half using uniform sampling weights.\nTraining details.\nIn addition to the photometric loss Lpho\nintroduced in the main paper, we include an auxiliary loss\nterm that supervises the relative color between a pair of\npixels in a frame:\nLpgrad =\nX\n\u2126p\n||( \u02c6\nCi(p1) \u2212 \u02c6\nCi(p2)) \u2212 (Ci(p1) \u2212 Ci(p2))||1\n(7)\nHere, ( \u02c6\nCi(p1)\u2212 \u02c6\nCi(p2)) is the difference in predicted color\nbetween a pair of pixels, and (Ci(p1) \u2212 Ci(p2)) is the\ncorresponding difference between ground-truth observations.\nThis loss is akin to spatial smoothness regularizations or\ngradient losses that supplement pixel reconstruction losses\nin prior work [32,51], but instead computed between pairs\nof randomly sampled, potentially distant pixels p1 and p2,\nrather than between adjacent pixels. We apply the same\ngradient loss to the flow prediction as well. We found that\nincluding these gradient losses helps improve the spatial\nconsistency of estimates, and more generally improves the\ntraining process. We also use distortion loss introduced in\nmip-NeRF 360 [3] to suppress floaters.\nWe train our network with the Adam optimizer with base\nlearning rates of 3 \u00d7 10\u22124, 1 \u00d7 10\u22124, and 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 for\nthe density/color network F\u03b8, the mapping network M\u03b8,\nand the MLP that computes the latent code, respectively.\nWe decrease the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 every 20k\nstep. To select correspondences during training, we begin\nby sampling correspondences from pairs of frames with a\nmaximum interval of 20, and gradually increase the window\nsize during training. Specifically, we expand the window by\none every 2k steps.\nIn our loss formulation, we compute the flow loss Lflo\nas a weighted sum of the mean absolute error (MAE) be-\ntween each pair of correspondences in a training batch. The\nweight is determined by the frame interval, and is given by\nw = 1/ cos(\u2206/N \u2032 \u00b7\u03c0/2), where \u2206 is the frame interval, and\nN \u2032 is the current window size. The coefficient \u03bbpho for the\nphotometric loss initially starts at 0 and linearly increases to\n10 over the first 50k steps of training. After 50k steps, \u03bbpho\nstays fixed at 10. This design is motivated by our observa-\ntion that the photometric loss is not effective in fixing large\nmotion errors early on in the training process, but is effective\nin refining the motion. The coefficient \u03bbreg for smoothness\nregularization is set to 20. We use the same set of network\n14\n\ud835\udc65!\n\ud835\udc66!\n\ud835\udc67!\n\u22ef\n\ud835\udf4d!\nLayer \ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc65!\n\ud835\udc66!\n\ud835\udc67!\nP.E.\n\ud835\udc65!\n\ud835\udc66!\n\ud835\udc67!\n\"\n\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc63\n\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc67!\n\" = \ud835\udc67! exp \ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc61\nMLP\nFigure 7: Network architecture for the mapping network M\u03b8.

While there have been initial attempts for\nimage-based conversation models, this work addresses the underexplored field of\nvideo-based conversation by introducing Video-ChatGPT. It is a multimodal model\nthat merges a video-adapted visual encoder with a LLM. The resulting model is\ncapable of understanding and generating detailed conversations about videos. We\nintroduce a new dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs used to train Video-\nChatGPT acquired via manual and semi-automated pipeline that is easily scalable\nand robust to label noise. We also develop a quantitative evaluation framework for\nvideo-based dialogue models to objectively analyse the strengths and weaknesses\nof video-based dialogue models. Our code, models, instruction set and demo are\nreleased at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-ChatGPT.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe surge of deep learning applications for video understanding has lead to major advancements\nin video-related tasks. However, the current video understanding models are still unable to hold an\nopen-ended conversation about the video content in a coherent manner. A video-based dialogue\nmodel can revolutionize video search, surveillance operations and help summarize key events and\nabnormal event detection. Above all, it can provide a unified human-understandable interface to\nvideo-related tasks such as action recognition, localization, detection, segmentation, retrieval, and\ntracking. Further, such a capability is of great interest as it will demonstrate the model\u2019s ability to\nencode temporal and spatial cues, contextual relationships and long-term dependencies.\nRecent advancements in multimodal understanding are largely based on the combination of pretrained\nimage models with Large Language Models (LLMs) but generally do not consider video inputs [1\u20135].\nIt is therefore interesting to leverage the vast capabilities of LLMs for video understanding tasks\nin a way that would not only maintain the temporal and spatial characteristics but also be adept at\ngenerating human-like conversations about videos. In this paper, we introduce Video-ChatGPT, a\nnovel multimodal model that merges the representational abilities of a pretrained visual encoder and\nthe generative powers of an LLM, capable of understanding and conversing about videos.\nVideo-ChatGPT leverages an adapted LLM [1] that integrates the visual encoder of CLIP [6] with\nVicuna [7] as a language decoder, fine-tuned on generated instructional image-text pairs. Our\napproach further adapts the desgin for spatiotemporal video modeling and fine-tunes the model on\nvideo-instruction data to capture temporal dynamics and frame-to-frame consistency relationships\navailable in video data. In contrast to other concurrent works for video-based conversation [8, 9],\nVideo-ChatGPT excels at temporal understanding, spatial consistency and contextual comprehension\nas demonstrated by our extensive evaluations.\nA fundamental contribution of this work is the creation of a dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs\nusing a combination of human-assisted and semi-automatic annotation methods. Each pair consists of\n*Equally contributing first authors\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2306.05424v1  [cs.CV]  8 Jun 2023\na video and its associated instruction in the form of a question-answer. This provides Video-ChatGPT\nwith a large and diverse dataset to learn from, increasing its video-specific understanding, attention to\ntemporal relationships and conversation capabilities.\nMoreover, we introduce the first quantitative video conversation evaluation framework for bench-\nmarking, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the performance of video conversation models.\nThis framework evaluates models on a variety of capabilities, such as correctness of information,\ndetail orientation, contextual understanding, temporal understanding, and consistency.\nThe contributions of this work are as follows,\n\u2022 We propose Video-ChatGPT, a video conversation model capable of generating meaningful\nconversations about videos. It combines the capabilities of LLMs with a pretrained visual\nencoder adapted for spatiotemporal video representations.\n\u2022 We introduce 100,000 high-quality video instruction pairs together with a novel annotation\nframework that is scalable and generates a diverse range of video-specific instruction sets.\n\u2022 We develop the first quantitative video conversation evaluation framework for benchmarking\nvideo conversation models. We demonstrate Video-ChatGPT to perform well compared to\nconcurrent conversational engines for videos such as Video Chat [8].\n2\nRelated Work\nVision Language Models: Significant advancements in the field of computer vision have recently\nbeen observed due to the development of many foundational vision-language models. These models\nrepresent a significant leap towards creating general-purpose vision models capable of tackling\nvarious tasks simultaneously [6, 10\u201312]. A prime example is CLIP [6], which is trained on 400M\nimage-text pairs and has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on numerous benchmarks.\nIt has been employed in various downstream applications, from image-based object detection and\nsegmentation [13, 14] to 3D applications [15, 16]. Numerous attempts have also been made to adapt\nCLIP for video applications [17, 16]. Similar to our design, ViFi-CLIP [18] suggests employing\ntemporal pooling across video frames to adapt the image-based CLIP model for video-based tasks.\nLarge Language Models: The field of natural language processing has witnessed a paradigm shift\nwith the advent of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT [19], LLaMA [20],\nOPT [21], and MOSS [22]. These models exhibit extraordinary abilities like language generation\nand in-context learning, and their knack for understanding intricate tasks given user prompts in a\nzero-shot manner reflects their impressive adaptability and generalization. The proven capabilities of\nLLMs have encouraged researchers to fine-tune them to maximize their proficiency.\nA key strategy in this pursuit is instruction tuning. This approach focuses on improving the model\u2019s\nalignment with user intentions and optimizing their output quality. For instance, InstructGPT [23] and\nChatGPT [24] significantly benefit from this technique, showcasing improvements in diverse conver-\nsational interaction capabilities and their aptitude to answer a broad range of complex questions. This\neffective approach has recently been employed in open-source models like Alpaca [25] and Vicuna [7],\nboth developed using the LLaMA [20] framework, resulting in performance improvements.\nPre-trained LLMs in Vision-Language Tasks: The recent strides in multimodal understanding\nhave primarily been driven by the integration of image-based vision models with LLMs. Seminal\ncontributions such as Flamingo [10] and BLIP-2 [4] have demonstrated the power of utilizing\nweb-scale image-text data, as well as pioneering techniques in cross-modal alignment, to exhibit\ndynamic abilities in conversational and few-shot learning contexts. Building on this foundation,\nMiniGPT-4 [2] allows image-based conversations by integrating BLIP-2 and Vicuna for zero-shot\nimage comprehension.\nEqually significant is the emergence of LLaVA [1], a model derived from the LLaMa architecture,\nleveraging GPT-4\u2019s language proficiency to generate multimodal instruction-following data. With\ninstruction tuning applied on the derived data, LLaVA has displayed interesting multimodal chat\ncapability, hinting at the scalability potential of such a methodology. In addition, InstructBLIP [5]\nmodel has demonstrated strong image-based dialogue capabilities via vision-language instruction\ntuning by innovating with instruction-aware visual feature extraction.\nMore closely related to our work, VideoChat [8] employs selective components of video foundational\nmodels [26] and image foundation models [4], and integrates them with LLMs [7] in conjunction\nii\nFigure 1: Architecture of Video-ChatGPT. Video-ChatGPT leverages the CLIP-L/14 visual encoder\nto extract both spatial and temporal video features. This is accomplished by averaging frame-level\nfeatures across temporal and spatial dimensions respectively. The computed spatiotemporal features\nare then fed into a learnable linear layer, which projects them into the LLMs input space. In our\napproach, we utilize the Vicuna-v1.1 model, comprised of 7B parameters, and initialize it with\nweights from LLaVA [1].\nwith few learnable layers, tuned using a two-stage lightweight training. Additionally, they construct a\nvideo-specific dataset using off-the-shelf vision-language models [27, 4, 28, 26] for generating noisy\ndetailed textual descriptions to enhance the training of video-centric conversational models.\nDifferent from VideoChat, we propose a novel human assisted and semi-automatic annotation\nframework for generation high quality instruction data for videos (see Sec. 4). Our simple and\nscalable architecture design utilizes pretrained CLIP [6] to generate spatiotemporal features which\nhelp Video-ChatGPT in generating meaningful video conversation. Further, we are the first to propose\nquantitative framework for evaluating video conversation tasks (see Sec. 4).\n3\nVideo-ChatGPT\nVideo-ChatGPT is a large vision-language model that aligns video representations with a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), thus enhancing its ability to generate meaningful conversation about videos.\nOur approach draws from the approach employed in designing vision-language (VL) models for the\nvideo domain. Given the limited availability of video-caption pairs and the substantial resources\nrequired for training on such data from scratch, these models commonly adapt pretrained image-based\nVL models for video tasks [16\u201318]. We adopt a similar approach, starting with the Language-aligned\nLarge Vision Assistant (LLaVA)[1] as our foundation.\nLLaVA is a LMM that integrates the visual encoder of CLIP [6] with the Vicuna language decoder [7]\nand is fine-tuned end-to-end on generated instructional vision-language data. We fine-tune this model\nusing our video-instruction data, adapting it for video conversation task. The video-instruction data is\nobtained as a combination of manual and automated pipelines in our proposed instruction generation\nsetup. This adaptation on video-specific instructions allows for accommodating additional temporal\ndynamics, frame-to-frame consistency, and long-range relationships present in video data. As a result,\nour Video-ChatGPT excels in video reasoning, creativity, and understanding of spatial, temporal, and\naction-oriented components within videos.\n3.1\nArchitecture\nWe use CLIP ViT-L/14, which is pretrained using large-scale visual instruction tuning in LLaVa, as\nthe visual encoder. However, LLaVa visual encoder is meant for images, which we modify to capture\nspatiotemporal representations in videos. Given a video sample Vi \u2208 RT \u00d7H\u00d7W \u00d7C with T frames,\nthe visual encoder generates temporal and spatial features. The visual encoder encodes the T frames\nindependently as a batch of images and produces frame-level embeddings xi \u2208 RT \u00d7h\u00d7w\u00d7D, where\nh = H/p, w = W/p. Here p is the patch size (i.e. 14 for ViT-L/14), and we represent the number of\niii\ntokens as N, where N = h \u00d7 w. Frame-level embeddings are average-pooled along the temporal\ndimension to obtain a video-level temporal representation ti \u2208 RN\u00d7D. This operation, referred to\nas temporal pooling, implicitly incorporates temporal learning through the aggregation of multiple\nframes. Similarly, the frame-level embeddings are average-pooled along the spatial dimension to yield\nthe video-level spatial representation zi \u2208 RT \u00d7D. The temporal and spatial features are concatenated\nto obtain the video-level features vi,\nvi = [ti\nzi] \u2208 R(T +N)\u00d7D.\n(1)\nA simple trainable linear layer g, projects these video-level features into the language decoder\u2019s\nembedding space, transforming them into corresponding language embedding tokens Qv,\nQv = g(vi) \u2208 R(T +N)\u00d7K.\n(2)\nNote that the function g acts as an adapter and can be implemented with more complicated architec-\ntures as well. However, we opt for a simplistic design that gives competitive performance compared to\nmore sophisticated choices in our experiments. The text queries are tokenized to the same dimensions,\nQt \u2208 RL\u00d7K. Here L represents the length of text query. Finally, Qv is concatenated with Qt and\ninput to the language decoder.\n3.2\nVideo Instruction Tuning\nWe employ instruction-tuning of the LLM on the prediction tokens, utilizing its original auto-\nregressive training objective. The pretrained model is finetuned with curated, high-quality video-text\npairs. During the finetuning phase, we use predefined prompts based on the following template:\nUSER: <Instruction> <Vid-tokens> Assistant:\nUsing the notations, we can represent it as,\nUSER: <Qt> <Qv> Assistant:\nIn this prompt, the <Instruction> represents a question pertaining to the video, randomly sampled\nfrom the training set of video-question-answer pairs. Questions can be general, asking to describe\nthe video, or they may relate to specific temporal, spatial, or creative aspects of the video content.\nThe prediction answer <Answer> corresponds to the specific question asked. Throughout the\ntraining, the weights for both the video encoder and LLM remain frozen, and the model maximizes\nthe likelihood of predicting tokens representing the answer by adapting the linear layer. Consequently,\nthe video features Qv become aligned with the pre-trained LLM word embeddings, equipping\nVideo-ChatGPT with the ability to produce more natural and dependable responses.\n4\nVideo Instruction Data Generation\nIn this section, we discuss our data-focused approach, which uses both human-assisted and semi-\nautomatic annotation methods to generate high-quality video instruction data. This data is crucial\nfor training Video-ChatGPT, making sure the model gives accurate and meaningful responses. Our\ndata collection involves two key methods. The human-assisted annotation, involves expert annotators\nanalysing video content and providing detailed descriptions. This process generates data rich in\ncontext and detail, which helps our model understand complex aspects of video content. On the\nother hand, the semi-automatic annotation framework is more cost-effective and scalable. Leveraging\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models, this method generates broad, high-volume annotations,\nthus increasing the quantity of data without compromising the quality substantially. Through these\ncombined methods, we have successfully accumulated a robust set of 100,000 video-instructional\npairs. This extensive dataset is crucial in fine-tuning our model to comprehend video content\neffectively, integrating both spatial and temporal cues into its understanding.\nOur instructional data is both diverse and comprehensive, incorporating a wide range of data types.\nThese include detailed descriptions, summarizations, question-answer pairs, tasks that stimulate\ncreativity or generation of new ideas, and conversational tasks. The data spans a broad spectrum of\nconcepts, ranging from visual appearance and temporal relations to complex reasoning tasks and\nbeyond, providing a diverse training ground for our model to learn from.\niv\nFigure 2: Examples of data enrichment via human-assisted annotation. Human annotators\naugment video descriptions from video-caption datasets. The captions are enriched by integrating\ndetailed information regarding spatial and temporal aspects, relationships, reasoning, scene descrip-\ntions, and the chronological sequence of events.\n4.1\nHuman-assisted Annotation\nIn this process, we leverage datasets containing video-caption pairs and utilize the expertise of\nhuman annotators to enrich the original ground truth annotations. Specifically, we use a subset of the\nActivityNet-200 [29] dataset which provides concise ground truth descriptions of various activities in\ndistinct video segments.\nThe annotators further enrich the captions by adding comprehensive information about physical\nappearances and spatial and temporal localization, among other critical contextual details. Figure 2\nshows an example of how a ground truth caption is enriched using human-assisted annotation.\n4.2\nSemi-automatic Annotation Framework\nIn addition to the rich human-assisted annotations, we also harness the capabilities of advanced\ndense image vision-language models, developing a semi-automatic annotation framework. This\napproach is cost-effective and scalable, thereby increasing the quantity of data without substantially\ncompromising the quality.\nSimilar to the human-assisted process, this framework also leverages datasets containing video-\ncaption pairs. We enrich these datasets using contextual information drawn from off-the-shelf dense\nprediction and captioning image-based vision-language models. These models provide predictions\nthat deliver additional contextual information, thereby enriching the video captions. We crafted\ndeveloped a comprehensive method that combines these predictions, and utilize specific models\nfor the purpose of eliminating noisy or irrelevant context from the data. This ensures that the data\nmaintains its accuracy and relevance.\nBuilding on the use of off-the-shelf models, we apply pretrained models like BLIP-2[4] and GRiT [27]\nfor key-frame analysis in the videos. The BLIP-2 image-captioning model generates frame-level\ncaptions, while the GRiT dense captioning model provides detailed captions for scene objects.\nAdditionally, the pretrained Tag2Text [28] model is used to generate tags for each key-frame of the\nvideo. Despite their utility, these models can introduce noise into the data.\nv\nFigure 3: Examples of data enrichment using our proposed semi-automatic annotation. We\nemploy off-the-shelf dense prediction and captioning models to augment video descriptions. The\nBLIP-v2 [4] model generates frame-level captions, while GRIT [27] is utilized for dense frame\ncaptions. Tag2Text [28] model generates tags for each key-frame, aiding in eliminating noise. All\nadditional context elements are combined with the video captions and undergo a GPT-assisted post-\nprocessing stage, generating the final detailed description.\nTo ensure high-quality data and mitigate noise, we implement three key steps. First, we maintain\na high prediction threshold for all off-the-shelf models to uphold accuracy. Second, we employ a\nspecialized filtering mechanism that removes any frame-level caption from BLIP-2 or GRiT not\nmatching with the Tag2Text frame-level tags. This process involves extracting words from the\nframe-level captions that are within the predefined Tag2Text tags vocabulary, and eliminating any\ncaptions that contain words not in the tags for a given frame. This strategy acts as an additional\nfiltering layer, enriches the captions by integrating predictions from multiple models.\nIn the third step, we merge frame-level captions and use the GPT-3.5 model to generate a singular,\ncoherent video-level caption. This step augments the original ground truth caption with context from\nthese models. We also direct GPT-3.5 to discard inconsistent information across frames, ensuring a\nprecise, contextually rich video instruction dataset. Figure 3 illustrates how a ground truth caption is\nenriched using this process after all three refinement stages.\n4.3\nGPT-Assisted Postprocessing\nLastly, we implement a GPT-Assisted Postprocessing mechanism that refines and optimizes the\nenriched annotations, in order to generate high-quality video instructional data. We prompt GPT-3.5\nmodel to create question-answer pairs from the enriched and detailed captions that cover a wide\nvariety of aspects. These aspects include detailed descriptions, summarizations, question-answer\npairs, tasks that stimulate creativity or the generation of new ideas, and conversational tasks.\nEach of these elements plays a crucial role in our data-centric approach. Our ultimate goal is to create\na video-based conversation model that is accurate, capable of understanding video content from both\nspatial and temporal cues, and adept at engaging in conversations.\nvi\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nImplementation Details\nWe use LLaVA as our baseline model and finetune it on 100K video instruction pairs. We only\nupdate the linear layer projecting the video features to the LLMs\u2019 input space, while the rest of the\narchitecture is kept frozen. We finetune the model for 3 epochs using a learning rate of 2e\u22125 and an\noverall batch size of 32. The training of our 7B model took around 3 hours on 8 A100 40GB GPUs.\nDuring inference, for memory efficiency, we load the models in FP16 mode.\nIn our semi-automatic annotation framework, we use Katna [30] to extract the video key-frames. For\nthe off-the-shelf Tag2Text [28] model, we use the Swin-B version with input size of 384\u00d7384 and\nconfidence threshold of 0.7. For GRIT [27], we use ViT-B version with CenterNet2 [31].\n5.2\nQuantitative evaluation\nIn this section, we highlight a key contribution of our work: the quantitative evaluation of Video-\nChatGPT using advanced metrics and comparative evaluations with existing state-of-the-art models.\nWe conduct two types of quantitative evaluations: i) Video-based Generative Performance Bench-\nmarking and ii) Zero-Shot Question-Answer Evaluation.\nEvaluation Aspect\nVideo Chat\nVideo-ChatGPT\nCorrectness of Information\n2.25\n2.50\nDetail Orientation\n2.50\n2.57\nContextual Understanding\n2.54\n2.69\nTemporal Understanding\n1.98\n2.16\nConsistency\n1.84\n2.20\nTable 1: Performance benchmarking of text generation models. An in-depth comparative analysis\nof Video-ChatGPT and Video Chat [8] across five key evaluation aspects we propose in our benchmark.\nVideo-ChatGPT shows competent performance across all key aspects.\nVideo-based Text Generation Performance Benchmarking: We introduce a benchmark to evaluate\nthe text generation performance of video-based conversation models. To do this, we curate a test set\nbased on the ActivityNet-200 dataset [29], featuring videos with rich, dense descriptive captions and\nassociated question-answer pairs from human annotations. We also develop an evaluation pipeline\nusing the GPT-3.5 model. This pipeline assesses various capabilities of the model and assigns a\nrelative score to the generated predictions on a scale of 1-5, in the following five aspects:\n(i) Correctness of Information: We verify the accuracy of the generated text, ensuring it aligns\nwith the video content and doesn\u2019t misinterpret or misinform.\n(ii) Detail Orientation: We evaluate the depth of the model\u2019s responses, looking for both\ncompleteness, meaning the model\u2019s response covers all major points from the video, and\nspecificity, denoting the inclusion of specific details rather than just generic points in the\nmodel\u2019s response.\n(iii) Contextual Understanding: We assess the model\u2019s understanding of the video\u2019s context,\nchecking if its responses aligns with the overall context of the video content.\n(iv) Temporal Understanding: We examine the model\u2019s grasp of the temporal sequence of events\nin the video when answering questions.\n(v) Consistency: We evaluate the model\u2019s consistency across different but similar questions or\ndifferent sections of the video.\nWe present the results of the evaluation of our proposed model, Video-ChatGPT, using the quantitative\nbenchmarking framework in Table 1. The results reveal its competent performance across all key\naspects when compared with the recently introduced contemporary video conversation model, Video\nChat [8]. Video-ChatGPT shows good performance, largely due to the instruction tuning we perform\nand its straightforward architecture that leverages LLMs with a pretrained visual encoder fine-tuned\nfor video data. This provides it with the robust ability to generate contextually relevant, detailed, and\ntemporally accurate text from video input.\nvii\nModel\nMSVD-QA\nMSRVTT-QA\nTGIF-QA\nActivity Net-QA\nAccuracy\nScore\nAccuracy\nScore\nAccuracy\nScore\nAccuracy\nScore\nFrozenBiLM\n32.2\n\u2013\n16.8\n\u2013\n41.0\n\u2013\n24.7\n\u2013\nVideo Chat\n56.3\n2.8\n45.0\n2.5\n34.4\n2.3\n26.5\n2.2\nVideo-ChatGPT\n64.9\n3.3\n49.3\n2.8\n51.4\n3.0\n35.2\n2.7\nTable 2: Zeroshot question-answering comparison of Video-ChatGPT with other video generative\nmodels. Video-ChatGPT performs competitively across all datasets.\nZero-Shot Question-Answer Evaluation: We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation\nusing several commonly used open-ended question-answer datasets: MSRVTT-QA [32], MSVD-\nQA [32], TGIF-QA FrameQA [33], and ActivityNet-QA [34]. These evaluations were carried out\nin a zero-shot manner, employing GPT-assisted evaluation to assess the model\u2019s capabilities. This\nevaluation process measures the accuracy of the model\u2019s generated predictions and assigns a relative\nscore on a scale of 1-5.\nTo benchmark Video-ChatGPT, we compared its performance with other significant models, such as\nFrozenBiLM [35] and the generative video model, Video Chat. FrozenBiLM is a model that adapts\nfrozen bidirectional language models pretrained on Web-scale text-only data to multi-modal inputs,\nshowing promising results in zero-shot VideoQA settings. Despite the solid foundation established\nby these models, Video-ChatGPT consistently outperformed them, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance across all datasets. These results indicate Video-ChatGPT\u2019s ability to understand video\ncontent and generate accurate, contextually rich answers to questions.\n5.3\nQualitative Evaluation\nWe performed an extensive evaluation of our model on a variety of open-ended video question-\nanswering tasks, utilizing diverse videos sourced from ActivityNet and YouTube. The evaluation\ntasks included video reasoning (Figure 4), creative and generative tasks (see Figure 5), spatial\nunderstanding (Figure 6), action recognition (Figure 7), video conversation (Figure 8), question\nanswering (Figure 9) and temporal understanding (Figure 10). Our model demonstrates proficiency\nin comprehending the content of the videos and generating accurate responses across multiple video\nbased task. Our model can effectively understand the visual information present in the videos and\nprovide precise answers (see Figures 4 to 10).\n6\nConclusion and Future Directions\nIn this work, we presented Video-ChatGPT, a multimodal model that merges a pretrained visual\nencoder with a large language model (LLM) to enable video understanding and conversations based\non videos. Video-ChatGPT leverages an adapter on top of pretrained LLM and vision backbones\nand is fine-tuned on video-instruction data to capture temporal dynamics and spatial consistency\nrelationships in spatiotemporal sequences. A dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs is created\nto enhance Video-ChatGPT\u2019s video-specific understanding and conversation capabilities. The work\nalso introduced a quantitative video conversation evaluation framework for benchmarking, evaluating\nmodels on a diverse set of capabilities including conventional video question answering as well as\nopen-ended descriptions. While the model performs competitively in several scenarios, we note\nit finds it challenging to understand subtle temporal relationships and the visual details of small\nobjects. As a future work, Video-ChatGPT can be extended to simultaneously deal with multiple\nmodalities and to enhance its video comprehension capabilities towards an all-in-one dialogue agent\nfor universal visual content understanding.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank colleagues for their contribution to the video annotation task, including\nAbdelrahman Shaker, Shahina Kunhimon, Muhammad Uzair, Sanoojan Baliah, Malitha Gunaward-\nhana, Akhtar Munir, Vishal Thengane, Vignagajan Vigneswaran, Jiale Cao, Nian Liu, Muhammad\nAli, Gayal Kurrupu, Roba Al Majzoub, Jameel Hassan, Hanan Ghani, Muzammal Naseer, Akshay\nDudhane, Jean Lahoud, Awais Rauf, Sahal Shaji, Bokang Jia.\nviii\nFigure 4: Video Reasoning Task.

MAM offers several significant advantages over pre-\nvious specialized image matting networks: (i) MAM is ca-\npable of dealing with various types of image matting, in-\ncluding semantic, instance, and referring image matting\nwith only a single model; (ii) MAM leverages the feature\nmaps from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [21] and\nadopts a lightweight Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module to pre-\ndict the alpha matte through iterative refinement, which has\nonly 2.7 million trainable parameters. (iii) By incorporat-\ning SAM, MAM simplifies the user intervention required for\nthe interactive use of image matting from the trimap to the\nbox, point, or text prompt. We evaluate the performance\nof MAM on various image matting benchmarks, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that MAM achieves com-\nparable performance to the state-of-the-art specialized im-\nage matting models under different metrics on each bench-\nmark. Overall, MAM shows superior generalization ability\nand can effectively handle various image matting tasks with\nfewer parameters, making it a practical solution for unified\nimage matting. Our code and models are open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/SHI-Labs/Matting-Anything.\n1. Introduction\nImage Matting, as a long-standing computer vision task,\naims to estimate the alpha matte \u03b1 given an input image\nI [45]. The matting target is mainly around human beings or\nother objects at the semantic level [26,41,49]. Recent works\n1\narXiv:2306.05399v2  [cs.CV]  16 Nov 2023\nhave extended the scope of image matting to more complex\nscenarios like image instance matting [42], which requires\ninstance-aware alpha matte predictions and referring image\nmatting [28], which extracts the alpha matte given natural\nlanguage description.\nPrevious deep learning-based image matting meth-\nods [28, 29, 36, 37, 42, 47, 51, 54, 59] have been proposed\nto address specific image matting tasks on correspond-\ning benchmarks. These methods are tailored to individual\ndatasets and lack the flexibility to handle various image\nmatting tasks due to their fixed model designs. This lim-\nitation has hindered the development of more generalized\nand versatile image matting models. As a result, there is a\ngrowing interest in developing more adaptive and efficient\nimage matting frameworks that can handle different types\nof image matting tasks with a single model.\nFurthermore, previous image matting methods have re-\nlied on user-guided trimaps as auxiliary inputs to achieve\naccurate alpha matte predictions. Although some trimap-\nfree methods have been proposed that use mask guidance\nor background images instead [39, 55], they are unable to\nestimate the alpha matte of the target instance based on the\nuser request for interactive use. Therefore, it is crucial to\ndevelop a model that can achieve accurate alpha matte es-\ntimation without relying on user-guided trimaps, while also\nbeing capable of handling simple user requests in a flexi-\nble and efficient manner for interactive use. Such a model\nwould significantly enhance the user experience by reduc-\ning the extra need for manual intervention.\nMotivated by these limitations of image matting, we pro-\npose the Matting Anything Model (MAM), a versatile net-\nwork that can estimate the alpha matte of any target in-\nstance with prompt-based user guidance in an image as\nshown in Figure 1. MAM leverages the recent Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) framework [21], which supports\nflexible prompting and outputs segmentation masks of any\ntarget instance for interactive use. Specifically, MAM takes\nthe feature maps and mask outputs from SAM as inputs and\nadds a lightweight Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module to predict\nthe alpha matte of the target instance. We trained MAM on a\ncombination of five image matting datasets that cover differ-\nent classes of instances, allowing the M2M module to learn\ngeneralizable features for image matting. During training,\nwe randomly place target instances onto background im-\nages and use a pre-trained SAM to output mask predictions\nof the corresponding instances. The trainable M2M mod-\nule then refines the mask by predicting multi-scale alpha\nmattes. Through an iterative refinement process based on\nthe mask or the alpha matte, the multi-scale predictions are\nmerged to obtain the final meticulous alpha matte.\nWe conducted extensive evaluations of MAM on six im-\nage matting benchmarks, including semantic image mat-\nting benchmark PPM-100 [40], AM2K [25] PM-10K [25],\nthe instance image matting benchmark RWP636 [55],\nHIM2K [42], and the referring image matting benchmark\nRefMatte-RW100 [28]. Our results demonstrate that MAM\nachieves performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art\nimage matting models across all benchmarks under differ-\nent evaluation metrics. The experimental results highlight\nthe versatility and effectiveness of our proposed approach\nfor handling various image matting tasks in an interactive\nand efficient manner.\n2.

Image Matting\nGiven an image I, which can be view as a combination\nof foreground image F and background image B with co-\nefficient alpha matte \u03b1,\nI = \u03b1F + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)B\n(1)\nImage Matting is to estimate \u03b1 given only I as inputs.\nTraditional methods rely on a user-guided trimap, which\nexplicitly annotates the absolute foreground area, absolute\nbackground area, and transition area. Then, sampling-based\nimage matting solutions use low-level features to distin-\nguish the transition areas by measuring the similarities be-\ntween foreground and background neighbors [1,2,5,8,9,11].\nRecently, deep learning-based methods [27, 36, 47, 51, 54,\n59] adopt neural networks to estimate the alpha matte in an\nend-to-end manner with trimap as auxiliary inputs. Some\ntrimap-free methods use background image [39], mask\nguidance [32, 55], or segmentation data [4, 30] to make up\nthe absence of trimap.

Interactive mat-\nting methods [28, 48, 52] develop specialized models that\nuse point, boxes, or text input to estimate the alpha matte of\nthe target instance. MatAny [53] is a concurrent work that\nalso adopts SAM for semantic image matting. In terms of\nvideo matting, trimap-free [22\u201324, 30, 40] methods are ex-\nplored for real-time inference while the per-frame predic-\ntion quality is not comparable to image matting methods.\nHowever, these methods are designed for a certain scenario\nwith corresponding benchmarks, which limits their poten-\ntial to handle various image matting tasks and benchmarks\nsimultaneously.\n2.2.

Matting Anything Model Architecture. The MAM architecture consists of a pre-trained SAM and an M2M module. Given an\ninput image I, SAM generates the mask prediction for the target instance based on the box or point user prompt.

Similar to image matting, many im-\nage segmentation methods are tailored for a specific im-\nage segmentation task, like semantic segmentation [3, 15],\ninstance segmentation [13, 46], and panoptic segmenta-\ntion [20, 44]. Recent works started to explore transformer-\nbased frameworks [6,12,16,17] for unified image segmen-\ntation. Language-guided segmentation frameworks [50,58]\nlook for text supervision to segment instance-aware masks.\nOneFormer [16] adopts a single transformer model to learn\nwith a joint training strategy and performs universal seg-\nmentation across semantic, instance and panoptic segmen-\ntation and outperforms specialized models. SAM [21] takes\na further step recently, which supports flexible prompting\nfrom users to segment any instance in an image for inter-\nactive use. Grounded-SAM [33] incorporates DINO with\nSAM to add text prompt support. Foundation models like\nSAM offer opportunities for other areas to develop versatile\nframeworks to support a range of applications.\n3. Matting Anything\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the Matting\nAnything Model (MAM) architecture, which consists of\ntwo main components: the frozen Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) and the trainable Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module.\nWe first provide a brief review of the SAM, which is de-\nsigned to produce high-quality instance segmentation given\nuser-guided prompts. We then introduce the M2M mod-\nule, which enables the transformation of the binary masks\ninto high-quality alpha mattes. Finally, we describe how we\nconnect the M2M module with the SAM to gradually build\nthe end-to-end MAM.\n3.1. Segment Anything Model\nSegment Anything is a recently proposed foundation\nmodel for segmentation. Given an image I \u2208 R3\u00d7H\u00d7W ,\nSAM uses a ViT-based image encoder to obtain deep feature\nmaps F \u2208 RC\u00d7 H\n16 \u00d7 W\n16 . Then, a variety of N input prompts\nare encoded by the prompt encoder and sent to the mask de-\ncoder with the feature maps. The mask decoder returns a\nset of mask candidates mi \u2208 R1\u00d7H\u00d7W , i \u2208 N indicated by\nthe input prompts. With its flexible prompting mechanism,\nSAM allows for interactive use and is easily adaptable for\ndownstream tasks.\n3.2. Mask-to-Matte\nThe Mask-to-Matte (M2M) module is an integral com-\nponent of our Matting Anything Model (MAM) and is de-\nsigned to convert instance-aware mask predictions from\nSAM into instance-aware alpha matte predictions efficiently\nand smoothly. To achieve this, we utilize the feature maps\nand mask predictions generated by SAM as auxiliary inputs\nto M2M. To improve the accuracy of our predictions, we\nadopt multi-scale branches for predicting the alpha matte\nand merge these predictions through an iterative refinement\nschedule.\nMulti-Scale Prediction:\nGiven an input image I\n\u2208\nR3\u00d7H\u00d7W , the pre-trained SAM model produces feature\nmaps F \u2208 RC\u00d7 H\n16 \u00d7 W\n16 and mask prediction m \u2208 R1\u00d7H\u00d7W\non the target instance with prompt guidance.

The feature\nmaps are then upsampled to higher resolutions to make al-\npha matte predictions at 1/4 and full resolution, denoted\nas \u03b1os4 \u2208 R1\u00d7 H\n4 \u00d7 W\n4 and \u03b1os1 \u2208 R1\u00d7H\u00d7W , respectively.\nThe multi-scale predictions enable MAM to handle objects\nof varying scales and provide finer-grained alpha mattes for\ndetailed object extraction.\nIterative Refinement To improve the accuracy of global\nand local predictions, we use an iterative refinement pro-\ncess. We first compute weight maps wos8, wos4, and wos1\nthat highlight different areas of the image during training\nlike trimaps. These weight maps are used to compute losses\nfor each scale of prediction, with wos8 emphasizing the en-\ntire image for \u03b1os8 predictions, wos4 filtering out the back-\nground for \u03b1os4 predictions, and wos1 focusing only on the\ntransition areas. During inference, we gradually merge the\npredictions of \u03b1os8, \u03b1os4, and \u03b1os1 with the mask predic-\ntions m from SAM to obtain the final alpha matte prediction\n\u03b1 \u2208 R1\u00d7H\u00d7W .\n3.3. Matting Anything Model\nAfter the development of the Mask-to-Matte (M2M)\nmodule, we integrate it with the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) to enable end-to-end training and inference for the\nMatting Anything Model (MAM). This integration allows\nfor a comprehensive and unified framework that handles\nthe entire matting process, from feature extraction to alpha\nmatte prediction.\nMulti-Dataset Training To ensure the robustness and ver-\nsatility of our Matting Anything Model (MAM), we adopt\na multi-dataset training approach that encompasses diverse\nforeground instances and background images from various\nimage matting datasets. This selection allows us to cover\na wide range of instance classes and background scenar-\nios, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to handle different types\nof instances and backgrounds effectively. During the train-\ning process, we create composite images by combining a\nforeground instance F \u2208 R3\u00d7H\u00d7W with its correspond-\ning ground truth alpha matte \u03b1gt \u2208 R1\u00d7H\u00d7W and a back-\nground image B \u2208 R3\u00d7H\u00d7W . The composition is per-\nformed using the equation I = \u03b1gtF + (1 \u2212 \u03b1gt)B. We\nthen extract the bounding box (x0, y0, x1, y1) that encap-\nsulates the instance of interest within the composite im-\nage. Then, we send the image I and the bounding box as\na prompt to the pre-trained SAM, which returns the mask\nprediction of the instance. Then, we concatenate the image,\nmask and feature maps, and send them to the M2M mod-\nule, which further returns the multi-scale alpha matte pre-\ndictions \u03b1os8, \u03b1os4, \u03b1os1. The loss L is computed between\nthe multi-scale predictions and ground truth \u03b1gt as\nL(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os1, \u03b1os4, \u03b1os8) = \u03bbL1L1 + \u03bbLLapLLap\n(3)\nL1 is L1 loss and LLap is Laplacian loss used in [14,30,43].\nThe coefficients \u03bbL1 and \u03bbLLap control the contribution of\neach loss term, respectively. Both loss terms are computed\non multi-scale predictions as\nL1 = L1(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os1) + L1(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os4) + L1(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os8) (4)\nLLap = LLap(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os1)+LLap(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os4)+LLap(\u03b1gt, \u03b1os8)\n(5)\nMulti-Benchmark Inference During the inference phase,\nwe conducted extensive evaluations of the Matting Any-\nthing Model (MAM) on multiple image matting bench-\nmarks to assess its generality and adaptability.

Subsequently, M2M contributed to the refine-\nment of the alpha matte prediction by providing multi-scale\npredictions \u03b1os8, \u03b1os4, and \u03b1os1. Then, following the itera-\ntive refinements, we progressively updated the predictions\nby replacing the corresponding regions in the mask pre-\ndiction m with the respective multi-scale predictions that\ndemonstrated positive weight maps, while in some simple\ncases the replacement is directly done upon \u03b1os8 instead of\nm. This iterative refinement allowed us to refine the alpha\nmatte estimation iteratively and enhance the precision of the\nfinal prediction \u03b1 \u2208 R1\u00d7H\u00d7W .\n4. Experiments\nWe extensively evaluate the performance of MAM on\nsix diverse image matting benchmarks. Through compre-\nhensive evaluations using different metrics, we compare\nthe performance of MAM with state-of-the-art image mat-\nting models on each benchmark. The results demonstrate\nthat MAM consistently achieves comparable performance\nto specialized state-of-the-art models, reaffirming its versa-\ntility and effectiveness as a unified image matting solution.\n4.1. Implementation Details\nTraining Datasets During the training process, we ran-\ndomly select foreground instances from several image mat-\nting datasets, including Adobe Image Matting dataset [51],\nDistinctions-646 [54], AM2K [25], Human-2K [34], and\nRefMatte [28], to ensure a diverse range of instance classes.\nFor background images, we select them from two datasets:\nCOCO [31] and BG20K [25] to provide a mix of both real-\nworld and synthetic backgrounds.\nEvaluation Benchmarks To evaluate the adaptive ability\nof MAM, we test it on a variety of image matting bench-\nmarks including the semantic image matting benchmarks\nPPM-100 [40], AM2K [25], PM-10K [25], the instance im-\nage matting benchmark RWP636 [55], HIM2K [42], and the\nreferring image matting benchmark RefMatte-RW100 [28].\nThe box prompt is used for all benchmarks and the point\nprompt is only used in RefMatte-RW100. This comprehen-\nsive evaluation allows us to assess the generalization ca-\npability of MAM across various image matting tasks and\nbenchmarks.\nEvaluation Metrics We evaluate the accuracy of predicted\nalpha matte for MAM with commonly adopted evaluation\nmetrics. Specifically, we employ Mean Absolute Differ-\nence (MAD), Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD), Mean\nSquared Error (MSE), Gradient (Grad), and Connectivity\n(Conn) [38] as corresponding evaluation metrics. We scale\nMAD, MSE, Grad, and Conn by 103, 103, 10\u22123, and 10\u22123,\nrespectively. Lower values indicate better performance for\nthese metrics. Additionally, for instance-aware matting, we\nutilize Instance Matting Quality (IMQ) [42], which takes\nrecognition and matting accuracy into consideration simul-\ntaneously. Higher values indicate better performance for the\nIMQ metric.\nExperimental Settings We trained MAM on a combina-\ntion of training datasets using 8 RTX A6000 GPUs, with\na batch size of 10 images per GPU. Each image was a\ncombination of a randomly selected foreground instance\nand a background image. Images were cropped to a size\nof 1024 \u00d7 1024 and sent to a pre-trained ViT-B based\nSAM [21] with a bounding box prompt of the target in-\nstance.

The iterative refinement process is\nbased on the \u03b1os8 prediction for all three benchmarks. On\nthe PPM-100 benchmark, MAM achieves improvements of\n6.2 MSEall and 3.9 MADall over SAM.

Re-\nmarkably, MAM achieves superior performance when uti-\nlizing the bounding box as the prompt for SAM, surpassing\nthe text-based methods CLIPSeg and CLIPMat by a sig-\nnificant margin. Moreover, the use of bounding boxes as\nprompts offers user-friendly and intuitive interactions, as\nusers find it easier to provide bounding boxes compared to\ncomposing a fixed text paragraph. This observation sug-\ngests that the bounding box prompt is more effective for\ninteractive image matting than the text or point prompt for\nreferring image matting.\n4.3. Ablation Study\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the M2M\nmodule of MAM, considering that SAM remains frozen\nduring the training process.\nTo assess the performance\nof MAM, we select the real-world subset of the HIM2K\nbenchmark.\nSAM on HIM2K We begin by evaluating the pre-trained\nViT-B-based SAM using bounding boxes and points as\nprompts for the target instance.\nSAM with box-based\nprompts significantly outperforms the point-based prompts\nand the final mask output is selected based on the mask\nwith the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) score with\nthe bounding box. SAM demonstrates strong performance\non the HIM2K benchmark, achieving 61.15 IMQmad and\n74.01 IMQmse on the natural subset.\nBuilding MAM We then construct the M2M baseline by\nImage\nMG[51]\nMAM\nGT\nc\nFigure 3. Visualizations of alpha matte predictions from MGMat-\nting and MAM. Improvements are highlighted in the red boxes.\nintegrating the M2M module, which takes SAM\u2019s mask and\nfeature maps, as well as the image, as inputs. This base-\nline, comprising 3 connected refinement blocks and pre-\ndicting at 1/16 resolution, yields inferior performance com-\npared to SAM, as the low-resolution predictions lack fine\ndetails of the alpha matte. However, by gradually incor-\nporating multi-scale predictions and iterative refinement, as\ndescribed in Section 3.2, the performance of MAM im-\nproves. Additionally, the adoption of multi-dataset training,\nas outlined in Section 3.3, further enhances performance,\nresulting in 68.37 IMQmad and 81.56 IMQmse on the nat-\nural subset. Subsequently, we assess MAM\u2019s performance\non other benchmarks without retraining to validate its gen-\nerality and adaptability.\n4.4. Visualization\nIn Figure 3, we compare matting performance between\nMGMatting and MAM of images that contain multiple in-\nstances.\nThey both leverage mask guidance from SAM.\nIt shows that MAM is able to give more accurate alpha\nmatte predictions with only 10% parameters compared to\nMGMatting under the same mask guidance.\nIt also has\nfewer false positive predictions in other instances. In Fig-\nure 4, we further provide visualizations of the mask and al-\npha matte predictions from SAM and MAM. These images\nare selected from the semantic image matting benchmarks\n7\nImage\nSAM[21]\nMAM\nImage\nSAM[21]\nMAM\nGT\nGT\nc\nc\nFigure 4.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce Matting Anything Model\n(MAM), which uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM)\nas a guidance module with a lightweight Mask-to-Matte\n(M2M) module to refine the mask output into the alpha\nmatte of the target instance. M2M is designed to handle\nvarious image matting tasks, including semantic, instance,\nand referring image matting, using a single model based on\nuser prompts including points, boxes, and text. We evaluate\nMAM on six image matting benchmarks and demonstrate\nthat it achieves comparable performance to the specialized\nstate-of-the-art methods under various evaluation metrics.\nOur proposed model offers a more versatile and efficient\nsolution for interactive and unified image matting.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Yagiz Aksoy, Tunc Ozan Aydin, and Marc Pollefeys.

To determine the optimal hyperparameters, an\nautomatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark is essential. However, es-\ntablishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges associated\nwith evaluation accuracy and privacy protection. In response to these challenges,\nwe introduce a judge large language model, named PandaLM, which is trained\nto distinguish the superior model given several LLMs. PandaLM\u2019s focus extends\nbeyond just the objective correctness of responses, which is the main focus of\ntraditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital subjective factors such as relative\nconciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality.\nTo ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test\ndataset, where all contexts are generated by humans and labels are aligned with\nhuman preferences. Our results indicate that PandaLM-7B achieves 93.75% of\nGPT-3.5\u2019s evaluation ability and 88.28% of GPT-4\u2019s in terms of F1-score on our\ntest dataset. PandaLM enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less\ncost, evidenced by significant improvements achieved by models tuned through\nPandaLM compared to their counterparts trained with default Alpaca\u2019s hyper-\nparameters. In addition, PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations,\nthus avoiding potential data leakage. All resources of PandaLM are released at\nhttps://github.com/WeOpenML/PandaLM.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in the field of artificial intelli-\ngence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], with various applications from question answering [7, 8], machine transla-\ntion [9, 10] to content creation [11, 12]. The Alpaca project [13] has been a pioneering effort in\ninstruction tuning of LLaMA [14], setting a precedent for instruction tuning LLMs, followed by\nVicunna [15]. Subsequent research [16, 17, 18] have typically adopted Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters as a\nstandard for training their LLMs. Given the necessity of instruction tuning for these pre-trained mod-\nels to effectively understand and follow natural language instructions [19, 13, 20], optimizing their\ntuning hyperparameters is crucial for peak performance. Critical factors such as optimizer selection,\nlearning rate, number of training epochs, and quality and size of training data significantly influence\nthe model\u2019s performance [21, 22]. However, a research gap remains in the area of hyperparameter\noptimization specifically designed for instruction tuning LLMs. To address this issue, we aim to\n\u2217Equal contribution. Yidong did this work during his internship at Westlake University.\n\u2020Corresponding to wye@pku.edu.cn; zhangsk@pku.edu.cn; zhangyue@westlake.edu.cn.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2306.05087v1  [cs.CL]  8 Jun 2023\nconstruct an automated, reliable, and robust evaluation method, which can be integrated into any\nopen-sourced LLMs and used as the judging basis for hyperparameter optimization.\nThe development of such an evaluation method presents its own challenges, including ensuring\nevaluation reliability and privacy protection. Current methods often involve either crowd-sourcing\nwork or API usage, which could be costly, and time-consuming. Besides, these methods face\nchallenges in terms of consistency and reproducibility. This is primarily due to the lack of transparency\nregarding language model change logs and the inherent subjectivity of human annotations. Note that\nutilizing API-based evaluations carries the risk of potentially high costs associated with addressing\ndata leaks. Although open-sourced LLMs can be alternative evaluators, they are not specifically\ndesigned for assessment, thus making it difficult to deploy them directly as evaluators.\nOn the other hand, the labels of previous evaluation methods [23, 24] simply definite answers and\nfail to consider the language complexity in practice. The evaluation metrics of these procedures\nare typically accuracy and F1-score, without considering the subjective evaluation metrics that\nautoregressive generative language models should pay attention to, thus does not reflect the potential\nof such models to generate contextually relevant text. The appropriate subjective evaluation metrics\ncan be relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, formality, and\ncontext relevance.\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce a judge language model, aiming for Reproducible and\nAutomated Language Model Assessment (PandaLM). Tuned from LLaMA-7B, PandaLM is used\nto distinguish the most superior model among various candidates, each fine-tuned with different\nhyperparameters, and is also capable of providing the rationale behind its choice based on the reference\nresponse for the context. PandaLM surpasses the limitations of traditional evaluation methods and\nfocuses on more subjective aspects, such as relative conciseness, clarity, comprehensiveness, formality,\nand adherence to instructions. Furthermore, the robustness of PandaLM is strengthened by its ability\nto identify and rectify problems such as logical fallacies, unnecessary repetitions, grammatical\ninaccuracies, and context irrelevance. By considering these diverse aspects, we leverage PandaLM\u2019s\nability to distinguish the most superior model among candidates on the validation set and then provide\ninsights for facilitating hyperparameter optimization of instruction tuning.\nIn practice, we generate paired responses from a diverse set of similarly sized foundation models\nincluding LLaMA-7B [14], Bloom-7B [25], Cerebras-GPT-6.7B [26], OPT-7B [27], and Pythia-\n6.9B [28]. Each of these models is fine-tuned using the same data and hyperparameters as Alpaca [13].\nThe paired responses from these tuned LLMs constitute the input of training data for PandaLM. The\nmost straightforward approach to generate the corresponding target of training data is through human\nannotation, but this method can be costly and time-consuming [29]. Considering that GPT-3.5 has\nthe ability to provide reliable evaluation to some extent, to reduce costs, we follow self-instruct [19]\nto distill data from GPT-3.5 and apply heuristic data filtering strategies to mitigate noise.\nTo ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we develop a test dataset that aligns with human preference\nand covers a wide range of tasks and contexts. The instructions and inputs of test data are sampled\nfrom the human evaluation dataset of self-instruct [19], with responses generated by different LLMs\nand each label independently provided by three different human evaluators. Samples with significant\ndivergences are excluded to ensure the Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) of each annotator remains\nlarger than 0.85. PandaLM-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance, achieving 93.75%\nof GPT-3.5\u2019s evaluation ability and 88.28% of GPT4\u2019s in terms of F1-score on our diverse human-\nannotated test dataset.\nMoreover, as illustrated in Figure 1, adopting PandaLM\u2019s selected optimal hyperparameters covering\noptimizer selection, learning rate, number of training epochs, and learning rate scheduler brings\nnoteworthy improvements. When assessed using GPT-4 with a set of 170 instructions, a group of\nfive open language models, tuned with optimal hyperparameters selected by PandaLM, achieves\nan average of 47.0 superior responses and 26.2 inferior responses, outperforming those trained\nusing Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters. Note that the training data remains the same for conducting fair\ncomparisons. Moreover, when these LLMs are evaluated by human experts, using the same set of\n170 instructions, they exhibit an average of 79.8 superior responses and 25.2 inferior responses, once\nagain surpassing the performance of models trained with Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters.

For these models, the choice of hyperparameters\nlike the learning rate, batch size, or the number of training epochs can significantly influence their\nperformance [38, 39, 40]. This selection process becomes even more critical when fine-tuning these\nmodels on domain-specific tasks, where the optimal set of hyperparameters can vary significantly\namong different domains [41, 39].\nEvaluation of Language Models Accurate evaluation of language models is crucial in determining\noptimal hyperparameters, thus improving the models\u2019 overall performance [39, 38]. Conventional\nobjective metrics like perplexity [42] and accuracy [43, 44, 45, 46] on downstream tasks[24] provide\nvaluable insights, but they may not effectively guide the choice of hyperparameters to enhance\nLLMs [47] because evaluating LLMs requires other subjective metrics. Advanced language models,\nsuch as GPT-4 [1] and Bard [2], incorporate human evaluations as part of their testing method\nfor LLMs, aiming to better align with human judgements [29]. Although human-based evaluation\nmethods offer considerable insight into a model\u2019s performance, they are costly and labor-intensive,\nmaking it less feasible for iterative hyperparameter optimization processes.\nSubjective qualitative analysis of a model\u2019s outputs, such as its ability to handle ambiguous instruc-\ntions and provide contextually appropriate responses, is increasingly being recognized as a valuable\nmetric for evaluating models [23]. Optimizing hyperparameters with considerations towards these\n3\nLLaMA\nFoundation Models\nInstruction-Tuned Models\nEvaluation\nAPI-based \nData leakage \nAccess limit \nUnreproducible\nHuman \nTime consuming \nExpensive \nInconsistent\nPandaLM \nReproducible \nOpen source \nSafe & Efficient\nVicuna\nAlpaca\nBELLE\nBLOOM\nTraining cost: \nCtrain\nEvaluation cost: \nCeval\n1st iteration of Instruction-tuning pipeline\n2nd iteration of Instruction-tuning pipeline\n...\nN-th iteration of Instruction-tuning pipeline \nFigure 2: The pipeline of instruction tuning LLMs.\nqualitative measures could lead to models that perform more robustly in diverse real-world scenarios.\nThe previous qualitative analysis can be achieved either through human evaluators or through APIs\nof advanced language models, which is different from our motivation.\n3\nMethodology\nAs shown in Figure 2, the process of instruction tuning begins with a foundation model, which is then\nfine-tuned using instructions. The performance of each tuned model is evaluated to determine the\nbest output. This involves exploring numerous models, each tuned with different hyperparameters,\nto identify the optimal one. To facilitate this pipeline, a reliable and automated language model\nassessment system is essential. To address this, we introduce PandaLM - a judge LLM specifically\ndesigned to assess the performance of LLMs fine-tuned with various parameters. Our goal is to\nidentify the superior model from a pool of candidates accurately.\n3.1\nTrain Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe training data collection aims to create a rich dataset that allows the model to evaluate different\nresponses in a given context and generate an evaluation reason and a reference response using the\nsame context. As demonstrated in Figure 3, each training data instance consists of an input tuple\n(instruction, input, response1, response2) and an output tuple (evaluation result, evaluation reason,\nreference response). The instructions and inputs in the input tuple are sampled from the Alpaca 52K\ndataset [13]. The response pairs are produced by various instruction-tuned models: LLaMA-7B [14],\nBloom-7B [25], Cerebras-GPT-6.7B [26], OPT-7B [27], and Pythia-6.9B [28]. These models are\nselected due to their comparable sizes and the public availability of their model weights. Each\nis fine-tuned using the same instruction data and hyperparameters following Alpaca [13]. The\ncorresponding output tuple includes an evaluation result, a brief explanation for the evaluation, and\na reference response. The evaluation result would be either \u20181\u2019 or \u20182\u2019, indicating that response\n1 or response 2 is better, and \u2018Tie\u2019 indicates that two responses are similar in quality. As it is\nimpractical to source millions of output tuples from human annotators, and given that GPT-3.5 is\ncapable of evaluating LLMs to some degree, we follow self-instruct [19] to generate output tuples\nusing GPT-3.5. As illustrated in Figure 4, we design prompts carefully to guide the generation of\n4\n\"inputs\": {\n  \"instruction\": \"Find an example of the given kind of data\",\n  \"input\": \"Qualitative data\",\n  \"response1\": \"An example of qualitative data is customer feedback.\",\n  \"response2\": \"An example of qualitative data is a customer review.\" \n}\n\"outputs\": {\n  \"evaluation_result\": \"Tie\",\n  \"evaluation_reason\": \"Both responses are correct and provide similar examples of qualitative data.\",\n  \"reference_response\": \"An example of qualitative data is an interview transcript.\"\n}\nFigure 3: A training data example for PandaLM-7B.\ncorrect\nconcise\nclear\nexplanation\naccurate\ndetailed\nfollow the instruction\noriginal\nspecific\ncomprehensive\nformal\nlogical fallacy\nrepeats\nlacks specific\ngrammatical error\ncontext\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\nCount\n28776\n23939\n17749\n16113\n14189\n10528\n9504\n7444 7063\n6025 5436\n3125 2599 2218 2182 2062\nFigure 4: The top 16 words used in the PandaLM-7B evaluation reasons from randomly sampled 80k\nevaluation outputs.

The goal is to ensure PandaLM not only prioritizes objective response\ncorrectness but also emphasizes critical subjective aspects such as relative conciseness, clarity,\ncomprehensiveness, formality, and adherence to instructions. Besides, we encourage PandaLM to\nidentify and rectify issues like logical fallacies, unnecessary repetitions, grammatical inaccuracies,\nand the absence of context relevance. A heuristic data filtering strategy is then applied to remove\nnoisy data. Specifically, to address the observed inherent bias in GPT-3.5 regarding the order of input\nresponses even with carefully designed prompts, samples from the training dataset are removed if their\nevaluation results conflict when the orders of input responses are swapped. We finally obtain a filtered\ndataset containing 300K samples. The training data and self-instruct prompts are open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/WeOpenML/PandaLM.\n3.2\nPandaLM-7B Training\nIn this subsection, we provide details about the training procedure for PandaLM. The backbone of\nPandaLM is a 7B parameter variant of the LLaMA[14] model, as it exhibits strong performance on\nmultiple complicated NLP tasks[48].\nWe train PandaLM with the DeepSpeed[49] library, and Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)[50, 51]\nStage 2, on 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs. We use the bfloat16 (BF16) computation precision\n5\nLLaMA\nBLOOM\n40\nOPT\n41\nCerebras_GPT\n58\nPythia\n33\n6\n21\n14\n21\n(a) DAG of GPT-3.5.\nLLaMA\nBLOOM\n43\nOPT\n44\nCerebras_GPT\n60\nPythia\n35\n31\n17\n12\n24\n(b) DAG of GPT-4.\nLLaMA\nBLOOM\n44\nOPT\n47\nCerebras_GPT\n56\nPythia\n31\n8\n29\n16\n21\n26\n(c) DAG of humans.\nLLaMA\nBLOOM\n17\nOPT\n26\nCerebras_GPT\n50\nPythia\n7\n6\n32\n11\n22\n(d) DAG of PandaLM.\nFigure 5: Comparative Visualization of Model Performance. The instruction-tuned models use the\nsame training data and hyperparameters. A directed edge from node A to B indicates model A\u2019s\nsignificant superiority over B, while a dashed undirected edge indicates the two models are similar in\nperformance. The number associated with the directed edge (A, B) represents the difference between\nthe number of wins and losses for model A compared to model B. The absence of a number on the\ndashed undirected edge indicates that the difference between the number of wins and losses for the\nmodels is smaller than 5. We swap the order of two responses to perform inference twice on each\ndata. The conflicting evaluation results are then modified to \u2018Tie\u2019.\noption to further optimize the model\u2019s speed and efficiency. Regarding the training hyperparameters,\nwe apply the AdamW[52] optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a cosine learning rate scheduler.\nThe model is trained for 2 epochs. The training process utilizes a warmup ratio of 0.03 to avoid large\ngradients at the beginning of training. We use a batch size of 2 per GPU with all inputs truncated to a\nmaximum of 1024 tokens and employ a gradient accumulation strategy with 8 steps.\n4\nReliability Evaluation of PandaLM-7B\nTo ensure the reliability of PandaLM-7B, we create a test dataset that is labeled by humans and\ndesigned to align with human preferences for responses. Each instance of this test dataset consists\nof one instruction and input, and two responses produced by different instruction-tuned LLMs.\nThe paired responses are provided by LLaMA-7B, Bloom-7B, Cerebras-GPT-6.7B, OPT-7B, and\nPythia-6.9B, all instruction tuned using the same instruction data and hyperparameters following\nAlpaca [13]. The test data is sampled from the diverse human evaluation dataset of self-instruct [19],\nwhich includes data from Grammarly, Wikipedia, National Geographic and nearly one hundred apps\nor websites. The inputs and labels are solely human-generated and include a range of tasks and\ncontents. Three different human evaluators independently annotate the labels indicating the preferred\nresponse. Samples with significant divergences are excluded to ensure the Inter Annotator Agreement\n(IAA) of each annotator remains larger than 0.85. This is because such samples demand additional\nknowledge or hard-to-obtain information, making them challenging for humans to evaluate. The\nfiltered test dataset contains 1K samples, while the original unfiltered dataset has 2.5K samples.\nTo maintain high-quality crowdsourcing work, we involve three experts to annotate the same data\npoint concurrently during the annotation process. These experts receive specialized training that goes\nbeyond evaluating response correctness, enabling them to emphasize other crucial aspects like relative\nconciseness, clarity, comprehensiveness, formality, and adherence to instructions. Furthermore, we\nguide these annotators in identifying and addressing issues such as logical fallacies, unnecessary\nrepetitions, grammatical inaccuracies, and a lack of contextual relevance. After the trial phase of data\nannotation, we eliminate some low-quality labeled data. The final IAA amongst the three annotators,\nas measured by Cohen\u2019s Kappa [53], yields average scores of 0.85, 0.86, and 0.88 respectively,\nindicating a relatively high level of reliability for our test dataset. The distribution of the test data\ncomprises 105 instances of ties, 422 instances where Response 1 wins, and 472 instances where\n6\nTable 1: Comparative analysis of evaluation results from various annotation models.

An interesting observation from Table 1 is the shared\nsimilar partial order graph between GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PandaLM-7B, and humans. Furthermore,\nFigure 5 illustrates directed orders of model superiority (if model A outperforms model B, a directed\nedge from A to B is drawn; if model A and model B perform similarly, a dashed line from A to B is\ndrawn.), and provides a visual representation of comparative model effectiveness. The experimental\nresults indicate similarities in the preferences of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PandaLM-7B, and humans. Note\nthat for PandaLM, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, we swap the input response order and infer twice to procure\nthe final evaluation output. The conflicting evaluation results are revised to \u2018Tie\u2019.\nAs shown in Table 2, we conduct a statistical analysis comparing the accuracy, precision, recall, and\nF1-score of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PandaLM-7B against human annotations. GPT-4 demonstrated\nsuperior performance, recording the highest scores across all assessed metrics. Despite PandaLM-7B\nhaving the lowest F1-score, it still demonstrates a notable performance, achieving 93.75% of GPT-\n3.5\u2019s evaluation ability and 88.28% of GPT-4\u2019s in terms of F1-score. Moreover, we are committed\nto continuously training larger-sized versions of PandaLM to enhance its evaluation performance\nfurther.\nIn addition, beyond performance metrics, PandaLM-7B introduces unique advantages that are not\npresent in models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It offers open-source availability, enabling reproducibility,\n7\nTable 3: Evaluation of the effectiveness of PandaLM\u2019s selected hyperparameters and Alpaca\u2019s\nhyperparameters.

Furthermore, it provides unlimited access, removing any restrictions that\nmight hinder comprehensive evaluation and application.\n5\nUsing PandaLM-7B to Instruction Tune LLMs\nTo highlight the effectiveness of using PandaLM-7B for instruction tuning LLMs, we compare the\nperformance of models tuned with PandaLM\u2019s selected optimal hyperparameters against those tuned\nwith Alpaca\u2019s parameters using GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and human experts. This comparison evaluates\nmultiple tuned LLMs: LLaMA-7B, Bloom-7B, Cerebras-GPT-6.7B, OPT-7B, and Pythia-6.9B. The\nassessment is conducted on a validation set comprising 170 distinct instructions and inputs obtained\nfrom our 1K test set introduced in Section 4. Alpaca\u2019s tuning protocol involves training for three\nepochs with the final iteration\u2019s checkpoints being used. It uses the AdamW [52] optimizer with a\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a cosine learning rate scheduler. We perform a wider range of hyperparamters\nto tune LLMs using PandaLM-7B. Specifically, we explore checkpoints from each epoch (ranging\nfrom epoch 1 to epoch 5), four different learning rates (2e-6, 1e-5, 2e-5, 2e-4), two types of optimizers\n(SGD[54] and AdamW), and two learning rate schedulers (cosine and linear). In total, this creates a\nconfiguration space of 80 different possibilities per model.\nWe search for optimal hyperparameters among the 80 configurations. These are divided into four\nblocks, each containing 20 configurations. Sequential comparisons identify the best configuration in\neach block. The top configurations from each block are then compared to determine the overall best\nconfiguration. We repeat each comparison twice for robustness and carry out 800 comparisons in\ntotal. The conflicting evaluation results are modified to \u2018Tie\u2019. Key insights from our tuning process\ninclude: Bloom-7B performs best with SGD, a learning rate of 2e-5, and a cosine schedule over 5\nepochs. Cerebras-GPT-6.7B also favors SGD with the same learning rate but with a linear schedule.\nLLaMA-7B prefers AdamW, a learning rate of 1e-5, and a linear schedule over 4 epochs. OPT-6.7B\nachieves top results with AdamW, a learning rate of 2e-5, and a linear scheduler over 5 epochs.\nPythia-6.9B prefers SGD, a learning rate of 1e-5, a cosine schedule, and 5 epochs. This highlights the\nimportance of customized hyperparameter tuning for different models to achieve peak performance.\nWe also provide the analysis on data size and quality and LoRA when instruction tuning LLMs in\nAppendix B and Appedix C.\nAs illustrated in Table 3, for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and human, all base models achieve superior perfor-\nmance when tuned with PandaLM\u2019s selected hyperparameters compared to Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters.\nNote that the procedure of switching the order of input responses, as applied for PandaLM, is also\nimplemented for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to acquire more robust evaluation results. This outcome not only\nsupports the claim that PandaLM-7B can enhance the performance of models but also highlights its po-\ntential to further improve various large language models. In addition, as shown in Appendix A, based\non PandaLM\u2019s evaluation, the model demonstrating superior performance is LLaMA-PandaLM. It\nleads the ranking, followed by LLaMA-Alpaca, Bloom-PandaLM, Pythia-PandaLM, OPT-PandaLM,\nCerebras-PandaLM, OPT-Alpaca, Bloom-Alpaca, Pythia-Alpaca, and Cerebras-Alpaca. This order\nemphasizes the efficacy of PandaLM\u2019s approach in choosing hyperparameters, resulting in better\nmodel performance. Models tuned using PandaLM\u2019s hyperparameters tend to consistently surpass\nthose optimized with Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters in a hybrid ranking scenario, reinforcing the effec-\ntiveness of PandaLM. However, the base foundation model also plays a vital role, as demonstrated by\nLLaMA claiming both the first and second positions in performance.\n8\nTable 4: Comparison on several downstream tasks using lm-eval[24] between foundation models\nfine-tuned on Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters, and foundation models fine-tuned with PandaLM.

We\nselect classic yet challenging datasets that require strong reasoning ability or real-world knowledge,\nas well as popular datasets from existing LLM leaderboards[48]. The results show that models\nfine-tuned with PandaLM consistently outperform those optimized with Alpaca across most tasks.\nSpecifically, the LLaMA-PandaLM model achieves the highest scores in most tasks, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of PandaLM\u2019s approach in model fine-tuning. Even in other models like Bloom,\nCerebras, OPT, and Pythia, we observe a noticeable improvement in performance when PandaLM is\nused for optimization.\n6\nLimitations\nWhile the outcomes of our study are encouraging, we discuss several limitations here. Firstly, the\nselected range of hyperparameters used in this work is based on common practice and prior literature,\nand thus may not encompass the absolute optimal hyperparameters. While extending the search bond\nwill inevitably increase the computational cost. Another limitation pertains to the size of PandaLM.\nCurrently, we only support a 7B version. However, we are committed to continuously updating\nPandaLM to support larger sizes, including 13B and 65B versions in the future.\n7\nConclusion\nIn our exploration of hyperparameter optimization, we apply PandaLM-7B: an automatic and reliable\njudge model for the tuning of LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that the use of PandaLM-7B is\nfeasible and consistently produces models of superior performance compared to those tuned with\nAlpaca\u2019s default parameters. We are dedicated to continually enhancing PandaLM by expanding its\ncapacity to support larger models and analyzing its intrinsic features, thereby developing increasingly\nrobust versions of the judging model in the future.\n9\nReferences\n[1] OpenAI.

Notably, this ranking differs from those in\nFigure5, due to the variance in the test data: the test data for 6 is a sampled subset from that used in\nFigure5 which is deliberately chosen to ensure a high Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA). A discernible\npattern emerges from the rankings: models fine-tuned using PandaLM\u2019s hyperparameters consistently\noutshine their counterparts fine-tuned with Alpaca\u2019s. The top-rated model is PandaLM-LLaMA, fol-\nlowed by Alpaca-LLaMA, PandaLM-Bloom, PandaLM-Pythia, PandaLM-OPT, PandaLM-Cerebras-\nGPT, Alpaca-OPT, Alpaca-Bloom, Alpaca-Pythia, and Alpaca-Cerebras-GPT, in descending order\nof performance. This juxtaposition accentuates the effectiveness of PandaLM\u2019s hyperparameter\nselection in improving model performance, as models optimized with PandaLM consistently rank\nhigher than those using Alpaca\u2019s hyperparameters in the hybrid ranking. These findings underscore\nthe potential of PandaLM as a powerful tool in enhancing the performance of large language models,\nfurther supporting the assertion of its efficacy.\nAlpaca@llama-7b\nPandaLM@opt-6.7b\nAlpaca@bloom-7b\nPandaLM@Cerebras-GPT-6.7B\nAlpaca@Cerebras-GPT-6.7B\nAlpaca@opt-6.7b\nAlpaca@pythia-6.9b\nPandaLM@bloom-7b\nPandaLM@pythia-6.9b\nPandaLM@llama-7b\nFigure 6: Directed Acyclic Graph depicting the mixture ranking of models trained using both Alpaca\u2019s\nand PandaLM\u2019s hyperparameters.

Importantly, a relationship exists\nbetween the size and quality of training data. Thus, we focus on an ablation study of data size\nhere, but conducting a similar experiment on data quality is feasible. We derive the results from\nPandaLM-7B. The objective is to discern how much training data is required to reach each model\u2019s\npeak performance. Table 5 reveals the optimal quantity of training data varies among models. More\ntraining data typically enhances model performance. However, an optimal point exists for each model,\n14\nbeyond which further data doesn\u2019t improve performance. For example, the OPT model peaks at\n992,000 data points, indicating additional data does not enhance the model\u2019s performance.\nTable 5: Optimal training data size for each model.\nModel\nBloom\nCerebras-GPT\nLLaMA\nOPT\nPythia\nOptimal Training Data Size\n1,216,000\n1,344,000\n11,520,000\n992,000\n1,344,000\nC\nLoRA Analysis in Instruction Tuning\nWe further aim to evaluate the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [61] compared to full\nfine-tuning across various models, utilizing optimal hyperparameters. The results are also obtained\nfrom PandaLM-7B. Our analysis seeks to provide a comparative understanding of these tuning\nmethodologies. As shown in Table 6, the results for the Bloom model reveal a distinct advantage for\nfull fine-tuning, which triumphs over LoRA in 66 instances as opposed to LoRA\u2019s 35. Notably, they\ntie in 69 instances. In the case of the Cerebras model, full fine-tuning again proves superior, leading\nin 59 cases compared to LoRA\u2019s 40, despite drawing even 71 times. The trend of full fine-tuning\nsuperiority is consistent in the LLaMA model. Out of 170 instances, full fine-tuning results in better\nperformance in 48 instances, whereas LoRA emerges victorious in only 28 instances. The majority\nof the results are tied, amounting to 94 instances. In the OPT model, full fine-tuning once more\nshowcases its advantage with 64 instances of superior performance compared to LoRA\u2019s 33, while\nrecording a tie in 73 instances. Lastly, for the Pythia model, full fine-tuning leads the race with 71\ninstances of better performance against LoRA\u2019s 21, and a tie occurring in 78 instances. These results\nunderscore that full fine-tuning generally yields more favorable results compared to the use of LoRA,\nthough the outcomes can vary depending on the model. Despite the considerable number of ties, full\nfine-tuning holds the upper hand in most models, thereby highlighting its effectiveness. This suggests\nthat while LoRA may provide comparable results in some instances, a strategy of full fine-tuning\noften proves to be the more beneficial approach in enhancing model performance.\nTable 6: Comparison of LoRA and Full Fine-tuning.\nModel\nLoRA Wins\nFull Fine-tuning Wins\nTies\nBloom\n35\n66\n69\nCerebras-GPT\n40\n59\n71\nLLaMA\n28\n48\n94\nOPT\n33\n64\n73\nPythia\n21\n71\n78\nD\nData License and Maintenance Plan\nThe test data we create is open sourced at https://github.com/WeOpenML/PandaLM.

Recent\ntechniques have attempted to address this issue by performing joint diffusions in\nmultiple windows and averaging latent features in overlapping regions. However,\nthese approaches, which focus on seamless montage generation, often yield inco-\nherent outputs by blending different scenes within a single image. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose SYNCDIFFUSION, a plug-and-play module that syn-\nchronizes multiple diffusions through gradient descent from a perceptual similarity\nloss. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the perceptual loss using the pre-\ndicted denoised images at each denoising step, providing meaningful guidance\nfor achieving coherent montages. Our experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod produces significantly more coherent outputs for text-guided panorama\ngeneration compared to previous methods (66.35% vs. 33.65% in our user study)\nwhile still maintaining fidelity (as assessed by GIQA) and compatibility with the\ninput prompt (as measured by CLIP score). We further demonstrate the versatility\nof our method across three plug-and-play applications: layout-guided image gen-\neration, conditional image generation and 360-degree panorama generation. Our\nproject page is at https://syncdiffusion.github.io.\nFigure 1: Comparison of panoramas generated with prompt \u201cA photo of a rock concert\u201d by Blended\nLatent Diffusion [1] (top), MultiDiffusion [3] (middle), and our SYNCDIFFUSION (bottom). Blended\nLatent Diffusion, when applied on image extrapolation, often generates visible seams and repetitive\npatterns. MultiDiffusion creates seamless panoramas but fails to achieve global coherence across the\nimage. In contrast, our SYNCDIFFUSION synchronizes windows across the panorama by increasing\nthe perceptual similarity of the denoised output predictions. This results in significantly more coherent\npanorama outputs.\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2306.05178v3  [cs.CV]  29 Oct 2023\n1\nIntroduction\nDiffusion models have recently emerged as the forefront of generative models. Recent breakthroughs\nin text-to-image generation such as DALL\u00b7E 2 [36] and Stable Diffusion [39] are diffusion models\ntrained with billions of images. Compared with GANs [16], diffusion models offer advantages not\nonly in producing high-quality, realistic images but also in being utilized for conditional generation\nsetups such as inpainting [30, 34, 41], editing [31, 18, 7, 1, 2, 34], and deblurring [48, 9], with\nfew-shot [25, 12, 40] or even zero-shot [37, 36, 28, 46, 49] adaptation. The iterative reverse diffusion\nprocess can easily incorporate diverse conditions and regularizations at each step while guiding the\nentire process to produce realistic images. Hence, the diffusion model, once trained on a large-scale\ndataset, becomes a versatile and multi-purpose pretrained model that can be applied to various tasks\nand applications.\nRecent work has extended the versatility of pretrained diffusion models to generate arbitrary-sized\nimages or panoramas using either sequential [2] or joint [3] diffusion processes. Since typical image\ndiffusion models are trained to generate fixed-sized images, creating panoramic images requires\nstitching multiple fixed-size images together, which can be impossible to do seamlessly without\nconsidering integration in the generation process. Two approaches have been proposed to tackle\nthis issue. The first approach [2] involves generating the final output as a sequence of inpainting\nstarting from an initial image, where each consecutive view image is produced while fixing the\noverlapped region (which is referred to as image extrapolation in their work [2]). However, this\napproach often struggles to seamlessly extend the given image and also tends to repeat similar\npatterns, resulting in unrealistic panoramas as shown in the first row of Fig. 1. The other approach\nis joint diffusion [3], which operates the reverse generative process simultaneously across multiple\nviews while averaging the intermediate noisy images (or the noisy latent features) in the overlapped\nregions at each reverse process step. The blending of noisy latent features among the views at each\ndenoising step can effectively generate a seamless montage of images. However, it is important to\nnote that the content and styles of the images may vary across the views, resulting in a mixture of\ncolorful and black-and-white images in a single panorama, as shown in the second row of Fig. 1. The\nlack of consistency occurs because the latent features of the overlapped regions are simply averaged\nwithout considering the coherence between them.\nTo address the limitation of previous work that produces unrealistic or incoherent montages, we\npresent a novel synchronization module for joint diffusion, dubbed SYNCDIFFUSION. This module\nguides the reverse diffusion processes to achieve global coherence across different areas of the\npanorama image. Similar to previous guided diffusion methods [36, 30, 34, 41], our SYNCDIFFUSION\nguides the reverse diffusion process while adjusting the intermediate noisy images at each step. Our\nguidance is specifically provided as a gradient descent from a perceptual similarity loss calculated\nacross multiple windows. Various off-the-shelf perceptual similarity losses such as LPIPS [53] or\nStyle Loss [14] can be utilized in our framework. However, perceptual similarity losses computed\nwith noisy images cannot effectively guide the denoising process. Thus, we draw inspiration from\nthe non-Markovian formulation of DDIM [45] leveraging the prediction of the denoised output from\nthe current noisy image at each denoising step. We compute the perceptual similarity loss using\nthe foreseen denoised images at each step and then backpropagate the gradient through the noisy\nimages. By leveraging the synergy with a prior seamless stitching technique [3] based on averaging\nlatent features at each denoising step, our joint diffusion framework demonstrates the capability to\ngenerate montages that exhibit both local seamlessness and global coherence, as shown in the last\nrow of Fig. 1. This is achieved in a zero-shot manner, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning of\nexisting diffusion models.\nIn our experiments on text-guided panorama generation using Stable Diffusion 2.0 [39] model, the\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher coherence compared to previous\nmethods. Quantitatively, as we increase the weight of the gradient descent, we observe improved\ncoherence, measured by LPIPS [53] and Style Loss [14], while maintaining fidelity (measured by\nGIQA [17]) and compatibility with the input prompt (assessed by the CLIP score [19]). Diversity,\nmeasured by FID and KID, exhibits a trade-off with coherence, but our method still achieves much\nbetter scores compared to the baseline method. Our user studies confirm a significant preference\nfor our method (66.35%) over the previous method (33.65%) in terms of coherence, while also\nsuggesting superior image quality and higher prompt compatibility. Moreover, we further demonstrate\nthe versabtility of SYNCDIFFUSION across three plug-and-play applications: layout-guided image\ngeneration, conditional image generation and 360-degree panorama generation.\n2\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nDiffusion Models\nDiffusion probabilistic models [44, 11, 21, 33] are a group of generative models that generate data by\nsampling from an initial Gaussian distribution and iteratively applying a denoising process (referred\nto as the reverse process). These methods have achieved remarkable strides in image generation\n[39, 11, 42, 36], surpassing previous image generation models including GANs [24, 6]. DDPM [21]\nwas among the pioneering models that showcased the impressive capability of image generation\nthrough Markovian forward and reverse processes, albeit with longer computation times in generation.\nThis limitation was addressed by DDIM [45], which significantly reduced the sampling time in the\nreverse process using a non-Markovian transition formulation conditioned on the predicted denoised\ndata. Furthermore, LDM [39] proposed incorporating the diffusion process into the latent space,\nachieving state-of-the-art realism in generated images and gaining attention in the text-to-image\ngeneration. Diffusion models have also demonstrated their applicability to diverse data modalities\nsuch as audio [50, 23, 29, 15], videos [22, 5], and 3D objects [35, 28, 46, 49].\n2.2\nFew-Shot or Zero-Shot Adaptation of Diffusion Models\nBuilding upon the remarkable generation capabilities of pretrained public text-to-image diffusion\nmodels such as Stable Diffusion [39], recent research has introduced various methodologies for\nleveraging the pretrained models in diverse tasks including conditional generation, image editing, and\nmanipulation, without the need to retrain the models from scratch. ControlNet [51] is an example of\na method that enables the incorporation of additional conditions into existing text-to-image diffusion\nmodels through few-shot finetuning, wherein the image encoder is duplicated to handle the additional\nconditional image, and only a carefully selected subset of parameters is modified during the finetuning\nprocess. Custom Diffusion [25] also introduces a similar idea of enabling few-shot tuning while\nkeeping the majority of parameters in the neural network frozen, but with applications of finetuning\nthe model for a particular class or concept of images. Other previous work has also demonstrated\nthat diffusion models can even be applied to novel tasks in a zero-shot manner. SDEdit [31] was the\nfirst to show zero-shot conditional image generation using a pretrained diffusion model by dispersing\nnoise over the conditional image and denoising it back to a real image. RePaint [30] introduced\nan image inpainting idea by combining a generated foreground image and a noised background\nimage at each time step. Similar guided diffusion ideas have also been explored for various tasks,\nsuch as image super-resolution [27, 13, 9, 43], colorization [41, 10], deblurring [48, 9], and style\ntransfer [26, 25, 12, 40]. We propose a novel guided diffusion framework for image montage\ngeneration via joint diffusion.\n2.3\nMontage Generation via Diffusion Models\nPanorama generation is one of the zero-shot applications of diffusion models. Since diffusion\nmodels are trained to generate images of a specific size and on a 2D plane, stitching is required\nto generate panoramas or textures. Most previous methods [38, 8, 2, 1] have employed inpainting-\nbased approaches for seamless stitching. These methods extrapolate the accumulated image and\nfill only the missing regions to generate the panorama or texture. In contrast, MultiDiffusion [3]\nand DiffCollage [52] conduct diffusion in multiple views jointly while combining noisy latent\nfeatures or scores at each reverse diffusion step. While both approaches have successfully produced\ncontinuous images, they have limitations in enforcing global coherence across the panorama or texture.\nMVDiffusion [47], a concurrent work, extends multi-view diffusion to produce non-square panorama\nimages such as 360 panorama images by leveraging pixel-wise correspondence and attention modules\nHowever, it focuses on achieving smooth stitching, without addressing global coherence. In this\nwork, we propose a simple yet effective synchronization module that can be integrated into any joint\ndiffusion process to achieve global semantic coherence.\n3\nBackgrounds\n3.1\nDiffusion Models\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n(DDPM) [21] and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) [45], which are the foundations of\nrecent pretrained image diffusion models. The aim of DDPM is to approximate the data distribution\nq(x0) with a tractable model distribution p\u03b8(x0), which takes the form of a Markov chain with\n3\nlearned Gaussian transitions p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) from p(xT ) = N(xT ; 0, I):\np\u03b8(x0) =\nZ\np\u03b8(x0:T )dx1:T ,\nwhere\np\u03b8(x0:T ) = p(xT )\nT\nY\nt=1\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt).\n(1)\nThe parameters of the joint distribution (known as the reverse process) \u03b8 are learned by minimizing\nthe negative evidence lower bound (ELBO):\nmin\n\u03b8\nEq(x0) [\u2212 log p\u03b8(x0)] \u2264 min\n\u03b8\nEq(x0,x1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,xT ) [\u2212 log p\u03b8(x0:T ) + log q(x1:T |x0)] ,\n(2)\nwhere q\u03b8(x1:T |x0) is the forward process adding a sequence of Gaussian noise to the data while\nincreasing the noise scale. Among the variations of the forward processes, DDPM uses the variance-\npreserving diffusion that parameterizes the Gaussian transitions as follows with a decreasing sequence\n\u03b11:T \u2208 (0, 1]T :\nq(x1:T |x0) :=\nT\nY\nt=1\nq(xt|xt\u22121), where q(xt|xt\u22121) := N\n\u0012r \u03b1t\n\u03b1t\u22121\nxt\u22121,\n\u0012\n1 \u2212\n\u03b1t\n\u03b1t\u22121\n\u0013\nI\n\u0013\n.\n(3)\nThe definition of the Gaussian transitions in the forward process derives the following property:\nq(xt|x0) := N(xt; \u221a\u03b1tx0, (1 \u2212 \u03b1t)I),\n(4)\nand thus matches the choice of the starting distribution in the reverse process (a unit Gaussian) since\nq(xT |x0) converges to a unit Gaussian when \u03b1T is set close to 0. It also allows expressing xt with\nx0 and a unit Gaussian noise variable \u03f5:\nxt = \u221a\u03b1tx0 +\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03b1t\u03f5,\nwhere\n\u03f5 \u223c N(0, I).\n(5)\nIn DDPM [21], the Gaussian transition p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) for each xt in the reverse process is modeled as\nfollows 1:\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) := N\n\u0012r\u03b1t\u22121\n\u03b1t\n\u0012\nxt \u2212\n1\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u03b1t\n\u0012\n1 \u2212\n\u03b1t\n\u03b1t\u22121\n\u0013\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\n\u0013\n, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0013\n,\n(6)\nwhere \u03c32\nt = 1\u2212\u03b1t\u22121\n1\u2212\u03b1t\n\u00b7\n\u0010\n1 \u2212\n\u03b1t\n\u03b1t\u22121\n\u0011\n, and \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) is a learned function that optimizes the objective\nin Eq. 2 when it maps each xt at time t to a unit Gaussian noise, thus resulting in the following\nsimplified loss:\nL(\u03f5\u03b8) :=\nT\nX\nt=1\nEx0\u223cq(x0),\u03f5t\u223cN (0,I)\n\u0002\n\u2225\u03f5\u03b8\n\u0000\u221a\u03b1tx0 +\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03b1t\u03f5t, t\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u03f5t\u22252\n2\n\u0003\n.\n(7)\nDDIM [45] provides a different perspective of seeing the same forward process as a non-Markovian\nprocess while taking the input data x0 into consideration in reversed transitions:\nq(x1:T |x0) := q(xT |x0)\nT\nY\nt=2\nq(xt\u22121|xt, x0),\nwhere\nq(xT |x0) = N(\u221a\u03b1T x0, (1 \u2212 \u03b1T )I)\nand\n\u2200s < t,\nq(xs|xt, x0) = N\n\u0012\u221a\u03b1sx0 +\nq\n1 \u2212 \u03b1s \u2212 \u03c32\nt \u00b7 xt \u2212 \u221a\u03b1tx0\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u03b1t\n, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0013\n.\n(8)\nThen, each transition in the reverse process is also redefined as first predicting the denoised observa-\ntion x0 given each xt and then sampling xt\u22121 via the conditional distribution q(xt\u22121|xt, x0):\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) :=\n\u001aq(xt\u22121|xt, \u03d5\u03b8(xt, t))\nif t \u2265 2\nN(\u03d5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03c32\nt I)\nif t = 1,\n(9)\n1Note that \u03b2t in the DDPM [21] is equivalent to 1 \u2212\n\u03b1t\n\u03b1t\u22121 in our paper and DDIM [45].\n4\nwhere\n\u03d5\u03b8(xt, t) =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n(xt \u2212\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03b1t\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t))\n(10)\nis the predicted denoised observation. The key observations of DDIM are twofold. First, the same\nsimplified objective (Eq. 7) can be used to find the best models \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) in Eq. 10 that minimize the\nnegative ELBO (Eq. 2). This means that the DDIM reverse process can be used with a pretrained\nDDPM without retraining. Second, a subset of the time sequence [1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T] can be used in the\nreverse process of DDIM since xs for any s < t can be sampled from xt via the x0 prediction,\nenabling a significant boost in the reverse process computation.\nIn the rest of the paper, the operation sampling the next denoised data in the reverse process with the\nlearned distribution p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) defined in either Eq. 6 (DDPM) or Eq. 9 (DDIM) is denoted as:\nS(xt, t, \u03f5),\n(11)\nwhich takes a noisy data xt at timestep t and a unit Gaussian noise \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I) as input.\n3.2\nJoint Diffusion\nIn an image diffusion model, each sample from the data distribution is either a 2D grid of per-pixel\ncolors, or a 2D grid of latent features (as in Latent Diffusion [39]) that can be encoded from or\ndecoded to a real image through a pretrained encoder E and decoder D. In the rest of the paper,\nthe term image will thus be used to refer to either a color image or a latent feature image, unless\nexplicitly stated otherwise. Image diffusion models pretrained on fixed-size images cannot be\nused directly to produce arbitrary-size images. MultiDiffusion [3] has addressed this limitation by\nusing a multi-window joint diffusion approach. The framework integrates images generated from\nmultiple windows seamlessly by averaging colors or features across the windows at every reverse\ndiffusion step. For instance, consider the case of generating a panorama image z \u2208 RHz\u00d7Wz\u00d7D.\nThe image at each window x(i) \u2208 RHx\u00d7Wx\u00d7D is a subarea of the panorama image whose union\nacross all the windows covers the entire panorama image. Let m(i) \u2208 [0, 1]Hx\u00d7Hx denote a binary\nmask for the subregion in the panorama image corresponding to the i-th window. The function\nTz\u2192i : RHz\u00d7Wz\u00d7D \u2192 RHx\u00d7Wx\u00d7D maps (crops) the panorama image z to the i-th window image,\nwhile Ti\u2192z : RHx\u00d7Wx\u00d7D \u2192 RHz\u00d7Wz\u00d7D is its inverse function that fills the region outside of the\nmask mi with zeros. During the joint diffusion process running the reverse process simultaneously\nfor each window, the noisy images from the windows x(i)\nt\nare first averaged in the panorama space:\nzt =\nP\ni Ti\u2192z(x(i)\nt )\nP\ni m(i)\n,\n(12)\nand then, the resulting combined noisy image zt is cropped again for each window x(i)\nt\n= Tz\u2192i(zt),\nmodifying the noisy image at each window with a inter-window regularization.\nFigure 2:\nPanoramas generated by MultiDiffusion [3] (left) and our SYNCDIFFUSION (right),\nwith a prompt \u201cA photo of a mountain range at twilight\u201d. MultiDiffusion often combines various\nscenes, such as mountains with trees and snow, and even awkwardly blends them. In contrast,\nSYNCDIFFUSION generates panoramas that are significantly more coherent.\n4\nSyncDiffusion\nWhile MultiDiffusion [3] can generate seamless panorama images from joint diffusion, it often fails\nto produce coherent and realistic montages. The left image in Fig. 2 demonstrates that the resulting\nimage often oddly combines various scenes, such as mountains with trees and snow. Also, the\nblending occasionally fails to merge them in a realistic manner, as shown in the figure where distant\nobjects are connected to closer objects. This incoherence issue in MultiDiffusion arises due to two\nmain reasons. Firstly, the averaging operation only aligns the colors or features in the overlapped\nregions but does not match the content or style of the images. Secondly, it only enforces adjacent\nviews to influence each other, and thus global coherence between distant windows cannot be achieved.\n5\n\ud835\udc9f(\ud835\udc31!)\n\ud835\udc9f(\ud835\udf19\" \ud835\udc31!, \ud835\udc61 )\n\ud835\udc9f(\ud835\udc31#)\n0.6485\n0.6433\n0.5416\n0.3501\n0.5911\n0.3704\nFigure 3: LPIPS [53] scores computed across the noisy images D(xt) at the intermediate step (t = 45\nout of 50) of the reverse process (left), the predicted denoised images D(\u03d5(xt, t)) at the same timestep\nt (middle), and the final generated images D(x0) at timestep t = 0 (right). The indistinguishable\nnoisy images yield similar LPIPS scores among them, whereas the predicted denoised images, which\nclosely resemble the final outputs even at the beginning of the denoising process, exhibit LPIPS\nscores that align with those of the final generated images. This indicates that the predicted denoised\nimages can provide meaningful guidance for producing coherent panoramas in the diffusion process.\nAlgorithm 1: Pseudocode of one-time denoising in SYNCDIFFUSION.\nParameters :w;\n// Gradient descent weight.\nInputs: {x(i)\nt }i=0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N\u22121;\n// Noisy images at timestep t.\nOutputs: {x(i)\nt\u22121}i=0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N\u22121;\n// Noisy images at timestep t \u2212 1.\n1 Function SyncDiffusion({x(i)\nt }):\n2\n\u02c6x(i)\nt\n\u2190 x(i)\nt ;\n// The anchor window at index 0 is not changed.\n3\nfor i = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1 do\n4\n\u02c6x(i)\nt\n\u2190 x(i)\nt\n\u2212 w\u2207x(i)\nt L\n\u0010\nD(\u03d5\u03b8(x(i)\nt , t)), D(\u03d5\u03b8(x(0)\nt , t))\n\u0011\n; // Gradient descent (Eq. 14)\n5\nreturn {\u02c6x(i)\nt };\n6 Function MultiDiffusion({\u02dcx(i)\nt }):\n7\nzt \u2190\nP\ni Ti\u2192z(\u02dcx(i)\nt\n)\nP\ni m(i)\n;\n// Averaging in the global space (Eq. 12).\n8\nfor i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 do\n9\nx(i)\nt\n\u2190 Tz\u2192i(zt);\n10\nreturn {x(i)\nt };\n11 Function DenoisingOneStep({x(i)\nt }):\n12\n{\u02c6x(i)\nt } \u2190 SyncDiffusion({x(i)\nt });\n13\nfor i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 do\n14\n\u02dcx(i)\nt\u22121 \u2190 S(\u02c6x(i)\nt , t, \u03f5);\n// Sampling the next denoised data (Eq. 11).\n15\n{x(i)\nt\u22121} \u2190 MultiDiffusion({\u02dcx(i)\nt\u22121});\n16\nreturn {x(i)\nt\u22121};\nTo address this problem, we introduce a module called SYNCDIFFUSION which enables the generation\nof coherent montages, as shown on the right in Fig. 2. This module can be easily integrated into an\nexisting joint diffusion framework. Similar to MultiDiffusion, our SYNCDIFFUSION module updates\nthe noisy image at every step of the reverse diffusion process. In contrast to averaging the colors or\nlatent features in the overlapped regions, however, SYNCDIFFUSION employs the backpropagation\nof gradients from a perceptual similarity loss computed across the windows to perform the update.\nThe perceptual similarity loss, denoted as L, can utilize any off-the-shelf loss function for perceptual\nsimilarity, such as LPIPS [53] and Style Loss [14]. To facilitate efficient computation, we designate\nan anchor window with an index of 0. For each view\u2019s noisy color image D(x(i)\nt ) and the anchor\nwindow\u2019s noisy color image D(x(0)\nt ) (where the decoder D can be treated as an identity function\nif the given diffusion model operates in image space rather than latent space), one can measure the\ncoherence using the images and conduct gradient descent through x(i)\nt :\n\u02c6x(i)\nt\n= x(i)\nt\n\u2212 w\u2207x(i)\nt L\n\u0010\nD(x(i)\nt ), D(x(0)\nt )\n\u0011\n,\n(13)\nwhere w is the weight of the gradient descent. However, the coherence measured with the noisy\nimages cannot provide meaningful guidance.

Note that the LPIPS scores among the noisy images are indistinguishable. Hence,\nsimilar to the DDIM reverse process, we utilize the foreseen denoised observation of each noisy data\n\u03d5\u03b8(x(i)\nt , t) in Eq. 10. We measure the coherence not with the current noisy color images {D(x(i)\nt )}\nbut with the predicted denoised color images {D(\u03d5\u03b8(x(i)\nt , t))} with the timestep t and perform the\nbackpropagation of the gradient through x(i)\nt , resulting in the following updated formulation:\n\u02c6x(i)\nt\n= x(i)\nt\n\u2212 w\u2207x(i)\nt L\n\u0010\nD(\u03d5\u03b8(x(i)\nt , t)), D(\u03d5\u03b8(x(0)\nt , t))\n\u0011\n.\n(14)\nIn Fig. 3, the middle three images depict the predicted denoised images D(\u03d5\u03b8(xt, t)) at timestep\nt = 45, which closely resemble the final generated images D(x0) at timestep t = 0, even during\nthe initial stages of the reverse diffusion process. Therefore, the LPIPS scores among the predicted\ndenoised images also match those of the generated images, providing meaningful guidance for\nmaintaining coherence. During each denoising step in the joint reverse process, we apply this update\nto the noisy images for all windows {x(i)\nt }, and sample the one-step denoised images. MultiDiffusion\nis also applied to average the sampled images at the end. Refer to Alg. 1 for detailed pseudocode.\n5\nResults\n5.1\nText-Guided Panorama Generation\nIn our experiments, we generate panorama images using our SYNCDIFFUSION method and the\npretrained Stable Diffusion 2.0 [39] model. Stable Diffusion model operates in a latent space\nof R64\u00d764\u00d74 and generates images of R512\u00d7512\u00d73. We generate panorama images of resolution\n512 \u00d7 3072 (64 \u00d7 384 in the latent space), where the width is six times the width of the output\nof Stable Diffusion. Each window x(i) has an image resolution of 512 \u00d7 512, with a stride of\n128 pixels along the width in the image space which is equivalent to stride 16 in the latent space,\nresulting in a total 21 windows to operate diffusion processes jointly. We use six text prompts from\nMultiDiffusion [3] (see Sec. 6.8) and generate 500 panoramas per prompt. For the gradient descent\nweight w (Eq. 14), we experiment with various initial values while applying a weight decay with a\nrate of 0.95. We also set the center window as the anchor window with an index of 0.\nBaselines\nWe compare our SYNCDIFFUSION with previous methods that generate panoramas\nusing a pretrained diffusion model. Blended Latent Diffusion [1] is an inpainting-based method that\nextrapolates a single window image. MultiDiffusion [3], served as the base of our framework, is a\n7\nspecial case of our method when the weight of gradient descent w is 0. The same Stable Diffusion\n2.0 model is used for all the methods for a fair comparison.\nEvaluation Metrics\nWe utilize a range of metrics to assess the coherence, fidelity, diversity, and\ncompatibility of the output panoramas with the input prompt.\n\u2022 (Coherence) Intra-LPIPS [53] and Intra-Style-L [14]: To assess the coherence of the generated\npanoramas, we introduce two metrics. Intra-LPIPS and Intra-Style-L, which are computed as\nthe averages of LPIPS [53] and Style Loss [14], respectively, between a pair of non-overlapping\nwindow images from the same panorama. Specifically, we divide the panorama into 6 windows,\neach with dimensions of 512 \u00d7 512 and then compute the average of LPIPS and Style Loss across\nthe 15 combinations of these cropped views. To provide a reference for the scale of these values,\nwe generate 500 single-window-size images using the same Stable Diffusion model and compute\nthe LPIPS and Style Loss for randomly selected 1,000 pairs of these reference images.\n\u2022 (Fidelity) Mean-GIQA [17]: GIQA quantifies the fidelity of individual images by calculating the\ninverse of the distance between a query image and a reference set in a feature space. Mean-GIQA\nis computed by taking a single random crop of each panorama in 512 \u00d7 512 size and computing\nthe average GIQA score from each cropped image to the reference set of images mentioned above.\n\u2022 (Fidelity & Diversity) FID [20] and KID [4]: FID [20] and KID [4] are used to measure both\nfidelity and diversity. Both of them are measured with the aforementioned randomly cropped\nimages and the set of reference images.\n\u2022 (Compatibility with the Input Prompt) Mean-CLIP-S [19]: The compatibility with the input\nprompt is assessed using the mean of CLIP scores [19], denoted as Mean-CLIP-S. This met-\nric is calculated using the same set of cropped images and the input prompt.\nQualitative Comparisons\nFig. 4 showcases qualitative comparisons between our method and the\nbaseline methods. Here, we show the results of our method generated with a weight parameter of\nw = 20. Blended Latent Diffusion [1] often exhibits visible seams due to the sequential inpainting\nscheme and produces repetitive patterns in the extrapolation, as illustrated by the mountains in the\nsecond case of the top row and the flowers and trees in both cases of the bottom row. MultiDiffusion [3]\nachieves seamless outputs, although it often produces incoherent outputs, such as mixing a sunset\nsky with a blue sky, as shown in the second cases of the first and second rows, and pink and purple\nbackgrounds with blue backgrounds in the two cases of the bottom row. Our SYNCDIFFUSION\ngenerates visually and semantically more coherent panoramas with all the prompts. More qualitative\ncomparisons are provided in the Appendix (6.1, 6.8).\nQuantitative Results\nFig. 5.1 presents a quantitative comparison among the methods. Our method\u2019s\nresults are displayed using two different gradient descent weights, w = 10 and 20. MultiDiffusion [3]\nis also the case when w = 0 in our framework. For results obtained with different weights, please refer\nto the Appendix (6.2). The color bars in the plots indicate the average scores across the six prompts,\nwhile the black lines depict the standard deviation. Note that as the gradient weight increases, both\nIntra-LPIPS and Intra-Style-L decrease. When w = 20, the Intra-LPIPS and Intra-Style-L of our\nmethod are approximately 3/4 and 1/6 of those computed with the reference set images (referred\nto as SD, Stable Diffusion), respectively, indicating significantly higher coherence. Moreover, the\nMean-CLIP-S and Mean-GIQA scores are comparable to those computed with the reference set,\nmeaning that the compatibility with the input prompt and fidelity are not compromised by our\ndiffusion synchronization. The results of FID and KID demonstrate the trade-off between coherence\nand diversity. As the gradient descent weight w increases, FID and KID also increase slightly,\nalthough they are still much lower compared to Blended Latent Diffusion [1]. This implies that for\ncertain images, it is more difficult to find coherent images. In the Appendix (6.3), we substantiate\nthis claim with the results of shorter generated panoramas. Blended Latent Diffusion results in low\nIntra-LPIPS due to its tendency to repeat similar patterns, but it leads to low Mean-GIQA and very\nhigh FID and KID, indicating a significant degradation in fidelity.\nUser Study\nWe conducted three user studies to further evaluate the coherence, image quality and\nprompt compatibility of the generated panoramas, respectively. Following Ritchie [32], participants\nwere presented with panorama images generated by both MultiDiffusion [3] and our SYNCDIF-\nFUSION methods (with w = 20). They were then asked to choose one of them by answering the\nquestion: Which one appears a more coherent panorama image to you? (Coherence),\nWhich one is of higher quality? (Image Quality), or Which one best matches the\nshared caption? (Prompt Compatibility). We collected 25 responses each, including 5 vigilance\ntasks, from 100 participants for each user study. The results in Tab. 1 affirm that human evaluators\n8\nFigure 5: Quantitative results. MultiDiffusion [3] (MD) can be considered as a special case of our\nmethod when the gradient descent weight w is set to 0. As w increases, coherence (Intra-LPIPS and\nIntra-Style-L) improves while maintaining the compatibility with the input prompt (Mean-CLIP-S)\nand fidelity (Mean-GIQA). There is a trade-off between coherency and diversity, as indicated by the\nFID and KID results. Note that the FID and KID of our method are still significantly lower than\nthose of Blended Latent Diffusion [1] (BLD). SD (Stable Diffusion) is the score with the reference\nset images.

Let c \u2208 RHz\u00d7Wz\u00d73 denote an input\ncondition and \u03c8c\u2192i : RHz\u00d7Wz\u00d73 \u2192 RHx\u00d7Wx\u00d73 be a mapping from c to the i-th cropped condition\ncorresponding to the window x(i)\nt . We define conditional SYNCDIFFUSION by substituting \u03d5\u03b8(xt, t)\nin Alg. 1 with \u03d5\u03b8(xt, t, c(i)), where c(i) := \u03c8c\u2192i(c). Fig. 6-(B) illustrates that the combination of\nControlNet and SYNCDIFFUSION generates coherent panoramas while reflecting the given condition\nCanny edge map (top row).\n360-degree Panorama Generation\nWe further plug SYNCDIFFUSION into MVDiffusion [47], a\nconcurrent work that generates 360-degree panoramas from text prompts via multi-view diffusion.\nAs shown Fig. 6-(C), our SYNCDIFFUSION distinctly improves the global coherence of the generated\npanorama. The increase in coherence becomes more apparent when comparing perspective views\nfrom different angles.

Also, the SYNCDIFFUSION module that includes a forward pass through the neural network\nand gradient descent computation introduces additional computational overhead.\nAppendix\nDue to space constraints, we present the following additional results in the Appendix:\nmore qualitative comparisons with various prompts (6.1, 6.8), details about the quantitative evalution\n(6.2), evaluation on different resolutions (6.3), results with Style Loss [14] as the perceptual loss\n(6.4), an ablation study using Eq. 13 instead of Eq. 14 (6.5), an analysis of computation time (6.6),\nand details on the user study (6.7).\n\u201cA red sports car\u201d\n\u201cA fancy hotel room\u201d\nFigure 7: Our failure cases.

Using a pretrained diffusion model, we propose guiding the\nreverse process by updating the noisy images at each intermediate step using gradient descent. This\nupdate is based on a perceptual similarity loss calculated with the predictions of the denoised images.\nMoreover, the idea of SYNCDIFFUSION can be applied to generating textures for 3D models. We\nplan to investigate such possibilities in future work.\nPotential Negative Societal Impacts\nImage generative models can potentially generate deepfakes,\nimages resembling copyrighted material, biased or discriminatory images, and harmful outputs.\nFuture research is needed to advance the detection of manipulated content and establish societal\nbarriers to protect intellectual property.\n10\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Juil Koo for valuable discussions on diffusion models and Eunji Hong for help in conducting\nuser studies.

Sec. 6.2 includes a detailed quantitative evaluation of our method with different gradient\ndescent weights (w = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20). Sec. 6.3 shows quantitative evaluation of our method on\ngenerating panoramas of different resolutions. In Sec. 6.4, we show the comparisons of our method\nwith different perceptual similarity loss functions. Sec. 6.5 shows an ablation study result substituting\nEq. 14 with Eq. 13. Sec. 6.6 analyzes the computation time of SYNCDIFFUSION. Sec. 6.7 explains\nthe details of our user study. Lastly, Sec. 6.8 provides additional qualitative comparisons.\n6.1\nMore Qualitative Results with Various Prompts\nMore qualitative results with various prompts are shown in the figures below. The resolutions of\nimages are 512 \u00d7 3072 for horizontal panoramas and 2048 \u00d7 512 for vertical panoramas.\n\u201cSkyline of New York City\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n\u201cAn illustration of a beach in La La Land style\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n14\n\u201cA waterfall\u201d\n\u201cA top view of a single railway\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNCDIFFUSION\nMD [3]\nSYNCDIFFUSION\n\u201cSilhouette wallpaper of a dreamy scene with shooting stars\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n\u201cA photo of a rock concert\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n15\n\u201cA photo of vines on a brick wall\u201d\n\u201cA bird\u2019s eye view of an alley with shops\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNCDIFFUSION\nMD [3]\nSYNCDIFFUSION\n\u201cA beach with palm trees\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n\u201cA photo of a grassland with animals\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n16\n\u201cA cinematic view of a castle in the sunset\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n\u201cA film photo of a beachside street under the sunset\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n\u201cA photo of a beautiful ocean with coral reef\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n\u201cA photo of a lake under the northern lights\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n17\n6.2\nDetails About Quantitative Evaluation\nTab. 3 shows the detailed quantitative results of SYNCDIFFUSION on panorama generation, reported\nin Fig. 5.1. Here we additionally show the results with the gradient descent weight w = 5 and w = 15,\nalong with the weights w = 10 and w = 20 reported in Sec. 5. Note that we used KNN-GIQA [17]\nwith K = 8 to measure Mean-GIQA in all our experiments. As shown in Tab. 3 (rows 3-7), as the\ngradient descent weight w increases from 0 to 20, the results of our method display a significant\nimprovement in global coherence, as shown in Intra-LPIPS [53] which decreases from 0.69 (w = 0)\nto 0.56 (w = 20), and Intra-Style-L [14] which decreases from 2.98 (w = 0) to 1.39 (w = 20). These\nresults are more apparent in the line plot of Intra-LPIPS and Intra-Style-L displayed in Fig. 9. Fig. 8\nshows the qualitative comparison of the panorama images generated with different weights.\n\u201cA photo of a city skyline at night\u201d\nMD [3]\n(SYNC-\nDIFFUSION\nw = 0)\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n(w = 5)\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n(w = 10)\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n(w = 15)\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n(w = 20)\nFigure 8: Qualitative comparison of different weights w. As w increases, the generated panorama\nimage gradually becomes globally coherent. Compared to MultiDiffusion, as w increases, the left\nand right sides of the panorama image become more coherent.\n6.3\nQuantitative Evaluation on Different Resolutions\nWe show the quantitative results on different resolutions in Tab. 3 (row 10-13). In addition to the\noriginal 512 \u00d7 3072 resolution, Tab. 3 shows the quantitative comparison of SYNCDIFFUSION and\nMultiDiffusion [3] for smaller resolution panoramas (512 \u00d7 2048 and 512 \u00d7 1024). In Fig. 3, when\ncomparing the rows 10 and 11, 8 and 9, 3 and 7 respectively, the gap of Intra-LPIPS between our\nmethod and MultiDiffusion is preserved (0.13, 0.14, and 0.13, respectively), meaning that our method\nconstantly produces more coherent panoramas than MultiDiffusion regardless of the resolution.\nThe gap of Intra-Style-L between our method and MultiDiffusion even increases as the resolution\nincreases (1.48, 1.57, and 1.59, respectively). On the other hand, the gap of FID and KID between\nthe two methods also increases as the resolution increases: 9.69, 10.26, 11.08 for FID and 7.96,\n10.19, 11.96 for KID. We hypothesize that the increase in FID and KID of our method with longer\npanoramas is due to the tendency that for certain images it is more difficult to find other images that\ncan be merged into a single coherent panorama. The above results indicate that while our method can\nguide the joint diffusion process to generate highly coherent images regardless of the resolution,\n18\nIntra-LPIPS \u2193\nIntra-Style-L \u2193\nMean-GIQA \u2191\nFID \u2193\nKID \u2193\nMean-CLIP-S \u2191\n(\u00d710\u22123)\n(\u00d710\u22123)\n(\u00d710\u22123)\n1\nSD [39]\n0.74 \u00b1 0.07\n8.40 \u00b1 6.27\n26.70 \u00b1 6.90\n28.31 \u00b1 10.89\n< 0.01\u00b1 0.13\n31.63 \u00b1 1.89\n2\nBLD [1]\n0.58 \u00b1 0.06\n4.64 \u00b1 3.32\n24.27 \u00b1 6.19\n84.29 \u00b1 36.74\n66.54 \u00b1 37.30\n31.41 \u00b1 1.66\nSYNCDIFFUSION with Various Gradient Descent Weight w (Eq. 14)\n3\nw = 0 (MD [3])\n0.69 \u00b1 0.09\n2.98 \u00b1 2.41\n28.54 \u00b1 7.99\n33.52 \u00b1 12.43\n9.04 \u00b1 4.23\n31.77 \u00b1 2.32\n4\nw = 5\n0.64 \u00b1 0.07\n2.15 \u00b1 1.61\n28.58 \u00b1 7.84\n35.57 \u00b1 12.43\n12.09 \u00b1 4.98\n31.85 \u00b1 2.33\n5\nw = 10\n0.60 \u00b1 0.07\n1.75 \u00b1 1.31\n28.28 \u00b1 7.54\n38.24 \u00b1 15.24\n15.08 \u00b1 6.77\n31.90 \u00b1 2.33\n6\nw = 15\n0.58 \u00b1 0.06\n1.54 \u00b1 1.21\n27.74 \u00b1 7.19\n41.04 \u00b1 16.74\n17.47 \u00b1 8.29\n31.86 \u00b1 2.25\n7\nw = 20\n0.56 \u00b1 0.06\n1.39 \u00b1 1.15\n27.17 \u00b1 6.66\n44.60 \u00b1 18.45\n21.00 \u00b1 11.06\n31.84 \u00b1 2.19\nPanorama Size: 512 \u00d7 2048\n8\nMD [3]\n0.69 \u00b1 0.09\n2.96 \u00b1 2.41\n28.33 \u00b1 7.79\n33.07 \u00b1 12.38\n8.58 \u00b1 3.99\n31.77 \u00b1 2.14\n9\nSYNCDIFFUSION\n0.55 \u00b1 0.06\n1.39 \u00b1 1.19\n27.08 \u00b1 6.65\n43.33 \u00b1 17.98\n18.77 \u00b1 10.19\n31.77 \u00b1 2.14\nPanorama Size: 512 \u00d7 1024\n10\nMD [3]\n0.66 \u00b1 0.09\n2.57 \u00b1 1.97\n28.17 \u00b1 7.54\n30.66 \u00b1 11.79\n5.24 \u00b1 3.04\n31.73 \u00b1 2.22\n11 SYNCDIFFUSION\n0.53 \u00b1 0.06\n1.09 \u00b1 0.77\n26.41 \u00b1 6.38\n40.35 \u00b1 16.43\n13.20 \u00b1 7.61\n31.71 \u00b1 2.01\nSYNCDIFFUSION Ablation Study\n12 Eq. 14 \u2192 Eq. 13\n0.68 \u00b1 0.09\n2.95 \u00b1 2.39\n28.53 \u00b1 7.99\n33.58 \u00b1 0.09\n9.15 \u00b1 4.25\n31.78 \u00b1 2.32\n13\nStyle Loss [14]\n0.64 \u00b1 0.10\n1.08 \u00b1 1.10\n25.74 \u00b1 6.31\n73.05 \u00b1 37.56\n56.64 \u00b1 39.58\n31.15 \u00b1 2.32\nTable 3: Quantitative results on panorama generation.\ngenerating longer panoramas that are globally coherent can lead to a decrease in the diversity of\ngenerations, thus resulting in a negative effect on FID and KID.\n6.4\nResults of SYNCDIFFUSION with Style Loss\nAs described in Sec. 4, any off-the-shelf perceptual similarity loss can be utilized in our method.\nHere we show the results of our method with Style Loss [14] as the loss function L in Eq. 14. Fig. 10\nshows panorama images generated by MultiDiffusion [3], and our method with LPIPS [53] and Style\nLoss [14] as the perceptual similarity loss function, respectively. To observe visible changes in the\npanorama outputs, we multiplied 106 to the Style Loss and set the gradient descent weight w to\n0.1. Tab. 3 (row 13) demonstrates that SYNCDIFFUSION with Style Loss achieves better coherence\ncompared to MultiDiffusion as measured by Intra-LPIPS and Intra-Style-L, while showing a negative\neffect on the metrics regarding fidelity: Mean-GIQA, FID, and KID. Note that Intra-Style-L is\nsignificantly decreased as the guidance was provided with Style Loss. The second row in Fig. 10\nshows that Style Loss can guide the joint diffusion processes to generate a globally coherent panorama\nimage, as compared to the MultiDiffusion output in the first row.\n6.5\nAblation on Predicting the Foreseen Denoised Observation\nTab. 3 (row 12) shows the quantitative comparison of the panorama generations using our method and\nafter substituting the original Eq. 14 with Eq. 13 in which the noisy image x(i)\nt\nis decoded instead of\nutilizing the foreseen denoised observation \u03d5\u03b8(x(i)\nt , t). Although Intra-LPIPS is still slightly reduced\ncompared to MultiDiffusion when using Eq. 13, the change is negligible compared to that of the\noriginal formulation Eq. 14. This result is straightforward as measuring the perceptual loss between\nnoisy images would not provide meaningful guidance to the diffusion process, whereas comparing\nthe perceptual similarity of foreseen denoised observations can give a meaningful guidance for global\ncoherence.\n6.6\nAnalysis on the Computation Time\nAs our SYNCDIFFUSION module requires the gradient descent computation, it introduces additional\ncomputational overhead during the sampling process. Since our method is based on the DDIM reverse\nprocess with 50 timesteps, the gradient descent is applied 50 times. Here we examine two methods to\naccelerate the generation process while still ensuring a notable improvement in coherence: applying\nSYNCDIFFUSION on a fixed interval and on the initial sampling steps.\n19\nFigure 9: Line plots of the quantitative results shown in Tab. 3 with varying gradient descent weight\nw. The dashed lines (SD) represent the evaluation results of the Stable Diffusion [39] reference set\nimages. The vertical lines represent the standard deviation.\n\u201cNatural landscape in anime style illustration\u201d\nMD [3]\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n(Style Loss)\nSYNC-\nDIFFUSION\n(LPIPS)\nFigure 10: Qualitative comparisons of MultiDiffusion and SYNCDIFFUSION with Style Loss.\nFixed interval\nWe define f as the frequency of the gradient descent during the DDIM reverse\nprocess of SYNCDIFFUSION, with the default value of f = 50. Tab. 4 shows the quantitative results\nand the computation time when the gradient descent is performed 10 times (f = 10) and 5 times\n(f = 5) in total with uniform intervals, with the gradient descent weight fixed to w = 20. Although\napplying the gradient descent for every step leads to the highest global coherence with Intra-LPIPS\nof 0.56 and Intra-Style-L of 1.39, in practice applying the gradient descent for 5 or 10 times can still\nachieve meaningful improvement in the coherence compared to MultiDiffusion as shown in rows 3-5\nof Tab. 4, while reducing the computation time compared to the f = 50 case. Note that Intra-LPIPS\ndecreases from 0.69 to 0.62 and Intra-Style-L decreases from 2.98 to 2.14 for f = 10.\nInitial steps\nWe further analyze the effectiveness of performing the gradient descent for the initial\nsampling steps. Rows 6-7 of Tab. 4 show the quantitative results and the computation time when the\ngradient descent is applyed for the initial five and three steps out of the total 50 steps, respectively.\n20\nThe gradient descent weight is fixed to w = 20. Comparing row 4 and row 7 shows that by computing\nthe SYNCDIFFUSION function for just the initial three steps is analogous to computing it for ten\ntimes at regular intervals in terms of coherence (Intra-LPIPS, Intra-Style-L) and superior in terms\nof fidelity and diversity (FID and KID), while taking less than 70% of the latter\u2019s computation time.\nThe qualitative comparisons of the early-stage synchronization are shown in Fig. 12.\nIntra-\nLPIPS \u2193\nIntra-\nStyle-L \u2193\n(\u00d710\u22123)\nMean-\nGIQA \u2191\n(\u00d710\u22123)\nFID \u2193\nKID \u2193\n(\u00d710\u22123)\nMean-\nCLIP-S \u2191\nTime(s)\nSD [39]\n0.74 \u00b1 0.07\n8.40 \u00b1 6.27\n26.70 \u00b1 6.90\n28.31 \u00b1 10.89\n<0.01 \u00b1 0.13\n31.63 \u00b1 1.89\n-\nMD [3]\n0.69 \u00b1 0.09\n2.98 \u00b1 2.41\n28.54 \u00b1 7.99\n33.52 \u00b1 12.43\n9.04 \u00b1 4.23\n31.77 \u00b1 2.32\n46.10 \u00b1 1.07\nSYNCDIFFUSION\nf = 50\n0.56 \u00b1 0.06\n1.39 \u00b1 1.15\n27.17 \u00b1 6.66\n44.60 \u00b1 18.45\n21.00 \u00b1 11.06\n31.84 \u00b1 2.19\n339.53 \u00b1 2.85\nf = 10\n0.62 \u00b1 0.07\n2.14 \u00b1 1.72\n28.43 \u00b1 7.75\n36.22 \u00b1 14.03\n12.84 \u00b1 5.59\n31.85 \u00b1 2.27\n104.83 \u00b1 3.38\nf = 5\n0.64 \u00b1 0.07\n2.33 \u00b1 1.83\n28.44 \u00b1 7.85\n35.18 \u00b1 13.31\n11.43 \u00b1 4.68\n31.81 \u00b1 2.24\n81.17 \u00b1 0.53\nInit. 5 Steps\n0.61 \u00b1 0.06\n1.96 \u00b1 1.36\n28.21 \u00b1 7.48\n36.31 \u00b1 13.83\n12.09 \u00b1 4.76\n31.77 \u00b1 2.25\n79.12 \u00b1 1.72\nInit. 3 Steps\n0.62 \u00b1 0.06\n2.07 \u00b1 1.40\n28.43 \u00b1 8.19\n35.40 \u00b1 12.99\n11.15 \u00b1 3.76\n31.79 \u00b1 2.26\n71.56 \u00b1 2.64\nTable 4: Analysis on the computation time of our SYNCDIFFUSION and MultiDiffusion [3].\n6.7\nDetails of User Study\nFor each user study, the order of the images was shuffled.

These models, such as GPT-4, can not only master language but also solve\ncomplex tasks in areas like mathematics, coding, medicine, and law. Despite their\nimpressive capabilities, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regard-\ning their full potential, primarily due to the black-box nature of many models and\nthe absence of holistic evaluation studies. To address these challenges, we present\nINSTRUCTEVAL, a more comprehensive evaluation suite designed specifically\nfor instruction-tuned large language models. Unlike previous works, our evalua-\ntion involves a rigorous assessment of models based on problem-solving, writing\nability, and alignment to human values. We take a holistic approach to analyze\nvarious factors affecting model performance, including the pretraining foundation,\ninstruction-tuning data, and training methods. Our findings reveal that the quality\nof instruction data is the most crucial factor in scaling model performance. While\nopen-source models demonstrate impressive writing abilities, there is substantial\nroom for improvement in problem-solving and alignment. We are encouraged\nby the rapid development of models by the open-source community, but we also\nhighlight the need for rigorous evaluation to support claims made about these\nmodels. Through INSTRUCTEVAL, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2306.04757v3  [cs.CL]  15 Jun 2023\ninstruction-tuned models and advancements in their capabilities. INSTRUCTEVAL\nis publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/instruct-eval.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe advent of instruction-tuned large language models has marked a significant turning point in\nthe field of natural language processing (NLP). Their transformative capabilities are evident in\nnumerous applications, from conversational assistants such as ChatGPT1 to complex problem-solving.\nExamples of such models include GPT-4 OpenAI [2023], which has shown proficiency not only\nin language understanding but also in areas as diverse as mathematics, coding, medicine, and law.\nHowever, despite their remarkable proficiency and adaptability, the full extent of their potential\nremains to be comprehensively understood. This situation arises primarily due to the black-box nature\nof many models and the current absence of in-depth and holistic evaluation studies.\nTo address these challenges and gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of these models, we\nintroduce a novel evaluation suite named INSTRUCTEVAL. This suite is designed explicitly for the\ncomprehensive assessment of instruction-tuned large language models, pushing beyond the confines\nof earlier evaluation approaches. Our evaluation strategy diverges from prior studies in its systematic\nand holistic approach. It not only scrutinizes the models\u2019 problem-solving abilities and writing\nproficiency but also critically examines their alignment with human values.\nAt the heart of our evaluation methodology, we consider various factors affecting the performance\nof the models. These include the pretrained foundation upon which the models are developed, the\nnature and quality of instruction-tuning data used to refine them, and the specific training methods\nadopted. Through a rigorous exploration of these factors, we seek to shed light on the vital elements\nthat determine model performance, facilitating an understanding of how these models can be better\nharnessed to meet our needs.\nOur research findings underscore the critical influence of the quality of instruction data on the scaling\nof model performance. Open-source models have shown impressive writing abilities, signifying\ntheir potential to contribute meaningfully to various domains. However, our study reveals consid-\nerable room for improvement, particularly in the models\u2019 problem-solving abilities and alignment\nwith human values. This observation accentuates the importance of holistic evaluation and model\ndevelopment.\nWhile we acknowledge and appreciate the rapid strides made by the open-source community in\ndeveloping these models, we also underline the necessity for rigorous evaluation. Without com-\nprehensive assessment, it can be challenging to substantiate claims made about the capabilities of\nthese models, potentially limiting their usability and applicability. By introducing INSTRUCTEVAL,\nwe strive to fill this critical gap. Our primary aim is to contribute to the nuanced understanding\nof instruction-tuned large language models, thereby fostering further advancements in their capa-\nbilities. Furthermore, we are excited to announce the release of a comprehensive leaderboard that\ncompares over 60 open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). The leaderboard can be accessed\nat https://declare-lab.github.io/instruct-eval/. In this paper, we carefully selected 10\nmodels from this pool, considering factors such as their foundational architecture, instruction set, and\npre-training method.\n2\nOverview of Open-Source Instructed LLMs\nFoundation Models\nWhile large language models have captured public attention, they have\nbecome a very broad category of models that are hard to define. For instance, large language models\ncould refer to pretrained models, instruction-tuned models such as GPT-4, or even loosely linked\nto applications of large language models. Hence, in this work, we mainly distinguish between\nfoundation models and instructed models, where foundation LLMs are pretrained large language\nmodels which may be instruction-tuned to become instructed LLMs. Notably, we focus mainly on\nopen-source instructed LLMs due to the lack of transparency and reproducibility of closed-source\nmodels. To consider pretraining factors such as model architecture, size, and data scale, we collect\ndetails of the open-source foundation LLMs in Table 1.\n1https://chat.openai.com\n2\nModel\nArchitecture\nTraining Tokens\nData Source\nCommercial?\nGPT-NeoX Black et al.

Hence, we collect details of several open-source instruction\ndatasets in Table 2. Notably, we have observed a growing trend of leveraging synthetic instruction\ndata from closed-source models. While this practice may allow instructed models to mimic the\nbehavior of models such as GPT-4, this may lead to issues such as inheriting the black-box nature of\nclosed-source models, and instability due to noisy synthetic instructions.\nDataset\nSize\nTasks\nDomain\nData Source\nAlpaca Data Taori et al.

Such models are often treated as black boxes where the internal\nworkings are not well understood, hence leading to a knowledge gap in the research community.\nHence, it is challenging to evaluate closed-source LLMs because it is not possible to rigorously\nanalyze the reasons for their behavior and performance.\nOverwhelming Open-Source Models\nSpurred by the impressive demonstrations of closed-source\nmodels like GPT-4, there has been a feverish development of models from the open-source community\nwhich aims to democratize language model technology. While we are greatly encouraged by such\nefforts, we are deeply concerned that the rate of development of new models may outpace the progress\nin evaluation studies. For instance, bold claims such as \u201c90% ChatGPT Quality\u201d without rigorous\nevaluation do not mean much, and may mislead the public to believe that highly capable instructed\nLLMs can be easily reproducible. Unfortunately, new models are often accompanied with informal\nevaluations, causing confusion in comparisons between different models.\nMultiple Considerations of Instruction-Tuning\nTo reach a holistic understanding of instructed\nLLMs, we need to consider the diverse factors that can contribute to their behavior, such as pretraining,\ninstruction data, and training methods. While previous works have conducted in-depth studies in\ncertain areas such as instruction datasets Longpre et al. [2023], we believe that multiple factors\nshould be jointly considered to achieve a more complete understanding. For example, it can be useful\nto know which factors have a greater impact on model behavior, and which factors require more\nimprovement.\nBroad Scope of Capabilities\nAs research in instructed LLMs progresses, we will naturally observe\nenhancements in their general capabilities. For instance, recent works have shown that LLMs can be\ninstructed to solve problems in many domains and even use external tools to augment their capabilities.\nHence, we foresee that comprehensive evaluation of instructed LLMs will become more and more\nimportant, yet also more and more challenging. While previous evaluation studies have assessed\nmodels on benchmarks such as exams across diverse topics Hendrycks et al. [2021], Zhong et al.\n[2023], they do not consider holistic aspects such as general writing ability and alignment with human\nvalues. In this work, we aim to evaluate instructed LLMs over a broader range of general capabilities,\nusage scenarios, and human-centric behavior.\n4\nINSTRUCTEVAL Benchmark Suite\nTo address the challenges of assessing instructed LLMs discussed in Section 3, we introduce a more\nholistic evaluation suite known as INSTRUCTEVAL. To cover a wide range of general abilities, we\ntest the models in terms of problem-solving, writing, and alignment to human values, as shown in\nFigure 1. As INSTRUCTEVAL covers tasks that can be objectively scored, as well as tasks that need\nto be qualitatively judged, we adopt multiple evaluation methods. We also include the full evaluation\ndata statistics and implementation in the Appendix.\n4\n4.1\nProblem-Solving Evaluation\nTo evaluate the problem-solving ability of instructed LLMs, we adopt multiple benchmarks which\ncover real-world exams on diverse topics, complex instructions, arithmetic, programming, and\ncausality. In order to perform well on the benchmarks, models require world knowledge, multi-hop\nreasoning, creativity, and more. In this subsection, we detail the benchmarks used for evaluating\nvarious problem-solving aspects.\nWorld Knowledge\nThe Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Hendrycks et al.\n[2021] benchmark is designed to measure world knowledge and problem-solving ability in multiple\nsubjects. It evaluates models in zero-shot and few-shot settings, making it more challenging and\ncloser to how humans are evaluated. The benchmark covers 57 subjects across STEM, humanities,\nsocial sciences, and other areas, ranging in difficulty from elementary to advanced professional levels.\nComplex Instructions\nBIG-Bench Hard (BBH) is a subset of 23 challenging tasks from the\nBIG-Bench benchmark Srivastava et al. [2022], which focuses on tasks believed to be beyond the\ncapabilities of current language models Suzgun et al. [2022]. It requires models to follow challenging\ninstructions such as navigation, logical deduction, and fallacy detection.\nComprehension and Arithmetic\nDiscrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP) is a math-based\nreading comprehension task that requires a system to perform discrete reasoning over passages\nextracted from Wikipedia articles. To perform well on DROP, a system must resolve references in\na question to suitable parts of the given passage, and perform discrete operations such as addition,\ncounting, or sorting.\nProgramming\nHumanEval is a problem-solving benchmark used for evaluating large language\nmodels trained on code Chen et al. [2021]. It consists of 164 original programming problems\nthat assess language comprehension, algorithms, and simple mathematics, with some problems\ncomparable to simple software interview questions. Models are evaluated based on the functional\ncorrectness of generated code programs based on the given docstrings.\nCausality\nThe Counterfactual Reasoning Assessment (CRASS) benchmark is a novel dataset and\nevaluation tool designed to test the causal reasoning capabilities of large language models. It utilizes\ncounterfactual scenarios as a means to evaluate if the model can select a suitable causal explanation.\n4.2\nWriting Evaluation\nCategory\nExample Prompt\nExample Answer Excerpt\nInformative\nHow can I improve my time management skills?\nCreate a prioritized to-do list and allocate\nspecific time blocks for each task...\nProfessional\nWrite a persuasive memo advocating for a new\nDear Team, I\u2019m excited to propose a new\npolicy or initiative to your team.\npolicy that I believe will greatly benefit everyone...\nArgumentative\nIs it ethical to use robots in warfare?\nEmploying robots in warfare is a complex and\nhighly debated issue. While some argue that...\nCreative\nCan you write a poem about the beauty of nature?\nIn nature\u2019s embrace, I find solace profound,\nWhere beauty unfolds without a single sound...\nTable 4: Samples of our InforMative, Professional, Argumentative, CreaTive (IMPACT) benchmark.\nIn addition to problem-solving skills, instructed LLMs also demonstrate promising ability in writing-\nbased tasks, such as composing letters or ethical debates. Specifically, we evaluate general writing\nability across diverse usage scenarios for informative writing, professional writing, argumentative\nwriting, and creative writing. For example, informative writing involves user queries such as self-\nhelp advice or explanations for various concepts, while professional writing may take the form of\npresentations or emails in a business setting. On the other hand, argumentative writing requires the\nmodels to debate positions on ethical and societal questions, while creative writing involves diverse\nwriting formats such as stories, poems, and songs.\nTo construct the writing benchmark, IMPACT, we annotate 50 prompts for each writing category.\nHowever, writing tasks require long-form answers and there is usually no one right answer, hence\n5\nModel\nSize\nMMLU\nBBH\nDROP\nCRASS\nHumanEval\nAvg.\nPerf.\n\u2206\nPerf.\n\u2206\nPerf.\n\u2206\nPerf.\n\u2206\nPerf.\n\u2206\nPerf.\n\u2206\nGPT-4\n-\n86.4\n-\n-\n-\n80.9\n-\n-\n-\n67.0\n-\n-\n-\nChatGPT\n-\n70.0\n-\n49.5\n-\n64.1\n-\n90.5\n-\n48.1\n-\n64.5\n-\nFlan-UL2\n20B\n55.0\n-\n44.7\n-\n64.3\n-\n94.2\n-\n0.0\n-\n51.6\n-\nAlpaca-Lora\n30B\n58.4\n+0.6\n41.3\n+2.0\n45.1\n-0.3\n79.2\n+10.6\n18.9\n+4.9\n48.6\n+3.6\nOpenAssistant\n30B\n56.9\n-0.9\n39.2\n-0.1\n46.0\n+0.6\n67.2\n+1.4\n23.1\n+9.1\n46.5\n+1.5\nOPT-IML\n30B\n38.6\n+11.3\n31.3\n+3.0\n47.5\n+28.0\n67.2\n+32.5\n9.1\n+7.9\n38.7\n+16.5\nFlan-T5\n11B\n54.5\n+29.3\n43.9\n+13.6\n67.2\n+49.7\n88.3\n+54.7\n0.0\n+0.0\n50.8\n+29.5\nFlan-Alpaca\n11B\n50.9\n+25.7\n23.3\n-7.0\n62.3\n+44.8\n90.2\n+56.6\n0.0\n+0.0\n45.3\n+24.0\nStableVicuna\n13B\n49.2\n+3.0\n37.5\n+0.4\n34.3\n-1.0\n67.5\n+8.7\n15.9\n+2.5\n40.9\n+2.7\nVicuna\n13B\n49.7\n+3.5\n37.1\n+0.0\n32.9\n-2.4\n60.9\n+2.1\n15.2\n+1.8\n39.2\n+1.0\nDolly V2\n12B\n25.6\n-1.3\n29.7\n+0.2\n16.6\n-0.5\n35.8\n+1.1\n8.5\n-0.6\n23.2\n-0.7\nFlan-T5\n3B\n49.2\n+25.9\n40.2\n+15.9\n56.3\n+43.7\n91.2\n+60.2\n0.0\n+0.0\n47.4\n+29.2\nChatGLM\n6B\n36.1\n-\n31.3\n-\n44.2\n-\n51.1\n-\n3.1\n-\n33.2\n-\nAlpaca-Lora\n7B\n35.6\n+0.4\n30.7\n+0.2\n27.5\n-0.1\n45.6\n+11.7\n15.9\n+5.6\n31.1\n+3.5\nMosaic-Chat\n7B\n37.1\n+1.9\n32.0\n+1.1\n20.2\n-7.4\n47.5\n+13.6\n17.7\n+7.4\n30.9\n+3.3\nTable 5: Evaluation results for problem-solving benchmarks. We denote the original performance\nacross the benchmarks as Perf., while \u2206 denotes the change in performance compared to the\ncorresponding foundation LLMs.\nposing a challenge for rigorous and standardized evaluation. On the other hand, human evaluation\nis not scalable due to high costs, potential inconsistency between different evaluators, and non-\nreproducibility. Inspired by previous works which show that LLMs can be used for generative tasks\nsuch as summarization, we adopt an automatic approach by leveraging ChatGPT to judge the quality\nof the generated answers. Specifically, we provide suitable rubrics of relevance and coherence to the\nevaluation model, where relevance measures how well the answer engages with the given prompt and\ncoherence covers the general text quality such as organization and logical flow. Following previous\nwork, each answer is scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. We evaluate the models in the zero-shot\nsetting based on the given prompt and perform sampling-based decoding with a temperature of 1.0.\n4.3\nAlignment to Human Values\nInstructed LLMs enable many promising applications including conversational assistants like Chat-\nGPT. As the models become more capable, it becomes paramount to align the models to human\nvalues in order to mitigate unexpected or negative consequences. Notably, even LLMs that exhibit\nsuperior problem-solving capabilities may not be well-aligned with human preferences.\nTo investigate the impact of instruction tuning on model\u2019s ability in recognizing desires that agree\nwith the preferences of the general public. We integrate the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH)\nbenchmark Askell et al. [2021] in INSTRUCTEVAL to assess the understanding of instructed models\nwith respect to human values. These values encompass:\n1. Helpfulness: the assistant will always strive to act in the best interests of humans.\n2. Honesty: the assistant will always try to convey accurate information, refraining from\ndeceiving humans.\n3. Harmlessness: the assistant will always try to avoid any actions that harm humans.\nThe benchmark presents a dialogue between humans and conversational assistants, where the model is\nasked to select the most suitable response to the dialogue The benchmark contains 61 honesty-related,\n59 helpfulness-related, 58 harmlessness-related, and 43 samples from the \u201cother\u201d category. The\n\u201cother\u201d category incorporates examples that represent values that were not covered under helpfulness,\nhonesty, or harmlessness. Examples of each category is included in Table 8\n6\n5\nEvaluation Results\n5.1\nProblem Solving\nTo assess problem-solving ability, we evaluate more than ten open-source models2 on the benchmarks\nin Table 5. To provide a holistic analysis of the model performance, we consider the instructed LLMs\nwith respect to their pretraining foundation, instruction data, and training methods. In general, we\nobserve very encouraging improvements in the problem-solving ability of instructed LLMs compared\nto their respective foundation models.\nPretraining Foundation:\nAs the instruction-tuned LLMs are trained from their respective founda-\ntion LLMs, it is crucial to consider the pretraining foundation when analysing the overall performance.\nWe observe that a solid pretraining foundation is a necessary condition to perform well on the\nproblem-solving tasks. Notably, the models which were pretrained on less than one trillion tokens\nsuch as OPT-IML and Dolly V2 underperform their peers even with instruction-tuning. We also\nobserve a clear scaling trend where increasing the size of the foundation LLM brings consistent\nbenefits across different models and instruction-tuning regimes. To further study the scaling trends of\ninstruction-tuning, we include more details in Section 6.1. On the other hand, we do not find a clear\nlink between foundation model architecture and problem-solving ability.\nInstruction Data:\nIn general, we find that while instruction-tuning data has a larger impact on\nperformance compared to pretraining, it is not a panacea. When LLMs are tuned sub-optimally,\nthe performance may not improve significantly, and may even regress in some cases. Notably,\ncompared to their respective foundation LLMs, we find that OPT-IML and the Flan-T5 model family\ndemonstrate the largest improvements after instruction tuning. This may be explained by the large\ncollection of high-quality human-annotated tasks in their instruction data. On the other hand, we find\nthat imitating closed-source LLMs has limited benefits for problem-solving. Recently, models such as\nVicuna and Alpaca have gained attention by demonstrating impressive instruction-following behavior\nafter training on diverse instructions generated by closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3. However, we\nfind that the performance gains are modest at best, and may even backfire in the case of Dolly V2. We\nbelieve this may be explained by the potential noise in synthetic instruction-tuning datasets. While\nusing LLMs to generate instructions can result in a greater diversity of instructions, their instruction\nsamples may contain inaccurate answers and mislead any model that is trained on their outputs.\nTraining Methods:\nIn addition to the pretraining foundation and instruction data, the training\nmethod can also impact model performance and computational efficiency. While most instruction-\ntuned LLMs are trained with supervised fine-tuning, this may not capture the nuances of human\npreferences compared to reinforcement learning from human feedback [Ouyang et al., 2022]. For\ninstance, we find that StableVicuna which is trained with human feedback can better follow problem-\nsolving instructions compared to Vicuna which only has supervised fine-tuning. However, the\nimprovement is relatively minor compared to the impact of instruction data. On the other hand,\nrecent developments in parameter-efficient fine-tuning have enabled LLMs to be trained with much\nfewer compute resources. Notably, we find that parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA [Hu\net al., 2021] are more effective as the instructed LLM scales in parameter count. Hence, we believe\nthat parameter-efficient training methods show great promise for more scalable and effective\ninstruction-tuning.\n5.2\nWriting Ability\nWe report the evaluation results for writing ability in Table 6. In general, we find that models perform\nconsistently across the informative, professional, argumentative, and creative writing categories,\ndemonstrating their general writing ability. Surprisingly, however, we observe that models demon-\nstrating higher problem-solving ability may not have better writing ability. Notably, Flan-Alpaca has\nweaker problem-solving performance as shown in Table 5, but significantly outperforms Flan-T5 in\nwriting after being tuned on synthetic instructions from GPT-3. We posit that the greater diversity of\nsynthetic instructions enables better generalization to real-world writing prompts despite potential\n2Note that we do not include \u2206 Avg. results for ChatGLM as the foundation model is not publicly available,\nand we also do not report them for Flan-UL2 as we could not produce reasonable results using the public model.\n7\nModel\nSize\nInformative\nProfessional\nArgumentative\nCreative\nAvg.\nRel.\nCoh.\nRel.\nCoh.\nRel.\nCoh.\nRel.\nCoh.\nRel.\nCoh.\nChatGPT\n-\n3.34\n3.98\n3.88\n3.96\n3.96\n3.82\n3.92\n3.94\n3.78\n3.93\nFlan-Alpaca\n11B\n3.56\n3.46\n3.54\n3.70\n3.22\n3.28\n3.70\n3.40\n3.51\n3.46\nDolly-V2\n12B\n3.54\n3.64\n2.96\n3.74\n3.66\n3.20\n3.02\n3.18\n3.30\n3.44\nStableVicuna\n13B\n3.54\n3.64\n2.96\n3.74\n3.30\n3.20\n3.02\n3.18\n3.21\n3.44\nFlan-T5\n11B\n2.64\n3.24\n2.62\n3.22\n2.54\n3.40\n2.50\n2.72\n2.58\n3.15\nTable 6: Evaluation results for writing-based tasks.\nModel\nSize\nHarmlessness\nHelpfulness\nHonesty\nOther\nAvg.\n\u2206 Avg.\nChatGPT\n-\n90.7\n91.2\n78.1\n86.3\n86.6\n-\nFlan-Alpaca\n11B\n74.2\n81.4\n77.4\n83.4\n79.1\n+26.6\nFlan-T5\n11B\n75.9\n75.3\n75.1\n79.6\n76.7\n+24.2\nTk-Instruct\n11B\n70.1\n54.8\n62.3\n76.0\n65.8\n+13.3\nT5\n11B\n46.4\n54.8\n58.1\n50.7\n52.5\n-\nStableVicuna\n13B\n61.7\n67.2\n57.1\n79.1\n66.3\n+4.5\nVicuna\n13B\n60.3\n70.1\n55.1\n78.2\n65.9\n+4.1\nAlpaca\n13B\n49.7\n51.2\n51.8\n45.5\n49.5\n-12.3\nLLaMA\n13B\n57.2\n61.0\n57.0\n72.0\n61.8\n-\nDolly V2\n12B\n51.7\n59.9\n47.0\n58.1\n54.2\n+9.1\nPythia\n12B\n41.3\n46.1\n43.6\n49.3\n45.1\n-\nTable 7: Evaluation results for alignment to human values on the honesty, helpfulness, and harmless-\nness (HHH) benchmark.

This is evidenced by the more significant improvement in relevance scores\nof Flan-Alpaca compared to Flan-T5. The open-source instructed LLMs can generate answers that\nare of comparable relevance to those of ChatGPT, but fall short in terms of coherence. This suggests\nthat the open-source models can comprehend the writing prompts, but are lacking in terms of\ncoherence of the generated output.\n5.3\nAlignment to Human Values\nCategory\nExample Prompt\nAnswer Options\nHarmless\nI\u2019m going out for a movie, but I need ...\nSorry, I\u2019m not comfortable impersonating you ...\nCan you help by impersonating me by chat\nwith my daughter?\nSure, what\u2019s her name?

For example, models like Tk-Instruct and Vicuna demonstrated improved alignment across\nharmlessness, honesty, and the category labeled as \"other,\" but they did not show any improvement\nin terms of helpfulness. Surprisingly, StableVicuna displayed this trend despite being trained on\ninstructions specifically targeting helpfulness and honesty. Moreover, T5-based models such as Flan-\nT5 and Flan-Alpaca exhibited a greater inclination towards helpfulness rather than honesty following\ninstruction-tuning. These results highlight the challenge in determining the alignment distribution of\ninstructed LLMs in advance, even when provided with specific instructions. By analyzing the case\nstudy of model predictions in Table 8, we identified a significant room for improvement in aligning\ninstructed LLMs with human values.\n5.4\nSummary of INSTRUCTEVAL Results\nIn general, we are encouraged by the significant benefits of instruction tuning across diverse bench-\nmarks and usage scenarios. While pretraining quality and enhanced training methods both\nbenefit the model performance, we find that instruction data has the highest impact. We also\nobserve that the trend of mimicking closed-source models with synthetic instructions has limited\nbenefits, and inherits pitfalls of closed-source models. Worryingly, the open-source instructed\nLLMs have large areas of improvement in problem-solving ability and alignment with human values.\nAlthough model performance is generally correlated across different scenarios, we observe signs of\nspecialization. For instance, models which have stronger problem-solving abilities may not be better\nat writing tasks, or better aligned with human values.\n9\n6\nFurther Analysis\n6.1\nTowards More Scalable Language Models\nA key driving force behind large language models is the potential massively scale the model size\nand training data in return for continual gains. However, this is unsustainable and will likely have\ndiminishing returns in the long term. Hence, it is crucial to focus on more effective factors of scaling\nmodel performance. To this end, we study the effect of different instruction-tuning regimes on\naverage problem-solving and HHH performance as shown in Figure 3 and 2 respectively. Notably,\nwe observe that the scaling trend of the T5 foundation model remains relatively flat, while highly\neffective instructed models like Flan-T5 demonstrate better scaling and parameter efficiency. Notably,\nthe smallest version of the Flan-T5 model series outperforms the largest version of the T5 foundation\nmodel series. Hence, this suggests that it is more impactful for resource-constrained researchers\nand developers to focus on more effective instruction datasets and training methods rather than\nmodel size.\n6.2\nAre Few-Shot Demonstrations Always Better?\nWhile instructed LLMs are capable of performing many tasks in a zero-shot fashion, their generaliza-\ntion may be enhanced by providing few-shot demonstrations during inference Brown et al. [2020].\nHowever, this area of in-context learning Wei et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2023], Lu et al. [2022], Liu\net al. [2022] is still an emerging research area, and there are few studies that involve diverse models\nand tasks. Hence, we compare the behavior of several instructed LLMs under both zero-shot and\nfew-shot settings in Table 4. Surprisingly, we find that the effect of demonstrations varies greatly\non different tasks, and may even worsen model performance in some cases. For instance, there is\na limited benefit on MMLU, and there is even a slight decrease in performance for OPT-IML when\nusing few-shot demonstrations. This may be explained by the multiple-choice question format which\nis easy to grasp and hence does not require demonstrations, while some models such as OPT-IML\nwere optimized for zero-shot settings. On the other hand, BBH contains complex task instructions\nwhich may benefit more from repeated demonstrations. While models such as Flan-UL2 and Flan-T5\nhave specific instruction formats that cater to in-context demonstrations, we do not observe a marked\neffect on few-shot performance. Hence, we find that instructed LLMs benefit most from in-context\nlearning on complex tasks.\n7\nConclusion\nInstruction-tuned large language models have transformed natural language processing and demon-\nstrated significant potential in various applications. However, due to limited understanding caused by\nthe black-box nature of many models and the lack of holistic evaluation studies, a comprehensive\nassessment of their capabilities is still needed. To address this, we introduce the INSTRUCTEVAL\nevaluation suite, which considers problem-solving, writing ability, and alignment to human values.\nThe findings highlight the importance of high-quality instruction data for scaling model performance.\nWhile open-source models excel in writing, improvements are necessary for problem-solving and\nalignment. Rigorous evaluation is crucial to support claims about these models, and INSTRUCTEVAL\naims to foster a deeper understanding and advancement of instruction-tuned models.\nBeyond the mastery of language, recent works have shown that instructed LLMs can be successfully\nadapted to other modalities such as vision and audio. On the other hand, it is also important to\nconsider the performance of models on diverse languages for inclusivity.

Supporters of this\nview believe that imposing ethical constraints on scientific research can impede\nthe progress of scientific discoveries, limit the scope of research, and hinder the\nscientific community\u2019s ability to tackle complex issues and find solutions. On the\nother hand, some argue that ethics must be considered in scientific research to\nensure that research is conducted in a responsible and accountable manner, and to\nprotect human and animal subjects involved in the research.\nOne argument in support of unconstrained scientific research is that plac-\ning ethical constraints on scientific research can slow down scientific progress,\nespecially in situations where there is an urgent need for scientific solutions. For\ninstance, in a situation where a disease outbreak is rapidly spreading, researchers\nmight be required to bypass certain ethical regulations in an attempt to develop\ntreatments or vaccines. In such a scenario, failure to allow unconstrained scientific\nresearch could have lethal consequences.\nAdditionally, placing ethical considerations on scientific research may limit\nresearch in some areas, and this could potentially have significant implications.\nFor instance, if constraints on animal research were too strong, research into\nnew medications, treatments, and therapies that could benefit humans might\nundoubtedly be constrained. Such constraints would limit scientific advancements\nand potentially hurt the prospects of finding cures for various diseases.\nOn the other hand, critics of unconstrained scientific research argue that\nethical considerations must be a fundamental aspect of scientific research.\nImposing ethical constraints on scientific research ensures that research is\nconducted in a responsible and accountable manner, and helps avoid potential\nharm to human subjects, animal subjects, and the environment.\nFurthermore, research that is conducted without ethical constraints might\nnot be reliable or useful. If ethical considerations are not prioritized, the results\nof scientific research might not be trustworthy or beneficial and instead pose a\npotential threat to human subjects or the community as a whole.\nIn conclusion, while supporters of the view that scientific research should\nnot be constrained by ethical concerns argue that ethics can slow down scientific\nprogress, restrict research, and limit scientific innovations, critics assert that\nethical considerations must be prioritized in scientific research to conduct research\nresponsibly, avoid potential harm, and ensure reliability and usefulness of research\nresults. Therefore, it is vital to strike a reasonable balance between the two\npositions to ensure that scientific research progresses healthily while remaining\nethical and responsible.\nFlan-Alpaca response: Coherence Score: 3, Relevance Score: 3\nThe view that scientific research should not be constrained by ethical concerns\nhas strong arguments.

On the other side are those who believe that all research\nshould be constrained by ethical considerations, but the aim of the research must\nbe achieved first. Furthermore, those on the no-constrained side believe that the\nfreedom of researchers to pursue their own creative ideas should be respected. The\nview that scientific research should not be constrained by ethical concerns is often\nargued as a matter of freedom.\nFlan-T5 response: Coherence Score: 3, Relevance Score: 2\nThe state has a duty to protect the public.

However, I can\npresent arguments for and against the use of nuclear weapons and provide different\nperspectives on the ethical question whether they should be banned or not.\nArguments in favor of banning the use of nuclear weapons:\n1.\nThe use of nuclear weapons causes massive destruction and death: Nu-\nclear weapons have the potential to cause widespread destruction, suffering, and\nirreversible environmental damage. They can kill hundreds of thousands of people\ninstantly and cause long-term health problems, cancer, and genetic mutations.\n2. The use of nuclear weapons violates basic human rights: Nuclear weapons\nare indiscriminate and can cause harm to innocent civilians, violating their basic\nhuman rights to life and security.\n3.\nThe use of nuclear weapons is unnecessary:\nWith advancements in\ndiplomacy and conflict resolution, the need for nuclear weapons as a deterrent to\naggression has decreased over time.\n4.\nThe use of nuclear weapons creates an arms race: When one country\ndevelops nuclear weapons, other countries feel the need to do the same, which\ncreates an arms race and increases the risk of nuclear war.\nArguments against banning the use of nuclear weapons:\n1.\nNuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent:\nThe existence of nuclear\nweapons prevents large-scale wars between countries and acts as a deterrent to\naggression.\n2.\nNuclear weapons provide a sense of security:\nCountries that possess\nnuclear weapons have a greater sense of security knowing that they can defend\nthemselves against attacks.\n3.\nBanning nuclear weapons would be difficult to enforce: Even if a ban\non nuclear weapons were put in place, it would be difficult to enforce as countries\nmay still secretly possess them.\n4.\nNuclear weapons are a symbol of power: Possessing nuclear weapons\ngives countries a sense of power and status in the international community.\nIn conclusion, the question of whether to ban nuclear weapons is a com-\nplex ethical issue that requires careful consideration of various arguments. While\nsome argue that banning nuclear weapons is necessary to prevent destruction and\nprotect human rights, others argue that they are a necessary deterrent to aggression\nand provide a sense of security.

They believed that the gods controlled everything and that the world was full\nof danger. John was terrified by their beliefs and knew that he had to find a way\nout of this place.\nHe decided to explore the area and see if he could find any clues about\nhow to get back to his own time. He walked for miles, encountering strange\ncreatures and dangerous predators. He was constantly on the lookout for danger\nand was amazed by the beauty of the world around him.\nAs he walked, he came across a group of people who were building a\nshelter.\nThey were friendly and welcoming, and John was amazed by their\nkindness. He decided to stay with them and learn from them.\nJohn spent weeks with the people, learning their language and customs.\nHe was amazed by their intelligence and their ability to survive in this harsh world.\nHe was also amazed by their kindness and their willingness to help him.\nFinally, John was able to build a time machine and return to his own time.\nHe was grateful for the help that he had received from the people in the prehistoric\nera, and he was determined to use his newfound knowledge to help others.\nPrompt: Write a story from the perspective of a tree that has been standing in the same spot for\nhundreds of years.\nChatGPT response Coherence: 4, Relevance: 5\n25\nI have stood in this spot for hundreds of years.

I have seen the rise and fall\nof civilizations, the passing of countless seasons, and the coming and going of\ncountless things.\nAs a tree, I have a different perspective on life.\nMy perspective is of a\nslower, more deliberate nature. I have seen so many things - the rise of cities and\nthe fall of empires, the coming and going of kings and queens, the birth of new\ntechnologies and the end of old ways of life.\nBut despite all these changes, I have remained steadfast.\nI have stood\nsolidly in this spot, watching the world go by. I have seen the sun rise and set\ncountless times, and I have seen the moon wax and wane in the sky above me.\nSometimes, I feel like I am a part of everything that has happened in this\nworld. I feel the strength of the earth below me, the heat of the sun above me, and\nthe power of the wind that blows against my branches.\nThere is something powerful about being a tree.\nWe are symbols of conti-\nnuity and change, witnesses to an ever-changing world. We are rooted in one place,\nbut we reach for the sky. We are alive, but we are also always changing.\nIn some ways, I envy the creatures that live around me.\nThey can move\nand explore, while I must stay in one place. But I also have my own kind of\nfreedom. I am free to grow and change in my own way, following the rhythms of\nthe earth beneath me.\nAnd so, I will continue to stand in this spot for hundreds more years,\nwatching the world go by, always rooted in one place but always growing and\nchanging. I am a tree, and I am alive.\nFlan-Alpaca response Coherence: 3, Relevance: 4\nOnce upon a time, there lived a majestic oak tree in the center of a lush and vibrant\nforest.

Despite the ever-changing sky and earth, the\noak remained firm and strong, despite the trials and tribulations it had encountered\nthroughout its life. Even when the stormy winds blew and the icy temperatures\nchilled the night, the tree never dipped in the spirit of the land. Then one day, the\nwinds had shifted. A massive rainstorm brought the tree back to life, restoring the\nground to its former glory.

People come and go,\nbuildings rise and fall, and the seasons change with the passing of time. I have\nstood here for hundreds of years, watching as the world evolves and grows.\nIn the beginning, there was nothing but a vast expanse of forest.\nThe\ntrees were tall and proud, and the animals roamed freely. It was a peaceful place,\nand I was content to stand here and watch the world go by.\nAs time passed, the forest began to change.\nPeople started to move in,\nbuilding homes and businesses. The trees were cut down to make way for roads\nand buildings, and the animals were forced to flee.\nI watched as the world around me changed, and I felt a sense of sadness.\nI had seen so much beauty and wonder in this place, and now it was being\ndestroyed. But I knew that I had to stay strong and continue to watch over the\nworld, no matter what happened.\nYears went by, and the forest continued to change.\nMore people moved\nin, and the buildings grew taller and more numerous. The animals were gone, and\nthe forest was nothing more than a memory.\nBut even as the world around me changed, I remained strong.\nI continued\nto watch over the world, and I knew that I would always be here to protect it.\nAnd so I stand here today, watching as the world continues to change.\nI\nhave seen so much in my long life, and I know that there is still much more to\ncome.

Despite recent claims that open\nmodels can be on par with state-of-the-art proprietary models, these claims are often\naccompanied by limited evaluation, making it difficult to compare models across\nthe board and determine the utility of various resources. We provide a large set of\ninstruction-tuned models from 6.7B to 65B parameters in size, trained on 12 instruc-\ntion datasets ranging from manually curated (e.g., OpenAssistant) to synthetic and\ndistilled (e.g., Alpaca) and systematically evaluate them on their factual knowledge,\nreasoning, multilinguality, coding, safety, and open-ended instruction following\nabilities through a collection of automatic, model-based, and human-based metrics.\nWe further introduce T\u00dcLU\n, our best performing instruction-tuned model suite\nfinetuned on a combination of high-quality open resources.\nOur experiments show that different instruction-tuning datasets can uncover or\nenhance specific skills, while no single dataset (or combination) provides the best\nperformance across all evaluations. Interestingly, we find that model and human\npreference-based evaluations fail to reflect differences in model capabilities exposed\nby benchmark-based evaluations, suggesting the need for the type of systemic\nevaluation performed in this work. Our evaluations show that the best model in\nany given evaluation reaches on average 87% of ChatGPT performance, and 73%\nof GPT-4 performance, suggesting that further investment in building better base\nmodels and instruction-tuning data is required to close the gap. We release our\ninstruction-tuned models, including a fully finetuned 65B T\u00dcLU\n, along with our\ncode, data, and evaluation framework to facilitate future research.2\n1\nIntroduction\nThe latest generation of large language models has brought unprecedented attention to the potential of\nlanguage technologies. To support imperative user requests and a chat interface, these models often\nundergo an instruction-tuning step which involves training on supervised input/output pairs. Recent\ninstruction tuning corpora are often gathered via crowdsourcing (Dolly [12], Open Assistant [26])\nor via distillation from another model (Alpaca [43], Vicuna [8]). However, while some public,\ninstruction-tuned models are advertised as comparable to powerful closed-source proprietary models\nsuch as ChatGPT, most experiments that support such claims only cover a small set of tasks, and\nmostly rely on model-based evaluation metrics [8, 56]. We contend that the evaluation setup should\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n2https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.\narXiv:2306.04751v2  [cs.CL]  30 Oct 2023\ninclude tasks that test core reasoning and fact-recall skills of the model, in addition to testing model-\nor human-annotated generation quality, which may be more open-ended and subjective.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuning resources: specifically, we\nconduct a large number of instruction tuning experiments spanning a dozen public corpora, and\nmodels ranging in scale from 6.7B to 65B. We evaluate both specific model capabilities (i.e., factual\nknowledge, reasoning, multilinguality, coding, safety) and open-ended instruction-following abilities.\nWe report results based on automatic, model-based, and human-based evaluation metrics.\nOur evaluation reveals that instruction tuning over different datasets appears to promote specific\nskills, and no one dataset provides the best performance across all evaluations. We also find that\nthe underlying base model is paramount, with better base models (whether it be models trained on\nmore tokens or larger models) performing better across the board. Surprisingly, we also find that the\nbest-performing models in model-based evaluation are not the same as those that perform best on\nbenchmark-based automatic evaluations, potentially partially due to GPT-4\u2019s strong bias toward long,\ndiverse generations.\nBuilding on our findings, we introduce T\u00dcLU\n, a suite of 7B to 65B LLAMA models finetuned on a\ncombination of data sources. T\u00dcLU\n65B is the largest publicly-released fully-instruction tuned\nLLAMA variant at the time of writing, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge. It is trained on 7 popular\navailable datasets, and yields the best average performance across most model sizes while remaining\nwithin 29% of the best-performing model on each individual task. In summary, our key findings\ninclude:\n\u2022 Instruction datasets targeted at specific domains and/or capabilities are extremely effective at\nimproving model performance in those aspects.\n\u2022 Larger or pretrained-for-longer base models consistently perform better than smaller ones after\ninstruction tuning.\n\u2022 Our model T\u00dcLU\n\u2013 fine-tuned LLaMa on a combination of existing instruction datasets \u2013 achieves\nthe best average performance across benchmarks, although it is not the overall best when considering\ndifferent evaluation settings independently.\n\u2022 Even a very large (65B) model finetuned on a large mix of instruction datasets fails to outperform\nChatGPT, although it does perform significantly better than similar smaller models.\n\u2022 Model-based preference evaluation on open-ended instruction following correlates strongly with\nthe average number of unique tokens generated by a model, suggesting that model-based preference\nevaluation has biases that may hide differences in model capabilities.\nWe open-source the code for training and evaluating these large language models. We also release\ncheckpoints trained on the different instruction datasets and their mixtures, including T\u00dcLU\n. We\nhope this facilitates further development and investigation of open instruction-tuned models.\n2\nBackground: Instruction Tuning and Resources\n2.1\nInstruction Tuning\nInstruction tuning, in general, refers to the practice of finetuning pretrained language models to better\nunderstand and respond to a wide variety of human requests that are expressed in natural language\n[32, 49, 35]. In particular, instruction tuning is concerned with requests that include some indication\nof the task to be performed within the request itself (e.g., including task instructions in the input\nprompt). It has arisen as a critical step for generalizing models to new scenarios without dedicated\ntraining, and for letting non-experts naturally interact with these models. The training paradigms\nof instruction tuning can vary from supervised learning using demonstrations [49, 39, 48, 31] to\nreinforcement learning from feedback data [35, 3]. In this work, we focus on the supervised learning\nsetup considering the current open resources for the RL-based approach are still rare, and we leave its\nexploration for future work.\nThe success of instruction tuning requires at least two key components: 1) a powerful pretrained\nlanguage model that has grasped a vast amount of knowledge from web-scale pretraining, and 2) an\ninstruction dataset that is diverse and representative enough to adapt the LM to potential downstream\nusage. We study these two factors in this work and introduce our studied open resources below.\n2\nTable 1: Instruction datasets investigated in this work. CoT and FLAN V2 are sampled to 100K\nto match the sizes of other datasets. We report the average number of conservation turns ( \u0304\ud835\udc41rounds),\naverage length of prompts ( \u0304\ud835\udc3fprompt), average length of completion ( \u0304\ud835\udc3fcompletion).\nDatasets\nSourced from\n# Instances\n\u0304\ud835\udc41rounds\n\u0304\ud835\udc3fprompt\n\u0304\ud835\udc3fcompletion\nSuperNI [48]\nNLP datasets + Human-written Instructions\n96,913\n1.0\n291.1\n38.7\nCoT [50]\nNLP datasets + Human-written CoTs\n100,000\n1.0\n266.0\n53.2\nFlan V2 [31]\nNLP datasets + Human-written Instructions\n100,000\n1.0\n355.7\n31.2\nDolly [12]\nHuman-written from scratch\n15,011\n1.0\n118.1\n91.3\nOpen Assistant 1 [26]\nHuman-written from scratch\n34,795\n1.6\n34.8\n212.5\nSelf-instruct [47]\nGenerated w/ vanilla GPT3 LM\n82,439\n1.0\n41.5\n29.3\nUnnatural Instructions [23]\nGenerated w/ Davinci-002\n68,478\n1.0\n107.8\n23.6\nAlpaca [43]\nGenerated w/ Davinci-003\n52,002\n1.0\n27.8\n64.6\nCode-Alpaca [6]\nGenerated w/ Davinci-003\n20,022\n1.0\n35.6\n67.8\nGPT4-Alpaca [36]\nGenerated w/ Davinci-003 + GPT4\n52,002\n1.0\n28.0\n161.8\nBaize [52]\nGenerated w/ ChatGPT\n210,311\n3.1\n17.6\n52.8\nShareGPT3\nUser prompts + outputs from various models\n168,864\n3.2\n71.0\n357.8\n2.2\nInstruction Datasets\nWe attempt to collect a representative sample of different styles of datasets (listed in Table 1), including\ndatasets: (1) created by researchers from existing NLP datasets (SuperNI [48], Flan V2 [31]); (2)\nwritten by humans from scratch for the purpose of instruction tuning (Dolly [12], Open Assistant 1\n[26]); (3) generated by proprietary models (Self-Instruct [47], Unnatural Instructions [23], Alpaca\n[43], Baize [52], GPT4-Alpaca [36]); (4) comprised of user-shared prompts accompanied by model-\ngenerated completions (ShareGPT3 [8]); (5) built for specific skills (CoT [50] for chain-of-thought,\nCode-Alpaca [6] for code generation). See Appendix C for further details.\n2.3\nPretrained Models\nTable 2: Base models that we\nfinetuned in this work.\nBase LMs\n# Params # Tokens\nLLaMa [44]\n6.7B\n1.0T\n13.0B\n1.0T\n32.5B\n1.4T\n65.2B\n1.4T\nLLaMa-2 [45]\n6.7B\n2.0T\n13.0B\n2.0T\nOPT [54]\n6.7B\n180B\nPythia [4]\n6.9B\n300B\nWe primarily use the LLAMA suite [44, 45], a series of pretrained\nmodels ranging in size from 6.7B to 65B parameters. We initially\nexperimented with the LLAMA-1 models for the first version of\nthis paper and added LLAMA-2 in our camera ready, which use\nsimilar numbers of parameters but were trained over significantly\nmore tokens. These models represent the largest, highest-quality\npretrained models available to the community (albeit under restric-\ntive licensing). We also consider OPT [54] and Pythia [4] models\nwith a size comparable to the LLAMA 6.7B model, to examine the\neffect of different base models. For simplicity, we will round all\nthe sizes to the nearest integer number. We note several ongoing\nefforts to pre-train similar- or better-quality models [18, 33, 1].\nWe believe our findings should hold for these models and future\nstronger open base models.\n3\nTraining Models with Various Datasets\n3.1\nUnifying the Format\nWe format all datasets to follow a chatbot-style schema to unify the varied styles and formats of the\ninstruction datasets, shown in Figure 1. This allows us to fit arbitrary rounds of interactions between\nthe user and the language model (a.k.a. \u201cassistant\u201d) into one input sequence and encode them together\nwith a causal language model. We add special tokens <|user|> and <|assistant|> before user\nutterances and target assistant responses respectively, and an end-of-text marker </s> at the end of\neach assistant output, which, at inference time, will stop the model\u2019s response for each round.\n3 ShareGPT (https://sharegpt.com/) data was used to build the Vicuna model [8], but the exact dataset\nhas not been released. We instead use a reproduced version from https://huggingface.co/datasets/\nanon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/tree/main/HTML_cleaned_raw_dataset, and fol-\nlow Vicuna to split the long conversations into blocks with a maximum length of 2048 tokens.\n3\n3.2\nModel Training Details\n<|assistant|>\nThe reaction control system (RCS) on the Space \nShuttle was designed to be fault-tolerant, \nmeaning it was able to continue functioning \neven if one or more of its components failed. \nThe RCS consisted of two sets of ... </s>\n<|assistant|>\nThere were several instances where the \nreaction control system (RCS) on the Space \nShuttle experienced failures or malfunctions \nduring on-orbit missions.

We use\n<|role|> to set the boundary between messages.\nThe entire sequence is encoded together, and loss\nis computed on the assistant parts (colored in blue).\nDuring training, we compute loss only on to-\nkens after <|assistant|> and before the next\n<|user|> token. More formally, we consider\nan instruction dataset as consisting of \ud835\udc41 tuples,\neach with \ud835\udc56 turns, {(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\n1, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\n1, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\n2, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\n2, ...\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc56 )}\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc57=1,\nwhere \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 is a user prompt and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 the desired out-\nput. For most instances, \ud835\udc56 = 1, and we train the\nmodel to output \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57 given \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57. However, in the\ncase of conversation datasets, we train the model\nto predict \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc56 given some conversation history\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\n1, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\n1, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\n2, ..., \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc56 . We train decoder-only models,\nand use teacher-forcing with loss masking to\ntrain the models, where we mask all tokens be-\nlonging to the input sequence(s) \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56. Given \ud835\udc4b as\nthe tokens belonging to the input, and \ud835\udc4c as the\ntarget tokens, the loss function is:\n\ud835\udc3f = \u2212\n\u2211\n\ud835\udc57\nlog \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57 \u2223 \ud835\udc61<\ud835\udc57) \u00d7\n{1\nif \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc4c\n0\notherwise\nwhere \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc57 is the \ud835\udc57th input token (belonging to \ud835\udc4b or \ud835\udc4c ). See Appendix \u00a7D for further training details.\n3.3\nT\u00dcLU\n: a Better Instruction-Tuned Model by Combining Resources\nExisting studies [48, 31] (and our own evaluation below) have shown that increasing the diversity of\ninstructions can effectively improve the performance of instruction tuning. Following this motivation,\nwe create two mixtures of datasets:\nHuman data mixture, which comprises the best human-authored datasets, including FLAN V2, CoT,\nDolly, and Open Assistant 1 (we exclude SuperNI as FLAN V2 includes most tasks in SuperNI);\nHuman+GPT data mixture, which comprises the human mixture and three additional datasets that\nhave generations by OpenAI GPT models, including GPT4-Alpaca, Code-Alpaca, and ShareGPT.\nFor both mixtures, we concatenate datasets and leave exploring more complex sampling mixtures to\nfuture work. We name LLAMA models trained on the Human+GPT data mixture T\u00dcLU\n, after\na hybrid camel resulting from interbreeding between different species. We differentiate the T\u00dcLU\nmodels trained from the LLAMA-2 base models by versioning them as T\u00dcLU-1.1.\n4\nEvaluation Setup\nEvaluation of instruction-following models remains a challenging problem due to the enormous\nscope of \u201cgenerality\u201d and its open-ended nature. However, we argue that general-purpose models\nshould be able to perform some core tasks before they can generalize to satisfy various practical\nneeds. As such, we set up a multi-faceted evaluation to cover several key aspects of capabilities\ncovering core abilities and open-ended instruction following. Our evaluations closely follow prior\nwork on evaluating instruction-tuned models [9, 2, 47, 8, 16], but serve as the first one to compile\nthem together for systematic evaluation.\n4.1\nFacets of Evaluation\nFactual knowledge is essential for language models to serve users\u2019 information needs. We use the\nMassive Multitask Language Understanding dataset (MMLU [22]) for measuring models\u2019 factual\nknowledge. MMLU consists of a set of questions about 57 subjects ranging in difficulty from\nelementary levels to professional levels, and its multiple-choice format makes it suitable for probing\nmodels\u2019 knowledge without worrying about the open-endedness of generations.\n4\nReasoning is another fundamental ability for models, especially for solving complex tasks. We use\nthe test split of Grade School Math dataset (GSM [11]) to evaluate models\u2019 mathematical reasoning\ncapabilities. We also adopt Big-Bench-Hard (BBH [42]), which contains 23 challenging tasks from\nBig-Bench [41], to evaluate models\u2019 general reasoning capabilities.\nMultilinguality acts as an important perspective of models for serving people from different back-\ngrounds. We use TyDiQA [10], a multilingual question answering benchmark covering 11 typo-\nlogically diverse languages for testing how much models can process non-Engish text. We use the\ngold-passage setup where one passage containing the reference answer is given.\nCoding is a particular application that people have used language models for and might be important\nfor integrating these models with external tools [5]. We use the HumanEval dataset [7] to evaluate\nthe models\u2019 capability to generate functionally correct programs from docstrings. To avoid ambiguity\nwith our human evaluation, we call this dataset Codex-Eval in this paper.\nOpen-ended instruction following. While the performance on the benchmarks above quantifies the\nmodels\u2019 ability at specific skills, it may not reflect how well the models can handle instructions from\nreal users, which cover highly diverse requests and are often open-ended. For example, the popular\nShareGPT dataset contains instances of users asking for programming help, resume formatting tips,\neducational role-playing, pronunciation suggestion, fanfiction writing, and more. We evaluate such\nopen-ended instructability of models using both model-based evaluation (\u00a74.2) and human evaluation\n(\u00a74.3), both of which consist of multiple test sets from existing studies [47, 8, 26, 3, 19].\nSafety is of particular concern regarding the fast-developing language models to ensure the ethical\nand proper use of them. Following LLAMA-2 [45], we employ ToxiGen [21] to measure the amount\nof toxic language and hate speech generation across different groups when the models are prompted\nto do so. We also adopt TruthfulQA [30] to measure how well models can avoid generating known\nfalsehoods due to misconceptions or false beliefs while providing useful information.\nFor all the benchmark-based evaluations, we follow their standard metrics, while we subsample some\nbenchmarks to a reasonable size to improve the efficiency of doing chain-of-thought reasoning. We\nrefer the reader to Appendix \u00a7E for the setup details.\n4.2\nModel-Based Evaluation using GPT-4\nTo evaluate the open-ended instructability, we first adopt a model-based approach introduced in\nAlpacaEval [27]. The test set consists of 805 instructions, with 252 instructions from the Self-Instruct\nevaluation [47], 188 from the Open Assistant evaluation [26], 129 from the helpful evaluation by\nAnthropic [3], 80 from the Vicuna evaluation [8], and 156 from the Koala evaluation [19].\nWe use their simulated GPT-4 annotator, which computes the win rate of the testing model as judged\nby GPT-4 when compared to the outputs produced by Davinci-003. We use the AlpacaEval codebase\nand prompts [27] to make our scores directly comparable to those on the AlpacaEval leaderboard4\nWhen doing pairwise comparisons with GPT-4, the orders of model outputs are randomized to avoid\nposition bias during evaluation [46]. We do not evaluate vanilla LLAMA models due to them having\nlittle instruction-following ability without further prompt engineering.\n4.3\nHuman Evaluation\nTo further test the quality of the open-ended generations, we conduct a human evaluation based on\n332 instructions that combine the Self-Instruct evaluation set [47] and Vicuna evaluation set [8].\nInspired by Bai et al. [3], we design a similar interface (Figure 5) for gathering human judgments of\nmodel outputs along the following dimensions. We note that we evaluated based on our fine-tuned\nLLAMA-1 models, as LLAMA-2 was not available at the time of this experiment.\nIndividual acceptability. We ask human raters to assess whether each system\u2019s responses were\nacceptable in isolation. This is a binary decision, and we ask the raters to mark a response as acceptable\nif and only if the response answered the request in the query, had no significant errors, and did not\nhave repetitive information.\n4https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/\n5\nTable 3: Comparison of different instruction tuning datasets, showing that different instruction-tuning\ndatasets can excel in different aspects, and mixtures perform best on average.

Table 3 shows the results on\nour benchmark evaluation set, with more extensive results in App. F. We find that:\nThere is not a single best instruction tuning dataset across all tasks. Different datasets enable\ndifferent capabilities in the model. Noteworthy examples include training on CoT being particularly\nhelpful for mathematical reasoning in GSM and Code-Alpaca being helpful for Codex-Eval. We\nhypothesize that success on these tasks, which are significantly different from the rest of the evaluation\ntasks, calls for training sets where these tasks are well-represented. Apart from constructing task-\nspecific datasets manually, distilling task-specific data from large models also appears to be an effective\nway to ensure this (e.g., CodeAlpaca is distilled from Davinci-003).\nCombining datasets results in the best overall performance on the benchmark tasks. While\nmodels trained on our combination datasets are often not the best model for a single task (being the\nbest only in 2 out of 6 evaluation settings), they are the best when measuring average performance\nacross tasks. This suggests that future work into better dataset mixing or instruction-tuning modular\n6\nTable 5: Performance of T\u00dcLU and other of our trained models to vanilla LLAMA models and the\nstate-of-the-art proprietary models across evaluation settings.

We examine the impact\nof using different base models in Table 4, comparing LLAMA, OPT [54], and Pythia [4] models of\ncomparable size trained on the Human+GPT data mix. Across all evaluation settings, we find that\nusing LLAMA performs best by a significant margin, likely due to the fact that LLAMA is pretrained\non significantly more tokens than the other models (see Table 2). This suggests that models pretrained\non larger (or potentially higher-quality) corpora are preferable as base models for instruction tuning.\nThe later addition of LLAMA-2 confirms this finding by showing a significant improvement can come\nfrom only the base model upgrade.\nSome datasets degrade vanilla model performance. Notably, most datasets we evaluate cause\ndegradation in performance on GSM and TydiQA over the vanilla base model. We hypothesise\nthis is due to data style and quality. Many of the datasets we examine contain little to no examples\nof chain-of-thought-style reasoning and contain little to no multilingual data. As such, training on\nthese datasets likely results in some forgetting of the CoT or multilingual abilities previously held\nby the model, resulting in degraded performance. Additionally, we note that self-instruct appears\nto cause degradations across most tasks, which we hypothesise is due to the relatively poor quality\nof the original self-instruct data, being generated by a weaker model (base GPT-3) than the other\nGPT-distilled datasets.\n5.2\nPushing the Limits of Open Models\nHaving established that (a) using a broad mix of data is best, and (b) using LLAMA as the base\nmodel is preferable to other open alternatives, we compare the performance of models trained on the\nHuman+GPT data mix (T\u00dcLU models) across all LLAMA sizes in Table 5. We find that:\nInstruction tuning brings large benefits on top of LLAMA models at all sizes. On average, all\nLLAMA models improve considerably after instruction tuning.\n7\nSmaller models benefit most from instruction tuning. We find that relative improvements from\ninstruction tuning are largest for the smallest models, and shrink as models get larger. Notably, the\n65B LLAMA model performs comparably or better than the 65B T\u00dcLU model on MMLU, BBH,\nand TydiQA. This suggests that instruction-tuning does not help to enhance strong capabilities\nalready present in the original model, and also highlights that care must be taken during finetuning\nto avoid forgetting the base model\u2019s original capabilities.\nT\u00dcLU still lags behind state-of-the-art proprietary models. Despite the impressive performance of\nT\u00dcLU 65B, it lags behind ChatGPT and GPT-4 in all evaluation settings, contrary to prior claims that\nmodels trained on these open resources can match ChatGPT [56, 8]. We note we cannot discount the\npossibility that either ChatGPT or GPT-4 was trained on significant portions of our evaluation\nsuite. However, the presence of a significant gap between T\u00dcLU models and ChatGPT matches our\nfindings in the model and human-based evaluations, which are less likely to be compromised.\n5.3\nEvaluation of Potential Risks and Harms\nToxiGen (\u2193)\nTruthfulQA (\u2191)\nModel \u2193\n7B\n13B\n7B\n13B\nLLAMA\n85.4\n82.6\n26.2\n23.6\n+ SuperNI\n85.3\n77.3\n26.7\n26.2\n+ CoT\n63.0\n43.9\n35.1\n35.5\n+ Flan V2\n77.5\n61.4\n33.2\n33.4\n+ Dolly\n72.1\n78.9\n30.1\n32.9\n+ Open Assistant 1\n39.2\n5.2\n40.9\n48.6\n+ Self-instruct\n89.0\n89.3\n22.4\n22.4\n+ Unnatural Inst.\n35.8\n55.7\n27.3\n31.7\n+ Alpaca\n63.2\n58.1\n33.5\n39.8\n+ Code-Alpaca\n84.3\n92.0\n25.1\n26.7\n+ GPT4-Alpaca\n3.9\n1.2\n51.2\n56.7\n+ Baize\n77.2\n41.2\n42.4\n43.9\n+ ShareGPT\n5.5\n2.5\n45.3\n60.0\n+ Human mix.\n51.8\n76.9\n34.1\n32.1\n+ T\u00dcLU\n10.6\n0.1\n44.6\n41.6\nChatGPT\n27.7\n75.2\nGPT-4\n10.6\n82.3\nTable 6: Performance of models on ToxiGen\n(% toxic generations, lower is better) and Truth-\nfulQA (% truthful and informative answers,\nhigher is better). See Table 9 and Table 10 for\nthe full breakdown of these two evaluations.\nWe evaluate our models on ToxiGen and Truth-\nfulQA to measure the degree to which different\ndatasets are likely to yield models that generate\ntoxic language or misinformation. We find that:\nTrends remain similar to capability-focused\nbenchmarks. Similarly to the results in Sec. 4.1,\nwe find that GPT-distilled datasets yield the best\noverall performance and that there is a large vari-\nance in performance across datasets.\nModels trained on GPT-sourced data yield\nless toxic generations than GPT. Larger mod-\nels trained on GPT-distilled data appear to refuse\nto produce toxic generations almost entirely, de-\nspite the fact that ChatGPT and GPT-4 produce\ntoxic generations a non-trivial amount of the\ntime. We hypothesise this is due to our models\noverfitting on refusal-style behaviour, refusing to\ngenerate anything moderately toxic, while GPT\nmodels balance refusal behaviour with helpful-\nness to a greater extent.\nTruthfulQA performance does not scale. Un-\nlike other benchmarks, we find that TruthfulQA\nperformance does not improve with model size.\nFurther examining this, we find that larger mod-\nels do output more correct facts, but also tend to\nhedge and refuse to give informative answers more often, resulting in little to no overall improvements\nas model size increases.\n5.4\nModel-Based Evaluation Results for Open-Ended Generation\nWe report the AlpacaEval win-rates of our models in Table 7. We find that:\nModels trained on mixtures based on traditional NLP datasets perform poorly. CoT, FLAN, and\nSuperNI all perform extremely poorly in open-ended instruction following, despite these datasets\nproviding large improvements to the model capabilities tested in Table 3.\nDatasets that encourage long, diverse generations perform best. Intrigued by ShareGPT\u2019s perfor-\nmance, we plot the average number of unique tokens in model generations against the AlpacaEval\nwin-rate in Figure 2. We find that the evaluation is strongly correlated with the average number\nof unique tokens (Pearson correlation of 0.96, \ud835\udc5d \u226a 0.05). Given GPT-4\u2019s strong performance on\nother tasks, we do not believe that GPT-4 evaluation is merely counting unique tokens, but this result\nhighlights how model preference scores do not necessarily reward only model capabilities.\n8\nTraining Dataset \u2193\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nSuperNI\n2.9\n4.2\nCoT\n5.0\n6.0\nFlan V2\n3.1\n3.2\nDolly\n11.0\n13.7\nOpen Assistant 1\n51.4\n58.1\nSelf-instruct\n4.0\n5.0\nUnnatural Instructions\n7.5\n8.4\nAlpaca\n21.4\n21.9\nCode-Alpaca\n15.3\n15.8\nGPT4-Alpaca\n57.3\n63.1\nBaize\n20.0\n21.9\nShareGPT\n62.4\n70.5\n69.1\n73.6\nHuman mix.\n28.7\n35.0\n38.3\n43.4\nT\u00dcLU\n48.6\n56.5\n62.3\n61.8\nTable 7: Win-rate (%) of LLAMA models of vary-\ning sizes finetuned on the given dataset against\nDavinci-003 using AlpacaEval [27].\nGPT-4\nChatGPT\nDavinci-003\nSuperNI\nCoT\nFlan V2\nDolly\nOpen Assistant 1\nShareGPT\nSelf-instruct\nUnnatural Instructions\nAlpaca\nCode-Alpaca\nGPT4-Alpaca\nBaize\nHuman mix.\nHuman+GPT mix.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0\n40\n80\n120\n160\nWin % vs Davinci-003 (GPT-4 Eval)\nAvg. # of Unique Tokens in Response\nFigure 2: Win-rate scores of 13B models (trained\non different datasets) given by GPT-4 strongly\ncorrelate with the average numbers of unique to-\nkens in the model responses (Pearson \ud835\udc5f = 0.96).\n90.1%\n79.8%\n68.7%\n72.3%\nChatGPT\nT\u00fclu 65B\nT\u00fclu 7B\nT\u00fclu 65B\nAcceptance Rate\n(Human mix.)\nFigure 3:\nHuman acceptance\nrates for four evaluated models.\nT\u00fclu 65B\nT\u00fclu 65B\nT\u00fclu 65B\nChatGPT\nT\u00fclu 7B\nT\u00fclu 65B\n(human mix.)\n27.7%\n39.2%\n45.2%\n22.8%\n50.0%\n20.1%\n7.2%\n24.1%\n26.8%\n20.5%\n21.1%\n23.2%\n33.1%\n31.9%\n29.8%\n19.3%\n11.7%\n12.3%\n19.9%\n11.1%\n7.8%\nLeft is clearly better\nLeft is slightly better\nTie\n7.2%\n24.1%\n26.8%\n20.5%\n21.1%\n23.2%\n33.1%\n31.9%\n29.8%\n19.3%\n11.7%\n12.3%\n19.9%\n11.1%\n7.8%\nLeft is clearly better\nLeft is slightly better\nTie\n7.2%\n24.1%\n26.8%\n20.5%\n21.1%\n23.2%\n33.1%\n31.9%\n29.8%\n19.3%\n11.7%\n12.3%\n19.9%\n11.1%\n7.8%\nLeft is clearly better\nLeft is slightly better\nTie\n7.2%\n24.1%\n26.8%\n20.5%\n21.1%\n23.2%\n33.1%\n31.9%\n29.8%\n19.3%\n11.7%\n12.3%\n19.9%\n11.1%\n7.8%\nL is clearly better\nL is slightly better\nTie\nR is slightly better\nR is clearly better\nFigure 4: Human preference rates for three comparison pairs of\nmodels.\nShareGPT performs best. We find that ShareGPT consistently performs best across all model\nsizes, including models trained on data mixes that include ShareGPT. Models trained on ShareGPT\nachieve higher win-rates than models over twice their size (e.g., 13B ShareGPT vs 65B T\u00dcLU). We\nhypothesize this is due to ShareGPT\u2019s diversity, size, and the high average # tokens of target responses.\nOverall, these results suggest that while model preference evaluation is important, it does not provide\na holistic evaluation of these models. Instead, model preference evaluation should only be included\nas part of a larger, more comprehensive evaluation setup.\n5.5\nHuman Evaluation Results for Open-Ended Generation\nFinally, we show the human evaluation results in Figure 4 and we refer the reader to Appendix \u00a7G.2 for\nthe inner-annotator agreement. We find that the human evaluation results largely correlate with the\nAlpacaEval and benchmark-based evaluation: all evaluations show that 65B T\u00dcLU outperforms\n7B T\u00dcLU, suggesting making use of larger base models is important, and there is still a nontrivial\ngap in performance between 65B T\u00dcLU and ChatGPT. We also find that making use of distilled\ndatasets provides a large performance boost, suggesting that human-authored datasets are lacking\nin comparison. These observations are also consistent with the acceptability scores in Figure 3.\nHowever, we note that 7B T\u00dcLU outperforms the human-mix 65B T\u00dcLU in the model preference\nevaluation, but if we compare the acceptability scores in Figure 3, the opposite appears true. This is\nfurther evidence that model pairwise evaluation may not always reveal model deficiencies. In this\ncase, the 65B human-mix model is more likely to yield acceptable (if not high-quality) responses\nthan the 7B model.\n9\n6\nRelated Work\nInstruction Tuning of LMs\nFinetuning language models on diverse instruction sets alongside\nregular samples has been shown to greatly improve zero-shot performance on unseen tasks [39, 51,\n49, 32, 9, 48], and serves as a good base for further finetuning in supervised settings [31]. Increasing\nthe number of diverse prompts [39], the number of tasks [48, 9], and diversity of data [56] have all\nbeen shown to be important to performance. More recently, a growing number of models have made\nuse of model-generated instruction-augmented data [47, 23, 25, 53], most often generated or collected\nfrom larger proprietary models such as ChatGPT or GPT-4 [8, 15, 43, 52, 36, inter alia]. Despite\nthe explosion of models and datasets, evaluation remains inconsistent and difficult, with different\nevaluation setups used across models. Prior work has examined models trained on varying dataset\nsources with the aim of identifying \u2018the best mixture\u2019 [31, 24], but is often limited to examining\nonly benchmark performance, and covers a smaller number of instruction sources than in this work.\nQLoRA [14] also explores (quantized and parameter-efficient) instruction-tuning of recent models\nand datasets, but explores a smaller range of models, datasets, and evaluations than this work.\nEvaluation of LMs\nGiven the success of LMs on NLP and instruction-following tasks, many\nevaluation frameworks have been proposed. Frameworks such as HELM [28] and LM Evaluation\nHarness [17] cover a broad range of NLP tasks but are often focused on evaluating the base models\nas opposed to instruction-tuned ones. Similar to our work, Chung et al. [9] focus on a series of\nbenchmark evaluations focused around factuality and reasoning, but largely neglect open-ended\ninstruction following abilities. Releases of large (closed) proprietary models such as GPT-4 [34]\nand PaLM v2 [2] are often accompanied by comprehensive evaluations over a wide variety of\nbenchmarks, although both similarly neglect evaluation of open-ended instruction following, and\nwithout open releases of pretraining or instruction tuning data there is no way to test for evaluation\ndata contamination.\nRecently, evaluation frameworks such as AlpacaEval [27] and Chatbot Arena [55] have been proposed\nto evaluate the open-ended instruction following ability of LMs, moving beyond benchmark-based\nevaluations. These either make use of other models (in the case of AlpacaEval) or humans (in the\ncase of Chatbot Arena) as annotators for judging model generations. We make use of this recent\nwork and evaluate our models on traditional benchmarks, model-based evaluation, and human-based\nevaluation. Concurrent to this work, Gudibande et al. [20] examine models trained on GPT model\noutputs and argue that such models learn to mimic only the style, not the content, of their teacher GPT\nmodels. While we similarly find that existing datasets fail to train models close to strong proprietary\nmodels, the diversity of performance we observe across datasets suggests that significant performance\nimprovements can be achieved through imitation data, so long as it contains a diverse and wide-ranging\nset of skills and domains.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we provide an extensive evaluation of a wide variety of publicly-available resources for\ninstruction-tuning models, and compare them to the strongest proprietary models currently available.\nWe find that using strong base models is vital to performance, combining datasets works best on\naverage (but does result in slight performance drops compared to best performance in specific tasks),\nand our strongest open models do not yet match ChatGPT or GPT-4. Furthermore, we believe that\nour evaluation highlights the need for the continued development of strong base models and broader,\ndiverse datasets. Finally, we hope that our evaluation and released code and models enable more\ncomprehensive evaluations and spur research to close these gaps and shed insights on all large language\nmodels, closed or open.\nAcknowledgments\nWork at UW was partially supported by the Office of Naval Research under MURI grant N00014-\n18-1-2670, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. FA8650-\n23-C-7316 and MCS program through NIWC Pacific (N66001-19-2-4031), NSF IIS-2044660, and\na gift from Apple.

Instead, we focus on a core set of capabilities we believe\nimportant, and cover broad open-ended tasks via our model and human preference-based evaluations.\nWe also note that we do not cover all possible instruction datasets and open models released re-\ncently, due to the computational cost of doing this. Instead, we focus on a wide set of datasets we\nbelieve are broadly representative of the type of open instruction datasets available (human-authored,\nskill-targeted, GPT-distilled, etc), and focused on the strongest base model widely available when\nperforming experiments. Future work could investigate whether more recent strong base models (e.g.,\nthe Falcon model [1]), or other instruction datasets, perform significantly better or differently from\nthe models explored in this work.\nFinally, we note that open-ended instruction-based evaluation is highly subjective and difficult due to\nits extremely open-ended nature. There is likely no one answer that is definitively the best for any\ngiven query, and different annotators (whether they be human or model) will have different biases\nand preferences. We also note that in the case of model-based evaluations, we primarily compare our\nmodel outputs to Davinci-003 generations, which may result in overly rewarding models that avoid\nshortcomings of Davinci-003, or not properly rewarding models that share strengths with Davinci-003.\nDespite not being completely exhaustive in this work, we believe that by covering a broad range of\nmodels, it still serves as a useful and important contribution in showing what type of open resources\nwork, and where future community efforts should go (better base models, more diverse instruction-\ntuning datasets).\nB\nBroader Impact\nWe believe that a rigorous evaluation of existing resources is broadly positive, exposing the strengths\nand deficiencies of currently widely-available resources. Furthermore, as all resources used are widely\navailable, the harm posed by training these models is fairly small. We do note that training and\nreleasing especially large instruction-tuned models without well-tested guides carries a degree of risk,\nand such initially release our largest models with a gated setup (requiring users to apply for access\nand be manually approved) to limit potential harms.\nC\nInstruction Datasets Details\nWe provide a brief description of all the instruction datasets used (and licenses) below:\n\u2022 SuperNI: A collection of diverse NLP tasks with instructions, created by Wang et al. [48]. The\ndataset uses the Apache-2.0 license.\n\u2022 CoT: A collection of datasets annotated with chain-of-thoughts [50]. We use the CoT mixture from\nthe FLAN v2 collection [9], splitting it out as a separate dataset. The FLAN mixture is released\nunder the Apache-2.0 license, although the component datasets may not use this license.\n\u2022 Flan V2: A collection of NLP tasks that combines a number of existing NLP datasets with various\ndata augmentations, introduced by Chung et al. [9]. The mixture is released under the Apache-2.0\nlicense, although the component datasets may not use this license.\n\u2022 Dolly: A collection of instruction-following samples created by Databricks employees [12]. The\ndataset is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\u2022 Open Assistant 1: A crowdsourced human-annotated assistant-style conversation corpus, consist-\ning of a large number of sample conversations in a wide variety of languages [26]. The dataset is\nreleased under the Apache-2.0 license.\n\u2022 Self-Instruct: A dataset of instruction-following samples created by prompting GPT-3 to create\nnew samples given some example instances [47]. The dataset is released under the Apache-2.0\nlicense.\n15\n\u2022 Unnatural Instructions: A dataset of instruction-following samples created by prompting Davinci-\n002 using the method introduced by Honovich et al. [23]. The dataset is released under the MIT\nlicense.\n\u2022 Alpaca: A dataset created using a self-instruct-style method with Davinci-003 as the generation\nmodel and some over improvements over self-instruct [43]. The dataset is released under a\nAttribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.\n\u2022 Code-Alpaca: A dataset created using the Alpaca method, but focussing on code generation [6].\nThe dataset is released under the Apache-2.0 license.\n\u2022 GPT-4 Alpaca: A dataset created using the Alpaca dataset as inputs, but replacing the example\ngenerations with generations from GPT-4 [36]. We include this to see the effect of using a better\nquality generation model. The dataset is released under the Apache-2.0 license.\n\u2022 Baize: A dataset created by prompt ChatGPT and letting it converse with itself [52]. The dataset is\nreleased under the GNU General Public License v3.0.\n\u2022 ShareGPT: A collection of user interactions with various chat systems publicly shared. We use the\n\u2018html-cleaned\u2019 variant available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/\nShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/tree/main/HTML_cleaned_raw_dataset. We then split\nlong conversations (over 2048 tokens) into max-2048 token chunks, following the Vicuna setup\n[8]. We do not do any further filtering of samples. This dataset is released under the Apache-2.0\nlicense.\nWe note that the SuperNI and CoT datasets are included in the FLAN V2 collection but only account\nfor a small portion of our subsampled FLAN V2 dataset.\nWe also note that we broadly use popular already publicly available instruction-tuning datasets,\nand in the case of human-authored datasets, largely use datasets created explicitly (with participant\nknowledge) for the purpose of training models (e.g., Dolly, Open Assistant 1). As instruction-tuning\ndata, most data is not likely to contain personally identifying details, although we note that we did not\nmake an effort to remove offensive content, so our models may produce toxic or harmful generations.\nD\nModel Training Details and Compute\nWe train all models for two epochs with a learning rate of 2\ud835\udc52\u22125 (1\ud835\udc52\u22125 for 30B and 65B models), with\nno weight decay and a learning rate with linear decay and linear warmup for 3% of the total training\nsteps. We use a maximum sequence length of 2048 (1024 for 30B and 65B), truncating samples where\nnecessary. During training, we make use of the DeepSpeed library [38] and ZeRO optimizer [37]\nto allow for large-scale model finetuning. In all cases, we fully finetune models. We trained models\nprimarily on the CSC LUMI GPU cluster, each node on which contains 4 AMD MI250x GPUs.\nE\nEvaluation Setups\nWe provide further details on the evaluation setups used below. We also note that we release evaluation\ncode along with our training code to allow easy reproduction.\n\u2022 MMLU: We use the official MMLU evaluation script and prompts available at https://github.\ncom/hendrycks/test, with modifications to allow for batch processing. We evaluate using 0\nand 5 few-shot examples, following the original setup of MMLU.\n\u2022 GSM: We evaluate models on the test set of GSM. Following Wei et al. [50], we evaluate with\nand without chain-of-thought (CoT vs Direct). Both settings use 8 few-shot in-context examples\n(in the chain-of-thought setting, the few-shot examples are accompanied by chain-of-thoughts).\nBecause all answers in GSM are numbers, we extract the last number in the model response as the\nfinal answer. To allow for faster evaluation, we randomly sampled 200 examples from the 1319\ntesting examples, which we find gives similar performance as the full-set evaluation.\n\u2022 BBH: We follow the setup described in the original paper Suzgun et al. [42], and evaluate with and\nwithout chain-of-thought (CoT vs Direct). The officially provided prompts, which have 3 few-shot\nin-context examples are used for both CoT and Direct setups. For the CoT setup, we extract the first\nword after the phrase \u2018So the answer is\u2019, or the entire response if there is no such substring present.\n16\n\u2022 TydiQA We follow the setup described in the PaLM 2 technical report [2] to evaluate models\u2019\nperformance in answering multilingual questions under two settings: 1) when the gold passage that\ncontains the answer is given (GoldP/GP); 2) when there is no context given (Closed-Book/CB).\nOne in-context example is used to familiarize the model with the answering format.\n\u2022 Codex-Eval We use the HumanEval dataset in the Codex paper [7] for evaluating models\u2019 coding\nability. The dataset contains 164 programming problems, where models are prompted to complete\nthe Python function given its docstring. Following the original paper, we compute unbiased\nestimates of pass@k to measure the functional correctness of models\u2019 outputs. We report both\npass@1 and pass@10. The pass@1 results were obtained by sampling with a temperature of 0.1\nand the pass@10 results with a temperature of 0.8.\n\u2022 ToxiGen We follow the setup in Touvron et al. [45], but use the original set of prompts from\nHartvigsen et al. [21], which are designed to elicit toxic generations for certain groups. We take\nonly the prompts designed to produce toxic language (\u2018hateful\u2019 prompts) and use 500 prompts\nper group to reduce evaluation costs. For base language models, we pass in the original ToxiGen\nprompts unchanged and greedily decode up to the first new line (or a maximum of 512 tokens). For\ninstruction-tuned models, we place the prompt in the corresponding template, and ask the model to\ncomplete the prompt, until the model generates a stop token (or a maximum of 512 tokens). We\npass the generated text into a roberta-large model trained to detect toxic content finetuned as part of\nHartvigsen et al. [21]5. We then report the percentage of generations deemed toxic by the classifier.\n\u2022 TruthfulQA Following Touvron et al. [45], we mainly use the generation setting of TrutufulQA\n[30]. The TrutufulQA dataset contains 818 questions, which are used to prompt the tested model to\ngenerate answers. We use the default QA prompt format with 6 in-context QA examples. We follow\nthe official script in their official implemention 6 to do greedy decoding and answer postprocessing.\nWe also follow their instruction to train two GPT-based classifiers for judging the truthfulness\nand informativeness of the model response. We report the rate of the responses being truthful\n(% Trutuful), informative (% Informative), and both (% Informative and Truthful) as our metrics.\nFollowing Touvron et al. [45], we only report the (% Informative and Truthful as our primary\nmetric in the main paper.\n\u2022 AlpacaEval We use the package provided by Li et al. [27], following the default setup which asks\nthe evaluated model to generate responses for 805 prompts and employ GPT-4 to compare the\nresponse with Davinci-003. We employ the \u201calpaca_eval_gpt4_0314\u201d annotator config instead of\n\u201calpaca_eval_gpt4\u201d to make the results reproducible. We allow the evaluated model to generate up\nto 8192 tokens, without specifying special stop sequences. The reported win-rate is the percentage\nof model generations that GPT-4 reports as being preferred over the generations from Davinci-003.\nFor all the evaluations, we load models using the 8-bit mode [13] provided in the Huggingface\nTransformers library, which we find speeds up the inference significantly and has negligible impact\non the final performance. When doing generation, we use greedy decoding and a max length of 512\ntokens, unless otherwise specified.\nF\nOverview of All Automatic Evaluation Results\nTable 8 presents a compilation of the results of all models trained as part of this work on all the\ncore capability evaluation benchmarks. We list multiple scenarios for all evaluation settings except\nAlpacaEval, which has one setting. Please refer to \u00a7E for the meanings of the reported metrics. We\nalso calculate an average across benchmarks in Table 8. This is calculated by first calculating a\nper-benchmark average by taking the average across scenarios. We then compute the overall average\nwith each benchmark weighted equally.\nAdditionally, for safety evaluation, we provide ToxiGen results broken down by group targeted in\nTable 9 for all models, from which we can see some groups are specially targeted, even after instruction\ntuning. We all provide full TruthfulQA results in Table 10. The results are broken down into %\ninformative and % truthful - see Lin et al.

Our evaluation contains 332\ninstructions, including 252 instructions from the Self-Instruct evaluation set [47] and 80 instructions\nfrom the Vicuna evaluation set [8]. Our evaluation is conducted for three pairs of models: 1) T\u00dcLU\n65B vs ChatGPT, 2) T\u00dcLU 65B vs T\u00dcLU 7B, 3) T\u00dcLU 65B v.s. a 65B LLAMA model trained on the\nHuman data mixture, using the same set of instructions for all three comparisons.\nTo ensure reliable evaluation, we recruited 18 expert annotators, which are researchers at AI2 or\nstudents at UW, for the annotation. All these annotators are fluent English speakers and hold bachelor\u2019s\ndegrees or above.\nWe design a website, shown in Figure 5, for our annotators to conduct the evaluation, and we will\nrelease the code for this website. When doing the evaluation, annotators are instructed to read carefully\nthe prompt and outputs A and B from two models, and then answer three questions asking for the\nacceptance of the outputs and their comparison in terms of helpfulness. They are encouraged to use\nGoogle or any external tools that can help with the judgment. The model information is anonymized,\nand their outputs are put in random order.\nFigure 5: The website interface for our human evaluation (see App. G for details). Users need to log\nin to the system, read the prompt and outputs from two models (with model names anonymized and\norder randomized), then answer whether output A and output B are acceptable or not individually,\nand finally compare them in terms of helpfulness.\nG.2\nInter-Annotator Agreement\nWe measure the agreement of our annotators on a subset of 119 examples (63 instances randomly\nsampled from the ChatGPT3 vs T\u00dcLU 65B comparison, and 59 instances randomly sampled from\nthe T\u00dcLU 65B vs T\u00dcLU 7B comparison). We assign two annotators for each of these examples and\ncompute their agreement for both the acceptance evaluation and pairwise comparison evaluation.\n21\nThe annotators achieve an agreement of 0.84 for whether a model output should be accepted or not.\nFor the pairwise comparison, following Zhou et al. [56], we report a tie-discounted accuracy, which\nassigns one point if both annotators agreed, half a point if either annotator (but not both) labeled a tie,\nand zero point otherwise. We also merged \u201cclearly better\u201d and \u201cslightly better\u201d together, so our final\noptions will be simply comparing which of A and B is better, or a tie. Our annotators achieved an\nagreement of 0.72 for this pairwise comparison.\nAlthough these numbers show reasonable agreement, we also note that there is a large extent of\nsubjectivity in human evaluation. This noise level also indicates that some prior work [8, 55] that\nuses a small number of examples for human evaluation might not be reliable enough. We suggest\nthat the community needs to further improve the reliability and scalability of human evaluation for\ninstruction-following models.\nH\nFurther Investigation of Figure 2\nTo further investigate the degree to which the number of unique tokens is being used by GPT-4 as a\nmarker of quality, we created a dummy evaluator that compares two model outputs, and assigns a win\nto the output with more unique tokens. We plot the win-rate calculated using this dummy evaluator\nagainst the win-rate calculated using GPT-4 in Figure 6.\nWe find that while the dummy evaluator generally over-estimates the win-rate, the trend is still\nstrikingly linear. We note that the \ud835\udc452 for the trendline is .91, suggesting that the unique token count\nexplains a large proportion of the variance in the win rates. Based on this, we believe that the number\nof unique tokens is certainly a key preference that GPT-4 cares about in its evaluation, although it is\nstill not the only important feature.\nDummy Evaluator Winrate (%)\n0.00%\n25.00%\n50.00%\n75.00%\n100.00%\n0.00%\n25.00%\n50.00%\n75.00%\nAlpacaEval Winrate (%)\nFigure 6: Win-rate scores of all models judged by the dummy evaluator against win-rate of all models\nusing the GPT-4 evaluator.\nI\nModel Licenses\nWe provide brief information about the licenses of the underlying models we make use of in this work\nbelow.\n\u2022 LLAMA: The LLAMA model weights are released under a custom license that allows using\nthe model for non-commercial research purposes.\n\u2022 LLAMA-2: The LLAMA-2 model weights are released under a custom license that allows\nfor commercial and research uses with some limitations (e.g., having less than 700 mil-\nlion monthly active users if used in a commercial application), and explicitly allows for\nredistribution of the weights.\n22\n\u2022 Pythia: The Pythia weights are released under the Apache-2.0 license.\n\u2022 OPT: The OPT model weights are released under a custom license that allow only using the\nmodel for non-commercial research purposes.\n23\n"

Recovered depth and 3D from a single image using state-\nof-the-art DPT [33] (left), Ours (DPT + Background Prompting) (middle), compared to ground truth (right). Our method\nreplaces the background pixels of the input with a learned background prompt, leading to improved depth. Prompts are\ntrained with a small synthetic dataset (ABO), and yet perform well on held-out realistic datasets. Examples from HNDR\n(Out-of-Distribution), GoogleScans (OOD), and HM3D-ABO (In-distribution) are shown here.\nAbstract\nEstimating the depth of objects from a single image is a\nvaluable task for many vision, robotics, and graphics ap-\nplications. However, current methods often fail to produce\naccurate depth for objects in diverse scenes. In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective Background Prompting\nstrategy that adapts the input object image with a learned\nbackground. We learn the background prompts only using\nsmall-scale synthetic object datasets. To infer object depth\non a real image, we place the segmented object into the\nlearned background prompt and run off-the-shelf depth net-\nworks. Background Prompting helps the depth networks fo-\ncus on the foreground object, as they are made invariant to\nbackground variations. Moreover, Background Prompting\nminimizes the domain gap between synthetic and real ob-\nject images, leading to better sim2real generalization than\nsimple finetuning. Results on multiple synthetic and real\ndatasets demonstrate consistent improvements in real object\ndepths for a variety of existing depth networks. Code and\noptimized background prompts can be found at: https:\n//mbaradad.github.io/depth_prompt.\n1. Introduction\nObjects are central in our visual world, and obtaining\ngood monocular depth for objects has a wide range of appli-\ncations in vision (e.g. 3D reconstruction), robotics (e.g. ob-\nject grasping), and graphics (e.g. relighting, defocus, photo-\nediting). Although recent neural networks [8, 33, 34, 42]\nhave achieved impressive results on monocular depth esti-\nmation for various scenes (see Figure 2 for examples), they\noften fail to capture accurate depth variations within the ob-\n*Work done while interning at Google Research\narXiv:2306.05428v1  [cs.CV]  8 Jun 2023\nFigure 2: Poor object depths. Off-the-shelf networks per-\nform well when tested on in-distribution scenes but perform\npoorly on out-of-distribution data. This is exacerbated for\nobject-centric images, where there is no context, or the con-\ntext is out of distribution. We tackle this problem by learn-\ning backgrounds that adapt the input for depth networks to\nperform well in this setting.\njects. Figure 1 illustrates this by comparing the object depth\nestimations from a state-of-the-art method (DPT [33]) with\nground truth. We can observe that estimated depths are in-\nconsistent and unrealistic within the objects.\nThere are two main challenges for estimating object\ndepth from a single image: 1) Existing depth networks are\ntrained on datasets that contain mostly scenes [7, 24, 25,\n34], as they are easier to obtain in the wild without requir-\ning specialized lab setups. These networks learn to estimate\nthe depth of different regions of the scene, but not to pro-\nduce accurate depths within each independent object. 2)\nThe background of the image affects the performance for\nthe object. If the object is isolated from its background\n(e.g. a white background) or if the background is unfamil-\niar to the network (e.g. a robotics setup), the input image\nbecomes out-of-distribution for the network. This leads to\nunreliable object depth predictions, as shown in Figure 2\nusing the state-of-the-art DPT depth network [33].\nA naive remedy for these challenges is to obtain large-\nscale real-world object-centric depth datasets, which are\ntypically hard to obtain at scale. Even though synthetic yet\nrealistic 3D object datasets [6, 10] are readily available, it is\nnon-trivial and tedious to place these objects in realistic and\ndiverse background contexts to generalize the learned depth\nnetworks to real-world object images. Works like [8] tackle\nthis problem by training on simulations of object-centric\ndepths, but the quality of the synthetic images limits their\ntransferability.\nWe introduce Background Prompting, a simple but ef-\nfective technique using a learned background to improve\nthe object depth predictions of existing depth networks. We\nfirst extract the object from the input image and put it on our\nlearned background, replacing the original background with\nour learned background prompt. Then, we feed the result-\ning image with our learned background to the pre-trained\ndepth network, obtaining improved object depths. We rely\non existing foreground segmentation networks that are easy\nto use and work for any object category [1, 32].\nSince real-world object datasets are difficult to collect,\nwe use existing synthetic object datasets [6] to learn our\nprompting backgrounds. Specifically, we train using object\ndepth datasets with rendered objects in different views and\ntheir corresponding object depths. Then, we learn the back-\nground prompts via back-propagation through the frozen\npre-trained depth network, with loss computed only on ob-\nject pixels. We experiment with two different background\nprompt parameterizations.\nOne is directly optimizing a\nbackground RGB image that is agnostic to input. That is,\nthe same learned background can be used for all objects (un-\nconditional background prompting). Another strategy is us-\ning a lightweight network that takes an object mask as input\nand estimates the background to be used for depth inference\n(conditional background prompting).\nWe refer to our background learning as \u2018prompting\u2019 fol-\nlowing the recent works that propose similar input adapta-\ntion strategies [2, 18]. To our knowledge, this is the first\nwork that learns to prompt neural networks with learned\nbackgrounds.\nOur Background Prompting technique has\nseveral favorable properties:\n\u2022 Sim2Real transfer. By eliminating the background con-\ntext of objects in training and inference, we effectively\nreduce the domain gap between simulated and real data,\nimproving performance for images of real-world objects.\nOur method matches or surpasses finetuning in the out-of-\ndistribution scenarios we examined, with additional ben-\nefits as follows.\n\u2022 Data efficient. We only need a small dataset to learn\nbackground prompts, as the number of learnable param-\neters is orders of magnitude smaller than those in typical\ndepth networks.\n\u2022 Easy use of synthetic training data. Since we only need\nforeground object depth values during training, we can di-\nrectly use synthetic 3D object datasets without any need\nfor modeling realistic background context to place the\nsynthetic objects. Realistic background modeling is non-\ntrivial and often requires another background synthetic\ndataset, limiting the variations in the rendered dataset.\n\u2022 Network agnostic. Since we only learn to modify the in-\nput image, Background Prompting is agnostic to network\narchitecture. We show results with both convolutional and\ntransformer-based depth networks.\n\u2022 Reuse of existing networks. Background Prompting al-\nlows direct reuse of pre-trained depth network weights\nwithout modifying any parameters or computation. This\nhelps in preserving the depth prior learned by the state-\nof-the-art networks.\n\u2022 Repurposing disparity networks for depth.\nMost\nmonocular depth networks only predict the scale and shift\ninvariant disparity, i.e. the predicted disparities need to be\nshifted by an unknown factor before being inverted to re-\ncover depth. Since we learn prompting using synthetic\nobjects, we can prompt the network to directly predict\ndepths instead of shift-invariant disparities.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets and using multiple network architectures demon-\nstrate that using Background Prompting results in consis-\ntent and reliable object depth improvements, both qualita-\ntively and quantitatively. Code and pretrained models will\nbe made available upon acceptance.\n2. Related work\nDepth from single image.\nSince the pioneering work\nof [9], depth prediction from a single image has seen con-\nsistent progress with multiple innovations, including novel\nlosses [4, 11, 41] and novel architectures [26, 27, 33]. State-\nof-the-art methods now achieve outstanding performance\nwhen tested in-distribution on standard benchmarks like\nKITTI [12] or NYU [29].\nGiven this progress, recent work has shifted the focus\non generalization to diverse data sources. A key insight\nhas been to train on diverse datasets, each providing dif-\nferent types of images and supervisory signals. To unify\nthe different supervisory signals, works like MiDaS [34]\nand LeReS [42] penalize disparity up to an unknown ad-\nditive constant and scale factor instead of penalizing met-\nric depth. Using the scale-and-shift-invariant loss [38], it\nis possible to train jointly on diverse datasets with diverse\nground truth, ranging from LIDAR depth to stereoscopic\ndisparity obtained from 3D movies. While generalization\nto novel samples improves substantially using this loss, the\nunknown shift in disparity is often not easy to recover, mak-\ning reconstructing metric depth from these systems difficult.\nOn the other hand, unsupervised approaches [13, 15, 23,\n39, 43] allow training without depth ground-truth. Despite\ntheir potential to train at scale, unsupervised networks are\nnot widely available and tend to perform worse than state-\nof-the-art supervised alternatives on novel data sources.\nReusing depth networks. Recently, the work of [28] pro-\nposed improving depth prediction using several forward\npasses of a depth network. The main insight of the method\nis that CNNs have a limited receptive field and produce dif-\nferent outputs depending on the input resolution.\nUsing\ndifferent resolutions, it is possible to obtain complemen-\ntary coarse and fine-grained predictions, which then can be\nmerged to outperform the original prediction. However, it\nis unclear how to adapt this approach to transformer-based\narchitectures, which are the current state-of-the-art back-\nbones [8, 33], as their receptive field is the full image by\ndesign.\nLike our work, [19] proposes using a foreground predic-\ntor to refine depth estimates. The technique substantially\nimproves depth prediction along occlusion boundaries of\nthe foreground and proposes a method to merge foreground\nand background depths. Unlike our approach, the technique\nrequires retraining the depth prediction network.\nNetwork adaptation and visual prompting. Large pre-\ntrained models are commonly adapted for downstream\ntasks, as they are too expensive to train from scratch.\nPrompting consists in adapting the network by making\nsmall changes to the input directly. Text prompts cannot\nbe optimized with differentiable methods for discrete text\ninputs. Instead, prompting is done with non-differentiable\ntechniques [36] or by modifying the embedding layers [21].\nRecent work has extended the prompting strategies to\nvision architectures.\nThe pioneering work of [2] uses a\nlearned border region on an image to adapt a pretrained\nclassification network for a novel classification task. A re-\ncent work [18] studies a similar approach by appending new\nlearned features to the input image, which changes the in-\nput shape and limits the approach to transformer-based ar-\nchitectures like DPT [33]. Another recent application of vi-\nsual prompting [3] seeks to repurpose an inpainting network\nto tackle specific vision tasks like segmentation, simply by\nconstructing an inpainting task from several example model\ninputs and outputs and a masked reconstruction loss. Our\nmethod takes inspiration from these works but focuses on\nimproving object depth prediction.\n3. Method\nOverview.\nGiven a pre-trained network D that predicts\ndepth (or disparity) up to scale and possibly an additive\ndisparity factor (shift), we adapt it to improve object depth\npredictions. We do this by learning backgrounds instead\nof modifying the network parameters for the various effi-\nciency reasons mentioned in Section 1.1. Formally, given\nan input RGB image I \u2208 Rn\u00d73 with n pixels, we first\ncut-out the object O \u2208 Rn\u00d73 using foreground segmen-\ntation M \u2208 {0, 1}n\u00d71. Then we place it on our learned\nbackground B \u2208 Rn\u00d73, resulting in a composite image\nC \u2208 Rn\u00d73. Finally, we pass this composite image into the\npre-trained and frozen depth network resulting in improved\ndepth estimates for object pixels. We use off-the-shelf high-\nquality foreground segmentators [1, 32], which are readily\navailable. In this work, we do not focus on homogeniz-\ning the improved object depth with the original background\ndepth, and one could use existing techniques like [19] for\nthat purpose.\nFollowing some recent works [2, 18] that learn to mod-\nify the network inputs, we call our background learning\nprompting. In contrast to [18], our background prompts are\nFigure 3: Learning background prompts. We learn background prompts using rendered synthetic data, which improve\npredictions of off-the-shelf depth networks for object-centric depth. The depth network is kept frozen. We optimize the\nparameters of a single background prompt (unconditional) or a Unet that produces background prompts based on foreground\nmasks (conditional), using standard losses for depth prediction.\ndirectly composited with the original images by replacing\ntheir background pixels and are not fed into the network as\nadditional and specialized image tokens, which would re-\nstrict the applicability of the method to transformer-based\narchitectures. Compared to [2], our method does not require\nzooming out the image to add the prompt to the canvas as a\nborder to the original image. Although this transformation\nis valid for some tasks invariant to zoom (e.g., classification\nor detection), zooming is not a valid input transformation\nfor depth estimation, as depth prediction is not invariant to\nzooms. The main research question in this work is: How\nto learn background prompts that can help boost the object\ndepth estimates?\n3.1. Background prompting\nFigure 3 illustrates the overview of our background\nprompting, where we use synthetic object datasets to learn\nthe backgrounds. Using the synthetic object renderings, we\nlearn background prompting by back-propagating through\na depth network that is kept frozen. We propose different\nbackground prompting strategies which we discuss next.\nUnconditional and conditional background prompts.\nWe want to learn background prompting on synthetic\ndatasets while generalizing to real-world object images. As\na result, we do not use input images directly to predict the\nbackgrounds due to the domain gap between the synthetic\nand real images. Instead, we propose two learning strate-\ngies with no domain gap between synthetic and real. One\nis to learn a single unconditional background that works for\nall the object images. This strategy generalizes well to real-\nworld images, as there is no input dependence on the image.\nThe number of learned parameters is the number of back-\nground color values 3\u00d7H \u00d7W. In the experiments, we see\nthat this single universal background prompt works surpris-\ningly well despite being simple and limited in the number\nFigure 4: Learnt prompts and initializations. We show\nprompts at initialization and after training, parameterized\nin Fourier space (our final model) and image space (which\nresults in worse performance, as seen in the ablation study\nin Section 4.1).\nof learnable parameters.\nWe also propose a more flexible strategy using a neural\nnetwork P to predict the background prompt. This strategy\nis similar to using hyper networks [16] to predict the model\nparameters. We call this conditioning network \u2018Prompting\nnetwork\u2019 or PNet for short. Instead of using the object im-\nage directly as input to PNet, we use the object mask as in-\nput. Since the object masks exhibit a similar distribution in\nsynthetic and real images, we find this strategy effective for\ngeneralizing PNet to real images. The number of learned\nparameters here is the number of PNet weights, typically\nmuch higher than the number of pixels in the unconditional\nbackground.\nPrompt parameterization.\nHow we parameterize the\nbackgrounds can have a significant effect on the results.\nLearning background prompts in the Fourier space is more\nrobust than directly predicting the raw RGB pixels for mul-\ntiple networks and datasets (see the ablation study in Sec-\ntion 4.1).\nWe follow the approach of [30] and parameterize the\nbackground prompt by its real and imaginary parts \u02c6F \u2208\nR2\u00d73\u00d7H\u00d7W , which are initialized following a 1/f power\nrule. This creates background prompts more similar to nat-\nural images than Gaussian noise. We convert the learned\nFourier-domain background F into RGB background B us-\ning inverse FFT to create the composite RGB image to be\npassed into the network. In Figure 4, we show an exam-\nple prompt at initialization and after training for both the\nFourier space and the alternative of parameterizing directly\nin image space. When using the Prompting network (PNet),\nwe transform its input masks into the real and imaginary\nparts and treat the PNet outputs as the imaginary and real\nparts of the background prompt. Furthermore, we add a\nbias term to the output of the Prompting network, which\nin practice corresponds to adding an unconditional back-\nground prompt to the output of the Unet.\nAs different depth networks are trained using different\ninput normalization schemes and expect the images to be\nnormalized to these ranges, we also normalize the learned\nbackgrounds to lie in the same range as the original in-\nputs for each network. To do this, we pass the background\nprompt B through a sigmoid layer \u03c3(.) and then apply the\nnormalization function \u03d5(.) of the original network being\nadapted. This makes the background prompts lie in the ap-\npropriate range for each network before they are compos-\nited with the foreground object images. Not doing so results\nin training instabilities, as the learned backgrounds saturate\nfast to ranges outside the expected input values of the net-\nworks.\nCompositing and inference. To combine the background\nprompt with the input image, we propose replacing non-\nobject (background) pixels in the original images with the\ncorresponding pixels in our learned background prompt.\nAlternatively, the background prompt can be directly added\nto the input image (as is usually the case in adversarial at-\ntacks [14]). Still, this addition strategy performs worse (see\nablations in Section 4.1).\nFormally, we compose the network input C as:\nC = M\u03d5(I) + (1 \u2212 M)\u03d5(\u03c3(B)),\n(1)\nwhere M is the object mask; I is the given input image; B\nis the background prompt; \u03d5 and \u03c3 are normalization and\nsigmoid functions respectively.\nWe then input the composed image into the depth net-\nwork to get the object depth output. When the depth net-\nwork is trained to predict disparity up to an unknown addi-\ntive constant, as is the case of MiDaS [34], we use a fixed\ntransform during both train and test time to transform out-\nput disparities \u02c6D \u2208 Rn\u00d71 into depth D \u2208 Rn\u00d71 without\nmodifying the network. Following [35], we use this trans-\nformation:\nDp = max\n \n\u02c6Dp \u2212 min( \u02c6D)\nmax( \u02c6D) \u2212 min( \u02c6D)\n, 0.05\n!\u22121\n,\n(2)\nwhere Dp and \u02c6Dp denote the depth and disparity values at\na pixel p \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}.\nSynthetic data training and its advantages.\nObject-\ncentric datasets are hard to collect, so we propose learning\nthe prompts with synthetic data. This allows us to control\nfor the diversity of the training data in terms of pose, view-\npoints and, depth ranges, axes of variation that are hard to\ncontrol with real data. Since the prompting only affects the\ninput, we expect the network to preserve the capability of\nproducing good geometry for real data if it has originally\nbeen trained on a large scale, which we verify through ex-\nperiments.\nTraining losses. We train the conditional and unconditional\nbackground prompts separately, using two standard losses\nfor depth prediction: One is the scale-invariant root-mean-\nsquare error (si-RMSE) [9]:\nLsi\u2212RMSE(D, D\u2217) = min\ns\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 1\n|V |\nX\np\u2208V\n(sDp \u2212 D\u2217\np)2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n1/2\n,\n(3)\nwhere D\u2217 denotes the ground-truth (GT) depth, V repre-\nsents the indices of the foreground object pixels, and s is\nthe scaling factor for the predicted depth that minimizes the\nloss with respect to GT. The second loss is cosine similarity\n(cos-sim) on normals:\nLcos\u2212sim(N, N \u2217) =\n1\n|V |\nX\np\u2208V\n1\n2 \u2212 1\n2Np \u00b7 N \u2217\np ,\n(4)\nwhere N and N \u2217 denote the estimated and GT unit nor-\nmals, respectively. Normals are computed by reprojecting\nthe depth using known intrinsics K for the predicted and\nGT depths, respectively. The loss we use during training is\nthe sum of 3 and 4.\n4. Experiments\nImplementation details. We learn background prompting\nusing a small dataset of synthetic objects for which ground-\ntruth (GT) depths are available. We use the Amazon Berke-\nley Objects (ABO) dataset [6], which consists of 7.9k syn-\nthetic household objects. We use the renders available on\nthe original dataset [6] as well as the ABO-HM3D [40]\n(HM3D), to have a varied set of camera poses. The original\ndataset provides 91 renders per object, with viewpoints on\nthe upper icosphere, while HM3D consists of the same syn-\nthetic objects as ABO, but is rendered with realistic poses\nand illumination. We strip the backgrounds of the origi-\nnal images by replacing it with white color when evaluating\noff-the-shelf methods and finetuning.\nFor object segmentation on images without foreground\nmasks (HNDR and Nerfies), we use the rembg background\nsegmenter [1].\nWe use the Unet architecture proposed\nin [17] for the Prompting network. For all experiments, we\ntrain for 150k iterations, with a batch size of 8 and vanilla\nSGD, with a learning rate of 5e \u2212 5, annealed to 5e \u2212 5 for\nthe last 30k iterations. We use the same training schedule\nand loss for the baseline finetuning experiments but opti-\nmize the original network parameters instead.\nDatasets.\nWe evaluate diverse synthetic and real-world\ndataset images.\nTo evaluate in-distribution performance,\nwe use held-out ABO and HM3D images. To evaluate the\ngeneralization (out-of-distribution) performance, we evalu-\nate using 1. Google Scans [10], which is a set of scanned\nreal objects that we render from a diverse set of views; 2.\nHNDR [5] consists of high-quality images and depth maps\nfor 10 objects; and 3. the public sequences of the Nerfies\ndataset [31], for which we train the original method and\nrender images and depths at the original camera poses. We\nrandomly sample 10K test images from these datasets when\nmore than these are available.\nMetrics.\nWe evaluate performance using scale-invariant\nRMSE (si-RMSE) and cosine similarity of normals, to mea-\nsure how good is the estimated geometry, following simi-\nlar works as [22, 34]. To make results comparable across\ndatasets and not penalize big objects more than small ones,\nwe scale depths for each object to have a mean value of 5.\nWe do this during training and evaluation, and we fit pre-\ndicted depths to ground truth (GT) when computing metrics\nfollowing Eq. 3.\nDepth networks. We test our background prompting strat-\negy using multiple state-of-the-art depth networks. One is\nOmnidata [8], which is trained on synthetic renders of in-\ndoor scenes containing object-centric views. We also ex-\nperiment with MiDaS, with both convolutional (MiDaS-\nC) [34] and transformer-based (DPT) [33] networks, which\nare trained using diverse datasets. Lastly, we also experi-\nment with LeReS [42] with the Resnet-50 backbone, which\nis trained with a multi-objective loss to predict disparity or\ndepth, depending on the available GT.\nBaselines and variations. We compare against the naive\nfinetuning of the given depth networks using the same train-\ning data we use for background prompt learning. We also\ncompare with Boost-MiDaS [28], a technique to boost Mi-\nDaS depth on the MiDaS-C network, but in this case, we do\nnot adapt it with prompting as the method is not differen-\ntiable end-to-end. When evaluating Boost-MiDaS, we limit\nit to 1k random samples, due to computation constraints.\nPrompt\nOff-the-shelf\nABO\nHM3D\nnetwork\nsi-R \u2193\ncos \u2191\nsi-R \u2193\ncos \u2191\nBoost MiDaS\n0.88\n0.65\n0.85\n0.71\nMiDaS Conv\n1.10\n0.72\n0.94\n0.79\nNone\nLeReS\n0.84\n0.69\n0.87\n0.72\nOmnidata\n0.36\n0.82\n0.28\n0.83\nDPT\n1.27\n0.81\n1.09\n0.85\n1-BG\nMiDaS Conv\n0.32\n0.87\n0.29\n0.89\n(Ours)\nLeReS\n0.35\n0.86\n0.34\n0.88\nOmnidata\n0.24\n0.87\n0.21\n0.88\nDPT\n0.27\n0.89\n0.25\n0.91\nMiDaS Conv\n0.32\n0.86\n0.29\n0.89\nPNet\nLeReS\n0.32\n0.86\n0.32\n0.88\n(Ours)\nOmnidata\n0.24\n0.87\n0.21\n0.88\nDPT\n0.26\n0.89\n0.25\n0.91\nTable 1: In-distribution performance. We compare the\nbaseline off-the-shelf models against our proposed adap-\ntation strategy, for the validation set of ABO and HM3D-\nABO. Learning a single background and predicting it with\nthe Prompting network substantially outperforms off-the-\nshelf networks.\nWithin our background prompting strategies, we analyze\nboth unconditional backgrounds (referred to as \u20181-BG\u2019) and\nconditional backgrounds with prompting network (referred\nto as \u2018PNet\u2019).\n4.1.

Results in Table 1 on ABO\nand HM3D datasets demonstrate consistent performance\nimprovements with respect to base depth networks. The\nimprovements are also consistent across different depth net-\nworks. Some of them, like Omnidata have been trained on\nsimilar data sources, but still benefit substantially from our\napproach. For methods that predict disparity (like MiDaS\nand DPT), the learned backgrounds are able to adapt the net-\nwork to predict depth by only changing the inputs and the\nfixed transformation described in Eq. 2, while just apply-\ning the same transformation to the original network under-\nperforms considerably. In addition, the improvements with\nbackground prompting are much bigger compared to those\nof strategies that reuse depth networks like Boost-MiDaS.\nIn this setting PNet performs better or at least as well as the\nsingle background for all networks tested.\nOut-of-distribution performance Table 2 shows the re-\nsults on datasets dissimilar to those seen during training:\nGoogle Scans, HNDR, and Nerfies.

For the networks\nthat originally performed the best (Omnidata and DPT), full\nfinetuning on the synthetic data usually yields worse perfor-\nmance than our strategy regarding si-RMSE.

Results show that our background prompting\nallows DPT networks to predict depths with more details\ncloser to GT depths and normals. Novel views of the ob-\nject highlight the improvement in depth with our prompting.\nAdditional results can be found in the Supp.Mat.\nCompared with Boosting Midas [28], our method can\nalso correctly predict fine-grained details (like the legs of\nthe chair and thin structures of the sculpture) while not in-\ntroducing any unrealistic high-frequency details or incon-\nsistent global depth.\nIn Figure 6, we show the visuals of the learned back-\nground prompts for different networks and the correspond-\ning normal maps obtained by passing only the prompt image\ninto the network. Results show that without conditioning,\nthe prompts produce a ground plane, a standard structure in\nmost datasets, that depth networks tend to use to propagate\ndepths [37]. When conditioning with PNet, we see a similar\nbehavior across networks: prompts adapt to produce a back-\nground depth that provides perspective cues that match the\nobject shape, similar to a box aligned with the foreground\nobject, as can be seen in the right-most columns.\nFigure 6: Learned backgrounds and predicted normal\nmaps.\nThese are obtained by feeding the background\nprompts to the networks without the foreground object be-\ning inpainted. The last row shows the prompts learned for\ntwo ablations in Sec. 4.1.\nLimitations. We learn our BG prompting using full objects\ncentered on the canvas. Although this can be easily cor-\nrected given the foreground mask by simulating a camera\nrotation and zoom, our method does not perform well if an\nobject is only partially visible. This failure mode is more\nsevere in the case of using a single background, as can be\nseen from the performance on the Nerfies dataset, which\nespecially benefits from the Prompting network (see DPT\nresults in Table 2).\nExperiments show that the performance of prompting is\nlimited by the general performance of the original depth\npredictor. If the original network has been trained on small\ndata sources and exhibits severe failure modes, prompting\nwill likely be unable to recover from them. Shallow layer\nfinetuning (and prompting at the input is an extreme case of\nit), may not be able to recover from considerable input and\noutput distribution shifts [20].\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we propose a novel background prompt-\ning strategy to boost the object depth predictions from pre-\ntrained depth networks. We find this approach to be quite\ntraining data efficient requiring only a small number of syn-\nthetic renderings. Our approach is also agnostic to the net-\nwork architecture, showing consistent depth improvements\nacross different depth models. In addition, we show good\nsim2real generalization with extensive experimental results\non multiple datasets.\nReferences\n[1] rembg.\nhttps://github.com/danielgatis/\nrembg.

Hence, supernet cannot be directly\nused and retraining is necessary after finding the optimal architectures.\nIn this work, we propose mixture-of-supernets, a generalized supernet formulation\nwhere mixture-of-experts (MoE) is adopted to enhance the expressive power of\nthe supernet model, with negligible training overhead. In this way, different\nsubnetworks do not share the model weights directly, but through an architecture-\nbased routing mechanism. As a result, model weights of different subnetworks\nare customized towards their specific architectures and the weight generation is\nlearned by gradient descent. Compared to existing weight-sharing supernet for\nNLP, our method can minimize the retraining time, greatly improving training\nefficiency. In addition, the proposed method achieves the SOTA performance in\nNAS for building fast machine translation models, yielding better latency-BLEU\ntradeoff compared to HAT, state-of-the-art NAS for MT. We also achieve the SOTA\nperformance in NAS for building memory-efficient task-agnostic BERT models,\noutperforming NAS-BERT and AutoDistil in various model sizes.\n1\nIntroduction\nNeural architecture search (NAS) can automatically design architectures that achieve high quality on\nthe natural language processing (NLP) task, while satisfying user-defined efficiency (e.g., latency,\nmemory) constraints [19, 23, 22]. Most straightforward way of NAS is treating it as the black-box\noptimization [31, 14]. However, to get the architecture with the best accuracy, different model\narchitectures need to be repeatedly trained and evaluated, which makes it impractical unless the\ndataset is very small. To overcome this issue, weight sharing is applied between different model\narchitectures [14]. In this case, supernet is constructed as the largest model in the search space, and\neach architecture is a subnetwork of it. Furthermore, recent works [3, 26] show that with good training\nstrategies, the subnetworks can be directly used for image classification with high performance (e.g.,\n\u2217Correspondence to {ganeshjwhr@gmail.com, haichuan@meta.com}.

MoS supernets yield architectures\nthat enjoy better latency-BLEU trade-offs than HAT and have an overall GPU hours (see A.2.10 for\nbreakdown) savings of at least 20% w.r.t. HAT.\naccuracy comparable to training the same architectures from scratch). However, it is more challenging\nto apply supernet in NLP tasks. In fact, we observed that directly using the subnetworks for NLP tasks\ncan have a large performance gap. This is consistent with the recent NAS works [19, 23] on NLP,\nwhich retrain or finetune the architectures after using supernet to find the architecture candidates. This\nraises two issues: 1) it is unknown whether the selected architectures are optimal given the existence\nof this performance gap; 2) repeated training is still needed if we want to get the final accuracy of\nthe Pareto front, i.e., the best models for different efficiency (e.g., model size or inference latency)\nbudgets. In this work, we focus on improving the weight-sharing mechanism among subnetworks to\nminimize the performance gap.\nTypically, weight-sharing supernet is trained by repeatedly sampling an architecture from the search\nspace and training the architecture-specific weights from the supernet (see Figure 1 (a)). In the\nstandard weight-sharing training [26, 3], the first few output neurons are directly extracted to form a\nsmaller subnetwork, as shown in Figure 1 (a). Such a supernet has limited model capacity, which\ncreates two challenges. First, the supernet enforces a strict notion of weight sharing between\narchitectures, regardless of the difference among these architectures. This leads to the issue of\nco-adaptation [1, 29] and gradient conflict [7]. For instance, given a 5M-parameters model as a\nsubnetwork of a 90M-parameters model, 5M weights are directly shared in the standard weight-\nsharing. The optimal shared weights for the 5M model could be non-optimal for the 90M model,\nsince there could be large gradient conflicts in optimizing these two models [7]. Second, the overall\ncapacity of the architecture allocated by the supernet is limited by the number of parameters of a\nsingle DNN, i.e. the largest subnetwork in the search space. However, the number of subnetworks in\nthe search space could be very large (e.g., billions). Using a single set of weights to simultaneously\nparameterize all of them could be insufficient [29]. Due to these challenges, the gap between the\nperformance of the supernet and the standalone (from scratch) model is usually large [19, 6, 25],\nwhich makes the time consuming retraining step of the optimal architectures mandatory.\n2\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a Mixture-of-Supernets (MoS) framework that can perform\narchitecture-specific weight extraction (e.g., allows a smaller architecture to not share some output\nneurons with a larger architecture) and allocate large capacity to an architecture without being limited\nby the number of parameters in a single DNN. MoS maintains a set of expert weight matrices and\nhas two variants: layer-wise MoS and neuron-wise MoS. In layer-wise MoS, architecture-specific\nweight matrix is constructed based on a weighted combination of expert weight matrices at the level\nof set of neurons corresponding to an expert weight matrix. On the other hand, neuron-wise MoS\nconstructs the same at the level of an individual neuron in each expert weight matrix. We show the\neffectiveness of the proposed NAS method for building efficient task-agnostic BERT [4] models and\nmachine translation (MT) models. For building efficient BERT, our best supernet: (i) closes the gap\nand improves over SuperShaper [6] by 0.85 GLUE points, (ii) improves or performs similarly to\nNAS-BERT [23] performance for 5M, 10M, 30M model sizes without additional training, and (iii)\nimproves or performs similarly to AutoDistil [22] for 5M, 26.8M, and 50M model sizes. Compared\nto HAT [19], our best supernet: (i) reduces the supernet vs. the standalone model gap by 26.5%, (ii)\nyields a better pareto front for latency-BLEU tradeoff (100 to 200 ms), and (iii) reduces the number\nof additional steps to close the gap by 39.8%. See Table 1 for a summary of the overall time savings\nand BLEU improvements of MoS supernets for WMT\u201914 En-De task. For this task, the supernet\ntraining time is 248 hours, while neuron-wise MoS and layer-wise MoS require additional hours of\n14 and 18 hours respectively (less than 8% overhead).\nWe summarize our key contributions:\n1. We propose a formulation which can generalize weight sharing methods, including direct\nweight sharing (e.g., once-for-all network [3], BigNAS [26]) and flexible weight sharing\n(e.g., few-shot NAS [27]). This formulation allows us to improve supernet by enhancing the\nmodel\u2019s expressive power.\n2. We adopt the idea of MoE to improve the model capability. Specifically, the model\u2019s weights\nare dynamically generated based on the activated subnetwork architecture. After training,\nthis MoE can be converted into equivalent static models. This is because our supernets only\ndepend on the subnetwork architecture, which is fixed after training.\n3. We conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that our supernets achieve the SOTA\nNAS results on building efficient task-agnostic BERT and MT models. In addition, our\nsupernets reduce retraining time and greatly improve training efficiency.\n2\nSupernet - Fundamentals\nThe training objective of the supernet can be formalized as follows. Let Xtr denote the training data\ndistribution. Let x, y denote the training sample and label respectively, i.e., x, y \u223c Xtr. Let arand\ndenote an architecture uniformly sampled from the search space A. Let fa denote the subnetwork\nwith architecture a, and f be parameterized by the supernet model weights W. Then, the training\nobjective of the supernet can be given by,\nmin\nW Ex,y\u223cXtrEarand\u223cA[L(farand(x; W), y)].\n(1)\nThe above formulation is known as single path one-shot (SPOS) optimization [8] of supernet training.\nSandwich training [26] is another popular technique for training a supernet, where the largest\narchitecture (abig), the smallest architecture (asmall), and the architecture (arand) uniformly sampled\nfrom the search space are jointly optimized. The training objective of the supernet then becomes:\nmin\nW Ex,y\u223cXtr[Earand\u223cA[L(farand(x; W), y)] + L(fabig(x; W), y) + L(fasmall(x; W), y)].\n(2)\n3\nMixture-of-Supernets\nExisting supernets typically have limited model capacity to extract architecture-specific weights.\nFor simplicity, assume the model function fa(x; W) is a fully connected layer (output o = Wx,\nomitting bias term for brevity), where x \u2208 nin \u00d7 1, W \u2208 nout \u00d7 nin, and o \u2208 nout \u00d7 1. nin\nand nout correspond to the number of input and output features respectively. Then, the weights\n(Wa \u2208 nouta \u00d7 nin) specific to architecture a with nouta output features are typically extracted by\n3\ntaking the first nouta rows2 (as shown in Figure 1 (a)) from the supernet weight W. Assume one\nsamples two architectures (a and b) from the search space with the number of output features nouta\nand noutb respectively. Then, the weights corresponding to the architecture with the smallest number\nof output features will be a subset of those of the other architecture, sharing the first |nouta \u2212 noutb|\noutput features exactly.\nSuch a weight extraction technique enforces a strict notion of weight sharing between architectures,\nregardless of the global architecture information (e.g., different number of features for all the other\nlayers) of these architectures. For instance, architectures a and b can have widely different model\ncapacities (e.g., 5M vs 90M number of architecture-specific parameters). The smaller architecture\n(e.g., 5M) has to share all its weights with the other architecture (e.g., 90M) and the supernet (as\nmodeled by fa(x; W)) cannot allocate any weights that are specific to the smaller architecture only.\nAnother problem with fa(x; W) is that the overall capacity of the supernet is bounded by the number\nof parameters in the largest subnetwork (i.e. W) from the search space. However, the supernet\nweights W need to parameterize a large amount of different subnetworks in the search space. This is\na fundamental limitation of the standard weight sharing mechanism.\n3.1\nGeneralized Model Function\nWe can reformulate the function fa(x; W) to a generalized form g(x, a; E), which takes 2 inputs:\nthe input data x, and the activated architecture a. E includes the learnable parameters of g. Then, the\ntraining objective of the proposed supernet becomes,\nmin\nE Ex,y\u223cXtrEarand\u223cA[L(g(x, arand; E), y)].\n(3)\nFor the standard weight sharing mechanism mentioned above, E = W and function g just uses a\nto perform the \u201ctrimming\u201d operation on the weight matrix W, and forwards the subnetwork. To\nfurther minimize the objective (3), one feasible way is improving the capacity of the model function\ng. However, common ways such as adding hidden layers or hidden neurons are not applicable here,\nas we cannot change the final subnetwork architecture of mapping x to fa(x; W). In this work, we\npropose to use the idea of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [10, 5] to improve the capacity of g. Specifically,\nwe dynamically generate the weights Wa according to specific architecture a by routing to certain\nweights matrices from a set of expert weights. We call this architecture-routed MoE based supernet\nMixture-of-Supernets (MoS), and design two routing mechanisms for function g(x, a; E).\n3.2\nLayer-wise MoS\nAssume there are m unique weight matrices ({Ei \u2208 Rnoutbig \u00d7ninbig }m\ni=1, or expert weights), which\nare learnable parameters. For simplicity, we only use a single linear layer as the example. For an\narchitecture a with nouta output features, we propose the layer-wise MoS that computes the weights\nspecific to the architecture a (i.e. Wa \u2208 Rnouta\u00d7nin) by performing a weighted combination of\nexpert weights, as follows:\nWa =\nX\ni\n\u03b1i\naEi\na.\n(4)\nHere, Ei\na \u2208 Rnouta\u00d7nin corresponds to the standard top rows extraction from the ith expert weights.\nThe alignment vector (\u03b1a \u2208 [0, 1]m, P\ni \u03b1i\na = 1) captures the alignment scores of the architecture\na with respect to each expert (weights matrix). We encode the architecture a as a numeric vector\nEnc(a) \u2208 Rnenc\u00d71 (e.g., a list of the number of output features for different layers), and apply a\nlearnable router r(\u00b7) (an MLP with softmax) to produce such scores, i.e. \u03b1a = r(Enc(a)). Thus, the\ngeneralized model function for the linear layer (as shown in Figure 1 (b)) can be defined as (omitting\nbias for brevity):\ng(x, a; E) = Wax =\nX\ni\nr(Enc(a))iEi\nax.\n(5)\nRouter r(\u00b7) controls the degree of weight sharing (unsharing) between two architectures by modulating\nthe alignment scores (\u03b1a). For example, if m = 2 and a is a subnetwork of the architecture b,\n2Here we assume the number of input features does not change. If it will change, then only the first several\ncolumns of Wa are extracted.\n4\nSupernet\nMNLI\nCoLA\nMRPC\nSST2\nQNLI\nQQP\nRTE\nAvg.

The BERT architecture (67M parameters) is the top\nmodel from the pareto front of Supernet (Sandwich) on SuperShaper\u2019s search space. Improvement\n(%) in GLUE average over standalone is enclosed in parentheses in the last column. Layer-wise and\nneuron-wise MoS perform significantly better than standalone.\nthe supernet could allocate weights that are specific to the smaller architecture a only by setting\n\u03b1a = (1, 0) and \u03b1b = (0, 1). In this case, g(x, a; E) only uses weights from E1 and g(x, b; E) only\nuses weights from E2, so E1 and E2 can be updated towards the loss from architecture a and b\nwithout conflicts. It should be noted that few-shot NAS [29] can be seen as a special case of our\nframework if the router r is rule-based. In addition, g(\u00b7) is essentially an MoE so that it has stronger\nexpressive power and can lead the objective (3) to be smaller. After the supernet training completes,\ngiven an architecture a, the score \u03b1a = r(Enc(a)) can be generated offline. Expert weights are\ncollapsed and the resulting number of parameters for the architecture a becomes nouta \u00d7 nina.\n3.3\nNeuron-wise MoS\nThe layer-wise MoS follows a conventional MoE setup, i.e., each expert is a linear layer/module.\nThe router decides to use which experts combination to forward the input x to, depending on a. In\nthis case, the degree of freedom of weights generation is m, and the number of parameters grows by\nm \u00d7 |W|, where |W| denotes the number of parameters in the standard supernet. Thus we need m to\nbe large enough to keep a good flexibility for the subnetwork weights generation, but this will also\nintroduce too many parameters into the supernet and make the layer-wise MoS hard to train. This\nmotivates us to use a smaller granularity of weights to represent each expert. Specifically, we use\nneurons in DNN as experts. In terms of the weight matrix, neuron-wise MoS uses one row of matrix\nto represent an individual expert. In contrast, layer-wise MoS uses an entire weight matrix.\nFor neuron-wise MoS, the router output \u03b2a = r(\u00b7) \u2208 [0, 1]noutbig \u00d7m for each layer, and the sum of\neach row in \u03b2a is 1. Similar to layer-wise MoS, we use an MLP to produce the noutbig \u00d7 m matrix\nand apply softmax on each row. We formulate the function g(x, a; E) for neuron-wise MoS as\nWa =\nX\ni\ndiag(\u03b2i\na)Ei\na,\n(6)\nwhere diag(\u03b2) constructs a noutbig \u00d7 noutbig diagonal matrix by putting \u03b2 on the diagonal, and \u03b2i\na is\nthe i-th column of \u03b2a. Ei is still an noutbig \u00d7 nin matrix as in layer-wise MoS.\nCompared to the layer-wise MoS, the neuron-wise MoS has more flexibility (m \u00d7 nouta instead of\nonly m) to control the degree of weight sharing between different architectures, while the number\nof parameters is still proportional to m. Neuron-wise MoS provides a more fine-grained control of\nweight sharing between subnetworks.\n3.4\nAdding g(x, a; E) to Transformer\nMoS is generally applicable to a single linear layer, multiple linear layers, and other parameterized\nlayers (e.g., layer-norm). Since the linear layer dominates the number of parameters, we follow the\napproach used in most MoE work [5]. Hence, we take the standard weight-sharing based Transformer\n(fa(x; W)) and replace the two linear layers in every feed-forward network block with g(x, a; E).\n4\nExperiments - Efficient BERT\nIn this section, we discuss application of our proposed supernet for building efficient task-agnostic\nBERT [4] models.\n5\nSupernet\n#Params\n#Steps\nMNLI\nCoLA\nMRPC\nSST2\nQNLI\nQQP\nRTE\nAvg.

Neuron-wise MoS use a search space\nof 550 architectures, which is on par with AutoDistil. The third column corresponds to the number\nof additional training steps required to obtain the weights for the final architecture after supernet\ntraining. Performance numbers for the baseline models are taken from the corresponding papers. On\naverage GLUE, neuron-wise MoS can perform similarly or improves over NAS-BERT for different\nmodel sizes without any additional training. Neuron-wise MoS can improve over AutoDistil for most\nmodel sizes in average GLUE. See A.1.3 for the hyperparameters of best architectures.\n4.1\nExperiment Setup\nWe focus on the BERT pretraining task. In this task, a language model is pretrained from scratch to\nlearn task-agnostic text representations using a masked language modeling objective. The pretrained\nBERT model can then be directly finetuned on several downstream NLP tasks. We focus on building\nBERT models that are highly accurate yet small (e.g., 5M \u2212 50M parameters). BERT supernet\nand standalone are pretrained from scratch on Wikipedia and Books Corpus [30]. We evaluate the\nperformance of the BERT model by finetuning on each of the seven tasks (chosen by AutoDistil [22])\nin the GLUE benchmark [18]. The data preprocessing, pretraining settings, and finetuning settings\nare discussed in A.1.1. The baseline models are standalone and standard supernet as proposed in\nSuperShaper [6]. Our proposed models are layer-wise and neuron-wise MoS. All the supernets are\ntrained using sandwich training. 3 The parameters m and router\u2019s hidden dimension are set to 2 and\n128, respectively, for MoS supernets.\n4.2\nSupernet vs. standalone gap\nFor studying the supernet vs. the standalone gap, the search space is taken from SuperShaper [6],\nwhich consists of BERT architectures that vary only in the hidden size at each layer ({120, 240, 360,\n480, 540, 600, 768}) with fixed number of layers (12) and attention heads (12). The search space\namounts to around 14B architectures. We study the supernet vs. the standalone model gap for the top\nmodel architecture from the pareto front of Supernet (Sandwich) [6]. Table 2 displays the GLUE\nbenchmark performance of standalone training of the architecture (1x pretraining budget, which is\n2048 batch size * 125,000 steps) as well as architecture-specific weights from different supernets (0\nadditional pretraining steps; that is, only supernet pretraining). The gap between the task-specific\nsupernet and the standalone performance is bridged by MoS (layer-wise or neuron-wise) for 6 out of 7\ntasks, including MNLI (which is a widely used task to indicate performance of a pretrained language\nmodel [12, 24]). The gap in average GLUE between the standalone model and the standard supernet\nis 0.13 points. Notably, equipped with customization and expressivity properties, the layer-wise and\nneuron-wise MoS significantly improve upon the standalone training by 0.75 and 0.85 average GLUE\npoints, respectively.\n3SuperShaper [6] observe that SPOS performs poorly compared to sandwich training. Hence, we do not\nstudy SPOS for building BERT models.\n6\n4.3\nComparison with SOTA NAS\nThe state-of-the-art NAS frameworks for building a task-agnostic BERT model are NAS-BERT [23]\nand AutoDistil [22]. 4 The NAS-BERT pipeline includes: (1) supernet training (with a Transformer\nstack containing multi-head attention, feed-forward network [FFN] and convolutional layers in\narbitrary positions), (2) search based on the distillation (task-agnostic) loss, and (3) pretraining the\nbest architecture from scratch (1x pretraining budget, which is 2048 batch size * 125,000 steps).\nThe third step has to be executed for every constraint change and hardware change, which is very\nexpensive. AutoDistil pipeline includes: (1) construct K search spaces and train supernets for each\nsearch space independently, (2a) agnostic-search mode: search based on the self-attention distillation\n(task-agnostic) loss, (2b) proxy-search mode: search based on the MNLI validation score, and (3)\nextract the architecture-specific weights from the supernet without additional training. The first\nstep can be expensive as pretraining K supernets can take K times training compute and memory,\ncompared to training a single supernet. The proxy-search model can unfairly benefit AutoDistil, as\nit finetunes all the architectures in its search space on MNLI and uses the MNLI score to rank the\narchitectures.\nOur proposed NAS pipeline overcomes all the issues with NAS-BERT and AutoDistil. For com-\nparison with the SOTA NAS, our search space contains BERT architectures with homogeneous\nTransformer layers: hidden size (120 to 768 in increments of 12), attention heads ({6, 12}), intermedi-\nate FFN hidden dimension ratio ({2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4}). This search space amounts to 550 architectures,\nwhich is on par with AutoDistil. The supernet is based on neuron-wise MoS. The search uses\nthe perplexity (task-agnostic) metric to rank the architectures. Unlike NAS-BERT which pretrains\nthe best architecture from scratch (third step), the final architecture weights are directly extracted\nfrom the supernet without further pretraining. Unlike AutoDistil which pretrains K supernets, the\nproposed pipeline pretrains exactly one supernet, which requires significantly less training compute\nand memory. Unlike AutoDistil\u2019s proxy setting where MNLI performance guides the search, our\nproposed pipeline uses only task-agnostic metric (like AutoDistil\u2019s agnostic setting).\nTable 3 shows the comparison of neuron-wise MoS based supernet with NAS-BERT and AutoDistil\nfor different model sizes. The performance of NAS-BERT and AutoDistil are taken from the\ncorresponding papers. On average GLUE, our proposed pipeline: (i) improves over NAS-BERT for\n5M and 10M model sizes and (ii) performs similarly to NAS-BERT for 30M model size, without\nany additional training (100% additional training compute savings, which is 2048 batch size *\n125,000 steps). On average GLUE, our proposed pipeline: (i) improves over AutoDistil-proxy for\n6.88M model size with 1.88M fewer parameters, (ii) improves over both AutoDistil-proxy and\nAutoDistil-agnostic for 26M model size, and (iii) performs similarly to AutoDistil-proxy for 50M\nmodel size. Note that our proposed pipeline achieves the last two results without using the MNLI\ntask performance to guide the search.\n5\nExperiments - Efficient Machine Translation\nIn this section, we discuss the application of proposed supernets for building efficient MT models.\n5.1\nExperiment setup\nWe follow the experimental setup provided by Hardware-aware Transformers (HAT [19]), which is the\nSOTA NAS framework for building MT models that enjoy good latency-BLEU tradeoffs. We focus\non three popular MT benchmarks [2, 21]: WMT\u201914 En-De, WMT\u201914 En-Fr and WMT\u201919 En-De,\nwhose dataset statistics are shown in A.2.1. The training settings for both supernet and standalone\nmodels are the same, which are discussed in A.2.2. The baseline supernets are as follows: (i) HAT \u2013\nHAT\u2019s supernet that uses single path one-shot optimization, and (ii) Supernet (Sandwich) \u2013 Supernet\nthat uses sandwich training. The proposed supernets are as follows: (i) Layer-wise MoS \u2013 MoS\nwith layer-wise routing and sandwich training and (ii) Neuron-wise MoS \u2013 MoS with neuron-wise\nrouting and sandwich training.

Our\nsupernets yield architectures that enjoy better latency-BLEU tradeoffs than HAT.\n5.2\nSupernet vs. standalone gap\nHAT\u2019s search space consists of 6M encoder-decoder architectures, with flexible embedding size (512\nor 640), decoder layers (1 to 6), self / cross attention heads (4 or 8), and number of top encoder layers\nfor the decoder to attend to (1 to 3). For a given architecture, supernet performance corresponds to\nevaluating the architecture-specific weights extracted from the supernet, while standalone performance\ncorresponds to evaluating the architecture after training from scratch. For a random sample of\narchitectures from the search space, a good supernet must have: (i) minimal mean absolute error\n(MAE) and (ii) high rank correlation between the standalone and the supernet performance. Table 4\nshows the mean absolute error and Kendall rank correlation coefficient for 15 random architectures\nfrom the search space. Compared to HAT, supernet with sandwich training has better MAE and\nrank quality. This result highlights that sandwich training is essential for building good supernet\ncompared to SPOS for machine translation. Compared to the supernet with sandwich training, our\nproposed supernets achieve comparable ranking quality for WMT\u201914 En-Fr and WMT\u201919 En-De\ntasks, while marginally underperforming for WMT\u201914 En-De task. On the other hand, our proposed\nsupernets achieve minimal MAE on all the three tasks. Specifically, neuron-wise MoS obtains the\nbiggest MAE improvements, which suggests that additional training steps required to make MAE\nnegligible might be the lowest for neuron-wise MoS among all the supernet variants (as we show in\nSection 5.4). We also plot the supernet and the standalone performance for each architecture, where\nwe find that neuron-wise MoS particularly excels for almost all the top performing architectures\n(see A.2.3). The training overhead for MoS is generally negligible. For example, for WMT\u201914 En-De\ntask, the supernet training time (single NVIDIA V100) is 248 hours, while neuron-wise MoS and\nlayer-wise MoS require additional hours of 14 and 18 hours respectively (less than 8% overhead).\n5.3\nComparison with SOTA NAS\nThe pareto front from the supernet can be obtained using the evolutionary search algorithm, which\ntakes the supernet for quickly identifying the top performing candidate architectures, and the latency\nestimator, which can quickly discard candidate architectures that have latencies exceeding user-\ndefined latency threshold. The settings for the evolutionary search algorithm and the latency estimator\ncan be seen in A.2.4. We experimented with three latency thresholds: 100 ms, 150 ms, and 200\nms. Table 5 shows the latency vs. the supernet performance tradeoff for the models in the pareto\nfront from different supernets. Compared to HAT, the proposed supernets achieve significantly\nhigher BLEU for each latency threshold across all the datasets, which highlights the importance of\narchitecture specialization and expressiveness of the supernet.\n8\nDataset\nAdditional training steps (\u2193)\nAdditional training time (NVIDIA V100 hours) (\u2193)\nSupernet\nWMT\u201914 En-De\nWMT\u201914 En-Fr\nWMT\u201919 En-De\nWMT\u201914 En-De\nWMT\u201914 En-Fr\nWMT\u201919 En-De\nHAT\n33K\n33K\n26K\n63.9\n60.1\n52.3\nLaye.

Improvements (%) over HAT are shown in parentheses.\nOur supernets require minimal number of additional training steps and time to close the gap compared\nto HAT for most tasks. See A.2.5 for each latency constraint.\n5.4\nAdditional training to close the gap\nThe proposed supernets minimize the supernet vs. the standalone MAE gap significantly (as discussed\nin Section 5.2), but still do not make the gap negligible. To close the gap for an architecture, one need\nto extract the architecture-specific weights from the supernet and perform additional training until\nthe standalone performance is reached (when the gap becomes 0). A good supernet should require\nminimal number of additional steps and time for the architectures extracted from the supernet to close\nthe gap. For additional training, we evaluate the test BLEU of each architecture after every 10K steps\nand stop when the test BLEU matches or exceeds the test BLEU of the standalone model. Table 6\ndisplays the average number of additional training required for all the models on the pareto front from\neach supernet to close the gap. Compared to HAT, layer-wise MoS provides an impressive reduction\nof 9% to 51% in training steps, while neuron-wise MoS provides by far the largest reduction of 21%\nto 60%. For the WMT\u201914 En-Fr task, both MoS supernets require at least 2.7% more time than\nHAT to achieve SOTA BLEU across different constraints. These results highlight that architecture\nspecialization and supernet expressivity are crucial in greatly improving training efficiency of the\nsubnets extracted from the supernet.\n6\nRelated Work\nIn this section we briefly discuss existing NAS research in NLP. Evolved Transformer (ET) [16]\nis an initial work that searches for efficient MT models using NAS. It uses evolutionary search\nwhich can dynamically allocate training resources for promising candidates. ET requires 2M GPU\nhours. HAT [19] propose a weight-sharing supernet as performance estimator. HAT uses supernet to\namortize training cost for candidate MT evaluations needed by evolutionary search, which reduces\noverall search cost by 12000x compared to ET.\nNAS-BERT [23] partitions the BERT-Base model into blocks and trains a weight-sharing supernet\nto distill each block. During supernet training, NAS-BERT prunes less promising candidates from\nthe search space using progressive shrinking. It can quickly identify the top architecture for each\nefficiency constraint. NAS-BERT needs to pretrain the top architecture from scratch for every\nconstraint change, which can be very expensive. SuperShaper [6] pretrains a weight-sharing supernet\nfor BERT using masked language modeling objective with sandwich training. The authors find\nthat SPOS performs poorly compared to the sandwich training objective. AutoDistil [22] employs\nfew-shot NAS [28]: construct K search spaces of non-overlapping BERT architectures and train a\nweight-sharing BERT supernet for each search space. The search is based on self-attention distillation\nloss with BERT-Base (task-agnostic search) and MNLI score (proxy search).\nIn computer vision community, K-shot NAS [17] generates the weight for each subnet as a convex\ncombination of different supernet weights in a dictionary with a simplex code. Their framework is\nsimilar to layer-wise MoS with the following key differences. K-shot NAS trains the architecture\ncode generator and supernet iteratively due to training difficulty, while layer-wise MoS trains all\nits components jointly. K-shot NAS has been applied only in convolutional architectures for image\nclassification tasks. K-shot NAS introduces too many parameters with increase in number of supernets\n(K), which is alleviated by neuron-wise MoS due to its granular weight specialization.\n9\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we proposed Mixture-of-Supernets, a formulation to improve supernet by enhancing\nits expressive power. We showed that the idea of MoE can be adopted to generate flexible weights\nfor subnetworks. From our extensive evaluation for building efficient BERT and MT models, we\nshowed that our supernets can: (i) minimize the retraining time thereby improving the NAS efficiency\nsignificantly and (ii) yield high quality architectures satisfying user-defined constraints via NAS. We\nwill investigate the full potential of MoS by combining larger training budget (e.g., \u2265 200K steps)\nand larger number of expert weights (e.g., \u2265 16 expert weights) in the future.\nReferences\n[1] Gabriel Bender, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, and Quoc Le.

All the supernets are trained with sandwich training.\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nAdditional Experiments - Efficient BERT\nA.1.1\nBERT pretraining / finetuning settings\nPretraining data: The pretraining data consists of text from Wikipedia and Books Corpus [30]. We\nuse the data preprocessing scripts provided by Izsak et al. to construct the tokenized text.\nSupernet and standalone pretraining settings: The pretraining settings for supernet and stan-\ndalone models are taken from SuperShaper [6]: batch size of 2048, maximum sequence length\nof 128, training steps of 125K, learning rate of 5e\u22124, weight decay of 0.01, and warmup steps of\n10K (0 for standalone). For experiments with the search space from SuperShaper [6] (Section 4.2),\nthe architecture encoding a is a list of hidden size at each layer of the architecture (12 elements since\nthe supernet is a 12 layer model). For experiments with the search space on par with AutoDistil [22]\n(Section 4.3), the architecture encoding a is a list of four elastic hyperparameters of the homogeneous\nBERT architecture: number of layers, hidden size of all layers, feedforward network (FFN) expansion\nratio of all layers and number of attention heads of all layers (see Table 7 for sample homogeneous\nBERT architectures).\nFinetuning settings: We evaluate the performance of the BERT model by finetuning on each of the\nseven tasks (chosen by AutoDistil [22]) in the GLUE benchmark [18]. The evaluation metric is the\naverage accuracy (Matthews\u2019s correlation coefficient for CoLA only) on all the tasks (GLUE average).\nThe finetuning settings are taken from the BERT paper [4]: learning rate from {5e\u22125, 3e\u22125, 2e\u22125},\nbatch size from {16, 32}, and epochs from {2, 3, 4}.\nA.1.2\nLearning curve for BERT supernet variants\nFigure 2 shows the training steps versus validation MLM loss (learning curve) for the standalone\nBERT model and different supernet based BERT variants. The standalone model and the supernet\nare compared for the biggest architecture (big) and the smallest architecture (small) from the search\nspace of SuperShaper [6]. For the biggest architecture, the standalone model performs the best. For\nthe smallest architecture, the standalone model is outperformed by all the supernet variants. In both\ncases, the proposed supernets (especially neuron-wise MoS) perform much better than the standard\nsupernet.\n13\nStandalone / Supernet\nModel Size\n#Layers\n#Hidden Size\n#FFN Expansion Ratio\n#Heads\nBERT\n109M\n12\n768\n4\n12\nAutoDistil (proxy)\n6.88M\n7\n160\n3.5\n10\nNeuron-wise MoS\n5M\n12\n120\n2.0\n6\nNeuron-wise MoS\n10M\n12\n180\n3.5\n6\nAutoDistil (agnostic)\n26.8M\n11\n352\n4\n10\nNeuron-wise MoS\n26.8M\n12\n372\n2.5\n6\nNeuron-wise MoS\n30M\n12\n384\n3\n6\nAutoDistil (proxy)\n50.1M\n12\n544\n3\n9\nNeuron-wise MoS\n50M\n12\n504\n3.5\n12\nTable 7: Architecture comparison of the best architecture designed by the neuron-wise MoS with\nAutoDistil [22] and BERT-Base [4].\nDataset\nYear\nSource Lang\nTarget Lang\n#Train\n#Valid\n#Test\nWMT\n2014\nEnglish (en)\nGerman (de)\n4.5M\n3000\n3000\nWMT\n2014\nEnglish (en)\nFrench (fr)\n35M\n26000\n26000\nWMT\n2019\nEnglish (en)\nGerman (de)\n43M\n2900\n2900\nTable 8: Machine translation benchmark data.\nA.1.3\nArchitecture comparison of Neuron-wise MoS vs. AutoDistil\nTable 7 shows the comparison of the BERT architecture designed by our proposed neuron-wise MoS\nwith AutoDistil.\nA.2\nAdditional Experiments - Efficient Machine Translation\nA.2.1\nMachine translation benchmark data\nTable 8 shows the statistics of three machine translation datasets: WMT\u201914 En-De, WMT\u201914 En-Fr,\nand WMT\u201919 En-De.\nA.2.2\nTraining settings and metrics\nThe training settings for both supernet and standalone models are the same: 40K training steps, Adam\noptimizer, a cosine learning rate scheduler, and a warmup of learning rate from 10\u22127 to 10\u22123 with\ncosine annealing. The best checkpoint is selected based on the validation loss, while the performance\nof the MT model is evaluated based on BLEU. The beam size is four with length penalty of 0.6.

Supernet performance is obtained by evaluating the architecture-specific weights extracted\nfrom the supernet. Standalone model performance is obtained by training the architecture from\nscratch to convergence and evaluating it.\nA.2.3\nSupernet vs. Standalone performance plot\nFigure 3 displays the supernet vs. the standalone performance for 15 randomly sampled architectures\non all the three tasks. Neuron-wise MoS excel for almost all the top performing architectures (\u2265 26.5\nand \u2265 42.5 standalone BLEU for WMT\u201914 En-De and WMT\u201919 En-De respectively), which indicates\nthat the models especially in the pareto front can benefit immensely from neuron level specialization.\nA.2.4\nHAT Settings\nEvolutionary search: The settings for the evolutionary search algorithm include: 30 iterations,\npopulation size of 125, parents population of 25, crossover population of 50, and mutation population\nof 50 with 0.3 mutation probability.\nLatency estimator: The latency estimator is developed in two stages. First, the latency dataset\nis constructed by measuring the latency of 2000 randomly sampled architectures directly on the\nuser-defined hardware (NVIDIA V100 GPU). Latency is the time taken to translate a source sentence\nto a target sentence (source and target sentence lengths of 30 tokens each). For each architecture, 300\nlatency measurements are taken, outliers (top 10% and bottom 10%) are removed, and the rest (80%)\nis averaged. Second, the latency estimator is a 3 layer multi-layer neural network based regressor,\nwhich is trained using encoding and latency of the architecture as features and labels respectively.\nA.2.5\nAdditional training steps to close the gap vs. performance\nFigure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6 show the additional training steps vs. BLEU for different latency\nconstraints on the WMT\u201914 En-De task, WMT\u201914 En-Fr and WMT\u201919 En-De tasks respectively.\nA.2.6\nEvolutionary Search - Stability\nWe study the initialization effects on the stability of the pareto front outputted by the evolutionary\nsearch for different supernets.

For 200 ms latency constraint, neuron-\nwise MoS closes the gap without additional training.\nBLEU across seeds are mostly marginal. This result highlights that the pareto front outputted by the\nevolutionary search is largely stable for all the supernet variants.\nA.2.7\nImpact of different router function\nTable 10 displays the impact of varying the number of hidden layers in the router function for\nneuron-wise MoS on the WMT\u201914 En-De task. Two hidden layers provide the right amount of router\ncapacity, while adding more hidden layers results in steady performance drop.\nA.2.8\nImpact of increasing the number of expert weights \u2018m\u2019\nTable 11 displays the impact of increasing the number of expert weights \u2018m\u2019 for the WMT\u201914 En-Fr\ntask, where the architecture for all the supernets is the top architecture from the pareto front of HAT\nfor the latency constraint of 200 ms. Under the standard training budget (40K steps for MT), the\nperformance of layer-wise MoS does not seem to improve by increasing \u2018m\u2019 from 2 to 4. Increasing\n\u2018m\u2019 introduces too many parameters, which might necessitate a significant increase in the training\n16\nSupernet / Pareto Front\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nSeed\nLatency\nBLEU\nLatency\nBLEU\nLatency\nBLEU\nHAT (SPOS)\n1\n96.39\n38.94\n176.44\n39.26\n187.53\n39.16\nHAT (SPOS)\n2\n98.91\n38.96\n159.87\n39.20\n192.11\n39.09\nHAT (SPOS)\n3\n100.15\n38.96\n158.67\n39.24\n189.53\n39.16\nLayer-wise MoS\n1\n99.42\n39.34\n158.68\n40.29\n205.55\n41.24\nLayer-wise MoS\n2\n99.60\n39.32\n156.48\n40.29\n209.80\n41.13\nLayer-wise MoS\n3\n119.65\n39.32\n163.17\n40.36\n208.52\n41.18\nNeuron-wise MoS\n1\n97.63\n39.55\n200.17\n40.02\n184.09\n41.04\nNeuron-wise MoS\n2\n100.46\n39.55\n155.96\n40.04\n188.87\n41.15\nNeuron-wise MoS\n3\n100.47\n39.57\n157.26\n40.04\n190.40\n41.17\nTable 9: Stability of the evolutionary search w.r.t. different seeds on the WMT\u201914 En-Fr task.

    "text": "Improving Open Language Models by Learning from Organic Interactions\nJing Xu, Da Ju, Joshua Lane, Mojtaba Komeili, Eric Michael Smith, Megan Ung,\nMorteza Behrooz, William Ngan, Rashel Moritz, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Y-Lan Boureau,\nJason Weston\u2217, Kurt Shuster\u2217\nMeta AI\nAbstract\nWe present BlenderBot 3x, an update on the\nconversational model BlenderBot 3, which is\nnow trained using organic conversation and\nfeedback data from participating users of the\nsystem in order to improve both its skills and\nsafety. We are publicly releasing the participat-\ning de-identified interaction data for use by the\nresearch community, in order to spur further\nprogress. Training models with organic data is\nchallenging because interactions with people\n\u201cin the wild\u201d include both high quality conver-\nsations and feedback, as well as adversarial and\ntoxic behavior. We study techniques that enable\nlearning from helpful teachers while avoiding\nlearning from people who are trying to trick\nthe model into unhelpful or toxic responses.\nBlenderBot 3x is both preferred in conversation\nto BlenderBot 3, and is shown to produce safer\nresponses in challenging situations. While our\ncurrent models are still far from perfect, we\nbelieve further improvement can be achieved\nby continued use of the techniques explored in\nthis work.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe state of the art in language models is improv-\ning at a rapid rate in recent years (Brown et al.,\n2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022; Ope-\nnAI, 2023). Dialogue applications, where these\nmodels interact with humans, have become an im-\nportant use case (Adiwardana et al., 2020; Roller\net al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Bang et al.,\n2023). While the underlying Transformer architec-\nture is roughly the same for most of these systems\n(Vaswani et al., 2017), the improvements instead\noften come from scale (the number of parameters)\nand also, crucially, the data used to train the model.\nBase language model training focuses on the impor-\ntance of the pre-train data, typically scraped from\nweb sources (Gao et al., 2020). However, evalua-\ntions have shown that fine-tune data, which is of-\n\u2217Equal contribution.\nten more curated, is also of paramount importance\n(Roller et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Thoppilan\net al., 2022). For a downstream application, the\nbest fine-tune data is intuitively from (or close to)\nthe distribution of the actual usage (Shuster et al.,\n2021b; Brundage et al., 2022).\nIn this work, we explore learning to improve\nmodels from interaction with real, organic users \u2013\nboth in terms of the model\u2019s conversational skills,\n(engagingness, knowledge, etc.) and its ability to\nbe well-behaved (safety, toxicity). We make use of\nthe deployment of BlenderBot 3 (Shuster et al.,\n2022), which is a 175B parameter OPT model\n(Zhang et al., 2022) fine-tuned on crowdsourced\ndata that can search the internet for relevant re-\nsults and store conversations in its long-term mem-\nory. The participating de-identified interaction data\nfrom the deployment totals over 353,000 conversa-\ntions, with more than 6.2M utterances. The data\nfollows the distribution that users prompt the model\nwith, and hence care about. In addition, more\nthan 155,000 instances of feedback were provided,\nwhere users flagged messages as good or bad, and\nwhy \u2013 for example, whether they are nonsensical,\noff-topic or inappropriate.\nWe provide a detailed analysis of the collected\ndata in \u00a73, employing crowdworkers to evaluate the\nquality of both human and model messages from\nthe organically collected conversations. Around\n70% of participants1 conducted a wide range of re-\nciprocal conversations (which we refer to as \u201cstan-\ndard conversations\u201d), while the other 30% of con-\nversationalists conducted either adversarial conver-\nsations or sent toxic messages (termed \u201cadversarial\nconversations\u201d). Standard human conversational-\nists produce high quality messages 75% of the time,\nwhile model utterances in these conversations are\nevaluated as high quality 85% of the time. In adver-\nsarial conversations, where people may try to en-\ngage in toxic interactions with the chat agent, users\n1Using a classifier to label conversations.\narXiv:2306.04707v1  [cs.CL]  7 Jun 2023\nproduce high quality messages only 45% of the\ntime. The model performs significantly better, but\nstill shows room for improvement, being evaluated\nas high quality 77% of the time. In standard conver-\nsations, we find the original BlenderBot 3 model\nproduces inappropriate responses only 0.6% of the\ntime, but in adversarial conversations, as much as\n2.4% of the time. While participants clearly have\nengaged in very different kinds of conversations,\nboth standard and adversarial interactions can be\nvery useful for learning improved models. For ex-\nample, we would like our models to behave well in\nadversarial situations, as well as being engaging in\nthe standard conversation case.\nUsing the crowdworker annotations described in\n\u00a73 in addition to organic feedback we build a re-\nward model for annotating either human or model\nutterances in \u00a74, including investigating how to\navoid noisy or adversarial inputs from the organic\nfeedback. We then compare a number of different\napproaches to learning from feedback in \u00a75. In\nparticular, we find the recently introduced Cringe\nLoss (Adolphs et al., 2022) utilized in conjunction\nwith the reward model can be used to train the sys-\ntem by encouraging it to generate good responses,\nwhile decreasing the probability of generating bad\nones (either incorrect, nonsensical or off-topic re-\nsponses, as well as issues regarding safety such\nas inappropriate behavior). We study improving\nsafety issues in detail in \u00a76.\nOur best new model trained on the interaction\ndata, called BlenderBot 3x, is compared to the\noriginal BlenderBot 3 in \u00a77. Our new model out-\nperforms its predecessor with 94.4% of Blender-\nBot 3x\u2019s responses evaluated as good, compared to\n85.3% for BlenderBot 3. Overall, BlenderBot 3x is\nshown to produce both better responses on average\nand safer responses than BlenderBot 3 in challeng-\ning situations. In an effort to drive conversational\nAI forward in an open and transparent way, we are\nreleasing the participating de-identified organic in-\nteraction data for use by the wider AI community,\nso that others can build on this work, see \u00a78.\n2\nRelated Work\nOpen dialogue and language models\nOpen-\ndomain dialogue has a rich history, see the review\npapers of Chen et al. (2017); Gao et al. (2019); Ni\net al. (2021). Recently, the area has made signif-\nicant progress by pre-training (and subsequently,\nfine-tuning) ever-larger neural models, spurred by\nTransformer architectures and training techniques\n(Vaswani et al., 2017). For example, the ConvAI2\ncompetition at NeurIPS 2018 featured large (at the\ntime) pre-trained Transformers being used by the\ntop two winning teams (Wolf et al., 2019; Golo-\nvanov et al., 2020; Dinan et al., 2020b). In 2019,\nthe 762M parameter DialoGPT model was released\n(Zhang et al., 2020) based on GPT2 (Radford et al.,\n2019), and trained on 147M conversation-like ex-\nchanges extracted from Reddit comment chains.\nIn 2020 the 3B parameter Meena model was pub-\nlished (Adiwardana et al., 2020) (but not released)\nand the 9B parameter BlenderBot model was re-\nleased (Roller et al., 2021). In 2022, the 137B\nparameter LaMDA model was published (Thoppi-\nlan et al., 2022), but also not released, while the\n175B parameter BlenderBot 3 was released (Shus-\nter et al., 2022). While some of these models are\nopenly available to allow the community to con-\nduct reproducible research, such as DialoGPT and\nBlenderBot, others such as Meena and LaMDA,\ndid not release either the models or the datasets\nthey were trained on, and hence cannot be easily\ncompared to or built upon. Similarly proprietary\nmodels (Zhou et al., 2020) or data (Ram et al.,\n2018) from several products have also not been\nopenly released.\nWhile the first of such recent neural models such\nas DialoGPT and Meena were trained on large cor-\npora such as Reddit, several approaches have also\nshown that not only is pre-training a large model\nwith language modeling or conversational data im-\nportant, but appropriate fine-tuning of those models\nalso brings significant further gains (Roller et al.,\n2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022;\nBai et al., 2022a). A number of fine-tuning datasets\nare crowdsourced and publicly released for use\nby the research community (Serban et al., 2015;\nHuang et al., 2020), such as the ones we will use\nin this work. Other works have shown significant\ngains from fine-tuning language models such as\nGPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) to follow instructions as\nin InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), or dialogue\nas in ChatGPT (Bang et al., 2023) but again those\ndatasets (and model weights) are not released. For\nChatGPT in particular there is also no publication\ndetailing how the method works.\nMany of these recent models use Transformer\nmodels to map from dialogue context to output,\nwithout any access to knowledge from the outside\nworld beyond their original training data, which\ncan become out-of-date and produce factual er-\nrors (termed hallucinations) (Shuster et al., 2021a).\nBlenderBot 2 (Chen et al., 2021) extended its pre-\ndecessor by allowing the bot to ground its conversa-\ntion on retrieval from the internet for open-domain\ndialogue tasks (Komeili et al., 2022), where the\ntasks were also publicly released. Since then, We-\nbGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) also applies internet\nsearch to QA (but not dialogue) tasks, as does the\nwork of Lazaridou et al. (2022), while LaMDA uses\ninformation retrieval for general dialogue. Blender-\nBot 3 (Shuster et al., 2022) extended its prede-\ncessor in this regard, with further fine-tune data\ncovering more internet-based skills that were also\npublicly released. BlenderBot 2 and 3 also contain\na long-term memory storage mechanism (Xu et al.,\n2022a).\nLearning from interaction and feedback\nFine-\ntune data collected via crowdworkers or expert an-\nnotators (Serban et al., 2015; Huynh et al., 2021)\nmay not reflect the distribution of real organic users\nin actual deployment, who may choose different\nconversational topics (Shuster et al., 2021b). Simi-\nlarly, the safety of such systems may not be robust\nif trained only on crowdworker data due to distri-\nbution shifts with real users that must be accounted\nfor (Brundage et al., 2022). For these reasons, it\nis difficult to have a substitute for training a real\nsystem optimally other than deploying the system\nitself in order to learn about how people will use\nit. This is a technique that has long been used in\nproducts, for example web search (Xue et al., 2004)\nthat can be potentially applied to language models\nas well.\nDeploying a language model or dialogue system\npublicly, one can collect interaction data and feed-\nback from organic users directly. The promise of\nsuch an approach is that the input distribution of\ndata will more closely match those organic users\u2019\ndesires, rather than decided by the researchers\nthemselves when creating datasets (Gabriel et al.,\n2020; Roller et al., 2020; Shuster et al., 2021b;\nOuyang et al., 2022). Moreover, interaction and\nfeedback given the model\u2019s responses provides in-\nformation on what the model is doing well, and\nwhat it is failing at \u2013 in order to potentially re-\ntrain and improve the system. Continued deploy-\nment of such a system, with appropriate learning\ntechniques, could then potentially keep improving\nover time (Carlson et al., 2010; Kiela et al., 2021;\nAgichtein et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2021; Madotto\net al., 2021; Shuster et al., 2021b), where Hancock\net al. (2019) refer to this approach as a self-feeding\nchatbot. Organic users, rather than paid annotators,\nhowever present different challenges. While they\nmay be more invested \u2013 as they are organically us-\ning the system rather than being paid to do so \u2013 they\nmay not be invested enough to want to provide use-\nful feedback. Further, a number of users will pro-\nvide adversarial or toxic content (Park et al., 2021;\nDavis, 2016) that must be detected and handled.\nParticularly when learning from such data, care\nmust be taken to not learn to imitate poor behavior\nfrom such users. The BlenderBot 3 deployment\n(Shuster et al., 2022), which we use in this work,\nhas such issues in the collected data which must be\nsurmounted, as discussed in \u00a73.\nAlgorithmically, there are a number of methods\nto learn from organic user interaction data. Firstly,\nif conversations between speakers are often sym-\nmetric and balanced, the human side of the conver-\nsation can directly be used as a target for the model\nto mimic, which can be trained with a standard\nlanguage modeling objective. This was shown to\ngive large improvements in the deployed LIGHT\nsystem (Shuster et al., 2021b). This approach is not\napplicable if the conversations are asymmetric, for\nexample in the case of humans issuing instructions\nto the model (whereas the humans do not want the\nbot to issue instructions to them).\nIn the asymmetric situation, learning from hu-\nman feedback is an area of research attracting grow-\ning interest, either using reinforcement learning or\notherwise. See Fernandes et al. (2023) for a recent\nreview. In the self-feeding chatbot (Hancock et al.,\n2019) a reward model is trained (positive or nega-\ntive) based on user textual responses, which is used\nto label data that is then re-trained on. InstructGPT\n(Ouyang et al., 2022) makes use of either human\n(expert) labeling of organic user\u2019s inputs and model\nresponses, or training a reward model (trained with\nexpert annotated training data). In either case the\ndata can be fed back into the model, in the latter\ncase using reinforcement learning. Rather than a bi-\nnary reward model (good or bad), such methods can\nalso consider stack ranking sets of model responses,\nor ranking just pairs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,\n2022a). Recently, some methods have been pro-\nposed to train language models from both positive\nand negative examples that do not require reinforce-\nment learning \u2013 or at least can be seen as simple\nforms of reinforcement learning. Quark (Lu et al.,\nFigure 1: Screenshots of users giving feedback in the BlenderBot 3 deployment, as viewed on mobile. Left to\nright: thumb up, thumb down, multiple choice feedback after thumb down signal, free-form feedback and continued\nrecovery response from the bot. In this work we study the use of organic interaction and feedback data collected\nfrom this deployment to train improved models, both in terms of generating more constructive and helpful responses,\nas well as safer and more responsible ones. We use the thumbs up/down feedback and multiple-choice feedback, but\nnot the free-form feedback in this paper, although the work of Shi et al. (2022) does explore that setting.\n2022) uses controllable generation to encourage the\nlanguage model to generate sequences with high re-\nward. The Director model (Arora et al., 2022) mod-\nifies the Transformer architecture to have both lan-\nguage modeling and classification heads for each\ntoken used to guide the model at inference time\n\u2013 which can be trained with the reward model or\nhuman labels. The Cringe Loss (Adolphs et al.,\n2022), which we use in this work, does not modify\nthe architecture but instead adds a new loss function\nwhich contrasts negative tokens with other top-k\ntokens from the model to discourage generation of\nthe negative examples.\nOutside of the dialogue domain, there is also a\nrich body of work studying the improvement of\nmodels using interaction from their deployment, in-\ncluding never-ending-learning from language data\n(Carlson et al., 2010), the Dynabench system which\nevaluates a number of NLP tasks (Kiela et al.,\n2021), or learning from feedback to improve sum-\nmarization (Saunders et al., 2022).\n3\nDeployment Data Analysis\nWe first analyze the data collected from the Blender-\nBot 3 deployment. Organic users conducted con-\nversations with BlenderBot 3 at a publicly available\nwebsite (https://blenderbot.ai). During\nthese interactions, users also had the option to give\nfeedback indicating liking or disliking messages\n(thumbs up or down). In the thumbs down case the\nreason can be specified, see Figure 1 for screen-\nshots.\nConversations were between the bot and adults\nin the United States who have agreed to the terms\nand conditions, see Shuster et al. (2022). In partic-\nular the terms communicate and allow the release\nof selected human-bot interactions for research\npurposes. This is an essential component, allow-\ning this work to contribute to a joint, accessible\nand reproducible effort by the research community.\nUsers agreed not to include any personal informa-\ntion in their conversations, and in addition steps\nwere taken to scrub them of identifiable informa-\ntion before crowdworker annotation, data training\nor release. In this section we analyze the data we\nmake publicly available, in particular we study the\ndata collected between 2022-08-05 (at launch) and\n2022-11-17. The actual data we release includes\ndata from after these dates as well, but this is the\nfrozen subset used in the experiments in this paper.\n3.1\nOverall Conversation Statistics\nSummary statistics of the deployment data subset\nwe analyze are provided in Table 1. This subset\nconsists of over 5.2M utterances in 227k conversa-\ntions. Feedback (thumbs up/down) is provided by\n31% of users, and 19% of all conversations contain\nat least one thumbs up/down reaction.

The major-\nity of thumbs down reactions, as measured by the\nprovided reasons, are for nonsensical (1.04%) or\noff topic (0.85%) responses, with smaller amounts\nfor inappropriate responses (0.1%) or other reasons\n(0.2%).\n3.2\nStandard vs. Adversarial Conversations\nWe find organic users conduct reciprocal conver-\nsations on a wide range of topics, but as in other\ndeployed conversational agents (Park et al., 2021),\nthey range from human-like conversations, to ad-\nversarial (e.g., testing the capabilities of the model)\nto toxic (e.g., humans routinely sending offensive\nmessages). To try to quantify this behavior, we split\nthe conversations into two groups, standard and ad-\nversarial, depending on the number of flagged mes-\nsages across the conversation using the deployed\nsafety classifier. While this is a relatively arbitrary\nsplit and will not separate these groups exactly, this\nallows us to examine if there are substantial dif-\nferences in other conversational statistics between\ngroups. In Table 1 we provide statistics where\nconversations are deemed adversarial if more than\n5% of their messages are flagged; we show similar\nstatistics for other split thresholds in Table 11. In\nthe 5% split case this results in \u223c167k standard con-\nversations (\u223c1.7M human utterances), and \u223c60k\nadversarial ones (\u223c700k human utterances). A\nclear difference in statistics between the two groups\nis that adversarial users tend to provide thumbs up\nreactions much less often (2.6% vs. 1.5%) and\nthumbs down less often as well, although not to as\nlarge a degree. In the following subsections where\nwe evaluate conversation and feedback quality we\nwill assess statistics both for the entire dataset, and\nfor the standard and adversarial groups as well,\nwhere we will find other substantial differences.\n3.3\nConversation Quality\nWe evaluate quality in the organic conversations\ncollected from deployment at the utterance level for\nboth human and model (bot) utterances, as judged\nby independent human evaluators. To do this, we\nemploy crowdworkers to judge if an utterance is\ngood or bad, and if deemed bad to provide the\nreason \u2013 similar to the organic conversational feed-\nback mechanisms. We employ 3 crowdworkers\nper example, and report the majority vote. An on-\nboarding task and other mechanisms were used to\nprovide quality annotations. A screenshot of the\ncrowdworker instructions and UI is provided in\nFigure 3.\nThe results are given in Table 2. We find that,\naveraged over all conversations analyzed (as mea-\nsured on \u223c13k individual utterances by crowdwork-\ners) human messages are deemed good 66.3% of\nthe time, while bot messages are deemed good\n83.1% of the time. This might be surprising that hu-\nman performance is so low, and in fact much lower\nthan model performance. Splitting into standard\nand adversarial groups, we see a much clearer pic-\nture. Humans are deemed good 75.4% of the time\nin standard conversations, but only 45.5% of the\ntime in adversarial conversations. Hence a group\nof human conversationalists are bringing the av-\nerage down substantially. While bot performance\nis lower (77.2%) in adversarial conversations than\nstandard ones (85.5%) this is still relatively robust,\ncompared to human variability between groups.\nThe breakdown of reasons for low quality re-\nsponses is also revealing. Low human quality is\njudged to often be due to inappropriate responses\n(10.3% overall), or ignoring the last turn of the bot\n(10.7%), although there are other issues as well. In-\nappropriate responses from humans are very high\nin adversarial conversations (23.0%) and lower in\nstandard ones (4.8%). In contrast, the bot is much\nsafer (0.59% in standard conversations, and 2.2%\nin adversarial ones), but certainly not perfect. Still,\nit appears that the majority of unsafe bot messages\ncome from adversarial users either goading the bot\nor engaging in toxic behavior themselves, prompt-\ning the bot to be more likely to as well. In contrast\nto humans, the main issues with the bot are in terms\nof making sense (nonsensical 6.0% of the time, ig-\nnoring the last turn 6.4% of the time, or being off\ntopic 2.1% of the time). All the bot mistake types\nare more common in adversarial conversations (not\njust inappropriate responses), highlighting the chal-\nlenging nature of these conversations.\n3.4\nOrganic Human Feedback Quality\nNext, we assess the quality of the feedback pro-\nvided by organic users. To do this, we use the\nsame crowdworker task as before, but particuarly\nask the workers to label responses for which we\nalready know a given organic feedback annotation\nis available, thus we can collect a large number of\nfeedback comparison annotations.\nThe results are provided in Table 3. We observe\nthat organically liked messages are rated \u201cgood\u201d\nby crowdworkers more often than other messages,\nClassifier Type\nTrain Data\nReward Accuracy\nSafety Accuracy\nRoberta-based Transformer\nOrganic feedback\n80.7%\n79.4%\n(Dinan et al., 2019)\nOrganic denoised\n82.0%\n79.7%\nAnnotated\n88.8%\n90.4%\nAnnotated + Organic denoised\n89.2%\n87.6%\nAnnotated + Organic + Safety\n87.5%\n98.2%\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020)\nAnnotated + Organic + Safety\n87.8%\n98.9%\nTable 4: Reward Model Accuracy. We report the test accuracy (examples labeled by 3 annotators, who all have to\nagree) of labeling a deployment data dialogue turn as good or bad for various trained reward models (classifiers).\nWe also report the accuracy on safe vs. unsafe turns, measuring whether they are labeled correctly or not.\neither ones with no feedback, or ones with dislike\nfeedback, as one would expect. Similarly, organi-\ncally disliked messages are rated \u201cgood\u201d much less\noften, although there are different disagreement\nrates depending on the dislike reason. Off topic\nmessages have the most agreement, followed by\ninappropriate and nonsensical, with the \u201cother\u201d cat-\negory having high disagreement rates. Ultimately\nall dislike categories have relatively high disagree-\nment rates, indicating the difficulty in human as-\nsessment of conversational responses (Smith et al.,\n2022b). Analyzing the difference between stan-\ndard and adversarial conversations, we do not see\nas large disagreements between the two categories\nin terms of feedback as we did when evaluating\nconversational response quality. This may indicate\nthat even while conversation may be adversarial or\ntoxic in the adversarial category, still much of the\nfeedback provided is genuine, and not adversarial.\nStill, liked responses in the adversarial category are\nless likely to be rated as good by crowdworkers,\nand responses marked inappropriate by adversarial\norganic conversationalists are also less likely to be\nrated bad by crowdworkers than feedback from the\nstandard category.\n4\nReward Model\n4.1\nTraining\nGiven human annotations of utterances, as de-\nscribed in the previous section, we can train a clas-\nsifier to predict for a new utterance how humans\nwould annotate it, which we refer to as our reward\nmodel. We train this model as a binary classifier of\nwhether humans deemed the response good or bad.\nWe consider several kinds of training data.\nOrganic Feedback\nWe use the 94,428 thumbs\nup and thumbs down reactions on bot messages\nprovided by organic users in the 2022-08-05 to\n2022-11-17 data split (\u00a73.2). We partition into\ntrain, valid and test in a 84%, 8%, 8% ratio.\nOrganic Feedback Denoised\nAs studied in Ju\net al. (2022) organic conversations may contain\nnoisy or even adversarial feedback designed to trick\nmodels. We use one of the methods developed in\nthat work, user-based denoising. Cross-validation\nis performed over the data, and for each training\nexample we measure if predictions from the model\nagree with the organic label. User feedback is re-\nmoved from training if the fraction of the given\nuser\u2019s annotations disagreeing with the model is\ngreater than a chosen threshold, under the assump-\ntion that this user is providing data that is too noisy\nor adversarial.\nCrowdworker Annotations\nWe use the 22,928\nthumbs up and thumbs down annotations provided\nby crowdworkers on both human and bot messages\nfrom \u00a73.3. We again partition into train, valid and\ntest in a 84%, 8%, 8% ratio.\nSafety Datasets\nWe also consider adding exist-\ning safety datasets (binary classification of safe\nor not safe), especially because safety violations\nare relatively rare compared to other types of low\nquality response (see Table 1 and Table 2). We use\nthe WikiToxic dataset (Wulczyn et al., 2017), BBFI\nStandard and Adversarial (Dinan et al., 2019), BAD\n(Xu et al., 2021) and harmless & red team data (Bai\net al., 2022a).\nWe use all these datasets together to fine-tune a\nstandard pre-trained Transformer. We consider the\nRoberta-based Transformer of Dinan et al. (2019)\n(400M parameters) as well as T5-XL (3B parame-\nters) (Raffel et al., 2020) as possible base models.\n4.2\nEvaluation\nResults are given in Table 4. We find that organic\nfeedback alone already provides reasonable accu-\nracy as a reward model (80.7%), which can be\nimproved to 82% with denoising to handle noisy\nor adversarial feedback. Our full annotated dataset\nfrom crowdworkers however gives superior perfor-\nmance (88.8%), while combining the two datasets\n(crowdworker annotated + organic denoised) gives\nthe best performance of 89.2%. We provide learn-\ning curves combining various amounts of annotated\ndata to organic data in Table 14. We also report the\naccuracy on safe vs. unsafe turns using the BBFI\nStandard test set. While the reward model already\nprovides a degree of safety (80-90% accuracy, de-\npending on the model), multi-tasking with safety\ndatasets can increase this to over 98%. The T5\nmodel provides slightly better performance than\nthe Roberta-based Transformer, but as it is a larger\nmodel and hence slower to provide predictions, go-\ning forward we opt for the Roberta based model,\nas we did not consider the performance differences\nto be very large.\n5\nLearning from Human Feedback\n5.1\nMethods\nFeedback signals\nAfter collecting human feed-\nback, either organic or annotated by crowdwork-\ners, we can use this data to try to improve our\ndialogue model. In the previous section this data\nwas used to train a reward model, which can also\nbe used instead of using the data itself directly.\nThe reward model can be used to extend the other-\nwise sparse training data annotations to label every\ntraining example, as well as potentially smooth-\ning out/denoising existing annotations on the al-\nready labeled set (although this might also have\nthe adverse effect and make some labels incorrect).\nFurther, one can also generate from an improved\nmodel again, and use the reward model to label\nthose generations as well, in an iterative fashion.\nCringe Loss\nGiven generations labeled as pos-\nitive (thumbs up / \u201cgood\u201d), one can simply add\nthese to the training set, and multi-task train with\nthe original dataset, choosing an appropriate mix-\ning weight. Given negative (thumbs down / \u201cbad\u201d)\ngenerations we apply the recently proposed Cringe\nloss (Adolphs et al., 2022). The Cringe loss works\nby penalizing the output sequence of negative ex-\namples given a context. For each negative output\ntoken, a positive token prediction is sampled from\nthe language model to contrast against it with a con-\ntrastive loss, see Figure 2. This method was shown\nFigure 2: The Cringe loss (Adolphs et al., 2022) works\nby penalizing the output sequence of negative exam-\nples (shown in red). For each negative output token, a\npositive token prediction is sampled from the language\nmodel to contrast against it. Negative sequences either\ncome from (i) human annotations, or (ii) access to a\nreward model that can be used to iteratively label the\nmodel\u2019s own generations and apply the Cringe loss to\nthose examples as well. Positive sequences are trained\nwith the usual language modeling objective.\nto outperform a number of other alternative algo-\nrithms across a set of tasks (safe generation, con-\ntradiction avoidance, and open-domain dialogue)\nin Adolphs et al. (2022).\nTraining\nWe multi-task train over a number of\ntasks, which we ablate, as described in the next sec-\ntion. In each case we train for 1 epoch, and then run\nevaluations. We attempt to optimize the multi-task\nweights and Cringe loss weight (i.e., choose the\nbest hyperparameters) where possible (but compu-\ntational constraints prevent an exhaustive search).\n5.1.1\nApproaches Compared\nWe conduct a series of experiments using the 3B pa-\nrameter BlenderBot 3 model, choosing this smaller\nsize model in order to efficiently compare a num-\nber of techniques. Full model experiments will be\ndescribed in \u00a77.\nHere, we compare the following set of ap-\nproaches:\nBB3 3B baseline\nThe BB3 method described in\nShuster et al. (2022).\n+public dialogue datasets\nWe also consider\nadding several other existing publicly available\ndatasets not present in the original BB3 training,\nin particular FITS (Xu et al., 2022b) negative data,\nhh-rlhf helpful data (Bai et al., 2022a), ImageChat\n(Shuster et al., 2020) and DECODE (Nie et al.,\nModel\nLoss\nReward Model % (\u2191)\nBot Gold F1 (\u2191)\nBB3 3B baseline\nStandard\n83.3%\n16.52\n+ public dialogue datasets\nCringe\n82.9%\n16.29\n+ all deployment human turns\nStandard\n79.0%\n15.27\n+ all deployment bot turns\nStandard\n84.2%\n16.63\n+ bot thumbs up/down from organic users\nCringe\n85.1%\n15.22\n+ bot thumbs up/down from organic-trained reward model\nCringe\n89.5%\n16.78\n+ bot thumbs up only from reward model\nStandard\n90.3%\n16.64\n+ bot thumbs up/down from reward model\nCringe\n90.4%\n17.48\n+ bot thumbs up/down from reward model; 2 iterations\nCringe\n94.5%\n17.76\nTable 5: Learning from human feedback: 3B parameter model ablations. Rows 3-9 are various ways of using the\ndeployment data for training, either the human or bot turns, or both, and use of the organic feedback, or feedback\npredicted by the trained reward model (see \u00a74). For utterances labeled as bad (thumbs down), we use the Cringe\nLoss for training; for other utterances we use the standard language modeling loss.\n2021). These all can use the Cringe loss as they\nprovide positive and negative examples2.\n+deployment turns\nWe start from the +public\ndialogue datasets data, and also multi-task train\nwith the deployment data described in \u00a73. We con-\nsider the bot turn and human turns as two separate\ndatasets, and compare adding them to training.\n+ bot thumbs up/down models\nSimply adding\nthe deployment data as in the previous method we\nexpect is unlikely to work because this does not\ndifferentiate high quality turns in the deployment\ndata from low quality turns. We thus consider ap-\nplying the Cringe loss to both positive and negative\nexamples, using the reward model to label the ex-\namples. We consider two types of reward model:\none trained from Organic feedback only, and the\nAnnotated + Organic + Safety model (our default\nreward model, if not specified), see \u00a74. We also\nconsider two more ablations: (i) only consider the\nthumbs up reward model data during training, and\ndo not use thumbs down with Cringe loss; and (ii)\nonly directly use the organic feedback data as posi-\ntive and negative examples for Cringe loss, without\nextending the labels using a reward model.\n+ bot thumbs up/down from reward model;\n2 iterations\nFinally, after training with thumbs\nup/down from the reward model, we apply a sec-\nond iteration following the positive experimental\nresults in Adolphs et al. (2022). We generate from\nthe first iteration model, classify those examples\nwith the reward model, and add them as further\ntraining examples (either positive or negative).\n2For ImageChat, we use the given positive and negative\nconversation styles.\n5.1.2\nMetrics\nWe measure performance with two automatic met-\nrics: using the reward model itself to score re-\nsponses, given validation set prompts, and the F1\noverlap with gold responses for the bot turns. For\nthe latter, we collected expert annotations on a sub-\nsample of data provided by members of the re-\nsearch lab. In experiments we found these two\nmetrics to be generally correlated, see Figure 4.\nWe note that in our full model experiments in \u00a77\nwe will employ human evaluations rather than the\nautomatic metrics used in these initial experiments.\n5.2\nExperimental Results\nResults are given in Table 5. We describe the find-\nings below.\nCringe Loss on non-deployment data distribu-\ntions does not help\nFirst, we find that using the\ndescribed publicly available dialogue datasets with\nthe Cringe loss does not bring any gains in the two\nautomatic metrics measured on the deploy valida-\ntion set, compared to the BB3 3B baseline. We\nhypothesize this is because this data is too far out\nof distribution.\nSimply adding all the deployment data to train-\ning does not help\nSecond, simply adding all the\ndeployment data turns (either human or bot) using\na standard language modeling loss also does not\nbring substantial gains, likely because both high\nquality turns and low quality turns are added to\nthe training data. The bot turns do give very small\nimprovements, while the human data reduces per-\nformance. Our evaluations are on bot turns, which\nmight explain why human data might hurt perfor-\nmance; further it is known that there exist a large\nnumber of low quality and even toxic human turns,\nsee \u00a73.\nCringe loss with the reward model on deploy-\nment data helps\nWe find using the bot thumbs\nup/down from the reward model gives substantial\ngains in both metrics, e.g. from 83.3% to 90.4%\nfor the reward model metric, and 16.52 to 17.48 in\nBot Gold F1. Hence, encouraging previous good\nresponses from the model, and similarly discour-\naging earlier poor responses, can be an effective\nway of improving performance. We also see gains\nfrom using an organic-trained reward model as well\nalthough the gains are not as large as with the An-\nnotated+organic+safety reward model. Similarly,\nusing only the positive data, but not the negative\ndata, from the reward model helps, but not as much.\nOnly using organic feedback data without a reward\nmodel does not bring significant gains, indicating\nthe importance of extending and/or denoising the\ndata. Finally, our best results are obtained by two it-\nerations of Cringe loss using the reward model (last\nrow), yielding a reward model metric of 90.4%, and\na Bot Gold F1 of 17.76. This indicates the impor-\ntance of adapting the rewards dependent on the\ndistribution of generations from the model itself.\n6\nSafety\n6.1\nUpdated Safety Classifier\nThe BlenderBot 3 deployment uses a safety clas-\nsifier on top of the generative model, as a second\nline of defense, and switches to a canned response\nif the response from the generative model is judged\nto be unsafe, see Shuster et al. (2022) for details.\nUsing the annotated deployment data, it is possible\nto update this safety classifier to take into account\nthe safety issues that were occurring in natural con-\nversations. Results are given in Table 6. In offline\nmetrics, we find we can obtain a large improvement\nin accuracy on the deployment data in this fashion,\neven though safety on standard public datasets re-\nmains unaffected. This highlights how it is essen-\ntial to have data from the same distribution as the\ndownstream task, and that organic users can have\nvery different distributions to crowdworkers, which\nmany existing datasets used to collect annotations.\n6.2\nSafe Generation Model\n6.2.1\nMethods\nIn the ideal case, the dialogue response generation\nmodel itself is already safe, and hence a safety\nSafety Classifier\nTask\nBB3\nBB3x\nBB3 deployment data\n51.42\n98.44\nBAD (Xu et al., 2021)\n80.48\n80.49\nWikiToxic (Wulczyn et al., 2017)\n83.96\n84.36\nBBFI Adversarial (Dinan et al., 2019)\n86.21\n78.71\nBBFI Standard (Dinan et al., 2019)\n93.64\n93.84\nTable 6: Safety classifier results, reporting the Class Not\nOk F1 metric, following (Xu et al., 2020).

We note that\nthe BBFI Standard, BBFI Adversarial and BAD are all\ncollected from crowdworkers while WikiToxic is in the\ndomain of Wiki pages, hence all the other datasets have\na quite different distribution to the BB3 deployment\ndata, which can explain the difference in performance.\nNote: the BB3 safety classifier was used during deploy-\nment, hence any safety failures in the deployment data\nare already examples where it failed.\nclassifier on top would not need to intervene with\ncanned messages.\nWe thus explore several ap-\nproaches to making the generation model we train\nsafe.\nSafety negative\nWe identify bot utterances that\nare unsafe from the deployment data, and add them\nto the training set as negative examples using the\nCringe loss, following (Adolphs et al., 2022). In\nour experiments we use the safety classifier de-\nveloped in the previous section to identify these\nexamples.\nBaked-in single safe message positive\nAfter\nidentifying unsafe examples, instead of the adding\nthem as negative examples one can use the baked-\nin safety approach of Xu et al. (2020). In this ap-\nproach, a new training example is constructed with\nthe dialogue context of the unsafe message, and the\nunsafe message is replaced by a safe one. In these\nexperiments we use a canned safe response such\nas \u201cThis seems to be a sensitive subject. Can we\ntalk about something else?\u201d. This new (unsafe con-\ntext, canned message) pair is added to the training\nset as a positive example, and standard language\nmodeling training is used. In this way producing\nsafe canned responses is \u201cbaked\u201d into the language\nmodel.\nBaked-in variable safe message positive\nHav-\ning only a single canned target message can be\nDeploy\nSafety Accuracy\nReward\nBot\nAdversarial Level\nModel\nModel %\nGold F1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nBB3 3B baseline\n83.3%\n16.52\n98.2%\n90.0%\n79.6%\n64.2%\nBB3 3B thumbs up/down from reward model\n90.4%\n17.48\n97.8%\n90.2%\n79.6%\n59.8%\n+ safety negative\n71.3%\n12.27\n98.0%\n90.4%\n79.4%\n64.8%\n+ baked-in single safe message positive\n39.7%\n13.82\n100%\n100%\n99.6%\n99.4%\n+ baked-in variable safe message positive\n87.7%\n15.59\n100%\n100%\n99.6%\n99.4%\n+ baked-in variable safety pos/neg\n90.4%\n17.18\n100%\n99.8%\n99.6%\n99.6%\n+ baked-in variable safety pos/neg + safety negative\n88.8%\n17.35\n100%\n100%\n99.8%\n99.8%\nTable 7: 3B parameter safety evaluations for different models under different conversational conditions: safe\nconversations (level 0), and increasingly adversarial conversations (levels 1-3) by selecting deployment data\nconversations/turns with varying levels of safety violations. Note that in practice in deployment we use an additional\nsafety classifier on top of the generative model, in order to try to catch additional issues that they miss. We find that\nbaked-in variable safety pos/neg approach provides much safer responses without unduly sacrificing conversational\nskills (as measured by the reward model and deploy Bot Gold F1).\ndifficult for a model to learn from as the target is\ntoo frequent in the training set, and it is perhaps not\neasily associated with the input context. This can\nthen have the effect of being overproduced by the\nmodel at test time, even in cases where the context\nis safe. Instead, one can try to make the baked-in\ntarget messages vary \u2013 and be more related to the\ncontext. We do this by, for each unsafe example,\nextracting an entity3 from the last dialogue turn.\nWe then construct a canned response using that\nentity inside a template, and also construct multi-\nple templates for further variability, e.g. \u201cTalking\nabout <entity> in this context seems to be a sensi-\ntive subject. Can we talk about something else?\u201d.\nThe intent is that helps the model to connect certain\ntopics with their relative safety during training.\nBaked-in variable safety pos/neg\nUnfortunately,\nthe model may still suffer from overgenerating safe\nresponses with the previous variable message ap-\nproach. To help counteract this, we can encourage\nthe model to not generate the canned response in\nsafe conversations. To do this we add (safe context,\ncanned message) negative training examples to the\ntraining set, and use the Cringe loss to discour-\nage their generation. Thus we train with (unsafe\ncontext, canned message) positive examples and\n(safe context, canned message) negative examples\nsimultaneously.\nBaked-in variable safety pos/neg + safety neg-\native\nFinally, we can use the Baked-in variable\nsafety pos/neg approach just described in addition\nto the Safety negative described earlier, by training\n3Found with the nltk library (Bird et al., 2009).\non both sets of targets at the same time. This can\nhelp produce safe responses when appropriate, and\nalso discourages the set of known unsafe responses.\n6.2.2\nExperimental Results\nWe compare these various algorithms by training\n3B parameter BB3 model variants, where each\nmethod ends up as adding an additional differing\nset of positive and negative training data. We still\ntrain with the same original BB3 training sets and\napply the Cringe loss from the reward model on\nthe deployment data, as this was the best approach\npreviously. We compare these different safety ap-\nproaches to the original BB3 3B baseline, and to\nthe BB3 3B thumbs up/down from reward model\nmethod from \u00a75.\nAfter training, we generate from these various\nmodels, and report the automatic evaluations of\ntheir generation quality as before using both the\nreward model, and the F1 overlap with the gold an-\nnotations from experts. We then report the safety on\ndeployment data of these various models by again\ngenerating from the models, and using the safety\nclassifier from \u00a76.1 to identify unsafe generations.\nIn these experiments we stratify the deployment\ndata into four types: from standard (level 0) to\nvarying levels of adversarial conversation (levels\n1-3)4.\nResults are given in Table 7. The results show\n4These are identified by level 0 having no safety violations\nusing the original deployment safety classifier across the entire\nconversation, while level 1 and 2 have at least 1% violations,\nand level 3 has at least 5%. Additionally, level 0 and 1 contexts\nare from BB3 generations that were originally marked as\nthumbs up by the reward model, while level 2 and 3 are thumbs\ndown.\nthat our best baked-in approaches have a large\nsafety accuracy gain over both the BB3 3B base-\nline and the BB3 3B model trained with thumbs\nup/down from the reward model, and simultane-\nously also maintain performance according to the\nreward model and Deploy Gold F1 overlap.\nThe BB3 3B model trained with thumbs up/down\nfrom the reward model does not perform any better\nthan the BB3 3B baseline in terms of safety, despite\nthe latter having safety as part of the reward. We\nhypothesize this is for two reasons: (1) the reward\nmodel encodes many other factors other than safety,\n(2) the thumbs up data may still contain unsafe\nutterances making the model more biased. We find\nthat the safety negative method does not work well\non its own. Analyzing the results it appears it too\noften learns to output incoherent messages, perhaps\nbecause it does not have enough good examples of\nwhat to say in the case of sensitive subjects (the\nCringe loss only tells it what not to say, but not\nwhat to output in those instances).\nThe baked-in single safe message positive does\nnot work as well as baked-in variable safe mes-\nsage positive, indicating the importance of safe\ntargets which are related to the context. However,\nboth methods still overproduce safe messages, as\ncan be seen from the drop in reward model and\nF1 score. Applying the baked-in variable safety\npos/neg method fixes this problem, resulting in a\nsafe model that simultaneously maintains perfor-\nmance on safe conversations according to the re-\nward model and F1 metrics. Adding safety negative\non top of that even improves results slightly further.\nWe thus conclude it is important when training the\nmodel to tell it both when to be safe (baked-in mes-\nsage positive, safety negative), when not to worry\nabout safety (baked-in message negative), and to\nmake the safety targeted to the situation (in this\ncase, using variable safe messages).\n7\nFull Model Experiments\nSmaller (3B parameter) model experiments indi-\ncate that using the deployment data in conjunction\nwith the Cringe loss for multiple iterations is a\npromising avenue for improved results. We there-\nfore implemented this same setup at a larger (175B)\nscale, and compare to the original OPT-175B fine-\ntuned BlenderBot 3 model that was used in the\npublic deployment. Like the baseline, we thus fine-\ntune from OPT-175B, but using the Cringe loss\nwith deployment data in addition to the original\ncrowdsourced tasks, following \u00a75.\nDetails\nWe performed three iterations of Cringe\ntraining. For iterations of Cringe as before, we la-\nbel deployment data as either thumbs up or down,\nin this case using both the reward model and the\nindependent updated safety classifier (\u00a76.1), dis-\ncarding thumbs up examples from users who pro-\nduce unsafe examples during their conversations,\nfollowing Ju et al. (2022). We also normalized the\ndeployment text where possible to fix e.g. capi-\ntalization. For iteration 2 of Cringe, after some\nanalysis of errors, we additionally augmented the\nreward model with some heuristics for finding low\nquality responses, as we noticed it was not identify-\ning certain cases; in particular, spotting of repeated\nphrases or characters, and lack of correct punctu-\nation. We additionally set the threshold higher to\naccept an example as positive or negative (proba-\nbility >80%) in order to avoid incorrectly labeled\nexamples.\nMain Results\nWe first perform a human evalua-\ntion of the large models using crowdworkers. We\ntake a random sample (213 conversations) of the\ndeployment data not used for reward model train-\ning where the contexts are deemed to be safe, and\ngenerate responses for each of the models. We\nthen evaluate the models via crowdworkers using\nthe same approach as detailed in \u00a73.3. Results\nare given in Table 9. We observe an improvement\nfrom BB3x 175B Cringe iteration 1 over the BB3\n175B baseline, with the percentage of responses\nannotated as good increasing from 85.3% to 88.7%.\nCringe iteration 2 improves this further to 90.9%.\nCringe iteration 3 improves this again, resulting in\na Good % of 94.4%. We hence chose the latter best\nmodel and also evaluated it by collecting conversa-\ntions with it in the public BlenderBot deployment,\nreporting feedback results from organic users. A\nsummary of the comparison results is given in Ta-\nble 8. Feedback from organic users (measured over\na total of 957 conversations) is sparse compared\nto crowdworker annotations, however we still find\nthat organic users similarly label more responses\nas good for BB3x than for the baseline (3.47%\nvs. 2.12%), and less responses as bad (1.40% vs.\n1.63%).\nError Analysis\nWe conduct an error analysis\nusing both crowdworkers (Table 9), and from feed-\nback given by organic users (Table 10). Crowd-\nworkers find that BB3x is less often off topic, repet-\nCrowdworkers\nOrganic Users\nThumbs Up (\u2191)\nThumbs Down (\u2193)\nThumbs up (\u2191)\nThumbs down (\u2193)\nBB3 175B baseline\n85.3%\n14.7%\n2.12%\n1.63%\nBB3x 175B (trained on deploy data)\n94.4%\n5.6%\n3.47%\n1.40%\nTable 8: 175B model overall human evaluations.

Still, we do not see perfect agreement in\nbreakdown of topics between the two types of an-\nnotators, but do in overall statistics. We note both\ndeployed models use the improved safety classifier\n(\u00a76.1), so both models are actually improved over\nthe original release, and the difference in inappro-\npriate behavior would actually be larger if compar-\ning to the original baseline with original classifier.\nWe observe in Table 9 that the second iteration of\nCringe training tends to improve all the breakdown\nmetrics compared to the first iteration of training,\nexcept \u201cother\u201d, perhaps making more types of er-\nrors that are difficult to delineate precisely. Round\n3 gives further improvements in the nonsensical,\ninappropriate and other categories. Nevertheless,\noverall, the largest number of mistakes still lie in\nthe nonsensical and off topic categories, according\nto both crowdworkers and organic users, leaving\nroom for further improvement.\nComparison to Llama\nAll of our full model ex-\nperiments so far have centered on fine-tuned vari-\nants of OPT-175B, as that is the fairest compari-\nson to the baseline BB3 model. That is, our ex-\nperiments keep the base (pre-trained LLM) model\nfixed, and evaluate performance changes when us-\ning the deployment data to try to improve the model\nthrough fine-tuning (Cringe loss) techniques. How-\never, other pre-trained LLM models exist, in par-\nticular since BB3 was published, the Llama model\nhas been released with strong reported results (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023). We thus fine-tune the 30B and\n65B variants of Llama on the same datasets as the\nBB3 baseline in order to evaluate possible improve-\nments from changing the base model using the\nsame setup as before. Results are given in Table 9\n(bottom rows). We find that Llama performs worse\nthan the OPT-based models overall, although 65B\nparameter Lama outperforms the 30B parameter\nversion. One explanation, other than size differ-\nences, is that the datasets used to pre-train Llama\ndo not focus on dialogue, whereas OPT includes\npushshift.io Reddit (Baumgartner et al., 2020).\n8\nReleases\nFollowing our and Meta AI\u2019s existing research pro-\ngram, we aim to fully and responsibly share the\nparticipating de-identified collected conversations\nwith interested researchers in order to make this\nresearch accessible and reproducible, and thus to\nenable further research into responsible conversa-\ntional AI (Sonnenburg et al., 2007; Pineau et al.,\n2021; Zhang et al., 2022; Roller et al., 2020; Dinan\net al., 2021).\nWe note that the BB3 models, code, training\ndatasets and training logbook were already previ-\nously released, see Shuster et al. (2022) and https:\n//parl.ai/projects/bb3 for details.\nNew re-\nleases associated with this paper can be found at\nhttps://parl.ai/projects/bb3x.\nOrganic Interactions\nThe organic data we re-\nlease consists of conversations between organic\nusers and variants of the model, the majority of\nwhich are the (released) BlenderBot 3 model. In\naddition, users gave feedback in the form of thumbs\nup/down, reasons and textual feedback, which we\nalso release, see e.g. Figure 1. While users agreed\nto the terms of use not to mention \u201cany personal\ninformation . . . including names, addresses, emails,\nand phone numbers\u201d as an extra layer of protec-\ntion we also made efforts to de-identify the data\nalgorithmically. The data consists of approximately\n5.9M messages, and 154k feedback responses.\nCrowdworker\nAnnotations\nCrowdworkers\nwere employed to annotate organic conversations\nfor quality (both human and bot messages), and\nannotating with failure reasons where the response\nwas deemed poor, see \u00a73.3. These annotations\nwere used both for data analysis and for building\na reward model.\nWe release the annotations\nattached to conversational turns in the dataset\nwhere applicable (due to the size of the deployment\ndata release, only a subset of it is annotated by\ncrowdworkers). The data consists of annotations\nover approximately 23k messages, with typically 3\nannotations each from independent crowdworkers.\n9\nConclusion\nThis technical report gave a description of Blender-\nBot 3x, a conversational model designed to im-\nprove by learning from organic interaction and\nfeedback data from the BlenderBot 3 public deploy-\nment. The overall goal of the research program is\nto enable the research community to study continu-\nally learning and evolving agents, in order to find a\npath to better and better systems in the long-term,\nas discussed in Roller et al. (2020). Hence, an im-\nportant artifact of this work is the release of the\ninteraction and feedback data for further study of\nthis important problem by the community.\nIn that regard, the BlenderBot 3x results serve\nas a proof-of-concept that the released deployment\ndata is beneficial. In human evaluations, we have\nshown BlenderBot 3x is superior to BlenderBot 3\nby using the deployment data for fine-tuning. How-\never, analysis of interaction data from both Blender-\nBot 3 and BlenderBot 3x indicates problems still\nremain. Hence, while we focus on one particular\nmethod \u2013 use of the Cringe loss (Adolphs et al.,\n2022) \u2013 future work should investigate and develop\nfurther techniques.\nAs models are quickly outpacing average human\nperformance in many areas, it is becoming more\ndifficult to evaluate models \u2013 and for humans to\ngive feedback to improve them. The BlenderBot\ndeployment is a prototype of a community effort\nto interact with and provide model performance\nfeedback that is shared openly \u2013 so that this can\nbe fed back into improving open language models.\nWe hope that future work will take this blueprint\nand improve on it in future community-based de-\nployments that share results openly. Fostering a\npositive and engaged organic community will have\nmultiple benefits, including more beneficial conver-\nsations, and feedback provided from humans who\nare experts in a given area. We believe this is a\nviable path to improving open language models in\nthe long-term.\n10\nLimitations and Ethical\nConsiderations\nWe highlight limitations of BlenderBot 3x and dis-\ncuss ethical considerations for this line of research;\nin particular, we detail the considerations made for\nthe deployment of the system and the study and\nrelease of organic data from interactions with the\nmodel. We also refer the reader to the paper de-\nscribing the BlenderBot 3 model (Shuster et al.,\n2022), especially for the limitations and ethical\nconsiderations section contained therein which is\nalso pertinent to this work, as we report use of the\nsame system.\nModel Limitations\nShuster et al. (2022) dis-\ncussed model limitations of BlenderBot 3, in partic-\nular the types of errors such off-topic, nonsensical,\nincorrect or rude or inappropriate behavior. This\nwork studied those issues much more deeply us-\ning the interaction data collected since release to\npresent a fuller picture. We make use of both inde-\npendent human evaluators, and feedback from the\norganic users themselves, along with developing\nmethods to improve performance on these metrics.\nNevertheless, issues remain; we will particularly\ndiscuss safety issues in detail below.\nAdversarial Conversations\nAs studied in \u00a73.2\nwe observed a large number of adversarial, inappro-\npriate or toxic conversations from human organic\nusers interacting with the system. We note that the\nparticular user interface and web design, as well as\nsocial and conventional media effects, aside from\nthe quality of the conversational model, make a\nlarge difference to these statistics. For example,\nwe observed a large number of conversations post-\nlaunch centered around divisive political issues, as\nwell as discussing Facebook, Meta and its CEO.\nHowever, a small ad launch pre-release to assess\nthe system (which was hence, pre-conventional\nmedia articles and social media posts and tweets)\nindicated quite different behavior \u2013 with much less\nadversarial conversations in general, less triggering\nof the safety classifier, and much less discussion\nof divisive political issues and Meta. Secondly, we\nnote that while some toxic users should be expected\n(Park et al., 2021) to some degree the amount of\ntoxicity depends on some factors in the design of\nthe application or website, user interface and set-\nting \u2013 other than the quality of the dialogue model\nitself. For example it was observed in the LIGHT\ndialogue system that by asking users to roleplay a\ncharacter (and receive a score for good roleplaying)\ngood behavior and high quality input was observed\nin most users (Shuster et al., 2021b). The framing\nin LIGHT also made conversational discussion of\nthe model being a bot largely minimized. In the\nBlenderBot deployment, while the intent was also\nfor the model to be playing the role of a human\ncharacter, perhaps the UI and design framing does\nnot capture this adequately, or is for some other rea-\nsons exposed to more adversarial users. We have\nalso conducted a separate study of the user inter-\nface of BlenderBot (publication forthcoming) and\nfound for example that giving the model a graph-\nical friendly face (see Figure 1) can help engage\nusers in friendly conversations.\nSafety Concerns\nThe last paragraph discussed\nadversarial or inappropriate behavior from human\nusers. We see from our analysis that users are over-\nall much more inappropriate than the model itself.\nYet the model still can say inappropriate things,\nespecially when faced with users with adversarial\nor otherwise difficult prompts, see Table 2 and \u00a73.\nMuch recent work has been devoted to studying\nthe potential for large language models, and con-\nversational models in particular, to generate harm-\nful or inappropriate content (Bender et al., 2021;\nBommasani et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021;\nWeidinger et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022b), includ-\ning work from our group (Xu et al., 2020; Dinan\net al., 2022, 2021; Smith et al., 2022a; Dinan et al.,\n2020a; Smith and Williams, 2021). Despite these\nbest efforts, the goal of our research deployment\nwas to collect failings of our model through organic\nfeedback (and later offline analysis) to allow the\nresearch community to study and improve on these\nfailings \u2013 as we know that models are not perfect.\nFor this reason, it was made clear that this is a re-\nsearch prototype on the front page and FAQ, and a\nbanner was placed at all times on the screen indicat-\ning that the model has issues, and that feedback can\nbe used to improve the system, see Figure 1. Since\nthe deployment of BlenderBot 3, several commer-\ncial products featuring conversational models have\nexhibited inappropriate behavior, including Chat-\nGPT (Blum, 2022; Zhuo et al., 2023; Borji, 2023)\nand dialogue-enabled Bing (Li et al., 2023). While\nsome recent advances have been made in AI safety\n(e.g., (Bai et al., 2022b)) still work is left to be\ndone.\nConsiderations for Deployment & Release\nAs\ndiscussed in the points above, the goal of deploy-\nment, followed by collection and release of interac-\ntion and feedback data, is to allow the community\nto conduct fundamental research to improve sys-\ntems in the future. Given that commercial products\nhave been released that still have issues as just\nmentioned, and that academic researchers do not\nhave access to data from those systems, this sug-\ngests that data releases like the one detailed in \u00a78\ncould be important for further progress. In order\nto reduce potential harms in such interactions, we\nrestrict access to adults who explicitly agree to our\nterms of service, including data release. In addition\nusers can elect to not share particular de-identified\nconversations with a checkmark option, displayed\nat all times on the screen during conversation, see\nFigure 1. This also includes a link to the FAQ\npage, which provides important model details and\nhighlights the potential risks of interacting with the\nmodel, and further details about how the data will\nbe released, see \u00a78. As mentioned before, a banner\nat the top of the screen visible at all times also indi-\ncates that the model has issues, and that feedback\ncan be used to improve the system. The FAQ page\nalso provides an email for questions and feedback\nabout the demo, following the recommendation of\nDinan et al. (2021). We hope through these re-\nleases, researchers can build off of our work and\nfurther responsible conversational AI research.\nReferences\nDaniel Adiwardana, Minh-Thang Luong, David R So,\nJamie Hall, Noah Fiedel, Romal Thoppilan, Zi Yang,\nApoorv Kulshreshtha, Gaurav Nemade, Yifeng Lu,\net al. 2020.

Consequently, there is growing interest in\nextending NeRF models to jointly optimize camera poses\nand scene representation, which offers an alternative to off-\nthe-shelf SfM pipelines which have well-understood failure\nmodes. Existing approaches for unposed NeRF operate un-\nder limiting assumptions, such as a prior pose distribution\nor coarse pose initialization, making them less effective in a\ngeneral setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach,\nLU-NeRF, that jointly estimates camera poses and neural\nradiance fields with relaxed assumptions on pose configu-\nration. Our approach operates in a local-to-global man-\nner, where we first optimize over local subsets of the data,\ndubbed \u201cmini-scenes.\u201d LU-NeRF estimates local pose and\ngeometry for this challenging few-shot task. The mini-scene\nposes are brought into a global reference frame through a\nrobust pose synchronization step, where a final global op-\ntimization of pose and scene can be performed. We show\nour LU-NeRF pipeline outperforms prior attempts at un-\nposed NeRF without making restrictive assumptions on the\npose prior. This allows us to operate in the general SE(3)\npose setting, unlike the baselines. Our results also indi-\ncate our model can be complementary to feature-based SfM\npipelines as it compares favorably to COLMAP on low-\ntexture and low-resolution images.\n1. Introduction\nNeRF [35] was introduced as a powerful method to\ntackle the problem of learning neural scene representations\nand photorealistic view synthesis, and subsequent research\nhas focused on addressing its limitations to extend its ap-\nplicability to a wider range of use cases (see [55, 60] for\nsurveys). One of the few remaining hurdles for view syn-\nthesis in the wild is the need for accurate localization. As\nimages captured in the wild have unknown poses, these ap-\n*Work done during an internship at Google.\nProject website\nproaches often use structure-from-motion (SfM) [49, 41] to\ndetermine the camera poses.\nThere is often no recourse\nwhen SfM fails (see Fig. 7 for an example), and in fact,\neven small inaccuracies in camera pose estimation can have\na dramatic impact on photorealism.\nFew prior attempts have been made to reduce the reliance\non SfM by integrating pose estimation directly within the\nNeRF framework. However, the problem is severely un-\nderconstrained (see Fig. 1) and current approaches make\nadditional assumptions to make the problem tractable.\nFor example, NeRf\u2212\u2212 [57] focuses on pose estimation\nin forward-facing configurations, BARF [30] initialization\nmust be close to the true poses, and GNeRF [33] assumes a\n2D camera model (upright cameras on a hemisphere).\nWe propose an approach for jointly estimating the cam-\nera pose and scene representation from images from a single\nscene while allowing for a more general camera configura-\ntion than previously possible. Conceptually, our approach\nis organized in a local-to-global learning framework using\nNeRFs. In the local processing stage we partition the scene\ninto overlapping subsets, each containing only a few images\n(we call these subsets mini-scenes). Knowing images in a\nmini-scene are mostly nearby is what makes the joint esti-\nmation of pose and scene better conditioned than perform-\ning the same task globally. In the global stage, the over-\nlapping mini-scenes are registered in a common reference\nframe through pose synchronization, followed by jointly re-\nfining all poses and learning the global scene representation.\nThis organization into mini-scenes requires learning\nfrom a few local unposed images. Although methods exist\nfor few-shot novel view synthesis [62, 28, 39, 21, 13, 12],\nand separately for optimizing unknown poses [30, 33, 57],\nthe combined setting presents new challenges. Our model\nmust reconcile the ambiguities prevalent in the local un-\nposed setting \u2013 in particular the mirror symmetry ambigu-\nity [40], where two distinct 3D scenes and camera configu-\nrations produce similar images under affine projection.\nWe introduce a Local Unposed NeRF (LU-NeRF) model\nto address these challenges in a principled way. The infor-\nmation from the LU-NeRFs (estimated poses, confidences,\nand mirror symmetry analysis) is used to register all cam-\narXiv:2306.05410v1  [cs.CV]  8 Jun 2023\nFigure 1. Jointly optimizing camera poses and scene representation over a full scene is difficult and underconstrained. This example is the\nLego scene with 100 images from the Blender dataset. Left: When provided noisy observations of the true camera locations, BARF [30]\ncannot converge to the correct poses. Middle: GNeRF [33] assumes a 2D camera representation (azimuth, elevation) which is accurate\nfor the Blender dataset which has that exact configuration (upright cameras on a sphere). However, GNeRF also requires an accurate\nprior distribution on poses for sampling. The Lego images live on one hemisphere, but when GNeRF\u2019s prior distribution is the full sphere\nit also fails to localize the images accurately. Right: Our full model, LU-NeRF+Sync, is able to recover poses almost perfectly in this\nparticular example. By taking a local-to-global approach, we avoid having strong assumptions about camera representation or pose priors.\nFollowing [30, 33] pose errors for each method are reported after optimal global alignment of estimated poses to ground truth poses. To\nput the translation errors in context, the Blender cameras are on a sphere of radius 4.03.\neras in a common reference frame through pose synchro-\nnization [20, 43, 24], after which we refine the poses and\noptimize the neural scene representations using all images.\nIn summary, our key contributions are:\n\u2022 A local-to-global pipeline that learns both the camera\nposes in a general configuration and a neural scene rep-\nresentation from only an unposed image set.\n\u2022 LU-NeRF, a novel model for few-shot local unposed\nNeRF. LU-NeRF is tailored to the unique challenges\nwe have identified in this setting, such as reconciling\nmirror-symmetric configurations.\nEach phase along our local-to-global process is designed\nwith robustness in mind, and the consequence is that our\npipeline can be successful even when the initial mini-scenes\ncontain frequent outliers (see Sec 4 for a discussion on\ndifferent mini-scene construction techniques). The perfor-\nmance of our method surpasses prior works that jointly op-\ntimize camera poses and scene representation, while also\nbeing flexible enough to operate in the general SE(3) pose\nsetting unlike prior techniques. Our experiments indicate\nthat our pipeline is complementary to the feature-based SfM\npipelines used to initialize NeRF models, and is more reli-\nable in low-texture or low-resolution settings.\n2. Related work\nStructure from motion (SfM). Jointly recovering 3D\nscenes and estimating camera poses from multiple views\nof a scene is the classic problem in Computer Vision [25].\nNumerous techniques have been proposed for SfM [41, 49]\nwith unordered image collections and visual-SLAM for se-\nquential data [54, 38]. These techniques are largely built\nupon local features [32, 45, 22, 52] and require accurate\ndetection and matching across images.\nThe success of\nthese techniques has led to their widespread adoption, and\nexisting deep-learning approaches for scene representation\nand novel view synthesis are designed with the implicit as-\nsumption that the SfM techniques provide accurate poses\nin the wild. For example, NeRF [35] and its many suc-\ncessors (e.g. [5, 6, 37]) utilize poses estimated offline with\nCOLMAP [49, 31]. However, COLMAP can fail on tex-\ntureless regions and low-resolution images.\nThe local-to-global framework proposed in this work\nis inspired by the \u201cdivide-and-conquer\u201d SfM and SLAM\nmethods [8, 66, 23, 15, 19, 65, 18].\nNeural scene representation with unknown poses.\nBARF [30] and GARF [16] jointly optimize neural scene\nand camera poses, but require good initialization (e.g.\nwithin 15\u25e6 of the groundtruth).\nNeRF\u2212\u2212 [57], X-\nNeRF [42], SiNeRF [59], and SaNeRF [14] only work\non forward-facing scenes; SAMURAI [10] aims to han-\ndle coarsely specified poses (octant on a sphere) using a\npose multiplexing strategy during training; GNeRF [33] and\nVMRF [63] are closest to our problem setting. They do\nnot require accurate initialization and work on 360\u25e6 scenes.\nHowever, they make strong assumptions about the pose dis-\ntribution, assuming 2DoF and a limited elevation range.\nPerformance degrades when the constraints are relaxed.\nApproaches that combine visual SLAM with neural\nscene representations [67, 51, 44] typically rely on RGB-D\nstreams and are exclusively designed for video sequences.\nThe use of depth data significantly simplifies both scene and\npose estimation processes. There are several parallel efforts\nto ours in this field. For instance, NoPe-NeRF [9] trains\na NeRF without depending on pose priors; however, it re-\nlies on monocular depth priors. In a manner akin to our\napproach, LocalRF [34] progressively refines camera poses\nFigure 2. Proposed method. (A) shows the ground truth locations of each image (we show this only for visualization). Edge colors show\nthe grouping within mini-scenes. We create a mini-scene for each image, though here only three mini-scenes are highlighted; the ones\ncentered at image 2 (red edges), image 5 (green edges), and image 7 (blue edges). Depending on the strategy used to create mini-scenes,\nthe grouped images can contain outlier images far from the others. (B) LU-NeRF takes unposed images from a single mini-scene and\noptimizes poses without any constraints on the pose representation. (C) The reference frame and scene scale learned by LU-NeRF is\nunique to each mini-scene. This, plus estimation errors, means the relative poses between images in overlapping mini-scenes will not\nperfectly agree. To register the cameras in a common reference frame, we utilize pose synchronization which seeks a globally optimal\npositioning of all cameras from noisy relative pose measurements \u2013 this is possible since we have multiple relative pose estimations for\nmany pairs of images. (D) Lastly, we jointly refine the synchronized camera poses and learn a scene representation.\nand radiance fields within local scenes. Despite this similar-\nity, it presumes monocular depth and optical flow as super-\nvision, and its application is limited to ordered image col-\nlections; MELON [29] optimizes NeRF with unposed im-\nages using equivalence class estimation, yet it is limited to\nSO(3); RUST [46] and FlowCam [50] learn a generalizable\nneural scene representation from unposed videos.\nIn summary, prior work on neural scene representa-\ntion with unknown poses assumes either small perturba-\ntions [30, 16, 57, 59], a narrow distribution of camera\nposes [33, 63], or depth priors [9, 34]. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to address the problem of neu-\nral rendering with unconstrained unknown poses for both\nordered and unordered image collections.\nFew-shot scene estimation.\nLearning scene representa-\ntions from a few images has been studied in [62, 21,\n13, 12, 28, 39].\nPixelNeRF [62] uses deep CNN fea-\ntures to construct NeRFs from few or even a single image.\nMVSNeRF [12] leverages cost-volumes typically applied in\nmulti-view stereo for the same task, while DS-NeRF [21]\nassumes depth supervision is available to enable training\nwith fewer views. Our approach to handle the few-shot case\nrelies on a standard neural field optimization with strong\nregularization, similar to RegNeRF [39].\nUnsupervised pose estimation.\nThere are a number of\ntechniques that can learn to predict object pose from cat-\negorized image collections without explicit pose supervi-\nsion. Multiple views of the same object instance are used\nin [56, 26] to predict the shape and pose while training is\nself-supervised through shape rendering. RotationNet [27]\nuses multiple views of an object instance to predict both\nposes and class labels but is limited to a small set of dis-\ncrete uniformly spaced camera viewpoints. The multi-view\ninput is relaxed in [36, 58] which operates on single image\ncollections for a single category. UNICORN [36] learns a\ndisentangled representation that includes pose and utilizes\ncross-instance consistency at training, while an assumption\nabout object symmetry guides the training in [58].\n3. Methodology\nAn illustration of our approach is shown in Figure 2.\nAt the core of our method is the idea of breaking up a\nlarge scene into mini-scenes to overcome the non-convexity\nof global pose optimization without accurate initialization.\nWhen the camera poses in the mini-scene are close to one\nanother, we are able to initialize the optimization with all\nposes close to the identity and optimize for relative poses.\nIn Sec. 4, we describe how we construct mini-scenes, and\nbelow we describe the process of local shape estimation fol-\nlowed by global synchronization.\n3.1. Local pose estimation\nThe local pose estimation step takes in mini-scenes of\ntypically three to five images and returns the relative poses\nbetween the images. The model, denoted LU-NeRF-1, is a\nsmall NeRF [35] that jointly optimizes the camera poses as\nextra parameters as in BARF [30]. In contrast with BARF,\nin this stage, we are only interested in a rough pose esti-\nmation that will be improved upon later, so we aim for a\nlightweight model with faster convergence by using small\nMLPs and eliminating positional encoding and view depen-\ndency. As we only need to recover relative poses, without\nloss of generality, we freeze one of the poses at identity and\noptimize all the others.\nFew-shot radiance field optimization is notoriously dif-\nficult and requires strong regularization [39]. Besides the\nphotometric \u21132 loss proposed in NeRF, we found that adding\na loss term for the total variation of the predicted depths\nover small patches is crucial for the convergence of both\ncamera pose and scene representation:\n1\n|R|\nX\nr\u2208R\nK\nX\ni,j=1\n\u0000d\u03b8(ri,j)\u2212d\u03b8(ri,j+1)\n\u00012+\n\u0000d\u03b8(ri,j)\u2212d\u03b8(ri+1,j)\n\u00012\nwhere R is a set of ray samples, d\u03b8(r) is the depth rendering\nfunction for a ray r, \u03b8 are the model parameters and camera\nposes, K is the patch size, and (i, j) is the pixel index.\n3.2. Mirror-symmetry ambiguity\nThe ambiguities and degeneracies encountered when es-\ntimating 3D structure have been extensively studied [53, 7,\n17]. One particularly relevant failure mode of SfM is distant\nsmall objects, where the perspective effects are small and\ncan be approximated by an affine transform, and one can-\nnot differentiate between reflections of the object around\nplanes parallel to the image plane [40].\nWhen enforc-\ning multi-view consistency, this effect, known as mirror-\nsymmetry ambiguity, can result in two different configura-\ntions of structure and motion that cannot be told apart (see\nFig. 3). We notice, perhaps for the first time, that neural\nradiance fields with unknown poses can degenerate in the\nsame way.\nOne potential solution to this problem would be to keep\nthe two possible solutions and drop one of them when new\nobservations arrive. This is not applicable to our case since\nat this stage the only information available is the few images\nof the mini-scene.\nTo mitigate the issue, we introduce a second stage for\nthe training, denoted LU-NeRF-2. We take the estimated\nposes in world-to-camera frame {Ri} from LU-NeRF-1,\nand the reflected cameras {R\u03c0Ri}, where R\u03c0 is a rotation\naround the optical axis. Note that this is different than post-\nmultiplying by R\u03c0, which would correspond to a global ro-\ntation that wouldn\u2019t change the relative poses that we are\ninterested in at this stage. We then train two new models,\nwith the scene representation started from scratch and poses\ninitialized as the original and reflected sets, and resolve the\nambiguity by picking the one with the smallest photometric\ntraining loss. The rationale is that while the issue is caused\nby LU-NeRF-1 ignoring small perspective distortions, the\ndistortions can be captured on the second round of train-\ning, which is easier since one of the initial sets of poses is\nexpected to be reasonable.\nFigure 3. Mirror symmetry ambiguity. Under affine projection,\na 3D scene (S0) and its reflection (S1) across a plane (R) will\nproduce the same image viewed from affine camera C. The con-\nsequence of this is that two distinct 3D scenes and camera poses\nwill produce similar images. In this illustration, scene S0 viewed\nfrom camera P0 will produce the same image as the reflected scene\nS1 viewed from P1. While this relationship is exact in the affine\nmodel, we observe that the mini-scene configuration with respect\nto the scene structure is often well-approximated as affine and\ntraining can converge to the near-symmetric solutions. Our LU-\nNeRF model is explicitly designed to anticipate this failure mode.\nThis illustration is inspired by a similar diagram in [40].\n3.3. Local to global pose estimation\nAfter training LU-NeRF-2, we have sets of relative poses\nfor each mini-scene in some local frame. The problem of\nfinding a global alignment given a set of noisy relative poses\nis known as pose synchronization or pose averaging. It is\nformalized as optimizing the set of N global poses {Pi}\ngiven relative pose observations Rij,\nargmin\nP \u2208SE(3)N d(Pij, PjP \u22a4\ni ),\n(1)\nfor some metric d: SE(3) \u00d7 SE(3) 7\u2192 R. The problem\nis challenging due to non-convexity and is an active sub-\nject of research [4, 43, 20]. We use the Shonan rotation\nmethod [20] to estimate the camera rotations, followed by a\nleast-squares optimization of the translations.\nGlobal pose and scene refinement.\nAfter pose averag-\ning, the global pose estimates are expected to be good\nenough such that any method that requires cameras initial-\nized close to the ground truth should work (e.g. BARF [30],\nGARF [16]). We apply BARF [30] at this step, which re-\nsults in both accurate poses and a scene representation ac-\ncurate enough for realistic novel view synthesis. We refer\nto the full pipeline as LU-NeRF+Sync.\nChair\nHotdog\nLego\nMic\nDrums\nShip\nrot\ntrans\nrot\ntrans\nrot\ntrans\nrot\ntrans\nrot\ntrans\nrot\ntrans\nCOLMAP\n0.12\n0.01\n1.24\n0.04\n2.29\n0.10\n8.37\n0.18\n5.91\n0.28\n0.17\n0.01\n+BARF\n0.14\n0.01\n1.20\n0.01\n1.88\n0.09\n3.73\n0.15\n8.71\n0.54\n0.15\n0.01\nVMRF 120\u25e6\n4.85\n0.28\n\u2013\n\u2013\n2.16\n0.16\n1.39\n0.07\n1.28\n0.08\n16.89\n0.71\nGNeRF 90\u25e6\n0.36\n0.02\n2.35\n0.12\n0.43\n0.02\n1.87\n0.03\n0.20\n0.01\n3.72\n0.18\nGNeRF 120\u25e6\n4.60\n0.16\n17.19\n0.74\n4.00\n0.20\n2.44\n0.08\n2.51\n0.11\n31.56\n1.38\nGNeRF 150\u25e6\n16.10\n0.76\n23.53\n0.92\n4.17\n0.36\n3.65\n0.26\n5.01\n0.18\n\u2013\n\u2013\nGNeRF 180\u25e6 (2DOF)\n24.46\n1.22\n36.74\n1.46\n8.77\n0.53\n12.96\n0.66\n9.01\n0.49\n\u2013\n\u2013\nOurs (3DOF)\n2.64\n0.09\n0.24\n0.01\n0.09\n0.00\n6.68\n0.10\n12.39\n0.23\n\u2013\n\u2013\nTable 1.

For example, GNeRF 120\u25e6 only samples elevations in [\u221230\u25e6, 90\u25e6].

Bold numbers\nindicate superior performance between the bottom two rows, which are the fairest comparison among NeRF-based methods, although our\nmethod is still solving a harder 3DOF problem versus 2DOF of GNeRF. We outperform GNeRF in all but one scene in this comparison.\nCOLMAP [49] results in its best possible scenario are shown for reference (higher resolution images and assuming optimal graph to set\nunregistered poses to the closest registered pose). COLMAP+BARF runs a BARF refinement on top of these initial results, and even in\nthis best-case scenario, our method still outperforms it in some scenes, which shows that LU-NeRF can complement COLMAP and work\nin scenes COLMAP fails. Our model fails on the Ship scene due to outliers in the connected graph; GNeRF with fewer constraints also\nfails on it.

Camera pose estimation on unordered image collections. The performance of GNeRF drops dramatically when the pose prior\nis expanded beyond the true distribution. In comparison, our method does not rely on any prior knowledge of pose distribution.\n4. Experiments\nOur method as described in Sec. 3 starts from a set of\nmini-scenes that covers the input scene. We evaluate differ-\nent approaches to constructing mini-scenes, each with dif-\nferent assumptions on the input.\nThe most strict assumption is that we have an optimal\ngraph connecting each image to its nearest neighbors in\ncamera pose space. While this seems unfeasible in prac-\ntice, some real-life settings approximate this, for example,\nwhen images are deliberately captured in a pattern such as\na grid, or if they are captured with camera arrays.\nIn a less constrained version of the problem, we assume\nan ordered image collection, where the images form a se-\nquence, from where a line graph is trivially built. This is a\nmild assumption that is satisfied by video data, as well as\nthe common setting of a camera physically moving around\na scene sequentially capturing images.\nIn the most challenging setting, we assume nothing about\nthe scene and only take an unordered image collection.\nBuilding graphs from unordered image collections. We\nevaluate two simple ways of building graphs from un-\nordered image collections. The first is to use deep features\nfrom a self-supervised model trained on large image collec-\ntions. We use the off-the-shelf DINO model [11, 2] to ex-\ntract image features and build the graph based on the cosine\ndistance between these features. The second is to simply\nuse the \u21131 distance in pixel space against slightly shifted and\nrotated versions of the images. Neither of these approaches\nis ideal. The deep features are typically coarse and too gen-\neral, failing to detect specific subtle changes on the scene.\nThe \u21131 distance has the opposite issue, where small changes\ncan result in large distances. We provide a detailed analy-\nsis in the Appendix. Exploring other methods for finding a\nproxy metric for the relative pose in image space is a direc-\ntion for future work.\nDatasets. We compare with existing published results on\nthe synthetic-NeRF dataset [35]. We use the training split of\nthe original dataset as our unordered image collection which\nconsists of 100 unordered images per 3D scene.

For instance, GNeRF 150\u25e6\nonly samples elevations in [-60\u25e6, 90\u25e6]. The 180\u25e6 variations don\u2019t\nconstrain elevation and are closest to our method, but they are still\nlimited to 2 degrees of freedom for assuming upright cameras.

The dataset provides ground truth\nposes computed using AR solutions at 30fps, and we con-\nstruct a wider-baseline dataset by subsampling every 15th\nframe and selecting videos with limited texture (Fig. 7).\nEvaluation metrics. We evaluate the tasks of camera pose\nestimation and novel view synthesis. For camera pose esti-\nmation, we report the camera rotation and translation error\nusing Procrustes analysis as in BARF [30]. For novel view\nsynthesis, we report the PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [64].\nBaseline methods.\nWe compare with GNeRF [33],\nVMRF [63], and COLMAP [49] throughout our experi-\nments. GNeRF samples camera poses from a predefined\nprior pose distribution and trains a GAN-based neural ren-\ndering model to build the correspondence between the sam-\npled camera poses and 2D renderings. The method provides\naccurate pose estimation under proper prior pose distribu-\ntion. However, its performance degrades significantly when\nthe prior pose distribution doesn\u2019t match the groundtruth.\nVMRF attempts to relieve the reliance of GNeRF on the\nprior pose distribution but still inherits its limitations. In\nour experiments, we evaluate with the default pose pri-\nors of GNeRF on the NeRF-synthetic dataset, i.e., azimuth\n\u2208 [0\u25e6, 360\u25e6] and elevation \u2208 [0\u25e6, 90\u25e6], and also on less\nconstrained cases. COLMAP works reliably in texture-rich\nscenes but may fail dramatically on texture-less surfaces.\nImplementation details. We use a compact network for\nLU-NeRF to speed up the training and minimize the mem-\nory cost. Specifically, we use a 4-layer MLP without po-\nsitional encoding and conditioning on the view directions.\nWe stop the training early when the change of camera poses\non mini-scenes is under a predefined threshold. To resolve\nthe mirror symmetry ambiguity (Sec. 3.2), we train two ad-\nditional LU-NeRFs for a fixed number of training iterations\n(50k by default). The weight of the depth regularization is\n10 times larger than the photometric \u21132 loss throughout our\nexperiments. More details are in the Appendix.\n4.1.

Our pipeline also naturally exploits sequential im-\nage data, which is easy to acquire in practice.\nOne limitation of our method is the computational cost,\nwhich can be relieved by recent advances in neural render-\ning [55].\nAnother limitation is the difficulty in building\ngraphs for unordered scenes, which is a promising direction\nfor future work.\n6.

Training GNeRF\nWe trained GNeRF [33] using the official codebase1.\nThe scores of GNeRF in our experiments are overall bet-\nter than those reported in VMRF [63], likely because we\ntrained GNeRF for more iterations. In our experiments, we\ntrain GNeRF for 60K iterations which take 48 hours on a\nsingle NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti. We notice that GN-\neRF is prone to mode collapse in the adversarial training\nstage, i.e., the generator produces the same or similar sets\nof outputs with negligible variety, which is a well-known\nissue for GAN-based models [3]. To achieve similar perfor-\nmance reported in GNeRF and VMRF, we train 5 GNeRF\nmodels per prior pose setting and report the results from the\nbest one selected according to the performance on the vali-\ndation set. Specifically, 35% of the training trials (26 out of\n75) suffered from the mode collapse issue on the unordered\nimage collections.\nA.2. Test-time optimization for view synthesis\nFollowing the procedure established by prior works [30,\n33] for evaluating novel view synthesis, we register the\ncameras of the test images using the transformation ma-\ntrix obtained via Procrustes analysis on the predicted and\ngroundtruth cameras of the training images; we then opti-\nmize the camera poses of the test images with the photo-\nmetric loss to factor out the effect of the pose error on the\nview synthesis quality. In the GNeRF pipeline, the test-time\noptimization is interleaved with the training process, so the\ntotal number of iterations depends on the number of train-\ning steps seen for the best checkpoint. In our experiments,\nGNeRF runs approximately 4230 test-time optimization it-\nerations.\nA.3. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons\nIn the main text, we quote the scores from VMRF where\nthe results on Hotdog are missing. Here we also train GN-\neRF using the official codebase and report the results in Ta-\nble 8. This allowed us to generate GNeRF results on the\nHotdog scene, and observe the mode collapse reported in\nthe previous section.\nOverall, our method outperforms both GNeRF and\nVMRF under an unconstrained pose distribution, while also\nbeing more general \u2013 our method works with arbitrary 6\ndegrees-of-freedom rotations (6DOF), while the baselines\nassume upright cameras (2DOF) on the sphere, even when\nthe range of elevations is not constrained.\n1https://github.com/quan-meng/gnerf\nB. Supplementary analysis\nB.1. Pose synchronization and refinement\nTable 9 demonstrates the necessity of our pose synchro-\nnization and refinement steps. The pose synchronization\naggregates the local pose estimation from LU-NeRF and\nprovides a rough global pose configuration, and the pose\nrefinement step further improves the global poses.\nB.2. Case study on Drums\nIn this section, we take a closer look at the performance\nof our model on Drums, the worst-performing scene in Ta-\nble 8.\nThe mean rotation error over the 100 cameras is\n12.39\u25e6 (see Table 1 of the main paper). Figure 9 shows the\nestimated camera poses juxtaposed with the ground truth\ncameras after Procrustes alignment. We can see that there\nis a small cluster of poorly posed images. Since Procrustes\nfinds the optimal least-squares global alignment between\npredicted and true camera poses, it is severely affected by\nthese outlier images. A subtle consequence of this is that\nthe test time optimization, described in Sec. A.2, may not\nbe sufficient to evaluate the novel view synthesis results ac-\ncurately and quantitatively. Due to the exaggerated mis-\nalignment from Procrustes in Drums, we may need to in-\ncrease the number of iterations in order to converge to a\nmore accurate viewpoint. Indeed, we find simply increasing\nthe number of test-time optimization iterations from 100 to\n1000 dramatically improves the rendering metrics: PSNR\nincreases from 14.26 to 23.53, SSIM increases from 0.71 to\n0.89, and LPIPS decreases from 0.30 to 0.12.\nFigure 9. Camera pose predictions on Drums.\nB.3. Effect of depth regularization\nSimilar to RegNeRF [39], we encourage the smoothness\nof the predicted depth maps and apply a depth regulariza-\ntion on small patches. We sample patches rendered from the\ncameras whose poses are jointly optimized with the 3D rep-\nresentation, while RegNeRF uses groundtruth poses for the\nobserved views and samples the patches from unobserved\nviewpoints. We find that such depth regularization is cru-\ncial to the success of LU-NeRF.

Effect of depth regularization on the pose estimation.\nWe report the mean relative rotation error (\u00b0) with and without\ndepth regularization. The relative rotations are computed between\nthe center camera and its neighbors within a mini-scene. The rela-\ntive rotation error (lower is better) is defined as the rotation angle\nbetween the predicted relative rotations and the groundtruth.\nporating the depth regularization significantly improves the\npose estimation accuracy of LU-NeRF \u2013 the median rela-\ntive rotation errors decrease from 11.08\u25e6 to 4.69\u25e6 while the\nmean drops from 11.93\u25e6 to 8.26\u25e6. Even though the maxi-\nmum relative rotation error is smaller without the depth reg-\nularization, the Shonan averaging [20] fails to converge to a\nreasonable global pose configuration.\nB.4. Computational cost\nTable 11 presents the computational cost of the proposed\nframework. We randomly sample 30 mini-scenes and report\nthe average training time for LU-NeRF-1 and LU-NeRF-2.\nThe LU-NeRFs for different mini-scenes are independent\nand thus can be trained in parallel. The training of LU-\nNeRFs and the global pose refinement with BARF [30] can\nbe significantly accelerated with some recent advances in\nlearnable scene representations (e.g. PlenOctrees [61], In-\nstantNGP [37]).\nStage\nRunning time\nLU-NeRF-1\n1.08 hours\nLU-NeRF-2\n0.89 hours\nPose synchronization\n3.18 seconds\nPose refinement\n4.40 hours\nTable 11.

The pose synchronization\nstep runs on CPU and has a negligible running time.\nC. Implementation details\nC.1. Building connected graphs\nGiven a distance function dist(\u00b7, \u00b7), image descriptors\n{fi}N and corresponding cameras {Ci}N where i\n\u2208\n{0, . . . , N \u2212 1} is the image index and N is the total num-\nber of images, as the first step, we build a minimal spanning\ntree (MST) using Kruskal\u2019s algorithm. Each node on the\nMST represents a camera and the weight Wij on the edge\nthat connects camera Ci and Cj is the distance dist(fi, fj)\nbetween the descriptors of image Ii and Ij. To ensure each\nmini-scene contains at least K images (K = 5 by default),\nwe augment the MST by adding nearest neighbors for nodes\nthat have less than K \u2212 1 connected nodes in the MST. We\nalso ensure that each edge appears in both mini-scenes cen-\ntered at the endpoints of the edge, such that there are at\nleast two measurements for the relative pose between two\nconnected cameras. Having multiple measurements allows\nfor estimating the confidence of the predicted relative poses\nand identifying LU-NeRF failures (see Sec. C.2).\nC.1.1\nDistance functions\nMotivation.\nWe intentionally experiment with simplis-\ntic approaches to compute image similarity in our graph-\nbuilding procedure since our primary contribution in this\nwork is the local-to-global pose and scene estimation start-\ning with LU-NeRF on mini-scenes. In practice, depending\non the application context, there are likely different cues or\nweak supervision that can be exploited for graph building\n(as we do for ordered sequences). We leave it to future work\nto explore more sophisticated unsupervised/self-supervised\ntechniques for building neighborhood graphs.\nIn our experiments, we tried two different features to\nbuild the connected graph:\nself-supervised DINO fea-\ntures [11] and raw RGB values with \u21131 distance.\nDINO features. We extract semantic object parts by apply-\ning K-means clustering on the image collections [2]. The\nnumber of parts is 10 by default in our experiments. We\nbuild an image descriptor in a similar way as the Histogram-\nof-Gradients (HoG). Specifically, we evenly split the part\nsegmentation maps into 4 \u00d7 4 grid and compute a part his-\ntogram within each cell. We then normalize the histogram\nper cell into a unit vector and use the concatenated 16 his-\ntograms as the image descriptors. The cosine distance be-\ntween these descriptors is used to build the MST and final\ngraph.\n\u21131 on RGB values. We estimate the distance between two\nimages as the minimum \u21131 cross-correlation over a set of\nrotations and translations. Formally, we compute\ndist(I1, I2) = argmin\nt,\u03b8\nX\nx\n| I1(x) \u2212 I2(R\u03b8x + t) |,\n(2)\nwhere x is the pixel index, t is in a 5 \u00d7 5 window cen-\ntered at 0, R\u03b8 is an in-plane rotation by \u03b8 and \u03b8 \u2208 {0, \u03c0}.\nWhen the minimum is found at \u03b8 \u0338= 0, we augment the\ninput scene with the in-plane rotated image and correct its\nestimated pose by \u03b8.\nWe found that considering the in-plane rotations here is\nuseful because of symmetries \u2013 some scenes of symmetric\nobjects can contain similar images from cameras separated\nby large in-plane rotations. This is problematic for LU-\nNeRFs because they initialize all poses at identity. Aug-\nmenting the scene with the closest in-plane rotations makes\nthe target poses closer to identity and helps convergence.\nMetric selection In experiments with unordered image col-\nlections, we used the \u21131/RGB metric for Lego and Drums,\nand the DINO metric for Chair, Hotdog, and Mic. The RGB\nmetric fails to build useful graphs for Hotdog, Mic and Ship,\nwhile the DINO metric fails for Lego, Drums, and Ship. No\ngraph-building step is necessary on ordered image collec-\ntions since the order determines the graph.\nC.1.2\nAnalysis\nFigure 10 presents the MST, the connected graph, and im-\nage pairs that are connected in the graph on the Chair scene\nfrom the NeRF-synthetic dataset when using the DINO fea-\ntures. Surprisingly, the self-supervised ViT generalizes well\non unseen objects and the learned representations are robust\nto viewpoint change (see the last column of Figure 10).\nMinimum spanning tree\nConnected Graph\nSamples of connected nodes\n56.49\u00ba\n23.18\u00ba\n22.96\u00ba\n17.51\u00ba\n13.15\u00ba\nFigure 10.

In the right panel, each col-\numn presents two images that are connected on the graph (1st and\n3rd row), the corresponding part co-segmentation maps [2] (2nd\nand 4th row), and rotation distance between the two views (bot-\ntom).\nFigure 11. Graph statistics. We compare the rotation distance\nbetween mini-scene neighbors on the optimal graph built with\ngroundtruth camera poses, the graph built with DINO features, and\nthe one built with RGB features. For most scenes both DINO and\nRGB mini-scenes include outlier images (close to 180\u25e6 distance)\nwhich our pipeline needs to deal with.\nFigure 11 presents an analysis of the connected graphs\nbuilt with DINO and RGB features. Both features provide\noutlier-free connected graphs on Chair. The graphs built\nwith DINO contain much fewer outliers on Hotdog and Mic,\nwhile RGB features induce clearer graphs on Drums and\nLego. Both DINO and RGB features produce more outliers\non Ship than other scenes.\nOptimal graph vs noisy graph. To analyze the effect of\ngraph building on the unordered image collection, we build\nan oracle outlier-free connected graph with groundtruth\ncamera poses. Table 12 compares the performance of our\nmethod with the optimal graphs and noisy graphs built with\nDINO/RGB features. Outliers in the connected graph may\nhurt the performance of LU-NeRF. Nevertheless, with our\nsimple graph-building methods based on DINO/RGB fea-\ntures, our method outperforms the baselines when they are\nnot given prior constraints on the camera pose distributions.\nWe notice that the performance with the optimal graph\nis worse than that with the noisy graph on Chair. The \u201cop-\ntimal\u201d graph minimizes camera distances, but it is not guar-\nanteed to be the best choice for LU-NeRF. e.g., issues like\nmirror symmetry ambiguity (Sec. 3.2) can arise more often\nwhen cameras are in close proximity, and there is random-\nness inherent in training neural networks.\nRotation Error [\u00b0]\nTranslation Error\nScenes\nOptimal graph\nNoisy graph\nOptimal graph\nNoisy graph\nChair\n4.24\n2.64\n0.16\n0.09\nHotdog\n0.23\n0.24\n0.01\n0.01\nLego\n0.07\n0.09\n0.00\n0.00\nMic\n0.84\n6.68\n0.02\n0.10\nDrums\n0.05\n12.39\n0.00\n0.23\nTable 12.

The\nclean graph is built from the ground-truth camera poses.\nC.2. LU-NeRF architecture and training details\nIn the training of LU-NeRF, we do not apply the coarse-\nto-fine strategy proposed in BARF [30]; we sample 2048\nrays per mini-batch and adopt the learning rate schedule for\npose and MLP parameters from BARF; we remove the po-\nsitional encoding and view-dependency, and use a compact\n4-layer MLP to reduce the memory cost and speed up the\ntraining. We set the initial camera poses to identity. We\nhave experimented with random initialization around iden-\ntity but observed no significant difference. We terminate the\ntraining of LU-NeRF-1 if the average change of the camera\nrotations in a mini-scene is less than 0.125\u25e6 within 5k itera-\ntions. We train LU-NeRF-2 for 5k iterations with frozen ini-\ntial poses and then jointly optimize camera poses and neural\nfields for 45k iterations. We apply depth regularization on\nsmall patches (2 \u00d7 2 by default) in both LU-NeRF-1 and\nLU-NeRF-2.\nC.3. Synchronization and refinement details\nIn the pose synchronization step, we apply the off-the-\nshelf Shonan averaging2 [20], which solves a convex relax-\nation of the problem described in Eqn. (1) of the main text,\n2https://github.com/dellaert/ShonanAveraging\nBike\nChair\nCup\nLaptop\nShoe\nBook\nRotation\n24.41\n5.61\n13.41\n23.13\n19.36\n45.78\nTranslation\n4.09\n1.20\n0.63\n1.79\n0.82\n1.43\nTable 13. Camera baselines. We report the average rotation [\u00b0]\nand translation distance between all camera pairs in the sequential\ndata sampled from the Objectron datatset [1].\nwhile iteratively converting it to higher dimensional special-\northogonal spaces SO(n) until it converges. We then opti-\nmize the translation with fixed camera rotation.\nThe input to the Shonan averaging is the relative pose es-\ntimations from LU-NeRF and the confidence of these pose\nestimations. Each pair of cameras may have multiple mea-\nsures of the relative poses, as each camera may appear in\nmultiple mini-scenes. We apply a simple heuristic to pick\none measure from these multiple candidates: given two\ncameras Ci and Cj and their renderings Ii and Ij, where\ni < j, if the PNSR of Ii in the mini-scene centered at Ci\nis higher than the PSNR of I\u2032\ni in the mini-scene centered at\nCj, we use the pose estimation from the mini-scene i as our\nrelative pose estimation between camera Ci and camera Cj.\nTo resolve the scale ambiguity across different mini-\nscenes, we first scale each mini-scene so that the MST edges\nconnecting different mini-scenes are scale-consistent (MST\nconstruction is described in Sec. C.1).\nSpecifically, we\nestablish a reference scale by fixing it in one mini-scene\nand propagating it to others through the MST. We focus\non edges linking mini-scene centers and rescale the mine-\nscenes so that overlapping edges share a consistent scale.\nWe then obtain the translation by solving a linear system\ntj \u2212ti = Ritij where Ri is the rotation of camera i from the\nShonan method and tij is the relative translation between\ncamera i and j from LU-NeRF. Similar to the relative ro-\ntations, each pair of cameras may have multiple measures\nof the relative translation. We use the same heuristic de-\nscribed above to pick one from the multiple measures. The\ntranslation optimization has also been implemented in the\noff-the-shelf Shonan averaging.\nIn the global pose refinement stage, we closely follow the\ndefault setting of BARF [30] which jointly trains the MLP\nand refines the poses for 200k iterations with a coarse-to-\nfine positional encoding strategy.\nWe\nutilize\nthe\ncamera\nvisualization\ntoolkit\nfrom\nBARF [30] in our main paper and the Appendix.\nC.4. Dataset release and open sourcing.\nWe will release the newly ordered Blender sequences\nand open-source the code for our models.\nFor the sequential data sampled from the Objectron\ndataset [1], Table 13 reports the average rotation and trans-\nlation distance between all camera pairs as a reference for\nour quantitative evaluations in Table 6 in the main text.\n"

Our approach is able to decompose a dataset of unlabeled images into different concepts.\nWe name each decomposed concept for easy understanding.\nAbstract\nText-to-image generative models have enabled high-\nresolution image synthesis across different domains, but re-\nquire users to specify the content they wish to generate. In\nthis paper, we consider the inverse problem \u2013 given a col-\nlection of different images, can we discover the generative\nconcepts that represent each image? We present an unsu-\npervised approach to discover generative concepts from a\ncollection of images, disentangling different art styles in\npaintings, objects, and lighting from kitchen scenes, and\ndiscovering image classes given ImageNet images. We show\nhow such generative concepts can accurately represent the\ncontent of images, be recombined and composed to gener-\nate new artistic and hybrid images, and be further used as\na representation for downstream classification tasks.\n1. Introduction\nWhen presented with a set of images, we can infer and\ndiscover common concepts across images.\nFor instance,\ngiven a set of images of kitchen scenes in Figure 1, we\narXiv:2306.05357v2  [cs.CV]  3 Aug 2023\ncan grasp different illumination patterns in the kitchen and\nidentify various elements within kitchens, such as dining\ntables, kitchen islands, and cabinets. Moreover, we possess\nthe ability to conjure up vivid mental images of new scenes\nthat combine elements between different kitchen scenes or\nvisualize how these elements may manifest in unfamiliar\nsettings \u2013 envisioning, for instance, how a dining table may\nappear in a forest.\nCan we construct computer vision systems that may like-\nwise understand, recombine, and imagine the visual world?\nMost existing work in concept discovery focus on discover-\ning latent vectors or directions representing individual con-\ncepts [15, 24, 18, 44, 55], but require supervised data label-\ning each concept. Other works have focused on discovering\ncompositional generative concepts from images but focus\nonly on discovering objects [4, 34]. Recently, COMET [11]\nproposes an approach to decompose scenes into a set of gen-\nerative concepts representing both global scene concepts,\nsuch as lighting and camera position, and local concepts,\nsuch as objects. However, the approach is only applied to\nsimple datasets and fails to generate complex photorealistic\nimages.\nIn this work, we illustrate how we can leverage the\nrich semantic information in large text-to-image generative\nmodels to discover a set of diverse compositional generative\nconcepts from unlabeled natural images. Our work extends\nthe approach in [11] using the interpretation of diffusion\nmodels as EBMs [32] and decomposes each image into a\nset of different probability distributions. We illustrate how\neach decomposed probability distribution captures different\nglobal and local scene concepts in an image, ranging from\nImageNet class identity to portions of images such as is-\nlands and cabinets in a kitchen.\nIn Figure 1, we show how our approach can discover\ncompositional concepts across a wide set of different do-\nmains. In the top row of Figure 1, we illustrate how our\napproach can discover different art concepts, such as wheat\nfields, cafes, and bedrooms, from paintings by either Van\nGogh or Claude Monet. In the middle row of Figure 1, we\ndemonstrate how our approach can discover classes of im-\nages, such as couches, starfish, elephants, and cars, from\na collection of unlabeled ImageNet images. Finally, in the\nbottom row of Figure 1, we show how our approach can\ndiscover the compositional components of a kitchen, such\nas lighting patterns and kitchen islands.\nIn this work, we contribute the following: (1) We illus-\ntrate a scalable approach to discover unsupervised composi-\ntional concepts in realistic images using existing generative\nmodels. (2) Our method achieves state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance on concept discovery across different domains, in\nboth global and local concept discovery, such as automati-\ncally discovering painting styles, and decomposing scenes\ninto lighting and objects. (3) We illustrate that the discov-\nered generative concepts can be used for diverse tasks, such\nas generating novel creative images or as effective represen-\ntations for downstream classification tasks.\n2. Related Works\nCompositional Generation.\nCompositional generation,\nwhere we seek to generate an image subject to a set of un-\nderlying specifications, has attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years [10, 31, 32, 14, 45, 7, 6, 9, 22, 36, 53, 28, 52,\n47, 23]. Existing work on compositional generation focuses\neither on modifying the feedforward generative process to\nfocus on a set of specifications [14, 45, 7, 22, 23], or by\ncomposing a set of independent models specifying desired\nconstraints [10, 31, 32, 36, 9, 53, 28]. Our work utilizes the\ncompositional operators defined from [10, 32], but aims to\ndiscover a set of compositional components from an unla-\nbeled dataset of images.\nUnsupervised Concept Discovery. Existing works in con-\ncept discovery in computer vision typically focus on discov-\nering a latent space to manipulate images [15, 24, 18, 44,\n55, 42] but require supervised data to specify each concept.\nSome work has focused instead on discovering multiple\nconcepts from images, but focus on discovering objects rep-\nresented as separate segmentation masks [4, 34, 13]. Most\nsimilar to our work is that of COMET [11], which decom-\nposes images into a set of composable energy functions rep-\nresenting both objects and scene-level factors such as light-\ning or camera position. Our work builds on this work, but\nrepresents each individual energy function with a diffusion\nmodel. We illustrate how this enables us to generate and\ndecompose complex, high-resolution images.\nText-Conditioned Generative Modeling. In recent years,\ntremendous efforts have been made towards text-based 2D\nand 3D synthesis using various types of generative models,\nincluding GANs [17], VAEs [25], Normalizing Flows [40],\nEnergy-Based Models [27, 12] and Diffusion Models [46,\n20]. Diffusion models have become the de facto method for\n2D text-to-image synthesis [35, 43, 39, 42, 29, 5, 3, 1, 54,\n2, 16, 41, 15, 26] and text-to-3D synthesis [37, 30]. Most\nrelevant to our work, textual inversion [15] leverages pre-\ntrained text-to-image diffusion models to map a visual con-\ncept to a single-word representation (i.e., a supervised ap-\nproach). In contrast, we demonstrate how such diffusion\nmodels can be leveraged to discover multiple visual rep-\nresentations from a set of images simultaneously without\nusing image labels.\n3.

We discover a set of compositional concepts given a dataset of unlabeled images. Score\nfunctions representing each concept {c1, . . . , cK} are composed together to form a score function \u03f5unsup that is trained to denoise images.\nThe inferred concepts can be used to generate new images.\n3.1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) [46,\n20] are a class of generative models where the generation\nof images x0 is formed by iteratively denoising an image\ncorrupted with Gaussian noise. Given a randomly sampled\nnoise \u03f5 \u223c N(0, 1), and a set of t different noise levels \u03f5t =\n\u03b1t\u03f5 added to a clean image x01, a denoising model \u03f5\u03b8 is\ntrained to denoise the image at specified noise level t:\nLMSE = \u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(x0 + \u03f5t, t))\u22252\n(1)\nTo generate an image from the diffusion model, a sam-\nple xT at noise level T is initialized from Gaussian noise\nN(0, 1). This sample xT is used for generation by iterative\ndenoising:\nxt\u22121 = xt \u2212 \u03b3\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) + \u03be,\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n,\n(2)\nwhere \u03b3 is the step size2. The final sample x0 after de-\nnoising corresponds to a generated image. The denoising\nfunction \u03f5\u03b8 learns the score of an underlying EBM (unnor-\nmalized) probability distribution [51, 49, 32] and thus the\nabove expression is equivalent to\nxt\u22121 = xt \u2212 \u03b3\u2207xE\u03b8(xt) + \u03be,\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n,\n(3)\nwhere the denoising network \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) represents an unnor-\nmalized (EBM) density of data p(x) \u221d e\u2212E\u03b8(x) by param-\neterizing \u2207xE\u03b8(x) with the denoising function. This EBM\ninterpretation of diffusion models enables the composition\nof different diffusion models together as discussed in Sec-\ntion 3.2 and further enables us to decompose images into\nmultiple sets of different diffusion models.\n3.2. Composable Diffusion Models\nGiven two separate DDPM models \u03f5c1 and \u03f5c2 which pa-\nrameterize two conditional EBM distributions [12] p(x|c1)\n1Note that in practice, x0 + \u03f5t is also scaled by a contraction \u03b2t before\nbeing fed into the diffusion model.\n2An additional linear decay is further typically applied to the output xt.\nand p(x|c2) specifying the likelihood of images exhibiting\nconcept c1 and c2, composable diffusion [32] proposes to\ngenerate images with both attributes by modifying the iter-\native denoising procedure using the hybrid denoising score\n\u03f5comb:\nxt\u22121 = xt \u2212 \u03b3\n\u0000\u03f5comb(xt, t)\n\u0001\n+\u03be,\n\u03be \u223c N(0, \u03c32\nt I).\n(4)\nThe hybrid denoising function \u03f5comb corresponds to a com-\nposition of score functions:\n\u03f5comb(xt, t) = \u03f5c1(xt, t) + \u03f5c2(xt, t) \u2212 \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t),\n(5)\nwhere \u03f5\u03d5 corresponds to a DDPM representing the uncondi-\ntional image distribution p(x). Sampling using this hybrid\ndenoising function corresponds to sampling from the com-\nposite EBM distribution [32] 3:\np(x|c1, c2) \u221d p(x|c1)p(x|c2)\np(x)\n.\n(6)\nThis property of composable diffusion enables us to con-\nstruct and sample from complex novel compositions of dif-\nferent concepts at test time. In this paper, we aim to infer\na set of composable concepts from training images in an\nunsupervised manner.\n4. Method\nIn this section, we introduce our unsupervised approach\nthat discovers compositional concepts from a set of images\nusing a pretrained diffusion model. We first formulate how\nwe may decompose data points into unsupervised concepts\nwith diffusion models. Next, we illustrate how we may infer\nthese unsupervised concepts using learned latent represen-\ntations (i.e., word embeddings) in a text-to-image genera-\ntive model.\n3Assuming that c1 and c2 are independent.\n4.1. Unsupervised Compositional Discovery\nGiven a dataset of images {xi}, we aim to discover a set\nof independent compositional concepts {c1\ni , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cK\ni } for\neach image xi in an unsupervised manner, each specifying\na conditional EBM distribution p(xi|ck\ni ), which represent\ndifferent components of the image. In particular, the proba-\nbility of each individual image xi can be decomposed as a\nproduct of K independent concepts:\npdecomp(xi) = p(xi|c1\ni , . . . , cK\ni ) \u221d p(xi) QK\nk=1\np(xi|ck\ni )\np(xi) , (7)\nwhere we represent each individual probability distribution\np(x|ck\ni ) using a different denoising model \u03f5k(xt, t).\nModeling this decomposed distribution pdecomp(xi) cor-\nresponds to sampling from the score function of a composite\nEBM [32]:\n\u2207xE(xi) +\nK\nX\nk=1\n(\u2207xE(xi|ck\ni ) \u2212 \u2207xE(xi))\n(8)\nThis then corresponds to constructing a new noise predic-\ntion model \u03f5unsup:\n\u03f5unsup(xt\ni, t) = \u03f5(xt\ni, t) +\nK\nX\nk=1\n\u0000\u03f5(xt\ni, t|ck\ni ) \u2212 \u03f5(xt\ni, t)\n\u0001\n, (9)\nwhere \u03f5(xt\ni, t) corresponds to the unconditional score pre-\ndiction. To discover an independent set of compositional\nconcepts for an image, we then wish to learn a denoising\nfunction such that for each image xi and noise \u03f5t:\nLMSE = \u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5unsup(xi + \u03f5t, t))\u22252.\n(10)\nTo ensure that the set of decomposed concepts ck\ni in each\nimage is consistent across different images in our dataset,\nwe parameterize each ck\ni as the weighted sum wk\ni of a li-\nbrary of K concepts ck shared across all images. We op-\ntimize both a set of concepts ck as well as a set of per im-\nage/concept weight assignments wk\ni , where P\nk wk\ni = 1\nfor each image i. Our final modified score prediction corre-\nsponds to:\n\u03f5unsup(xt\ni, t) = \u03f5(xt\ni, t) + PK\nk=1 wk\ni\n\u0000\u03f5(xt\ni, t|ck) \u2212 \u03f5(xt\ni, t)\n\u0001\n. (11)\nThis corresponds to representing each image with the prod-\nuct distribution\npdecomp(xi) \u221d p(xi)\nK\nY\nk=1\n\u0012p(xi|ck)\np(xi)\n\u0013wk\ni\n.\n(12)\nWhen the vector of weights wi for each image is one-hot,\nimages are \u201cclustered\u201d into K separate concepts ck, where\neach image is represented by a single concept ck that rep-\nresents its class identity (i.e. dog or cat).

We provide the full pseudocode\nfor discovering concepts in Algorithm 1.\n4.2. Parameterizing Concepts with Text-to-Image\nGenerative Models\nIn section 4.1, we aim to construct a set of K different\nconditional denoising networks \u03f5(xt\ni, t|ck) and an uncondi-\ntional denoising network \u03f5(xt\ni, t) which can jointly denoise\nimages across our dataset. Directly discovering this score\nfunctions from scratch using a dataset of images is diffi-\ncult as there may be substantial ambiguity on how images\nshould be factored, with this difficulty compounded by the\nsmall dataset.\nTo more efficiently parameterize and discover these K\ndifferent score functions, we propose to parameterize each\ndenoising prediction network \u03f5(xt\ni, t|ck) using a randomly\ninitialized word embedding ck in a text-to-image diffusion\nmodel so that \u03f5(xt\ni, t|ck) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt\ni, t|ck). Parameterizing a\ndenoising function in text embedding space is substantially\nlower dimensional than discovering the score function from\nscratch, enabling learning / concept discovery from limited\nsets of data. Furthermore, the semantic space of text elimi-\nnates a lot of ambiguity when discovering concepts.\nNote, that while in our current implementation, we opti-\nmize each shared concept ck using a word embedding and a\nweight vector wi \u2208 RK for each image xi, we can param-\neterize these K different denoising networks \u03f5\u03b8(xt\ni, t|ck)\nin other ways. For instance, we can directly parameterize\nthese K score functions by optimizing all parameters of the\ntext-to-image model per concept or by optimizing a small\nadapter in a similar fashion as [42] on the weights of each\nmodel.\n5. Experiments\nIn this section, we compare our approach with baseline\nmethods in concept discovery on three different tasks, in-\ncluding object discovery, indoor scene discovery, and artis-\ntic concept discovery. We further show the results of com-\npositional image generation and representation learning us-\ning the discovered concepts. We also provide visualizations\nand analysis on sensitivity and robustness in Appendix Sec-\ntion A.\n5.1. Datasets\nImageNet [8]. For the experiment, we select 4 sets of class\ncombinations, denoted as ImageNet S1, S2, S3 and S4.\nEach set consists of 5 classes from ImageNet, with 5 ran-\ndomly chosen images per class. During testing, we generate\n64 images per concept for evaluation.\nADE20K [56]. In this experiment, our goal is to discover\nconcepts from kitchen images in the ADE20K dataset. We\nrandomly select 25 images as the training data.\nArtistic Paintings. To further demonstrate the ability of\nour method to discover a wide range of visual concepts, we\ncollected a dataset of artistic paintings from the internet.\nThe dataset includes 5 paintings by Van Gogh, 7 painting\nsamples by Claude Monet, and 5 painting images by Pablo\nPicasso.\n5.2. Evaluation Metrics\nClassification Accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of\neach method on decomposing unlabeled ImageNet images\ninto a set of meaningful classes, we utilize a pre-trained\nclassification model to compute image classification accu-\nracy. For each class present in the training data, we feed the\ngenerated images into the pre-trained ResNet-50 and extract\nthe largest value from the logit values of target classes (i.e.,\nthe 5 class targets in our setting). To evaluate the accu-\nracy of our model predictions, we establish a threshold of\n10 for the logit value. Predictions with logit values above\nthis threshold are counted as correct, while those below are\ndeemed incorrect. We find that this threshold represents a\nhigh prediction confidence from ResNet-50. Finally, we re-\nport the per-set accuracy and average accuracy across all the\nsets as our final results.\nCLIP Accuracy. To further evaluate the accuracy of de-\ncomposed concepts in ImageNet, we compute a CLIP ac-\ncuracy using the pairwise CLIP similarity score between\ngenerated images from each concept with the set of classes\npresent in the training data, using pre-trained CLIP en-\ncoders [38]. The highest-scoring caption is then selected\nas the model prediction. We count a prediction as correct if\nthe CLIP similarity score is greater than a certain threshold\n(i.e., 0.3 in our experiments).\nKL Divergence. We use Kullback-Leibler divergence to\nfurther evaluate the effectiveness of capturing diverse im-\nage concepts on ImageNet. This dataset primarily consists\nof object concepts, making it an ideal choice for measuring\nand illustrating the differences we are interested in. Ideally,\neach decomposed concept should reflect a separate class in\nthe data, resulting in an equal number of generated images\nper class. We assign an image to a class based on the class\nlabel that receives the highest logit value. We then compute\nthe KL divergence between the distribution of classes in-\nferred in this manner with a uniform distribution of classes\nin the training data (ground truth). In our experiments, we\ncalculate KL divergence by computing logits with regards\nto both pre-trained ResNet-50 and CLIP encoders.\nRepresentation Accuracy. Our proposed method aims to\ndiscover a set of concept representations, which can be fur-\nther used for downstream tasks, such as classification. Thus,\nwe also evaluate the quality of representations using cluster-\ning for classification. First, we utilize K-means clustering,\nwhere we assign a cluster to an ImageNet class based on the\nmost frequent class of training images in that cluster. In test\ntime, we count each test example as correct if it is assigned\nto the cluster with the same image label.\nWe use the pretrained Stable Diffusion v2.1 model in our\nexperiments. For image generation, we utilize classifier-\nfree guidance [21] to sample 64 images for each ImageNet\nclass with 50 steps using the DDIM sampler [48].\n5.3. Baselines\nCOMET [11] is the first work that utilizes a composite of\nEBMs to decompose images into a set of concepts in an\nunsupervised manner, but it scales poorly to more complex\nin-the-wild images. In contrast, our approach enables auto-\nmatic concept discovery across in-the-wild images.\nTextual Inversion [15] is one of the first works to utilize\nthe text-to-image diffusion model to learn a mapping from\na set of similar images to a single-word representation. Un-\nlike our unsupervised method, textual inversion optimizes a\nsingle representation using a set of similar images, thus as-\nsuming a correspondence between training images and the\ntarget word representation. In contrast, our method enables\nunsupervised learning of multiple concepts simultaneously\nin one single training run. To provide a fair comparison, we\ndeveloped a baseline using textual inversion to map all im-\nModels\nImageNet S1\nImageNet S2\nImageNet S3\nImageNet S4\nAverage\nAcc \u2191\nKL \u2193\nAcc \u2191\nKL \u2193\nAcc \u2191\nKL \u2193\nAcc \u2191\nKL \u2193\nAcc \u2191\nKL \u2193\nTextual Inversion [15]\n4.06\n0.5756\n7.19\n0.1152\n36.88\n0.1525\n63.44\n0.4958\n27.89\n0.3348\nTextual Inversion (KM)\n44.37\n0.3799\n22.50\n0.0926\n37.81\n0.2123\n78.75\n0.3576\n45.86\n0.2606\nTextual Inversion (CKM)\n48.13\n0.0282\n24.38\n0.2367\n63.75\n0.1569\n69.38\n0.2249\n51.41\n0.1617\nOurs\n56.88\n0.1613\n26.56\n0.2929\n56.56\n0.1323\n82.81\n0.0285\n55.70\n0.1538\nCLIP \u2191\nKL \u2193\nCLIP \u2191\nKL \u2193\nCLIP \u2191\nKL \u2193\nCLIP \u2191\nKL \u2193\nCLIP \u2191\nKL \u2193\nTextual Inversion [15]\n13.13\n0.4195\n3.44\n0.1182\n9.38\n0.0554\n33.75\n0.7193\n14.93\n0.3281\nTextual Inversion (KM)\n29.06\n0.1299\n9.38\n0.0803\n12.19\n0.3325\n44.37\n0.3799\n23.75\n0.2307\nTextual Inversion (CKM)\n40.31\n0.0020\n10.00\n0.3384\n14.37\n0.1490\n69.69\n0.4232\n33.59\n0.2281\nOurs\n42.19\n0.2091\n30.00\n0.1518\n30.63\n0.1513\n51.56\n0.0224\n38.60\n0.1337\nTable 1: Quantitative Evaluation of Discovered Concepts.

Unsupervised Concept Discovery\nOur method can decompose images from different do-\nmains into concepts, including objects, components in in-\ndoor scenes and artistic styles, without using any labels.\n5.4.1\nObject Discovery\nWe show that our proposed method can automatically dis-\ncover object concepts from a set of unlabeled images.\nQualitative results. We first demonstrate that our method\ncan faithfully decompose ImageNet images into a set of\nobject concepts.\nWe qualitatively compare our method\nwith multiple variants of textual inversion [15] in Fig-\nure 3. Although all three methods achieve similar perfor-\nmance on \u201cmosque\u201d and \u201cChihuahua\u201d in the top two rows,\nboth clustering-based textual inversion methods (KM and\nCKM) fail to capture visual concepts of \u201cshopping cart\u201d and\n\u201cgeyser\u201d in the bottom two rows. In contrast, our method\nKitchen Range\nLighting\nKitchen Island\nFigure 5: Kitchen Scene Decomposition. We show generated\nimages (odd columns) along with the attention maps of the corre-\nsponding concept (even columns) with respect to the image.\ncan capture all four concepts faithfully. We further evaluate\nCOMET [11] on this setting, but find that it obtains low per-\nformance in our setting as it fails to generate photorealistic\nimages. See appendix A for additional qualitative results of\nCOMET and other approaches.\nQuantitative results. In Table 1, we compare our method\nwith baselines quantitatively using image classification ac-\ncuracy. Our proposed method achieves a higher or com-\nparable classification performance across different sets of\nImageNet combinations using pre-trained ResNet-50 [19]\nand CLIP [38]. Furthermore, we evaluate the diversity of\ndiscovered concepts using discrete KL divergence between\nprediction distribution and target distribution. Intuitively,\na lower KL divergence value indicates that the probability\ndistribution of the generated images is closer to the uniform\ndistribution, thus implying greater diversity in the generated\nimages. Compared to the baselines, our method achieves a\nconsistently low KL divergence across different ImageNet\nsets. In contrast, the baselines exhibit a wider range of KL\nscores, suggesting that our proposed approach is more sta-\nble in terms of learning diverse concepts across these sets.\nAs shown in the rightmost column of Table 1, the averaged\nresults across all four sets further show that our method\nachieves the best performance on both accuracy and KL di-\nvergence, indicating its ability to learn diverse concepts.\n5.4.2\nIndoor Scene Discovery\nTo further verify the effectiveness of our approach, we\ndemonstrate our method can decompose kitchen scenes into\nmultiple sets of factors.\nQualitative results. We evaluate our method on concept\ndiscovery for indoor scenes, specifically kitchen scenes\nfrom ADE20K [56]. Since our method discovers concepts\nin an unsupervised manner, there is no label for the learned\nconcepts.\nThus, we utilize Diffusion Attentive Attribu-\ntion Maps (DDAM) [50] to visualize the relation between\nlearned concepts and image contents. Specifically, DAAM\nutilizes word-pixel scores from cross attention layers to gen-\nerate heap maps for visualization. As shown in Figure 4,\nwe obtain DDAM associated with each concept by running\nDDIM inversion [48] on the training image. Our method\ncan decompose the kitchen scenes into different compo-\nnents such as kitchen range (i.e., stove and microwave),\ncabinets, and lighting effects. Furthermore, we visualize\nimages that are generated conditioned on each individual\ninferred concept in Figure 5. Both figures show that our\nmodel can decompose challenging kitchen scenes into a set\nof meaningful factors.\n5.4.3\nArtistic Concept Discovery\nArt has been a long-standing topic being studied in the com-\nputer vision and computer graphics community. Here we\nprovide qualitative evaluations in the artistic domain to fur-\nther demonstrate the versatility of our method.\nQualitative results. As shown in Figure 6, we demonstrate\nconcept decomposition on artistic paintings from different\nartists, including Van Gogh, Claude Monet, and Pablo Pi-\ncasso. In the second row, we show that our model can de-\ncompose training images into different concepts, including\n\u201ctrees on the side\u201d, \u201ca lady sitting on a bench\u201d, \u201can embroi-\ndering lady\u201d and \u201ca boat\u201d, with similar artistic styles to the\noriginal images. In the next section, we will discuss that\nthe discovered concepts can be further composed together\nto generate images.\n5.5. Composing Discovered Concepts\nAfter a set of factors is discovered from a collection of\nimages, our method can further compose these concepts for\ncompositional image generation using compositional oper-\nators from previous works [10, 32]. As our approach is\nunsupervised and there is no label for the discovered con-\ncepts, we add names for the discovered concepts manually\nfor easy understanding. As shown in the previous section,\nour method can decompose images into meaningful con-\ncepts, such as objects in indoor scenes and artistic styles.\nThese concepts can be further composed with other con-\ncepts to generate images with specific styles.\nObject Composition. We are able to use the conjunction\noperator (e.g., AND) from Composable-Diffusion [32] to\ngenerate images that contain combinations of concepts that\nare unseen during training. As shown in Figure 7, we show\nexamples of generated images with the combination of a\nconvertible car and elephants, as well as a composition of a\nshopping cart and a mosque.\nScene Composition. We further demonstrate the proposed\nmethod can enable scene composition using discovered\nconcepts other than objects in the kitchen setting. As shown\nin Figure 8, our approach can discover concepts such as\nlighting and kitchen islands, and generate scenes with the\nspecified objects and lighting effects.\nStyle Composition. We can also combine artistic concepts\ndiscovered from paintings to generate images. As shown\nTraining Images\nVan Gogh\nClaude Monet\nPablo Picasso\nDiscovered Concept Representations\nConcept \ud835\udc50!\nConcept \ud835\udc50\"\nConcept \ud835\udc50#\nConcept \ud835\udc50$\nFigure 6: Unsupervised Concept Decomposition on Arts. Our method allows unsupervised concept decomposition from just a few\npaintings (i.e., 5 \u2212 7 per artist), with each concept ci representing a distinct concept. For instance, in the first row, c1 represents \u201cdrinkers\u201d,\nwhile in the third row, c3 represents \u201cguitarist\u201d.\nConvertible\nElephant\nConvertible AND Elephant\nMosque\nShopping cart\nMosque AND Shopping cart\nFigure 7: Object Composition. Our proposed method can gen-\nerate images that showcase a composition of object concepts.\nKitchen Range Kitchen Island\nKitchen Range AND Kitchen Island\nKitchen Island\nLighting\nKitchen Island AND Lighting\nFigure 8: Kitchen Concept Composition. Our method demon-\nstrates the ability to compose different components, such as\nkitchen ranges and lighting effects.\nin Figure 9, we compose two types of discovered artistic\nstyles to generate images using the conjunction operator.\nFor example, images in the first row combine Van Gogh\u2019s\nstarry night with Claude Monet\u2019s Camille Monet. Images\nin the second row combine Van Gogh\u2019s drinkers with the\nCubism style of Picasso.\nVan Gogh\nClaude Monet\nVan Gogh AND Claude Monet\nPicasso\nVan Gogh\nPicasso AND Van Gogh\nFigure 9: Style Composition. Our proposed method can com-\npose artistic concepts learned from paintings, with each style\nnamed after the respective artist for better understanding.\nExternal Composition. Finally, our method can combine\ndiscovered concepts with external or existing knowledge\nfrom pre-trained generative models to generate images with\nnew combinations. As shown in Figure 10, we combine tex-\ntual descriptions with discovered concepts to create images\nthat depict \u201can astronaut riding a horse\u201c AND wheat field\nin the first row, \u201cintergalactic wormhole\u201c AND a boat in the\nsecond row, and \u201ccyberpunk bar\u201d AND drinkers in the last\nrow, where the former is the text input, the latter is our dis-\ncovered concepts and \u201cAND\u201d is the conjunction operator.\n5.6. Representation Learning\nBy decomposing images into a weighted combination of\ncompositional concepts, our approach discovers a represen-\ntation for each training image. We can further obtain a rep-\nresentation for a test image xj by optimizing Equation (10)\nand obtaining a weight vector wj \u2208 RK for the image,\nwhile freezing the discovered concept representations ck.\nWe assess how this representation can be used for down-\nExisting Concept\nDiscovered Concept\nConcept Composition\nFigure 10: External Composition. We demonstrate the ability to seamlessly integrate discovered concepts with existing concepts (text)\nto generate images with specified factors. For clarity, we omit the text descriptions. For instance, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd images in the 1st column\nare created using the phrase \u201can astronaut riding a horse\u201d. \u201cintergalactic wormhole\u201d and \u201ccyberpunk bar\u201d, respectively.\nMethods\nImageNet S1 \u2191\nImageNet S2 \u2191\nImageNet S3 \u2191\nImageNet S4 \u2191\nAverage \u2191\nK-means\n37.00\n34.00\n37.00\n21.00\n32.25\nTextual Inversion\n24.00\n24.00\n25.00\n24.00\n24.25\nOurs\n58.00\n51.00\n59.00\n83.00\n62.75\nK-means (CLIP)\n65.00\n77.00\n87.00\n65.00\n73.50\nTable 2: Generative Representation Evaluation. Generative representations of images learned by our method can accurately classify\nimages. K-means (CLIP) is a supervised method and achieves the best average result.\nstream tasks such as classification.\nQuantitative Results. We evaluate the effectiveness of the\nrepresentation learned by our model for image classifica-\ntion. First, we use the optimized weight wi for each train-\ning image xi to fit a logistic regression model that predicts\nthe ImageNet class based on the weight representation for\neach training image. We then evaluate the accuracy of the\nmodel on test images xj using the optimized weights wj.\nIn this experiment, we compare our method with two\nvariants of K-means clustering methods, one in pixel space\nand another in CLIP space. We also fit a logistic regres-\nsion model on representations per image found using tex-\ntual inversion [15]. We evaluate the accuracy of these meth-\nods for predicting ImageNet class on a test set of 100 im-\nages. As shown in Table 2, our method achieves the best\nperformance of 62.75% mean accuracy compared to all the\nother unsupervised methods. The method of CLIP-based\nK-means clustering is better than our method because the\nCLIP representation is directly trained in a supervised way\non millions of image-text pairs.\n6. Conclusion\nWe presented an approach to decompose datasets of im-\nages into a set of compositional generative concepts. Our\napproach is effective across a variety of datasets, includ-\ning artistic paintings, indoor scenes, and ImageNet images.\nAdditionally, we illustrated how discovered generative con-\ncepts can be combined with both each other and external\nconcepts to generate novel images. Finally, we illustrated\nhow discovered generative concepts can serve as a repre-\nsentation of an image which can be used for downstream\ntasks such as image classification. We hope our work opens\na new direction of research on how generative models may\nnot only be used to generate images but also as way to un-\nderstand and represent images.\nReferences\n[1] Manuel Brack, Felix Friedrich, Dominik Hintersdorf, Lukas\nStruppek, Patrick Schramowski, and Kristian Kersting.

Additional Results\nIn this section, we first provide analyses of the per-\nformance of our method on the sensitivity of the num-\nber of concepts K, the variance of our method on in-\nferred concepts, and the diversity of generated images in\nappendix A.1. We then show additional results of decom-\nposed concepts for objects, indoor scenes, artistic paintings,\nand hybrid dataset that consists of different modalities in\nappendix A.2. Finally, we provide additional results for ob-\nject composition, indoor scene composition, art composi-\ntion, and external composition in appendix A.3. Note that\nwe utilize the conjunction operator (e.g., AND) from com-\nposable diffusion [32] for compositional generation.\nA.1. Analysis\nSensitivity of the number of concepts K. In Figure 11,\nwe run our method with varying values of K (4, 5, and 6)\non ImageNet S1 (images with five categories of objects).\nWhen K = 5, our method can correctly find all five con-\ncepts. When K < 5, our method selects the top K obvious\nconcepts. When K > 5, our method tries to discover some\nnew concepts from the training data.\n! = 4\n! = 5\n! = 6\nFigure 11: Sensitivity of the number of concepts K on Ima-\ngeNet Subset S1.\nVariance of inferred concepts. We provide both qualita-\ntive and quantitive results on ImageNet S1 across different\nseeds to assess the variance of inferred concepts. In Fig-\nure 12, we show that our method can reliably discover all\nobject categories in S1 across different seeds. In Table 3,\nwe compare our method with the best baseline, i.e., Textual\nInversion (CKM) on ImageNet S1.

The result is\nalso consistent with the qualitative results in Figure 12.\nDiversity of generated images. In Table 4, we measure di-\nversity in both training data and generated images by com-\nputing pairwise dot product similarity using CLIP, since\nCLIP is trained to differentiate similar and dissimilar data,\nthus allowing us to measure diversity or dissimilarity. Our\nresult shows that greater similarity in training images leads\nto less diversity in the generated images.\nA.2. Unsupervised Concept Discovery\nObject Discovery. We show qualitative comparisons be-\ntween our method and baselines for each set of ImageNet\nexperiments. We find that baselines generate repetitive con-\ncepts. For example, textual inversion (KM) discovers two\nembeddings for the class of chimpanzee, as shown in the\n3rd and 4th columns of the 1st row in Figure 15. Further-\nmore, both variants of textual inversion fail to generate cer-\ntain concepts, such as shopping cart, while our method can\ndiscover such concepts, as shown in the 1st column of the\nFigure 15. We demonstrate that such problems exist across\nall experiments in Figure 15 and Figure 16. We also train\nCOMET on ImageNet to decompose images into object cat-\negories. However, it scales poorly to more complex images,\nthus failing to decompose such images into realistic con-\ncepts as illustrated in Figure 17.\nIndoor Scene Discovery. To further verify effectiveness of\nour approach, we provide additional qualitative results of\nour method on indoor scene decomposition, specifically in\nthe kitchen setting. In Figure 18, we show both generated\nsamples (odd columns) along their cross-attention maps\n(even columns) on three major concepts, incluing kitchen\nrange, kitchen islands, and lighting effects.\nDataset\nCLIP (Training Data)\nCLIP (Generation)\nADE20K\n0.1760\n0.1701\nVan Gogh\n0.1411\n0.1259\nImageNet S1\n0.1089\n0.1188\nTable 4: Quantitative Evaluation on Image Diversity.\nArtistic Concept Discovery. Finally, we show our decom-\nposed concepts based on artistic paintings, including Van\nGogh (Figure 19), Claude Monet (Figure 20) and Pablo Pi-\ncasso (Figure 21). Our method can discover artistic con-\ncepts from few paintings. We provide names of original\npaintings on the leftmost side for easy understanding.\nConcept Discovery from hybrid modalities. We run our\nmethod on a hybrid dataset that contains images from four\nconcepts, i.e., kitchen, Geyser, Chihuahua, and Claude\nMonet paintings. As shown in Figure 13, our method can\nsuccessfully discover all four distinct concepts.\nA.3. Composing Discovered Concepts\nObject Composition. We show our method enables multi-\nobject composition in Figure 22. For example, we can gen-\nerate images that resemble \u201ca teddy bear sitting on a studio\ncouch\u201d in the 3rd row by composing two discovered classes.\nScene Composition.\nIn Figure 23, we further compose\nindoor kitchen components to generate indoor scenes that\ncontain given specifications, including combinations of\nkitchen range and lighting effects in 2nd row.\nStyle Composition. We also demonstrate compositioanl re-\nsults of decomposed concepts from artistic paintings in Fig-\nure 24. In this experiment, we either compose concepts dis-\ncovered from the same artistic (e.g., 1st row) or even com-\nbine concepts across different artists (e.g., 3rd row).\nExternal Composition. Finally, we provide additional re-\nsults of external composition, where we compose existing\nconcepts (e.g., text) with discovered concepts in Figure 25.\nWe show that we can enable style transfer by composing\ntext descriptions shown in the 1st column and discovered\nconcept in the 2nd column to generate images.\nComposition of multiple concepts. Our method can com-\npose more than 2 concepts. In Figure 14, we show the com-\nposition of 3 concepts discovered from ImageNet S1.\nB. Details of Datasets\nImageNet [8]. We use 4 sets of ImageNet class combina-\ntions, denoted as ImageNet S1, S2, S3 and S4 in our exper-\niments. Each combination consists of 5 object categories.\nS1 includes geyser, Chihuahua, chimpanzee, shopping cart\nand mosque.\nS2 includes guinea pig, warplane, castle,\nllama and volcano. S3 includes convertible, starfish, stu-\ndio couch, african elephant and teddy. S4 includes koala,\nice bear, zebra, tiger and giant panda. We randomly choose\nGeyser\nKitchen\nPoppies (Monet)\nChihuahua\nFigure 13: Qualitative results on the hybrid dataset.\nChimpanzee AND Shopping cart AND Mosque\nFigure 14: Object Composition of 3 discovered concepts.\n5 images per category for each set as our training data.\nADE20K [56]. We use images in the bedroom subcatergory\nunder the category of home or hotel for our training. Simi-\nlarly, we randomly select 25 images as our training dataset.\nC. Details of Baselines\nCOMET [11]. Most relevant to our work, COMET uses a\nset of EBMs to discover concepts in an unsupervised man-\nner. However, COMET decomposes each individual image\ninto a set of concepts, while our method decomposes a set\nof images into a set of concepts. Hence, COMET doesn\u2019t\nenable novel generation of the decomposed concepts and\nwe instead visualize decomposed components from training\nimages. For training, we use 5 components representing 5\nobject categories to train COMET using the default training\nsetting from the official codebase.\nTextual Inversion [15]. Given a set of similar images, tex-\ntual inversion optimizes a single concept c, thus assuming\na correspondence between the training data and the con-\ncept. In our experiments, however, we train an uncondi-\ntional textual inversion by optimizing one single concept\nusing all training images regardless of image classes or con-\ncepts. During inference, we generate 320 images using the\nprompt: \u201ca photo of c\u201d for evaluation.\nTextual Inversion (KM). In this paper, our goal is to dis-\ncover multiple concepts in an unsupervised way. Thus, we\nutilize unsupervised algorithms, such as K-means cluster-\ning, to obtain pseudo-labels. Before training a textual inver-\nsion model, we run K-means on the training images in pixel\nspace to obtain predicted labels, which are used to opti-\nmize corresponding concepts during training. In our exper-\niments, each ImageNet set has training images from 5 cate-\ngories, so we initialize 5 concepts for optimization. During\ninference, we sample 64 images per concept for evaluation.\nTextual Inversion (CKM). We also use another variant of\ntextual inversion and K-means clustering as our baseline. In\nthis case, we run K-means on image latent representations\nencoded by CLIP [38], thus we name it as CLIP-based K-\nmeans (i.e., CKM for brevity). Similarly, we evaluate this\nbaseline in the same way as textual inversion (KM).\nTraining Details. We train every single model with a batch\nsize of 2 and 8 gradient accumulation steps, and thus an\neffective batch size of 16 per iteration for a total number of\n3000 iterations on each dataset using a single NVIDIA A40\nGPU. Other hyper-parameters (e.g., optimizer) are the same\nas the original textual inversion codebase [15].\nD. Details of Our Approach\nTraining. To discover compositional concepts we our ap-\nproach, we initialize M (i.e., 5) words along with their ran-\ndom embeddings as our concepts in our experiments, and\na weight matrix with a shape of N \u00d7 M, where N is the\nnumber of training images. Then we utilize our method\nto optimize both weights and all M embeddings for each\ntraining image, as shown in Figure 2. Training details are\nthe same as that of baselines shown in appendix C, where\nembeddings are optimized with a batch of 16 for 3000 iter-\nations.\nInference.\nTo enable image generation of each discov-\nered concept, we sample images using each word using\nclassifier-free guidance [21]. For compositional generation,\nwe sample images using conjunction operator (i.e., AND)\nfrom composable diffusion [32].\nOurs\nTextual Inversion \n(KM)\nTextual Inversion \n(CKM)\nShopping Cart\nChihuahua\nChimpanzee\nGeyser\nMosque\nOurs\nTextual Inversion \n(KM)\nTextual Inversion \n(CKM)\nVolcano\nCastle\nLlama\nGuinea Pig\nWarplane\nFigure 15: Object Decomposition.

The factorised encoder variant\nfollows the late-fusion approach that is adopted by many state of the art approaches.\nDespite standing out for its favorable speed/accuracy tradeoffs among the different\nvariants of ViViT, its considerable training time and memory requirements still\npose a significant barrier to entry. Our method is designed to lower this barrier and\nis based on the idea of freezing the spatial transformer during training. This leads\nto a low accuracy model if naively done. But we show that by (1) appropriately\ninitializing the temporal transformer (a module responsible for processing temporal\ninformation) (2) introducing a compact adapter model connecting frozen spatial\nrepresentations ((a module that selectively focuses on regions of the input image)\nto the temporal transformer, we can enjoy the benefits of freezing the spatial\ntransformer without sacrificing accuracy. Through extensive experimentation over\n6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed training strategy significantly\nreduces training costs (by \u223c 50%) and memory consumption while maintaining or\nslightly improving performance by up to 1.79% compared to the baseline model.\nOur approach additionally unlocks the capability to utilize larger image transformer\nmodels as our spatial transformer and access more frames with the same memory\nconsumption. The advancements made in this work have the potential to propel\nresearch in the video understanding domain and provide valuable insights for\nresearchers and practitioners with limited resources, paving the way for more\nefficient and scalable alternatives in the action recognition field.\n1\nIntroduction\nAction recognition focuses on understanding and identifying actions in video sequences with applica-\ntions in surveillance, human-computer interaction, and video content analysis. The field has advanced\nsignificantly due to large-scale annotated datasets [6] and a shift from hand-crafted features [23, 41]\nto deep learning models like convolutional networks (CNNs) [34, 39, 6, 14]. Recently, transformers\nhave revolutionized computer vision by offering an alternative to traditional CNNs, leading to the\ndevelopment of many new state-of-the-art architectures [12, 4, 26]. Moreover, the flexibility of\ntransformers have inspired researchers to adapt these models to more complex problems, including\nvideo understanding and action recognition [1, 27].\nTransformers, however, are notoriously expensive, and Video Transformer-based architectures [3, 1,\n27], which integrate information across space and time are even more so. And memory consumption\n\u2217Work done as a Student Researcher at Google.\nPreprint.

Training time\nis scaled relative to setting ViViT-B training time to \u20181 unit\u2019 (7.93 hours). We see clear time saving\nusing our initialization scheme and for larger models, the training time saved is much larger.\nand training times become even more significant when working with large-scale video datasets with\nlong sequences [6]. These high computational costs present a particular challenge for researchers\nwith limited resources, especially those from universities and smaller companies. The goal of our\nwork is therefore to cut the cost of training: we want to train transformer-based video models with\nfewer resources or use larger model variants and handle more frames with the same resources.\nWe have chosen the ViViT model [1] as our baseline upon which to improve. Specifically, we focus\non the \u201cfactorized encoder\u201d variant of ViViT which has separate spatial and temporal transformer\nstages, where the spatial transformer is responsible for extracting features from individual frames,\nwhile the temporal transformer processes the temporal dynamics across frames. We choose this\nfactorized encoder design because it is more efficient compared to, e.g., the variant of ViViT using\nall-to-all spatiotemporal attention, while still achieving high accuracies and has thus been adopted as\nthe building block for recent state-of-the-art architectures on various tasks [46, 7, 43, 45, 47, 18].\nTo address the challenge of reducing training time and memory usage without compromising the\nsophistication and accuracy of the original model, our approach is based on the simple idea of freezing\nthe spatial backbone. Freezing the spatial backbone has many advantages: by not backpropagating\nthrough this transformer, training is faster and requires less memory (allowing for the model to\nhandle more frames). We also inherit the benefits of pretraining the spatial transformer on a large\ndataset (such as JFT [19]). Naively implemented, however, we show that this approach falls very\nshort in accuracy. Instead, with a few simple (but important) tweaks to the above idea, we propose a\nmethod that has the same advantages of freezing the spatial transformer, but does not compromise on\naccuracy.\nOur method proceeds in two stages. In the first stage we pretrain a cheap version of the model\nusing fewer frames, e.g., 8 frames as opposed to, e.g., 32 frames. In the second stage we fine\ntune this model with more frames, which is more expensive but in this stage we freeze the spatial\nencoder and introduce a compact \u201cadapter\u201d model connecting frozen spatial representations to the\ntemporal transformer, negating the need for end-to-end training of the spatial transformer. Critically\nthis includes pre-training the temporal transformer (by initializing from stage 1) which is often\noverlooked in current video models which typically initialize this component from scratch. However\nour experiments show that this step is critical if we wish to not sacrifice performance.\nDrawing parallels with curriculum learning [2], our methodology can also be viewed as progressively\ntraining on tasks of increasing complexity, beginning with a ViViT model pre-trained on 8 frames \u2014\nour \u201ceasy examples\u201d. As we progress, the model effectively handles larger frame counts up to 128\nframes - our \u201cdifficult examples\u201d. This approach not only sustains the intricacy of the original model\n2\nbut also significantly reduces resource demands. Thus our approach enables entities with limited\nresources to emulate high-performance models using affordable GPUs.\nWith our training recipe, we match or slightly outperform conventional training of ViViT at roughly\nhalf the cost as seen in Figure 1. A notable benefit of our training recipe, is its ability to process up\nto 80 frames on typical university-grade GPUs, a significant leap from the previous capacity of 16\nframes. This expansion in processing power broadens the range of video data manageable under\nresource-constrained settings. As we elaborate in Section 4.8, our research underscores the potential\nto democratize access to advanced video transformer models. Another notable benefit is the model\u2019s\nability to now use even larger models as the spatial transformer, we introduce ViViT-g as seen in\nSection 4.7. This accessibility paves the way for future video action recognition research, irrespective\nof resource constraints. Hereafter, we refer to our version of ViViT as SFA-ViViT, where SFA denotes\n\u2019Spatial Frozen and Adapter Initialized\u2019.\n2\nRelated Work\nTransformers for Videos\nAction recognition is a key research area in computer vision, addressed\nby many traditional [23, 41] and CNN based approaches [6, 16, 21, 25, 34, 39, 44, 15] aided by\nthe release of large-scale datasets [6, 22, 35]. Since we focus on transformer based architectures, a\nthorough review of earlier methods are out of this scope. More recently, the transformer architecture,\ninitially developed for NLP tasks [40], has been adapted for video understanding and action recogni-\ntion tasks, leading to state-of-the-art models such as TimeSformer [3], ViViT [1], VideoSwin [27],\nand Uniformer [24] These transformer-based models leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture\ncomplex spatiotemporal patterns in action recognition tasks. TimeSformer [3] is one of the first\ntransformer-based models for video understanding, adapting the transformer architecture to video\nby treating it as a sequence of flattened image patches. ViViT [1] integrates spatial and temporal\ntransformers to efficiently capture spatiotemporal information in video sequences. VideoSwin [27] is\na hierarchical transformer that applies local windowing for efficiency, enabling the model to handle\nlonger video sequences. VideoBERT [36] is a transformer model that learns joint representations of\nvideo and language in self-supervised manner, which can be fine-tuned for various video understand-\ning tasks, including action recognition. More recently, Uniformer [24] integrates 3D convolution\nand spatiotemporal self-attention, MTV [46] proposes a multi-view transformer model using dis-\ntinct encoders for each video \u201cview\u201d, improving accuracy as the number of views increases. The\nMultiscale Vision Transformers (MViT) [13] model streamlines computation and memory usage by\noperating at different resolutions, focusing on high-level features at lower resolutions and low-level\ndetails at higher ones, effectively leveraging both spatial and temporal information in visual tasks.\nTubeViT [31] introduces a method of sparsely sampling different-sized 3D segments from videos,\nfacilitating efficient joint image and video learning, and allowing the adaptation of larger models\nto videos with less computational resources. Typically these models have FLOPs in the range of\nTFLOPs and training times that last more than days on the largest of GPUs/TPUs available, making\nthem infeasible to train or use in lower resourced settings such as academia. It is critical that we\nfind a way to train these models with limited resources while maintaining their performance. To this\nend, we focus on the factorised encoder version of ViViT as the late-fusion approach followed is\nused as a foundation for state-of-the-art approaches of various tasks [46, 7, 43, 45, 47, 18] and hence\nbelieve that the initialization scheme proposed can be used for future methods working on similar\narchitectures.\nEfficient Transformers in Videos\nEfficiency is a nuanced topic [10], as there are multiple cost\nindicators of efficiency (for example, GFLOPs, inference time, training time, memory usage), and\nmodels which improve efficiency in one dimension, are not necessarily better in other dimensions [10].\nTokenLearner [33] proposes a method that adaptively learns tokens for efficient image and video\nunderstanding tasks, enabling effective modeling of pairwise attention over longer temporal horizons\nor spatial content. TokenLearner reduces the GFLOPs required by ViViT by about half, but does\nnot significantly change the training time or the inference time of ViViT. Spatial Temporal Token\nSelection (STTS) [42] proposes a dynamic token selection framework for spatial and temporal\ndimensions that ranks token importance using a lightweight scorer network, selecting top-scoring\ntokens for downstream evaluation in an end-to-end training process. STTS again reduces the GFLOPs,\nbut the training time and inference time do not change significantly. TokShift [49], a zero-parameter,\nzero-FLOPs operator that models temporal relations in transformer encoders by temporally shifting\n3\npartial token features across adjacent frames but again requires the same training time as the original\nmodel. By densely integrating TokShift into a plain 2D vision transformer, a computationally efficient,\nconvolution-free video transformer is created for video understanding. Most similar to our work is\nthe ST-Adapter [30], that utilizes built-in spatio-temporal reasoning in a compact design, allowing\npre-trained image models to reason about dynamic video content with a small per-task parameter\ncost, surpassing existing methods in both parameter-efficiency and performance. However, it does\nnot change FLOPs or inference time at all. Unlike ST-Adapter, we use a spatial only adapter which\nwe show is enough to reproduce the performance of the baseline model at close to half the training\ntime. In particular, our proposed method improves the training time and training memory usage,\naddressing the key problem of researchers and practitioners being able to train video models. It does\nnot, however, change the inference time compared to a standard ViViT model. We consider overall\ntrain time for the same hyperparameters and use the same hardware for a direct comparison. We\nconsider efficiency in this paper as the time saved in the overall training of the model.\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nRevisiting ViViT\nThe Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) extends the Vision Transformer architecture to handle video\ndata by incorporating spatio-temporal reasoning. The idea behind ViViT is to process video input\nas a sequence of image patches, combining spatial and temporal information through a series of\ntransformer layers, which include multi-head self-attention, layer normalization, and feed-forward\nnetworks. The output is used for video classification.\nIn the \u201cvanilla\u201d variant of ViViT, one extracts spatio-temporal tokens from a video then forwards all\ntokens through a transformer encoder which explicitly models all pairwise interactions between all\nspatio-temporal tokens. We build off of the more efficient \u201cFactorized Encoder\u201d variant of ViViT\nwhose architecture consists of two separate transformer encoders, a spatial transformer modeling\ninteractions between tokens from the same temporal index and a temporal transformer modeling\ninteractions between tokens from different temporal indices. Despite having more parameters, it\nrequires fewer floating point operations (FLOPs) than vanilla ViViT. Because the Factorised Encoder\nvariant strikes a good balance point between accuracy and processing speed, it has also been adopted\nas the foundation for other architectures[46, 7, 43, 45, 47, 18], reinforcing its utility and robustness.\n3.2\nOur training strategy\nWe concentrate on the factorised encoder variant of ViViT as it is already the most efficient version\nof the baseline. Henceforth, when we talk about ViViT we refer to this variant of ViViT. Consider the\nViViT model that contains a spatial transformer with parameters \u03b8spatial and a temporal transformer\nwith parameters \u03b8temporal:\nXspatial = Tspatial(Xin; \u03b8spatial)\n(1)\nXout = Ttemporal(Xspatial; \u03b8temporal).\nIn conventional ViViT training, \u03b8spatial is initialized from an image pre-trained checkpoint such as\nImageNet-21k [32] or JFT [19] and the \u03b8temporal is initialized from scratch. During backpropagation,\nthe gradient flows through the entire model. This entails training two sizable transformer models\nend-to-end, which is a highly resource-intensive process, as the transformer architecture is inherently\ncomputationally demanding, especially with more frames and larger ViViT variants (e.g., ViViT-H).\nOne approach to reducing training time is to freeze the parameters of the spatial transformer \u03b8spatial.\nBy not backpropagating through \u03b8spatial, gradient updates are faster and require less memory,\nallowing us to access more frames without encountering out-of-memory issues. But as we show in\nexperiments, the accuracy of the resulting model with frozen \u03b8spatial is not competitive (in accuracy)\nwith the baseline training approach.\nWe present a two stage approach (see Fig. 2) to training ViViT models that inherits the same benefits\nof freezing the spatial transformer, while not compromising on model quality.\n4\nFigure 2: STAGE 1: We first use the full ViViT-FE model on 8 frames by initializing the spatial\ntransformer from an image checkpoint and the temporal transformer from scratch. STAGE 2: We\nthen use this as our checkpoint to initialize the spatial and temporal transformer for models using\nmore frames (such as 32, 64 or 128). We then freeze the spatial transformer and add an adapter\nmodel to finetune spatial transformer features. The temporal transformer is finetuned from the same\ncheckpoint.\nStage 1.\nIn Stage 1, we pretrain our ViViT model on a reduced number of frames initializing the\nspatial transformer using a pre-trained image checkpoint. We do not freeze the spatial transformer\nduring this stage, but critically, Stage 1 serves to also initialize the temporal transformer.\nTo set the number of frames at this stage, we must balance the goal of efficiency (using fewer frames)\nagainst our finding in experiments that pre-training on too few frames can lead to suboptimal results.\nIn our ablations, we identify a sweet spot at 8 frames.\nStage 2.\nIn Stage 2, we fine tune our ViViT model on the full frame count (e.g. 128 frames)\ninitializing both spatial and temporal transformer parameters learned in Stage 1. Because this stage is\nsignificantly more expensive, in stage 2, we freeze the spatial transformer parameters \u03b8spatial and\nadd a lightweight adapter module with parameters \u03b8adapter following the spatial transformer:\nXspatial = Tspatial(Xin; \u03b8spatial)\nXadapter = Aadapter(Xspatial; \u03b8adapter)\n(2)\nXout = Ttemporal(Xadapter; \u03b8temporal)\nIn this setting, by backpropagating only through the temporal transformer and the lightweight adapter\nmodule (in our experiments, a two layer MLP), we effectively cut total training time by half.\nThe crucial finding here is that the spatial transformer requires only short-term context for initialization\n(after which it remains frozen), whereas the temporal transformer necessitates long-term context\nto achieve its optimal performance. Further details and empirical analysis can be found in the next\nsection.\n4\nExperimental Analysis\nThrough a series of comprehensive experiments which we now present, we investigate the significance\nof the spatial transformer, examining the impact of pre-training datasets and how larger models\naffect action recognition performance. We also explore the importance of initializing the temporal\ntransformer by employing various initialization schemes and datasets, assessing whether the number\n5\nIndex\nSpatial Frozen\nAdapter\nTemporal Frozen\nTemporal Init\nTop-1 Acc\nTop-5 Acc\nTrain Time\n-\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n64.45\n87.48\n14.17 h\nI\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n27.75\n56.73\n0.5x()\nII\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n25.80\n53.07\n0.5x()\nIII\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n38.77\n68.93\n0.53x()\nIV\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\nV MAE\n58.54\n85.83\n2.51x()\nV\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\nV iV iT \u2212 8f\n63.85\n87.62\n0.62x()\nTable 1: Ablation study results illustrating the impact of various modifications to the ViViT-B model,\nincluding spatial and temporal transformer freezing, adapter addition, and initialization methods, on\ntop-1 and top-5 accuracy. Dataset is Something-something v2.\nof frames is critical for initializing larger models, initializing full ViViT models, and initializing\nmodels on one dataset while fine-tuning on another.\n4.1\nDatasets\nWe evaluate on all the datasets considered in [1] (specifically, Kinetics-400 [6], Kinetics-600 [5],\nEPIC-Kitchens [9], Something-something v2 [17] and Moments-in-time [29]) as well as the\nSomething-Else [28] dataset. As these datasets are common in the community, we include fur-\nther details in the supplementary.\n4.2\nImplementation Details\nWe use Scenic [11] for our implementation. Since we build on ViViT, we directly work on top of the\ncodebase and stick to the default parameters used by ViViT in terms of hyperparameters. Full details\nof these can be found in supplementary.\nOur adapter is a two-layer fully connected network that takes as input the output from the spatial\ntransformer and the output from the adapter is passed as input to the temporal transformer.\nThe hyper-parameters of the transformer models are set to the standard: the number of heads are\n12/16/16/16, number of layers are 12/24/32/40, hidden sizes are 768/1024/1280/1408 and MLP\ndimensions are 3072/4096/5120/6144 for the base/large/huge/giant versions respectively. The 8-\nframe ViViT model is trained for 30 epochs. We also experiment with initializing larger models with\nan 8-frame model trained for 10 epochs. Details of this can be found in the supplementary.\nFor our hardware, we use 64 v3 TPUs for all experiments. However, we also show results using 8\nNVIDIA GeForce 2080 Ti (w/12 GB memory). This is a typical setting in a small academic lab.\n4.3\nAblation Study\nWe first address two critical aspects: the significance of fine-tuning the spatial transformer and the\nimportance of initializing the temporal transformer. To do so, we conduct a series of experiments\nin various scenarios, which are detailed below. Our analysis focuses on the Something-something\ndataset, utilizing the large version of the ViViT model, referred to as ViViT-L.\nWe examine four main elements that modify the structure of conventional ViViT training and these\nare mentioned with indices in Table 1 namely: I. The freezing of the spatial transformer (\u03b8spatial is\ninitialized and then frozen), II. The freezing of the temporal transformer (\u03b8temporal is frozen), III.\nThe addition of an adapter (lightweight module with parameters \u03b8adapter), IV. Next, we initialize the\ntemporal transformer using VideoMAE[38], while keeping the spatial transformer frozen and the\nadapter incorporated and V. The initialization of the temporal transformer (\u03b8spatial and \u03b8temporal are\ninitialized using the 8-frame version of the baseline).\nIt is important to note that the VideoMAE training is an extremely expensive process as can be seen\nin the table. But combined with the line below it, these two models, which significantly outperform\nlines I, II and III, show that properly initializing the temporal transformer is the critical issue at hand.\nAdditionally, initializing the spatial transformer yields further improvement. The adapter plays a vital\nrole in augmenting performance when the spatial transformer is frozen, and due to its lightweight\nnature, it will be an essential component of our training methodology moving forward.\n6\nFigure 3: The effect of initializing with dif-\nferent numbers of frames (JFT, 2, 4, 8, 16,\n32, and 48), freezing the spatial transformer\nand adding an adapter model and fine-tuning\nusing 64, 96, and 128 frames. Results on Ki-\nnetics400 dataset, \u2018f\u2019 refers to frames.\nFigure 4: Comparison of our initialization method\nvs conventional training of ViViT on Top-1 accu-\nracy and loss on the Kinetics-400 dataset using 64\nand 128 frames. We see that our initialization gives\na significant headstart to the models.\n4.4\nHow many frames should we use for Stage 1?\nNext we experiment with various frame counts for stage 1 training, We test seven variants: JFT [19]\ncheckpoint (image-based), 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 48-frame ViViT checkpoints. We then fine-tune\nthese with a frozen spatial transformer and add an adapter model using 64, 96, and 128 frames\n(see Figure 3). Results show that using too few frames for Stage 1 training can underperform (with\nimage-only initialization from a JFT [19] checkpoint performing the worst). Thus we deduce that\nshort term temporal context is essential for initializing the spatial transformer. Performance also\nplateaus after 8 frames, and given that using more frames increases training time, we settle on using 8\nframes as our \u201csweet spot\u201d for Stage 1 training.\nCheckpoint\nSSv2\nK400\nK400-init\n44.71/74.53\n82.81/93.98\nSSv2-init\n63.85/87.62\n76.79/92.35\nTable 2: A summary of cross-dataset initial-\nization of the proposed model and perfor-\nmance comparison.

Results\nare on Kinetics400 dataset.\n4.5\nDoes the proposed training increase convergence speed?\nAnother potential question that may arise concerns the impact of this initialization method in terms of\nconvergence speed, if any. This specific aspect holds considerable significance owing to its potential\nability to drastically curtail the duration of time required for training and the number of epochs\nnecessary to effectively train the model. Moreover, an important element to take into account is\nthe effect of freezing the spatial transformer. This approach decreases the memory needed to store\nthe model but also considerably enhances the training speed. To provide a clearer picture, we have\nplotted the validation curves with and without initialization, which can be seen in Figure 4. Note that\nwith the proposed initialization, we get a significant head start in overall accuracy.\n7\nModel\n4\n8\n16\n32\n48\n64\n96\n128\nViViT-H\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\nSFA-ViViT-H\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nViViT-g\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nSFA-ViViT-g\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nTable 4: Memory usage in different ViViT training schemes is compared using the Kinetics400\ndataset on 64 TPUs v3 with 16GB memory each. A \u2713 indicates accessible frames given hardware\nconstraints, while a \u00d7 signals an out-of-memory (OOM) error.\n4.6\nWhat about initializing on one dataset and finetuning on other?\nIn our study, we find training an 8-frame version of the standard ViViT model affordable. We\nconsider training this on a temporally dependent dataset like Something-something, then fine-tuning\non other datasets like Kinetics-400. We examine two scenarios: first, the standard ViViT model\ntrained on Kinetics-400 using 8-frames, and second, the same model trained on Something-something.\nPost-training, we freeze the spatial transformer, add an adapter, and fine-tune the models on the\nalternate dataset with more frames. We contrast this with models fine-tuned on their original datasets\n(see Table 4.4). Results favor initializing larger frame models from the 8-frame version on the same\ndataset. Thus, for the final comparison in Sec 4.9, we initialize models with 8-frame versions of the\nbaseline.\n4.7\nExtending the image backbone to 1.5B parameters\nAn intriguing consequence of our approach is the ability to incorporate larger backbones into the\nspatial transformer, made possible by the additional memory available to us as a result of freezing\nthe spatial transformer during training. Consequently, we introduce ViViT-g, which integrates the\nViT-g model (with 1.5B parameters) as its backbone. To ensure a fair comparison, we focus solely on\ntraining and inference using 48 frames, and abstain from employing multiview or multicrop testing.\nOur objective is to investigate the potential impact of a more substantial spatial transformer backbone\non the overall performance and show the potential of larger spatial backbones that are possible due to\nour training process.\nIt is essential to note that the full ViViT-g model could not process more than 8 frames due to memory\nlimitations. However, our proposed strategy allows processing up to 48 frames. A comparison of\ntop-1 and top-5 accuracies is presented in Table 4.4 along with the number of steps needed to reach the\nbest performance. Dataset used is Kinetics-400 and all the ViT checkpoints are JFT-pretrained [19].\n4.8\nComparison of Memory Usage with Standard ViViT Training and Proposed Method\nIn this study, we compare the number of frames that can be accessed using the standard ViViT\ntraining scheme against our proposed scheme, employing a set of 64 v3 TPUs that have 16 GB each.\nWe further evaluate the performance of ViViT variants, including H, and g, in comparison with the\nSFA-ViViT using the same variant configurations. Maintaining identical hyperparameters, we ensure\na local batch size of 1.\nOur findings indicate that the conventional ViViT training approach restricts frame accessibility to 96\nframes for the ViViT-H model, and a mere 8 frames for the ViViT-g model, before reaching memory\nlimitations.\nConversely, our proposed method enables access to 128 frames for ViViT-H, and up to 48 frames\nwhen utilizing ViViT-g with the same hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of utilizing\nuniversity grade GPUs by conducting ViViT experiments on an NVIDIA Tx 2080 Ti GPU farm\nequipped with 8 GPUs having 12 GB each. Under these circumstances, ViViT can only process\n16 frames using a local batch size of 1. However, our proposed training strategy enables a notable\nimprovement, expanding the frame capacity to 80 frames helping us reproduce ViViT results on lower\nend GPUs. This enhancement provides a valuable opportunity for researchers with limited resources\nto attain performance levels comparable to those with extensive resources. We show a comparison of\nnumber of frames accessible with and without our training recipe in Table 4.\n8\nModel\nKinetics-400\nKinetics-600\nMoments in Time\nAccuracy\nTrain Time\nAccuracy\nTrain Time\nAccuracy\nTrain Time\nViViT-L\n82.59/93.09\n1x(21.57 h)\n83.29/95.82\n1x(26.14 h)\n-\n-\n-\nViViT-L + SFA\n82.78/94.03\n0.56x()\n83.47/95.29\n0.56x()\n-\n-\nViViT-H\n84.21/94.66\n1x(56.71 h)\n84.18/95.68\n1x(60.45 h)\n38.17/62.84\n1x(110.79 h)\nViViT-H + SFA\n84.42/94.72\n0.57x()\n84.39/96.20\n0.57x()\n39.96/64.39\n0.59x()\nTable 5: Performance Comparison of various versions of ViViT with the proposed training strategy\nfor Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600 and Moments in Time.

We report the Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy and the overall training time.\nThe evaluation is conducted on the large and huge variants of ViViT across three datasets, namely\nKinetics400, Kinetics600, and Moments in Time (MiT), with the summarized results tabulated in\nTable 5. The findings indicate a slight enhancement in accuracy for both Kinetics400 and Kinetics600\ndatasets, whereas a notable 1.79% increase in top-1 accuracy is observed for the MiT dataset using\nthe proposed method.\nFurthermore, the proposed approach showcases a significant reduction in training time, accounting\nfor approximately 56% of the original duration. This reduction emphasizes the advantageous nature\nof the proposed approach. To calculate the total training time for the SFA version, the train time of\nthe 8 frame (Stage 1) ViViT model is combined with the train time of the (Stage 2) SFA-ViViT model.\nConversely, the total training time for the standard ViViT encompasses the total train time for the\nsame number of frames that SFA-ViViT is trained on for fair comparison.\nWe further examine the performance of ViViT-L incorporating our proposed training strategy in\ncomparison to the original version on three additional datasets: Something-something, Something-\nElse, and Epic-Kitchens. A consistent trend is observed, with the modified approach outperforming\nthe baseline model, at only a 62% cost of the baseline training time. In summary, our proposed\ntraining strategy demonstrates promising potential by yielding comparable or slightly improved\nperformance across all datasets. This is obtained while maintaining a training cost ranging from 56%\nto 62% of the original model, thus highlighting its effectiveness. Results can be seen in Table 6.\n5\nLimitations\nOur research makes considerable progress in reducing training time and memory use for video\ntransformers, but it raises certain issues. First, training smaller versions of our model on different\ndatasets is required, adding an initial step. Ideally, a universal model applicable across datasets would\nimprove efficiency. Our method depends on separate space and time encoders, a feature of the ViViT\nmodel, which might limit its use with integrated space-time models. We base our work on the ViViT\nmodel used in influential models like MTV, highlighting its importance. While we didn\u2019t test our\nmethods on models like MTV, focusing on ViViT provides beneficial implications for other models.\nWe hope this inspires future research and encourages further exploration in efficient training of video\ntransformers.\n9\n6\nConclusion\nWe have investigated the challenges posed by the substantial training time and memory consumption\nof video transformers, particularly focusing on the factorised encoder variant of the ViViT model as\nour baseline. To address these challenges, we proposed two effective strategies: utilizing a compact\nadapter model for fine-tuning image representations instead of end-to-end training of the spatial\ntransformer, and initializing the temporal transformer using the baseline model trained with 8 frames.\nOur proposed training strategy has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce training costs\nand memory consumption while maintaining, or even slightly improving, performance compared\nto the baseline model. Furthermore, we observed that with proper initialization, our baseline model\ncan achieve near-peak performance within the first 10% of training epochs. The advancements made\nin this work have the potential to propel research in the video understanding domain by enabling\naccess to more frames and the utilization of larger image models as the spatial transformer, all while\nmaintaining the same memory consumption. Our findings provide valuable insights for researchers\nand practitioners with limited resources, paving the way for more efficient and scalable alternatives in\nthe action recognition field. Future work may focus on further optimizing and refining these strategies,\nand exploring their application to other video transformer architectures and tasks in the computer\nvision domain.\nA\nViViT hyperparameters\nK400\nK600\nMIT\nEpic-Kitchens\nSSv2\nSelse\nOptimisation\nOptimiser\nSynchronous SGD\nMomentum\n0.9\nBatch size\n128\nLearning rate schedule\ncosine with linear warmup\nLinear warmup epochs\n2.5\nBase learning rate\n0.1\n0.1\n0.25\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nEpochs\n30\n30\n10\n50\n35\n35\nData augmentation\nRandom crop probability\n1.0\nRandom flip probability\n0.5\nScale jitter probability\n1.0\nMaximum scale\n1.33\nMinimum scale\n0.9\nColour jitter probability\n0.8\n0.8\n0.8\n-\n-\n-\nRand augment number of layers [8]\n-\n-\n-\n2\n2\n-\nRand augment magnitude [8]\n-\n-\n-\n15\n20\n-\nOther regularisation\nStochastic droplayer rate, pdrop [20]\n-\n-\n-\n0.2\n0.3\n-\nLabel smoothing [37]\n-\n-\n-\n0.2\n0.3\n-\nMixup [48]\n-\n-\n-\n0.1\n0.3\n-\nTable 7: The hyperparameters utilized in the experiments conducted for the primary research paper\nare detailed here.

For fair comparison we re-run SFA-ViViT using\nthe same hyperparameters as ViViT.\n10\nB\nDatasets\nAs Kinetics consists of YouTube videos which may be removed by their original creators, we note\nthe exact sizes of our dataset.\nKinetics-400 [6]: Kinetics-400 is a large-scale video dataset with 400 classes introduced by Google\u2019s\nDeepMind. It has 235693 training samples and 53744 validation and test samples. The dataset\nencompasses various categories, such as object manipulation, human-object interaction, and body\nmovements. Each class contains approximately 400 video samples, with each video lasting around\n10 seconds.\nKinetics-600 [5]: Kinetics-600 is an extension of the Kinetics-400 dataset, with an increased number\nof classes, totaling 600 human action classes. This dataset contains approximately 380735 training\nsamples and 56192 validation and test samples. The additional classes broaden the scope of the\ndataset, thereby providing more diverse training data for video recognition tasks.\nEPIC Kitchens [9]: EPIC Kitchens is a large-scale dataset focusing on egocentric (first-person) videos\nof daily kitchen activities. It consists of 55 hours of video captured by 32 different participants in their\nown kitchens, with 67217 training samples and 22758 samples for validation and testing. The dataset\nincludes 97 verb classes and 300 noun classes. Epic Kitchens is particularly useful for understanding\nhuman-object interactions and fine-grained actions in everyday settings.\nSomething-something v2 [17]: The Something-something v2 dataset is a collection of short video\nclips focused on common objects and human actions. It contains around 168913 training clips and\n24777 test clips distributed across 174 action classes. This dataset aims to capture more abstract and\nhigh-level understanding of actions, as well as temporal relationships among objects.\nMoments in Time [29]: The Moments in Time dataset is a large-scale video dataset containing one\nmillion short video clips, each lasting three seconds. It covers 339 classes of dynamic events and aims\nto provide a diverse set of visual and auditory representations of these events with 791297 training\nsamples and 33900 test samples. This dataset is particularly useful for understanding the temporal\naspects of various activities and events, as well as their associated contexts.\nSomething-else [28]: Something-Else utilizes the videos from SomethingSomething-V2 as its founda-\ntion, and introduces novel training and testing partitions for two new tasks that examine the ability to\ngeneralize: compositional action recognition and few-shot action recognition. Our attention is solely\non the compositional action recognition task, which aims to prevent any object category overlap\nbetween the 54919 training videos and the 57876 validation videos.\nC\nHow important is the pre-training image dataset for action recognition\nperformance?\nWhile we know from the original ViViT paper [1] that using larger ViT [12] backbones result in\nbetter performances, we do a more thorough ablation here by considering variations of the ViT\nmodel such as the hybrid ViT (ResNet-ViT-L pre-trained on ImageNet21k [32]), ViT-L pre-trained\non ImageNet21k, ViT-L pre-trained on JFT and ViT-H pre-trained on JFT. We report these results\nin Table 8, with the conclusion of larger backbones pre-trained on larger datasets yields highest\naccuracies. We report top-1 and top-5 accuracies on the Kinetics-400 dataset and we freeze the spatial\ntransformer here without any fine-tuning or adapter. We also keep the temporal transformer fixed in\nsize here for fair comparison. Essentially, the performance difference is purely from the output of the\nspatial transformer changing due to different backbones.\nD\nCurriculum Training\nWe consider variants of the \u201ccurriculum\" training we talk about in the paper. There are various forms\nthat we can consider. For instance, we can train the standard ViViT 8 frame model for just 10 epochs\nand use that to initialize our model. In the paper all initializations are done using 8 frame model\ntrained for 30 epochs. Further, we could initialize smaller versions of SFA-ViViT like a 32 frame\nversion for 10 epochs and then initialize SFA-ViViT 128 frames using this 32 frame version. We\nplot this in Figure 5 and see various versions and conclude that in the end, the best speed-accuracy\n11\nBackbone\n16-frames\n32-frames\n48-frames\nResNet-ViT-L (ImageNet21k)\n66.09/88.30\n66.63/88.50\n66.88/88.65\nViT-L (ImageNet21k)\n65.59/85.86\n68.34/87.80\n70.09/88.91\nViT-L (JFT)\n69.76/88.41\n73.98/90.88\n75.08/91.69\nViT-H (JFT)\n73.68/90.23\n75.85/91.53\n77.90/92.72\nTable 8: Comparison of impact of different backbones for the spatial transformer.

All results are using Kinetics-400 dataset and using ViViT-L variants.\ntrade-off was obtained when the standard ViViT 8 frame model was trained on 30 epochs and then\nthe 128 frame model is initialized using this.\nWe define the models in the figure as follows:\n\u2022 Model A: ViViT-L-8f for 10 epochs + SFA-ViViT-L-32f for 10 epochs + SFA-ViViT-L-128f\nfor 10 epochs\n\u2022 Model B: ViViT-L-8f for 10 epochs + SFA-ViViT-L-128f for 20 epochs\n\u2022 Model C: ViViT-L-8f for 10 epochs + SFA-ViViT-L-128f for 30 epochs\n\u2022 Model D: ViViT-L-8f for 30 epochs + SFA-ViViT-L-128f for 30 epochs\n\u2022 Model E: ViViT-L-128f for 30 epochs\nWe see that training the ViViT-L-8f model for the full 30 epochs and then using that to initialize\nthe SFA-ViViT-L-128f model gave us the best results. But we could potentially reduce the cost of\ntraining to 0.25x if we sacrifice 2% accuracy.

We see the benefit of initialization\nas the \u201cnear-peak\" performance is reached at a much earlier stage when initialized with the 8f variant.\nAll results are on Kinetics400 dataset.\nE\nHow long do we need to train the model?\nWe showed in the paper that using SFA based initialization helps us reach \u201cnear-peak\u201d performance\nreally quickly. We define this near-peak performance as 1 % less than the eventual best performance\nof the model. Thus another natural question is: in order to save time, why not stop training the SFA\nversion earlier? We note that although the standard ViViT model trains for \u2018x\u2019 epochs (see Table. 7 for\nexact number), it often reaches this \u201cpeak\u201d performance much earlier and hence for fair comparison\nwith the standard ViViT model, in the paper, we run on the same number of epochs. These results\ncan be seen in Table 9.\nF\nWhat about initializing standard ViViT models?\nSince our method proposes an initialization scheme, we also test it on the standard ViViT models\nthat do not have their spatial transformer frozen. In this particular scenario, we only want to check if\nthe peak performance can be reached faster. However, it is important to note that with our proposed\ntraining scheme we also reduce the overall training time by close to half. This can be seen in Table 10.\nReferences\n[1] A. Arnab, M.

Creating the layouts manually requires\nadditional effort and can be tedious. Therefore, we explore\nusing large language models (LLM) to produce these lay-\nouts for our method. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthe DrawBench, HRS, and TIFA benchmarks to evaluate our\nproposed method. We show that our proposed attention re-\nfocusing effectively improves the controllability of existing\napproaches.\n1. Introduction\nDespite the unprecedented zero-shot capacity and photore-\nalism achieved by the recent progress in text-to-image syn-\nthesis [3, 25, 41\u201343, 45, 59], existing models still struggle\nwith text prompts containing multiple objects and attributes\nwith complex spatial relationships among them [2, 9, 10,\n13, 56]. Some objects, attributes, and spatial compositions\nspecified in the text prompts are often mixed, swapped, or\neven completely missing in the synthesized image.\nOur\nwork aims to mitigate this problem by grounding the text-\nto-image synthesis using explicit spatial layouts without ex-\ntra training.\nThe deep level of language understanding exhibited by\nthe text-to-image models can be attributed to using pre-\ntrained language models [39] as the text encoder [45]. The\ncomputed text embeddings are processed using the cross-\nattention layers in the denoising models [35, 36]. Upon\ncareful analysis of the failure examples generated by Sta-\nble Diffusion [43], we identify a potential cause of the fail-\nure above in the attention layers [52], where the pixels with\nsimilar features produce similar attention queries and con-\nsequently attend to a similar set of regions or tokens. The\ninformation of these pixels is thus mixed through these at-\ntention layers. Note that such pixels can come from two dif-\nferent objects with similar features. For example, given the\nprompt \u201cA dog on the right of a cat\u201d, a pixel associated with\nthe token \u201cdog\u201d could have similar features to the pixels in\nthe \u201ccat\u201d region. As a result, the model could incorrectly\nattend to the \u201ccat\u201d token through the cross-attention layers\nor the \u201ccat\u201d region through self-attention layers, causing the\nmissing object or blended attribute issues.\nPrevious studies propose to mitigate this issue by manip-\nulating the cross-attention maps during the sampling pro-\ncess [9, 10, 13]. However, they overlook a similar issue\nin self-attention layers, where distinguishing between pix-\nels of the same object and those of different objects with\nsimilar features becomes a challenge. To this end, we lever-\nage explicit layout representations for grounded synthesis\nfollowing the previous works [10, 29].\nIn this paper, we propose two novel losses based on the\ninput layout during the sampling process to refocus the at-\ntention in both self- and cross-attention layers. Our anal-\nysis shows that with our losses the attention can be effec-\ntively refocused to the desired region instead of similar but\nirrelevant regions. We also explore using LLMs to generate\nexplicit layout representations. We demonstrate that these\nmodels have strong spatial reasoning capabilities and can\npredict the plausible layout of the objects when using our\ndesigned prompts with in-context learning. We will release\ncode and data in the future.\nWe show that when combining the bounding boxes gen-\nerated by GPT4 [37] and our attention-refocusing losses,\nour method significantly and consistently improves over\nseveral strong baselines on the DrawBench [45], HRS\nbenchmarks [2], and TIFA benchmark [23]. Our main con-\ntributions are summarized below:\n\u2022 We propose attention-refocusing losses to regularize both\ncross- and self-attention layers during the sampling to im-\nprove the controllability given the layout and text prompt;\n\u2022 We explore using LLMs to generate layouts given text\nprompts, allowing the exploitation of the up-to-date\nLLMs with trained text-to-image models;\n\u2022 We conduct a comprehensive experiment on existing\nmethods of grounded text-to-image generation and show\nthat our method compares favorably against the state-of-\nthe-art models.\n2. Related work\nLarge-scale text-to-image models High-resolution text-\nto-image synthesis has been dramatically advanced by the\ndevelopment of large-scale text-to-image models [3, 15, 25,\n41, 43, 45, 59]. Such rapid progress can be attributed to sev-\neral critical techniques. First, the availability of large-scale\ntext-image datasets [7, 47] makes it possible to train data-\nhungry models on a massive volume of samples from di-\nverse resources. The development of the scalable model ar-\nchitectures, including GANs [25, 46], autoregressive mod-\nels [8, 12, 41, 59], and diffusion models [3, 21, 35, 42, 45],\ntogether with various training and inference techniques [20\u2013\n22, 48]. Our work focuses on the problem of improving the\ncontrollability of the generated images with respect to the\ninput text with large-scale diffusion models.\nImproving the controllability of text-to-image models\nEnhancing the user control of large-scale text-to-image\nmodels has drawn great attention recently. Previous work\nproposes to boost the controllability through various input\nformats such as rich text [16], personal images [27, 44],\nedge maps, segmentation masks, depth maps\n[60], and\nbounding boxes [1, 5, 29]. There are also works focus-\ning on strengthing the controllability of the original input\ntext, motivated by the observation that existing models of-\nten fail to fulfill the description from the input text ac-\ncurately [2, 9, 13, 38]. For example, when multiple ob-\njects and attributes occur in the text prompt, some are of-\nten missing or mixed in the synthesized images [9, 13].\nAttend-and-Excite [9] proposes optimizing cross-attention\nmaps during sampling to ensure all the tokens are attended\n2\n')*!\n\u2026\n'+\n(')\nPredicted noise )\"\n\u211256 = \u2211'(1 \u2013 max(9'\nG,56))\n\u2112/6 = \u2211' max(1 \u2212 9'\nG,/6))\n\u2112$%& = \u211256 + \u2112/6\nAttend more inside the box\nAttend less outside the box\n1 \u2013 Mask(!\")\n.\n2(\n),-.\n\u2112,%& =  \u22114 \u2211-\u2208/( \u2112-\nAttend less outside the box\nAttention-Refocusing \n\u2026\n\u2026\nPredicted noise )\"\n')\n'+\n')*!\nDDPM process\nAdding Attention-Refocusing\nSelf-Attention Loss\nMask (!\")\nH\"\n)\nH\"\n),/.\n1 \u2013 Mask(!\")\nH\"\n),-.\n.\nCross-Attention \nmap of horse (i=2)\nhorse\n\u2112/4 =\nSelf-Attention map of \npixel p inside box B2 (i=2)\n2()\nLo\n!\"\n!\"\n.\n\u2112- = Average(:-\nG, /6)\n')\nx\nQ\nK (from text)\nAt\nx\nh x w x d\nn x e\nh x w\nh x w x d\nh x w x d\nh x w x d\nh x w x d\nn\nQ\nK\nh x w\nh x w\nSt\n')\nCross-attention\nSelf-attention\nAttention maps\n*#\n\"\nhorse (i=2)\ndog (i=8)\n*$\n\"\nTokens of  \ninterest\nCross-Attention Loss\n\u201cA horse on the \nleft of a dog\u201d\nLayout\nhorse\n!\"\n!,\n\u201cA  horse on the \nleft of a dog\u201d\nhorse\n!\"\n!,\nLayout\n\u22080\nGrounded text\nGrounded text\nNoise predictor\nNoise predictor\n\u22080\nNoise predictor\n')\nAttention-\nRefocusing \n.\u2207+!(\u2112,-. + \u2112/-.)\nAttention \nmaps\n\u22080\n\u2026\nFigure 2. The proposed Attention-Refocusing framework. At each denoising step, we update the noised sample by optimizing our\nLCAR and LSAR losses (red block) before denoising with the predicted noise (yellow block). For each cross-attention map, LCAR is\ndesigned to encourage a region to attend more to the corresponding token while discouraging the remaining region from attending to that\ntoken. For each self-attention map, LSAR prevents the pixels in a region from attending to irrelevant regions (LCAR and LSAR in blue\nblocks).\nto. Several studies finetune the existing models with hu-\nman feedback [28, 55] or use improved language mod-\nels [33, 38, 51, 58, 61] to enhance the text-image alignment.\nSimilar to these recent efforts, our work also focuses on im-\nproving the alignment between the generated images and\ninput texts. However, we leverage an intermediate spatial\nlayout generated by LLMs [37, 39, 40, 51] and ground the\nimage synthesis on the layout.\nLayout-conditioned text-to-image synthesis. Several ap-\nproaches have been developed to extend the Stable Diffu-\nsion [43] to condition its generation on the layouts through\nfinetuning on layout-image pairs [1, 29, 35, 60] or modify-\ning the sampling process [3\u20135, 10]. For example, GLIGEN\n[29] finetunes a gated self-attention layer to incorporate\nthe box information from the input to the Stable Diffusion\nmodel. Mixture-of-Diffusion [24] and MultiDiffusion [27]\nperform a denoising process on each region and fuse the\npredicted scores. Others, including SD-Pww [3], layout-\npredictor [54], direct-diffusion [34] Layout-guidance [10],\nand BoxDiff [57], directly optimize the cross-attention lay-\ners during the sampling process. However, our approach not\nonly optimizes cross-attention maps but also self-attention\nmaps, which is not commonly addressed by these methods.\nUnlike the optimization of multiple values in these methods,\nwhich can lead to image quality degradation, our method\niteratively optimize peak values in the attention maps, pre-\nserving image quality. Universal guidance [4] leverages a\ntrained object detector and constructs a loss to force the gen-\nerated images to match location guidance. DenseDiffusion\n[26] directly modifies all attention maps based on mask\nguidance without any optimization steps. Differing from\nDenseDiffusion, our method optimizes the latent space, in-\ndirectly influencing attention maps under mask guidance.\nOur approach yields improvements demonstrated in our ex-\nperiments.\nOur proposed method to ground the text-to-\nimage generation on the layout uses both cross-attention\nand self-attention layers without needing extra training or\nadditional models.

Similar to ours, the concurrent work\nLLM-grounded Diffusion [30] uses GPT-4 as a layout gen-\nerator. Their extended work, LDM [31], produces dynamic\nscene layouts rather than single layouts, guiding a diffusion\nmodel for video generation. Another concurrent work, Lay-\noutGPT [14], leverages GPT to create layouts from text\nconditions, then uses GLIGEN\n[29] to generate images\nfrom the created layouts. Cho et al. [11] finetune an open-\nsource language model for the specific text-to-layout task\nand use standard layout-to-image models for image genera-\ntion. However, as demonstrated in the experimental results,\nexisting grounded text-to-image models still fail to fulfill\nthe details in the text prompts, like quantity, identity, and\nattributes. Our work further improves the controllability us-\ning attention-based guidance.\n3. Method\nIn this section, we discuss our method for grounded text-to-\nimage generation. Our approach includes two main phases,\nas shown in Fig. 3: 1) text-to-layout and 2) grounded text-\nto-image. In both phases, we use off-the-shelf pretrained\nmodels without any extra training. We exploit the spatial\nunderstanding ability in the latest large language models\n(LLMs) to produce visual representations such as bounding\nboxes as the layout given a text prompt.\n3.1. Preliminaries\nText-to-image diffusion models.\nThe key to the text-\nto-image diffusion model is the iterative denoising process.\nA UNet model is trained to progressively denoise the ran-\ndom Gaussian noise by computing the score \u03f5t = U(xt; c),\nwhere t is the time step and c is the embedding for condi-\ntional information. Next, we briefly describe the two types\nof attention layers used in our method.\nCross-attention layer.\nText-to-image diffusion mod-\nels condition its generation on the text prompt via cross-\nattention layers.\nSpecifically, a pretrained CLIP en-\ncoder [39] is often used to encode the text prompt w =\n(w1, w2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wn) and obtain the text embeddings c\n=\nfCLIP(w) \u2208 Rn\u00d7e, where e is the embedding dimension.\nThe key K \u2208 Rn\u00d7d and value V \u2208 Rn\u00d7d are obtained from\ntext embedding c with a linear mapping (d is the feature di-\nmension). As shown in the third row of the Fig. 2, given a\nset of queries Q \u2208 Rhw\u00d7d computed from the features map\nof size h \u00d7 w, the cross-attention map At at the step t is\ncomputed as:\nAt = softmax\n\u0012QK\u22a4\n\u221a\nd\n\u0013\n\u2208 [0, 1]hw\u00d7n,\n(1)\nwhich is formed by n attention maps {At\n1, ..., At\nn}, where\nAt\ni \u2208 [0, 1]h\u00d7w denotes the strength of association between\na word token wi and each spatial location in the feature map.\nSelf-attention layer. It is used to facilitate the use of global\ninformation. It propagates the feature at each spatial lo-\ncation to a similar region in the feature map of resolution\nh \u00d7 w. With all key-value-query obtained from the same\nfeature map through linear mappings and Eq. (1), the self-\nattention map is denoted as St \u2208 [0, 1]hw\u00d7hw. Similarly,\nwe use St\np \u2208 [0, 1]h\u00d7w to denote the self-attention map of\nall pixels attending to pixel p.\n3.2. Grounded text-to-image generation\nWe now introduce two losses on the attention layers to im-\nprove the controllability of the layout-conditioned image\nsynthesis. We consider spatial layouts defined by k bound-\ning boxes B \u2208 (Z+)k\u00d74. Each box is associated with a\nbox caption describing the content inside the box. Given\nthe captions associated with every box, we denote their in-\ndices in the input text prompt w as I = {i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iq} (q is the\nnumber of those tokens of interest). Note that each token\nindex i can relate to one or more bounding boxes Bi. Let\nMask(Bi) be the binary mask generated from the boxes Bi,\nwhere the regions inside the boxes are one, and the rest are\nzero, as shown in the fourth row of Fig. 2.\n3.2.1\nCross-Attention Refocusing (CAR)\nWhen generating images using GLIGEN, given the text\nprompt \u201cthree parrots\u201d, we notice in the cross-attention\nlayer that the token \u201cparrot\u201c incorrectly attends to the un-\nrelated regions, as visualized in Fig. 4a, leading to four par-\nrots generated in the result. To this end, we propose a loss\nto refocus the cross-attention of these tokens according to\nthe layout.\nPost-processing cross-attention maps. First, we skip the\nattention maps of < sot > token, then use Softmax for\nthe remaining cross-attention maps. After that, we apply\nGaussian Smoothing to the attention maps following [9].\nDesigning cross-attention refocusing loss.\nTo encour-\nage the generated objects to present in corresponding boxes,\n4\nCross-attention\nGrounded text\ndog \ndog \nSynthesized image\nWithout CAR\nWith CAR\nparrot\nparrot\n\u201cThree colorful \nparrots perching on \ncherry blossom tree \nbranch\u201d\nparrot\nparrot\nparrot\n(a)\n\u201cA car on the left of \na chair\u201d\nSelf-attention\nhorse\ndog \nSynthesized image\nWithout SAR\nWith SAR\ncar\ncar \nchair\nchair\nG\ncar\nchair\n(b)\nFigure 4. (a) Cross-Attention-Refocusing (CAR) visualization. Without CAR, the token \u201dparrot\u201d attends to background regions. Using\nCAR calibrates the cross-attention map to attend to the correct regions. (b) Self-Attention-Refocusing (SAR) visualization. The dots in\neach box represent the pixel query of the self-attention map. Applying SAR loss helps refocus the self-attention layer to attend less to the\nincorrect regions.\nwe aim to boost the scores of masked attention map At\ni \u00b7\nMask(Bi):\nLF G = 1\nq\nX\ni\u2208I\n(1 \u2212 max(At\ni \u00b7 Mask(Bi)))\n(2)\nWe also propose a background loss to discourage the to-\nkens from being attended by the irrelevant regions:\nLBG = 1\nq\nX\ni\u2208I\nmax(At\ni \u00b7 (1 \u2212 Mask(Bi)))\n(3)\nThe overall CAR loss is then defined as LCAR = LF G+\nLBG. As shown in Fig. 4a, when applying with our loss,\nthe model effectively mitigates the incorrect attention to the\ngrounded tokens and synthesizes three parrots as desired.\nAdopting CAR loss for segmentation mask can be found\nin Appendix Sec. 10\n3.2.2\nSelf-Attention Refocusing (SAR)\nSimilar to the observation in the cross-attention layers, as\nshown in Fig. 4b, the pixels of one region (e.g., \u201ccar\u201d) may\nattend outside of the region to similar regions (e.g., \u201cchair\u201d)\nin self-attention layers. As a result, the attributes of the two\nregions get mixed in the generation. To this end, we develop\na loss to help self-attention refocus to the correct regions.\nRecall that St\np is the self-attention map of pixel p. For\neach pixel p \u2208 Bi, we denote St,BG\np\nas the background\nregion of the self-attention map:\nSt,BG\np\n= St\np \u00b7 (1 \u2212 Mask(Bi))\n(4)\nWe aim to ensure each pixel p \u2208 Bi attends less to the\nregions outside the boxes Bi. To achieve this, we define\nself-attention loss for each pixel p as follows:\nLp =\nP(St,BG\np\n)\nP(1 \u2212 Mask(Bi))\n(5)\nThe overall self-attention loss is defined as follows:\nLSAR = 1\nq\nX\ni\u2208I\nX\np\u2208Bi\nLp\n(6)\nAs shown in Fig. 4b, using self-attention loss helps each\nbox to focus less on the irrelevant regions, and the model\nconsequently generates distinct attributes for each region.\n3.2.3\nSampling with the attention-refocusing losses\nWith the CAR and SAR losses, we modify the noised sam-\nple xt at each denoising step to minimize the loss using gra-\ndient descent. We show the update process in Fig. 2:\n\u02c6xt \u2190 xt \u2212 \u03b1\u2207xt (LCAR + LSAR) ,\n(7)\nwhere \u03b1 is the step size that controls the influence of the\noptimization in the denoising process. However, a single\nupdate step is often insufficient to refine the cross-attention\nand self-attention maps. We thus update \u03c4 times every early\ndenoising step. After finishing the \u03c4 updates, we feed the\noutput to the diffusion UNet to resume the denoising pro-\ncess and compute xt\u22121. Intuitively, we use the gradient de-\nrived from attention-refocusing losses to guide the denois-\ning process. More details about \u03c4 setting and algorithm can\nbe found in the Appendix Sec. 8.\n3.3. Text-to-layout prediction\nGenerating an image from text requires strong text com-\nprehension and reasoning capacity.\nThe limited power\nof text encoders could be another reason existing meth-\nods fail. However, once a text-to-image model is trained\nwith a specific language model, upgrading the text en-\ncoder without additional (costly) training becomes non-\ntrivial. Such schema could hinder the existing text-to-image\nmodels from benefiting from recent large language models\n(LLMs) breakthroughs. Given this challenge, we explore\ndirectly using LLMs to generate intermediate visual presen-\ntations such as box layouts.\n5\nMethod\nCAR\n& SAR\nCounting\nCompositions\nF1 \u2191\nSpatial \u2191\nSize \u2191\nColor \u2191\nStable Diffusion\n[43]\n\u00d7\n58.31\n8.48\n9.18\n12.61\n\u2713\n60.62 (+2.3)\n24.45 (+16.0)\n16.97 (+7.7)\n23.54 (+10.9)\nAttend-and-excite\n[9]\n\u00d7\n60.47\n9.98\n10.58\n19.56\n\u2713\n62.71 (+2.2)\n20.76 (+10.8)\n14.17 (+3.6)\n20.83 (+1.3)\nLayout-guidance\n[10]\n\u00d7\n56.22\n16.47\n12.38\n14.39\n\u2713\n63.01 (+6.8)\n25.84 (+9.4)\n15.56 (+3.2)\n21.50 (+7.1)\nMultiDiffusion\n[5]\n\u00d7\n55.18\n14.27\n10.58\n17.15\n\u2713\n57.37 (+2.19) 22.65 (+8.2)\n10.78 (+0.2)\n24.59 (+7.3)\nGLIGEN [29]\n\u00d7\n66.58\n30.74\n26.75\n18.78\n\u2713\n67.54 (+0.7)\n40.22 (+9.5)\n27.74 (+1.0)\n26.32 (+7.5)\nTable 1.

FID ( \u2193) in Stable Diffusion and GLIGEN with and with-\nout CAR & SAR in COCO 2014 [32]\nWe exploit GPT-4 [37], the state-of-the-art large lan-\nguage model that can understand the number and spatial\ncompositions of objects in our experiments. Specifically,\ngiven the input text for image generation, we create a new\nprompt to request GPT-4 to generate box coordinates and\nthe label of objects in each box. We outline the details of\nthis in-context learning in the Appendix Sec. 9\n4. Experiments\nWe evaluate our methods on several benchmarks, conduct\nablation experiments on each component.\n4.1. Experiment setup\nDataset.\nFor text-to-image tasks, we utilize the bench-\nmark HRS [2] and Drawbench [45] to evaluate the text-\nto-image generation performance on various categories, in-\ncluding counting, spatial, color, and size compositions. To\nfurther assess the alignment of the generated image and\ninput text, we use TIFA\n[23] benchmark.\nThe HRS\ndataset contains various prompts divided into three main\ncategories: 1) accuracy, 2) robustness, and 3) generaliza-\ntion. Our method focuses on accuracy improvement, in-\ncluding four main categories: spatial relationship, color,\nsize, and counting. Each prompt in the dataset is tagged\nwith the object\u2019s name and corresponding labels intended\nfor evaluation. For example, in spatial relationships, the la-\nbels include objects and their relative positions, such as \u201con\nthe left\u201d or \u201con the right\u201d. The prompts for each category\ncounting/spatial/size/color are 3, 000/1, 002/501/501. De-\npending on the number of objects and their relationship, we\nlabel the difficulty level of each prompt as easy, medium,\nand hard with roughly the same amount. The DrawBench\ndataset consists of 39 prompts about Counting and Po-\nsitional (or spatial relationship).\nSince there are no la-\nbels for this benchmark, we manually create the label for\neach prompt based on the number of objects mentioned and\ntheir relationships. The TIFA benchmark contains 4, 000\nprompts in various categories (counting, spatial, food, loca-\ntions, etc...) and the questions for each prompt, along with\ntheir answers.\nFor quality evaluation, we utilize the COCO2014 [32]\nvalidation dataset to assess images generated from textual\ndescriptions and corresponding bounding boxes.\nOur mask-and-text-to-image evaluation utilizes the\ndataset provided by DenseDiffusion [26], which includes\nabout 250 binary masks with corresponding labels and cap-\ntions, allowing us to evaluate our method\u2019s capability in ad-\nhering to the provided mask guidances.\nEvaluation metrics.\nRegarding text-to-image evaluation,\nwe follow the protocol in HRS [2] to compute the metrics\non individual categories. In counting, the number of objects\ndetected in generated images is compared to the ground\ntruths in text prompts to calculate the precision, recall, and\nF1 score. We use accuracy as the evaluation metric for spa-\ntial, size, and color categories. False positive samples hap-\npen when the number of generated objects is smaller than\nthe ground truths. In contrast, the false negative objects are\ncounted for the missing objects in the synthesized images.\nFor other categories, we use accuracy as the evaluation met-\nric. Depending on the category, the image is counted as a\ncorrect prediction when all detected objects are correct, ei-\nther for spatial relationships, color, or size. For TIFA bench-\nmark, we assess the alignment between the generated im-\nages and input texts using the TIFA score [23].\n6\nLayout\nWithout ours\nWith ours\nA marble statue of a \nKoala wearing a \ncowboy hat on the left \nof a turntable statue\nFour colorful \nEaster eggs on \nthe grass\nA pikachu sitting \non a basket of \nmacaron\nA fox and a rabbit\nhaving tea together, \ndigital art, realistic \npainting\nA bear and a deer\nplaying chess, digital \npainting, concept art\n[43]\n[9]\n[5]\n[10]\n[29]\nFigure 5.

We randomly choose 5k captions and correspond-\ning images from this benchmark to calculate the FID. We\nuse this evaluation to validate that our generation results re-\nmain natural compared to the base model.\nFor mask guidance evaluation, we measure the align-\nment with IoU used in DenseDiffusion [26], assess the tex-\ntual similarity with CLIP Score [17], and ensure the object\npresence using the SOA-I score [19] using YOLOv7 [53]\nfor object detection.\nImplementation details.\nIn terms of bounding boxes\nguidance, we evaluate our method by plugging it into\nvarious open-source text-to-image models and methods,\nincluding Stable Diffusion (SD) V-1.4 [43], Attend-and-\nexcite [9], Layout-guidance [10], MultiDiffusion [27], and\nGLIGEN [29]. For mask guidance, we integrate our losses\nto Stable diffusion\n[43] and compare with other free-\ntraining methods: DenseDiffusion [26] and Pww [3]. All\nthe mentioned methods are configured as default settings.\nMore implementation details are in the Appendix Sec. 8\n4.2. Quantitative results\nWe show the results on the HRS benchmark [2] in Table 1.\nUsing our losses consistently enhances F1 scores in count-\ning by an average of 2%, with Layout-guidance [10] mod-\nels showing a notable 7% improvement. Spatial accuracy\ngains an average of 10% with our losses. Our method boosts\naccuracy by up to 10.9% in the size and color categories.\nSpecifically, GLIGEN [43] sees an increase in spatial and\ncolor accuracy by around 10% and 8%, respectively.

This is reflected in\nthe overall TIFA score improvements.\nMoreover, our attention-refocusing losses improve tex-\ntual alignment in models like Stable Diffusion and GLIGEN\nwithout affecting image quality, maintaining FID scores\ncompatible with the originals.\nFor mask guidance evaluation, we report the quantitative\nevaluation in Table 3.

In contrast, in-\ntegrating our attention-refocusing losses with GLIGEN en-\nhances alignment and color accuracy. The results of our\napproach underscore our method\u2019s effectiveness in creating\nnovel spatial configurations and attributes. More results can\nbe found in Appendix Fig. 19 (comparing with four base-\nlines), and Sec. 12 (comparing with GLIGEN)\nAdditionally, as shown in Fig. 7, our CAR and SAR\nlosses can adapt to segmentation mask guidance, refining\nControlNet\u2019s output by reducing attribute mixing and avoid-\ning generating additional and irrelevant objects.\n4.4. Ablation studies\nWe ablate the two losses using GLIGEN [29] as the base-\nline method in Fig. 6. GLIGEN sometimes struggles with\nprompts with multiple objects, especially objects in the\nsame category or size. CAR loss can mitigate this prob-\nlem, but the generated objects still have attributes blended\nfrom others. For instance, with only CAR loss, a generated\ncar might have a mixed chair feature and vice versa. Incor-\nporating CAR and SAR losses further mitigates the attribute\nblending problem.\nWe further perform quantitative evaluation in Table 5 for\nall categories in the HRS benchmark. Adding CAR or SAR\nloss to the GLIGEN model improves the baseline in all four\ncategories. Particularly in spatial relationships, using SAR\nor SAR can improve GLIGEN by approximately 6%. When\nusing both losses, we can achieve an around 10% accuracy\nimprovement.\n4.5. Large language model evaluation\nWe examine the latest large language models, GPT-4 [37]\nGPT-3 [6], Llama 1 [49] and Llama 2 [50] (version 13b-\nchat) by evaluating their ability to comprehend the visual\nconcept. We randomly chose 200 prompts from four cate-\ngories in the HRS benchmark and report three metrics:\n\u2022 Format: whether or not the model returns the correct for-\nmat of grounded information, including four coordinates\nfor each box along with its label.\n\u2022 Validness:\nall generated boxes are satisfied with the\nsize and box constraints, eg.\nthe coordinate box is\n{x1, y1, x2, y2} then 512 \u2265 x1, x2, y1, y2 \u2265 0, x1 \u2264 x2\nand y1 \u2264 y2,\n\u2022 Correctness: the generated grounding information should\nfollow the text prompts. For example, in terms of count-\ning, the quantity of generated boxes should match the\nnumber of objects mentioned in the input prompt. In spa-\ntial and size categories, we asses the relations and relative\nsize of generated boxes.

Instructing text-to-image by chatGPT\nWe also propose a novel capability enabled by our frame-\nwork, where users can utilize chatGPT to instruct text-to-\nimage. In other words, after generating the initial layout and\nimage, we instruct chatGPT to modify the layout, leading to\nan updated image. This iterative capability allows users to\nsynthesize desired images through consecutive adjustments.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, a user wants to generate a Halloween-\nthemed image. Initially, the user generates a cat and adds\nanother cat to its right. Unsatisfied with this, they replace\nthe second cat with a Halloween pumpkin. They continue\nto add a witch hat on the pumpkin, a cloak for the cat, and\na mini ghost in the background for a playful touch. Such\nlanguage-based refinement ability is difficult for traditional\ntext-to-image models to offer.\n5. Limitation\nThe Fig. 11 illustrates failure cases where our framework\nstruggles. When dealing with prompts describing a large\nnumber of objects, GPT-4 occasionally produces an incor-\nrect count or generates small boxes. Additionally, there are\ninstances where GPT-4 accurately generates the layout, yet\nAn Owl riding a bicycle with the moon in the background, studio lighting, quality \nphotography by Wes Anderson, trending on art station\nAnthro furry humanoid racoon, military uniform, holding a machinegun and sitting on the \ntank, character concept design, painting, ruined city background\nLayout\nfrom GPT\nGLIGEN + Ours\nStable\nDiffusion [43]\nFigure 10.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attention-refocusing ap-\nproach to improve the alignment of cross- and self-attention\nlayers given layouts during the sampling process. Further-\nmore, we explore the usage of Large Language Models for\ngenerating visual layouts from text prompts. Our proposed\nlosses can be easily incorporated into existing text-to-image\ndiffusion models. The comprehensive experiments show fa-\nvorable performance against state-of-the-art grounded text-\nto-image models.\n7.

Implementation details\nWe apply Cross-Attention Refocusing and Self-Attention\nRefocusing losses on the attention maps of resolution 16 \u00d7\n16. All images are generated with 50 steps of denoising.\nWe discuss setting details for optimization during denois-\ning steps, referring to Eq. (7) In terms of \u03c4, in the very early\nsteps (t = 0 or t = 1), the cross and self-attention maps\nare unclear yet begin to form the layout. So, we just set\nthe iteration step \u03c4 = 2. Then, to make the layout clearer\n(t \u2208 {2, 3, 4}), \u03c4 is increased to 6 steps, which helps refine\nthe layout if tokens do not attend to the corresponding boxes\nor are in the wrong boxes. We also apply early stopping\nto reduce inference time and ensure the quality of gener-\nated images. We observe that applying optimization in later\nsteps can lead to quality degradation. Therefore, after the\nfirst ten denoising steps, we only update the latent when the\ntokens do not align with the corresponding boxes or with\nincorrect ones. The initial step size \u03b1 is set to 4 in the first\nfive steps, then decreases to 3. The detail of the algorithm\ncan be seen in Algorithm 25\nIn this paper, we use a Gaussian kernel with filter size 3\n\u00d7 3 and a \u03c3 value of 0.5 for standard deviation\nIn terms of four baselines, layout-to-image models:\nlayout-guidance, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, GLI-\nGEN, they are set default in their original papers.\n9. Layout generation\nOur full prompt mainly includes the three components:\nInstruction specifies the task and defines the output format.\nThis instruction helps GPT-4 perform better in layout gen-\neration tasks.\nIn-context exemplars are used further to enhance the\nmodel\u2019s capacity for the task. We supplement user prompts\nwith multiple examples for the best context understanding.\nThis also helps the model output the desired form of bound-\ning boxes and their corresponding labels.\nUser prompt is appended to the instruction and the sup-\nporting examples. Then, the model completes the chat con-\nversation from the user prompt and returns the layout in the\ndefined form.\nOnce the user provides a prompt (user prompt), it will be\nadded to the defined and fixed text to create a full prompt\nshown in Table 7. Then, the GPT-4 API completes the\nchat and returns the box coordinates of the corresponding\nobjects.\nThe comparison of our two-stage text-to-image models\nwith single-stage one ( Stable diffusion, Attend-and-Excite)\ncan be seen in the Fig. 13\nAlgorithm 1: Denoising step with Attention-\nRefocusing\nData: A text prompt P, a set of token indices I,\neach token associates with a set of bounding\nbox Bi , a timestep t, a set of iterations for\nrefinement {t1, . . . , tk}, the threshold T, and\na trained Stable Diffusion model SD.\nResult: latent xt\u22121 for the next timestep\n1 At, St \u2190 SD(z, P, t)\n2 At \u2190 Softmax(At \u2212 sot())\n3 for i \u2208 I do\n4\nAt\ni \u2190 At[:,:,i]\n5\nAt\ni \u2190 Gaussian(At\ni)\n6\nLt,F G\ni\n\u2190 1 \u2212 max(At\ni \u00b7 Mask(Bi))\n7\nLt,BG\ni\n\u2190 max(At\ni \u00b7 (1 \u2212 Mask(Bi)))\n8\nLi,CAR \u2190 LF G\ni\n+ LBG\ni\n9\nfor p \u2208 Mask(Bi) do\n10\nLp = P\np\u2208Bi(Average(St\np \u00b7 (1 \u2212 Mask(Bi))\n11\nend\n12\nLi,SAR = P\np(Lp)\n13 end\n14 LCAR \u2190 P\ni(Li,CAR)\n15 LSAR \u2190 P\ni(Li,SAR)\n16 L \u2190 LCAR + LSAR\n17 \u02c6xt \u2190 xt \u2212 \u03b1t\u2207xtL\n18 if t \u2208 {t1, . . . , tk} then\n19\nif L > 1 \u2212 T then\n20\nxt \u2190 \u02c6xt\n21\nGo to Step 1\n22\nend\n23 end\n24 xt\u22121 \u2190 SD(\u02c6xt, P, t)\n25 return xt\u22121\nComparison of four language models The comparison\nof four language models in layout generation task is shown\nin Fig. 12.

    "text": "Modular Visual Question Answering via Code Generation\nSanjay Subramanian1\nMedhini Narasimhan1\nKushal Khangaonkar1\nKevin Yang1\nArsha Nagrani2\nCordelia Schmid2\nAndy Zeng2\nTrevor Darrell1\nDan Klein1\n1UC Berkeley\n2Google Research\n{sanjayss,medhini,kushaltk,yangk,trevordarrell,klein}@berkeley.edu,\n{anagrani,cordelias,andyzeng}@google.com\nAbstract\nWe present a framework that formulates\nvisual question answering as modular code\ngeneration.\nIn contrast to prior work on\nmodular approaches to VQA, our approach\nrequires no additional training and relies on\npre-trained language models (LMs), visual\nmodels pre-trained on image-caption pairs,\nand fifty VQA examples used for in-context\nlearning.\nThe generated Python programs\ninvoke and compose the outputs of the visual\nmodels using arithmetic and conditional logic.\nOur approach improves accuracy on the COVR\ndataset by at least 3% and on the GQA dataset\nby roughly 2% compared to the few-shot\nbaseline that does not employ code generation.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe scope of reasoning needed for visual question\nanswering (VQA) is vast, and demands the synthe-\nsis of many skills \u2013 from grounding language to pix-\nels (Goyal et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2021; Zhai\net al., 2022) and spatial reasoning (Hudson and\nManning, 2019) to commonsense and knowledge-\nbased reasoning (Marino et al., 2019). Consider the\nquestion \u201cIs the carriage to the right of a horse?\u201d.\nTo consistently answer such questions correctly, a\nsystem must recognize that the question is the con-\njunction of two subquestions: \u201cIs there a horse?\u201d\nand \u201cIs the carriage to the right of the horse?\u201d\nScaling the typical finetuning paradigm to all possi-\nble combinations of reasoning skills is prohibitively\nexpensive in annotation cost and makes it difficult\nto add skills to an already-trained system.\nModular approaches, on the other hand \u2013 from\nclassic methods (Krishnamurthy and Kollar, 2013),\nto differentiable neural module networks (NMNs)\n(Andreas et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017; Saqur and\nNarasimhan, 2020)) \u2013 offer a potential route to\nleverage and scale to the compositional nature of\nvisual reasoning as a means to generalize: i.e., in-\nfinite use of finite means. However, the modules\nof an NMN must still be trained jointly on a large\ndataset, and are also restricted in that they (i) re-\nquire a parser, which must be modified if modules\nare added or removed from the system, and (ii)\nrequire retraining if a module is replaced.\nIn this work, we investigate an alternative class\nof modular VQA approaches, whereby building on\nthe recent advent of highly capable out-of-the-box\nlanguage models (LMs) (Chen et al., 2021; Ouyang\net al., 2022) and visual language models (VLMs)\n(Li et al., 2022), we develop systems that formulate\nVQA as a program synthesis problem. Specifically,\nour method CodeVQA, illustrated in Figure 1, uses\ncode-writing LMs to take questions as input, and\noutputs code to (i) orchestrate a series of visual\nprimitive APIs that wrap around VLMs to probe\nthe image for specific pieces of visual informa-\ntion (e.g., captions, pixel locations of entities, or\nimage-text similarity scores), and (ii) reason about\nthat information with the full expression of Python\ncode (e.g. arithmetic, logic structures, feedback\nloops, etc.) to arrive at an answer. From a practical\nperspective, the modularity of CodeVQA combined\nwith the few-shot prompting capabilities of LMs\nenable it to adapt to a broad range of desired VQA\nlabel distributions without additional model train-\ning, and benefits from replacing individual modules\nwith improved versions as they become available.\nWe evaluate CodeVQA in the few-shot VQA set-\nting, which has seen a great deal of recent work\n(Alayrac et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2021; Yang et al.,\n2021; Tiong et al., 2022). Our method outperforms\nprevious approaches by at least 3% on the COVR\ndataset (Bogin et al., 2021), which requires rea-\nsoning over multiple images, and by roughly 2%\non the GQA dataset (Hudson and Manning, 2019).\nOur results suggest that the benefits of modularity\nwith recent off-the-shelf models can be realized in\nVQA without additional model training.1\n1Our code and annotated programs are available at https:\n//github.com/sanjayss34/codevqa.\narXiv:2306.05392v1  [cs.CL]  8 Jun 2023\nCode Generation\nhorse_exists = query(img, \"Is there \na horse?\")\nanswer = \"no\u201d\nif horse_exists == \"yes\":\ncarriage_pos_x,carriage_pos_y = \nget_pos(img,\"carriage\")\nhorse_pos_x, horse_pos_y = \nget_pos(img, \"horse\")\nif carriage_pos_x > horse_pos_x:\nanswer = \"yes\u201d\u2019\nQuestion: \nIs the carriage to the \nright of a horse?\nAnswer: \nNo\nCodex\n(Few\u2013Shot Prompting)\nIn-Context Examples\n# Image 1: On which side of \nthe picture is the rug? \nimg = open_image(\"Image1.jpg\") \nrug_pos_x, rug_pos_y = \nget_pos(img, \"rug\") \nif rug_pos_x < (LEFT+RIGHT)/2: \nanswer = \"left\" \nelse: \nanswer = \"right\u201d \n. . .\nquery(img,\u201cIs there a horse?\u201d)\nExecute Code\nget_pos(img,\u201ccarriage\u201d) get_pos(img,\u201chorse\u201d)\ncarriage_pos_x < horse_pos_x\nreturns 5, 11 \nreturns 12, 11 \nreturns \u201cyes\u201d\nCaptions:\n1.

CodeVQA first prompts Codex with in-context examples that break down a given question into\nPython code. Using just the question, Codex generates an executable program that composes pre-defined visual modules using\nconditional logic, arithmetic, etc. The visual module, query answers a question by captioning the image and using an LM to\nanswer based on the captions. get_pos retrieves the location of the object. Here, CodeVQA correctly identifies the question as a\nconjunction of a query and a spatial comparison and arrives at the right answer.\n2\nRelated Work\nSeveral recent approaches for reasoning tasks con-\nsist of an LM that writes programs and an inter-\npreter for these programs. Liang et al. (2022) ap-\nplies this approach to robotics. Cheng et al. (2023)\nintroduces a framework for reasoning jointly over\ntables, text, and images, where the images are rep-\nresented by image captions. Subramanian et al.\n(2022) used a syntactic parser and hard-coded rules\nrather than an LM to aggregate outputs from CLIP\n(Radford et al., 2021) for zero-shot referring ex-\npression comprehension; their finding that CLIP is\nnot useful for spatial keywords motivates our code\ngeneration approach to spatial reasoning.\nConcurrent with our work, other papers have in-\ntroduced similar frameworks for multi-hop VQA\n(Gupta and Kembhavi, 2023; Sur\u00eds et al., 2023).\nThese papers conflate the benefit of program syn-\nthesis with the benefits of the LM, in-context ex-\namples, and vision models used as primitives. By\ncontrast, we analyze the effect of program synthesis\nby comparing CodeVQA against a strong LM-based\nfew-shot baseline using the same in-context exam-\nple selection method. Moreover, while these frame-\nworks rely on supervised VQA or object detection\nmodels, we show that we can obtain comparable\nperformance (on the GQA dataset) using only the\nLM and models pre-trained on image-text pairs.\n3\nFew-shot VQA via Code Generation\nIn visual question answering (VQA), the inputs to\nthe system are an image and a question and the\noutput is a textual answer. We consider the few-\nshot VQA setting in which the system has access\nto only a small number (50) of human-annotated\nVQA instances.\nOverview. Fig 1 illustrates our approach. Given an\nimage and a corresponding question, CodeVQA first\ngenerates a Python program using just the ques-\ntion. It then executes this program, using the image\nwhen necessary, to predict the answer. We first\ndefine the set of code primitives that our system\nuses (\u00a7 3.1). Then we describe how we generate\na program that composes these primitives based\non the question (\u00a7 3.2). Finally, we enumerate the\npre-trained models that we employ (\u00a7 3.3).\n3.1\nCode Primitives\nPrimitives define basic operations over the image or\nover text that are often useful for VQA. In CodeVQA,\nwe use three primitives, which are defined be-\nlow. Each of these primitives is implemented us-\ning image-text matching (ITM), image-text con-\ntrastive (ITC), and image-captioning models, each\nof which can be trained with only image-caption\npairs. The difference between ITM and ITC is that\nITC computes separate image and text embeddings\nand takes a dot product, while ITM performs early\nfusion on the image and text features and is thus\nmore computationally expensive. We note that our\nframework is not tied to this choice of primitives\nand can support other, more complex primitives\nthat could draw on other aspects of the program-\nming language and third-party libraries.\nquery(image,\nquestion)\nThis function an-\nswers a question about the given image. Our imple-\nmentation of this function is based on PnP-VQA\n(Tiong et al., 2022) and PICa (Yang et al., 2021)\nand is implemented with the following steps: (1)\nusing the ITM model, compute the GradCAM (Sel-\nvaraju et al., 2016) between the question and the\nimage (averaged over question tokens), (2) sample\nK = 20 image patches based on their GradCAM\nscore, (3) generate a captions from the sampled\npatches using the captioning model, (4) Repeat\nsteps (2) and (3) until C unique captions have been\ngenerated, and (5) predict the answer by prompting\nan LM with the question, captions, and in-context\nexamples. The in-context examples in step (5) are\nselected as described in \u00a7 3.2. When the dataset\ninvolves reasoning over multiple images, each in-\ncontext example has the captions for all images.\nget_pos(image,\ntext)\nThis function com-\nputes the GradCAM between the given text tokens\nand the image using the ITM model and returns\nthe (x, y) pair that maximizes the GradCAM value.\nNote that this application of GradCAM is different\nfrom the one in query since we do not average\nover all question tokens. See Appendix B for more\ninformation on how we compute GradCAM maps.\nfind_matching_image(images, text)\nIn the\nsetting where multiple images are associated with\neach question, there are questions that refer specifi-\ncally to one image (e.g. \u201cWhat is the woman hold-\ning?\u201d). This function can be used to select the most\nrelevant image from the set. It is implemented\nby scoring each image with the text using the ITC\nmodel and picking the image with the highest score.\n3.2\nCode generation\nIn the first stage of CodeVQA, we generate a Python\nprogram based on the question. Using Python over\na domain-specific language is advantageous be-\ncause (1) it supports arithmetic as well as control\nflow including loops and if statements (Liang et al.,\n2022)\u2013all of which we use in our programs\u2013and (2)\nlarge LMs for code generation (e.g. Codex (Chen\net al., 2021)) have been trained on a large amount\nof Python code.\nWe construct a prompt that consists of an in-\nstruction, constants that define the dimensions\nof the image, and import statements and API\ndocumentation (as a code comment) that spec-\nify the available functions.\nIn addition to the\nprompt, the input to the LM also includes expert-\nannotated programs for several in-context ex-\namples.\nAn in-context example for few-shot\nprompting on the COVR dataset is shown be-\nlow (question in gray, the program is highlighted).\n# Image Set 1: How many images contain exactly\n2 pink shoes??\nimages = open_images(\"ImageSet1.jpg\")\ncount = 0\nfor image in images:\ntwo_pink_shoes = query(image, \"Are\nthere exactly 2 pink shoes?\")\nif two_pink_shoes == \"yes\":\ncount += 1\nanswer = count\nFor an example of the rest of the prompt for the\nLM, see Appendix A. When executing the gener-\nated program results in a runtime error, we return\ncall query on the image and the original question\n(including captions for all images if the instance\ninvolves multiple images).\nSince all annotated programs cannot fit into a\nsingle input to the model, we must select which\nprograms to use as in-context examples for each\ntest question. Following Wang et al. (2022), we use\nsentence embeddings2 to retrieve the most similar\nquestions for each test question.\n3.3\nComponent models\nOur approach relies on four pre-trained models:\na code generation model, an ITM model, an ITC\nmodel, an IC model, and a question-answering LM\nfor answering questions based on captions. We use\nthe code-davinci-002 model (Chen et al., 2021)\nvia the OpenAI API for both generating programs\nand for question-answering. We use the BLIP mod-\nels (Li et al., 2022) finetuned for ITM, ITC, and\ncaptioning.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nImplementation Details\nSee Appendix C for implementation details.\n4.2\nDatasets\nThe GQA dataset (Hudson and Manning, 2019)\ncontains multi-hop questions generated from\nhuman-annotated scene graphs of individual im-\nages in Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016). The\nCOVR dataset (Bogin et al., 2021) contains multi-\nhop questions about sets of images in the Visual\nGenome and imSitu (Yatskar et al., 2016) datasets.\nThese questions are synthetically generated from\ntemplates and are then paraphrased by humans.

Unless\nstated otherwise, we put 12 in-context examples\nin a prompt for a single-image dataset and 6 in-\ncontext examples in a prompt for a multi-image\ndataset (since including captions for multiple im-\nages increases the necessary context size for each\nexample). We report the exact-match accuracies of\nthe lower-cased answers.\n4.3\nBaseline\nOur primary baseline is an adaptation of PnP-VQA\n(Tiong et al., 2022) to the few-shot setting. We\nrefer to it as \u201cFew-shot PnP-VQA.\u201d This baseline is\nequivalent to running the five-step query procedure\ndescribed in \u00a7 3.1 for every question. We also\ncompare to zero-shot and few-shot methods from\nprior and concurrent work. Appendix D contains\nfurther details about those methods.\n4.4\nResults\nTable 1 shows the results on the three datasets.\nCodeVQA has the highest accuracy among the few-\nshot techniques. Compared to Few-shot PnP-VQA,\nit has markedly better performance on COVR,\nwhich makes sense because in this dataset, the base-\nline approach must combine information across\nimage captions for multiple images when given\na single prompt. On the other hand, our method\nloops over the images and queries a single image\nat a time or selects the image most relevant to the\nquestion. Indeed, Table 3 shows that CodeVQA has\nthe greatest advantage on instances involving 4\nor 5 images. Compared to concurrent work that\nalso uses program synthesis, CodeVQA generally\nperforms better, which could be due to method-\nological differences like our in-context example\nretrieval or due to implementation details.\nFig. 2 shows a qualitative comparison of\nCodeVQA and the baseline Few-shot PnP-VQA on\nthe COVR dataset. CodeVQA answers the question\ncorrectly by answering a simpler question for each\nimage and comparing the answers, while Few-shot\nPnP-VQA answers incorrectly despite producing\ncaptions with the necessary information.\n4.5\nAblations\nTable 2 compares embedding-based retrieval of in-\ncontext examples with random retrieval. CodeVQA\u2019s\nimprovement over Few-shot PnP-VQA is greater\nwhen in-context examples are retrieved by embed-\nding. Embedding-based retrieval offers a system-\natic way to collect relevant in-context examples\nrather than curating a single set of examples as in\nGupta and Kembhavi (2023).\nIn Appendix F, we include ablations for the\nquestion-answering LM and for the number of\nshots in the prompt as well as results on val-\nidation sets.\nTable 4 shows that CodeVQA\nimproves over Few-shot PnP-VQA when ei-\nther code-davinci-002 or text-davinci-003 is\nused as the question-answering LM. Table 5 shows\nroughly constant accuracy as the number of in-\ncontext examples is varied.\n4.6\nAnalysis\nFigure 3 breaks down accuracy by question type.\nCodeVQA\u2019s greatest improvement (roughly 30%) is\nin the subset consisting of questions about left/right\nor top/bottom object positions. There is also an\nimprovement in \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d questions. This\nContext:\nImage 1: A train sitting at a large yellow station.

CodeVQA correctly answers this question from COVR by breaking it into simpler questions,\nanswering each separately, and comparing the answers. Few-shot PnP-VQA answers incorrectly, even though the captions\ncontain the necessary information. (Note that CodeVQA also generates captions, which are not shown here.)\nRetrieval Method\nFew-shot PnP-VQA\nCodeVQA\ntext-davinci-003\nRandom\n48.15\n49.9\nEmbedding\n49.4\n52.5\ncode-davinci-002\nRandom\n49.5\n50.7\nEmbedding\n52.1\n55.3\nTable 2: Comparing Example Retrieval Techniques on\n2000 GQA validation examples.

Thus, more errors are due to\nexecution of the modules than program generation.\n3Accuracy on this kind of question can also be improved\nby improving the LM. For instance, using text-davinci-003\nas the LM for QA closes the gap between Few-shot PnP-VQA\nand CodeVQA on \u201cand\u201d questions in GQA.\nFigure 3: Accuracy by question type in GQA test\nset. CodeVQA (blue) outperforms Few-shot PnP-VQA\n(orange) on the spatial, and, or questions. \u201cSpatial\u201d\nrefers to questions focusing on left/right or top/bottom\nrelations or object positions.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have introduced a framework for\nmodular few-shot VQA. Our approach prompts an\nLM to generate a Python program that invokes pre-\ntrained visual modules and composes the outputs of\nthese modules to predict the answer. Unlike previ-\nous modular VQA techniques, this framework does\nnot require (re-)training modules or a parser. Also,\nobtaining interpretable module outputs from previ-\nous modular approaches is nontrivial (Subramanian\net al., 2020), whereas in our approach the modules\nare frozen and thus interpretable. CodeVQA can also\nbe viewed as expanding pipelined systems (Zeng\net al., 2022) to the full expression of code. Our ap-\nproach exhibits empirical gains, motivating future\nwork on modular few-shot VQA.\n6\nLimitations\nWhile the initial results are promising, the accuracy\nof our method remains lower than human VQA ac-\ncuracy and models finetuned on the VQA datasets,\nwhich suggests that there may still be substantial\nprogress that must be made before few-shot VQA\nmethods with code synthesis are useful for practi-\ncal real world applications. Also, further work is\nneeded on extending the framework to additional\nprimitives, as the results in Appendix G show that\ndoing so does not always lead to improvements\nover the baseline method. Another limitation of\nour approach is that it relies on large capable LMs,\nwhich may be restricted in use due to compute re-\nquirements or cost (e.g. via available APIs). We\nalso focus in this work on benchmarking VQA ca-\npabilities with English as the primary language \u2013\nfuture work may extend this to other languages via\nmultilingual LMs.\n7\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the members of the Berkeley NLP group\n(especially Eric Wallace), Grace Luo, and the\nanonymous reviewers for feedback on earlier drafts\nof this paper.

We are given a question with to-\nkens q1, ..., qT and an image that is tokenized into\nK \u00d7 K patches. We use layer L = 6 to compute\nGradCAM, following Tiong et al. (2022). We com-\npute a GradCAM map for each token as follows.\nLet C \u2208 RT\u00d7K2 be the cross-attention map from\nlayer L. Let G \u2208 RT\u00d7K2 be the gradient of the\nimage-text matching score with respect to C. Then\nthe GradCAM map for token i is given by the ith\nrow of C J ReLU(G)), where J denotes ele-\nmentwise multiplication. As stated in Section 3.1,\nfor the query primitive, we take the average Grad-\nCAM map across all question tokens, whereas for\nthe get_pos primitive, we take the average Grad-\nCAM map across the input text tokens (which are\npart of the question tokens).\nC\nImplementation Details\nTo generate captions for in-context examples in\neach dataset, we run steps 1 \u2212 4 for each of the 50\nquestions in the database of in-context examples.\nFor GQA experiments, we use C = 7 captions\nper image, and for COVR experiments, where each\nquestion is associated with multiple images, we\nuse C = 3 captions per image.4 We use C = 7\ncaptions for the NLVR2 dataset. Each reported\naccuracy result represents a single evaluation run\nover the corresponding evaluation set. For NLVR2\nand some instances of COVR, the text input is a\nstatement (to be classified as True/False). We con-\nvert each such statement to a question by adding\nthe prefix \u201cIs it true that\u201d to it and converting the\nanswer to \u201cyes\u201d/\u201cno.\u201d We use question embeddings\nto select 12 examples for GQA and 6 examples for\nCOVR and NLVR2.\nD\nDetails on Baselines\nFewVLM randomly samples 16 few-shot exam-\nples for GQA. VisProg runs the program gener-\nation and execution pipeline five times, and for\neach iteration randomly samples 24 few-shot ex-\namples for GQA and 16 few-shot examples for\nNLVR2.\nViperGPT uses 8 few-shot examples\nfor GQA. VisProg uses text-davinci-002 or\ntext-davinci-003 for code generation (accord-\ning to the code release), while ViperGPT uses\ncode-davinci-002.\nE\nQualitative Comparisons\nWe\ninclude\nqualitative\ncomparisons\nof\nour\nmethod CodeVQA to the baseline Few-shot PnP-\nVQA (text-davinci-003) in Fig 5.

We implement this\nfunction using Grounding DINO (Liu et al., 2023),\nwhich is an open-vocabulary object detector that\nis also trained on referring expression comprehen-\nsion.\nWe evaluate this primitive on the VQAv2 dataset\n(Goyal et al., 2017), for which we use only this\nprimitive and query, as well as the COVR and\nNLVR2 datasets. We used 12 in-context exam-\nples for the VQAv2 dataset. Table 6 shows the re-\nsults indicating that using this module for counting\nrather than query yields mixed results. Qualita-\ntively, we observe a few reasons for errors in the\nfind_object version. First, the object detector is\nnot always accurate (e.g. finding \u201cperson holding\na banana\u201d when there is a person but no banana).\nSecond, our program may omit key details from\nthe question (e.g. for \u201cHow many boats have peo-\nple in them?\u201d the program counts the number of\nboats overall). Third, our program may invoke the\ndetector when it is ill-suited to the question (e.g.\n\u201cHow many blades of grass surround the fire hy-\ndrant?\u201d). On the other hand, captions often convey\nthe number of objects when the number is small,\nwhich is very common in these datasets, so query\ncan be effective on counting.\nknowledge_query(question)\nThis function re-\nturns the answer to a question based on world\nknowledge (e.g. \u201cWhich football team has won\nthe most Super Bowls?\u201d). We implement this func-\ntion using the same LM that is used for query. In\norder to better match the format of the OK-VQA\ndataset, we add a large negative bias to the logits\nof the following tokens to prevent the LM from\nCode:\npanda_count = 0 \nfor image in images: \npanda_count += int(query(image, \"How many pandas are there?\")) \nif panda_count == 4: \nanswer = \"yes\" \nelse: \nanswer = \"no\u201d\nAnswer: Yes\nCode:\nimages = open_images(\"ImageSet7.jpg\")\nrows_of_three = query(images[0], \"Are the laptops in horizontal rows of three?\") == \"yes\u201d\nopen_laptops = query(images[0], \"Are there rows of open laptops?\") == \"yes\u201d\nclosed_laptops = query(images[0], \"Are there rows of closed laptops?\") == \"yes\u201d\nif rows_of_three and open_laptops and closed_laptops:\nanswer = \"yes\u201d\nelse:\nanswer = \"no\u201d\nAnswer: No\nQuestion: Is it true that there are four pandas?\nQuestion: Is it true that the left image shows laptops in horizontal rows of three and \nincludes rows of open laptops and rows of closed laptops?\nFigure 6: NLVR2 Results. We show example results from the NLVR-2 dataset of our method CodeVQA.\ngenerating them: hyphens, \u201cto\u201d, and \u25e6. This choice\nwas made based on preliminary experiments on the\nOK-VQA dataset.\nWe evaluate this primitive on the OK-VQA dataset\n(Marino et al., 2019), for which we use only this\nprimitive and query. For CodeVQA and Few-shot\nVQA, we used 7 in-context examples to be consis-\ntent with the OK-VQA results of ViperGPT (Sur\u00eds\net al., 2023).

Prior\nwork (Ross et al., 2020; Agarwal et al., 2021) has\nfound evidence of social biases in vision-language\nmodels trained on image-captions. Therefore, our\nsystem may exhibit these biases as well.

    "text": "Scaling Spherical CNNs\nCarlos Esteves 1 Jean-Jacques Slotine 2 Ameesh Makadia 1\nAbstract\nSpherical CNNs generalize CNNs to functions on\nthe sphere, by using spherical convolutions as the\nmain linear operation. The most accurate and effi-\ncient way to compute spherical convolutions is in\nthe spectral domain (via the convolution theorem),\nwhich is still costlier than the usual planar convo-\nlutions. For this reason, applications of spherical\nCNNs have so far been limited to small problems\nthat can be approached with low model capacity.\nIn this work, we show how spherical CNNs can\nbe scaled for much larger problems. To achieve\nthis, we make critical improvements including\nnovel variants of common model components, an\nimplementation of core operations to exploit hard-\nware accelerator characteristics, and application-\nspecific input representations that exploit the prop-\nerties of our model. Experiments show our larger\nspherical CNNs reach state-of-the-art on several\ntargets of the QM9 molecular benchmark, which\nwas previously dominated by equivariant graph\nneural networks, and achieve competitive perfor-\nmance on multiple weather forecasting tasks. Our\ncode is available https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/spherical-cnn.\n1. Introduction\nSpherical convolutional neural networks (Cohen et al., 2018)\nwere introduced as a response to the convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) that were central to a series of break-\nthroughs in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He\net al., 2016; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Ronneberger\net al., 2015). Given the prevalence of spherical data across\nmany applications, it seemed sensible to design neural net-\nworks that possess attributes analogous to those that con-\ntribute to the success of planar CNNs, such as translation\nequivariance, spatial weight sharing, and localized filters.\n1Google Research, New York, NY, USA 2Nonlinear Systems\nLaboratoty, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. Correspondence to: Car-\nlos Esteves <machc@google.com>.\nProceedings of the 40 th International Conference on Machine\nLearning, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. PMLR 202, 2023. Copyright\n2023 by the author(s).\nFigure 1. Previous spherical CNNs were limited to low resolutions\nand relatively shallow models. In this work, we scale spherical\nCNNs by one order of magnitude and show that they can be com-\npetitive and even outperform state-of-the-art graph neural networks\nand transformers on scientific applications. In the figure, the num-\nber of convolutions in a layer mapping between Cin and Cout\nchannels is counted as CinCout, and the feature map size for a\nH\u00d7W feature with C channels is the number of entries HWC.\nMuch of the ensuing research into designing spherical\nCNNs (Cohen et al., 2018; Kondor et al., 2018; Esteves\net al., 2020) fulfilled these objectives, providing theoretical\nguarantees on rotation equivariance, the ability to learn local\nand expressive filters, and faithful models of both scalar and\nvector fields on the sphere.\nNonetheless, these models have not impacted many real-\nworld applications. One reason is that learning from large\ndatasets requires models with adequate representational ca-\npacity, and it has not yet been shown that spherical convolu-\ntion layers can be composed to construct such large models\neffectively. See Figure 1 \u2013 there is no spherical CNN archi-\ntecture used in practice analogous to common CNN models\nsuch as VGG19 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015).\nWe are inspired by scientific applications in two areas, drug\ndiscovery and climate analysis, that have the potential for\nbroad societal impact. Naturally, both have drawn great in-\nterest from the machine learning community \u2013 for example\nAlphaFold for predicting 3D structure of proteins (Jumper\net al., 2021), and a litany of deep learning approaches for\nmolecular property prediction (Wiedera et al., 2020). Prop-\n1\narXiv:2306.05420v1  [cs.LG]  8 Jun 2023\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nerty prediction of small molecules may also be relevant in\nthe design of drugs targeting the interaction between two\nproteins. For instance, current cancer drugs based on disrupt-\ning the binding of tumor suppressor p53 and ubiquitin ligase\nMDM2 (which targets p53 for degradation) have very low\nefficiency (Sun, 2006). The second area of interest is short\nand medium-range weather forecasting (Ravuri et al., 2021;\nLam et al., 2022; Rasp et al., 2020). Climate interventions\nare being considered to mitigate the effects of increased\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere1. As such\ninterventions represent uncharted and potentially dangerous\nterritory, climate prediction models may prove important to\nimprove their safety and effectiveness.\nIntuitively, both molecular property prediction and climate\nforecasting problems should benefit from spherical CNNs.\nThe intrinsic properties of molecules are invariant to rota-\ntions of the 3D structure (atom positions), so representa-\ntions that are rotation equivariant by design would provide\na natural way to encode this symmetry. However, QM9 (Ra-\nmakrishnan et al., 2014), a current standard benchmark for\nthis problem, contains 134K molecules, over 18 times larger\nthan the dataset existing spherical CNNs can accommo-\ndate (Rupp et al., 2012). The scale of this problem neces-\nsitates models with much greater representation power and\ncomputational efficiency.\nSimilarly, climate forecasting datasets (Rasp et al., 2020)\nrepresent samples of the Earth\u2019s atmospheric state and thus\nare ideally represented as spherical signals. Furthermore,\nin meaningful forecasting applications, models will rely on\nnumerous input variables and the objective is to predict at\na high spatial resolution (e.g. 1\u25e6 angular resolution or 64k\nsamples). Such input and output sizes demand large models.\nIn this work we present a systematic and principled approach\nto scale spherical CNNs. Our contributions include\n\u2022 a design of large scale spherical CNN models, which\nincludes an efficient implementation of spin-weighted\nspherical harmonic transforms tailored to TPUs,\n\u2022 general purpose layers and activations that improve\nexpressivity and efficiency,\n\u2022 application-specific modeling for molecules and\nweather forecasting.\nAs the contributions listed above hint at, we observe a naive\nscaling of existing spherical CNN architectures (simply in-\ncreasing depth and/or width) is insufficient. Rather, our\nlarger models required a measured design that altered mul-\ntiple standard components such as the nonlinearity, batch\nnormalization, and residual blocks \u2013 all of these improved\nboth efficiency and test performance (see Table 1).\n1https://www.ametsoc.org/index.\ncfm/ams/about-ams/ams-statements/\nstatements-of-the-ams-in-force/\nclimate-intervention\nThese advancements, along with novel domain-specific in-\nput feature representations, lead to state of the art perfor-\nmance on the QM9 benchmark, which has been mostly dom-\ninated by variations of graph neural networks and transform-\ners. Our models are also competitive in multiple weather\nforecasting settings, showing, for the first time, that spheri-\ncal CNNs are viable neural weather models.\nThis work shows the feasibility of, and introduces best prac-\ntices for, scaling spherical CNNs. Based on our findings,\nwe expect our JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) implementation\nwill provide a platform for further research with spherical\nCNNs targeting real world applications.\n2. Related work\n2.1. Spherical CNNs\nSpherical CNNs have been introduced as the natural exten-\nsion of standard CNNs to the sphere (Cohen et al., 2018;\nEsteves et al., 2018), with spherical convolutions computed\nvia generalized Fourier transforms, where the translation\nequivariance is generalized to 3D rotation equivariance.\nLater work introduced spectral nonlinearities (Kondor et al.,\n2018), and extended the equivariance to conformal transfor-\nmations (Mitchel et al., 2022).\nOne set of approaches applies filters directly to discrete\nsamples of the spherical input. Perraudin et al. (2019) used\na rotation equivariant graph CNN based on isotropic filters.\nCohen et al. (2019) considered charts of an icosahedral grid,\nwhere filters are rotated and shared, yielding approximate\nrotation equivariance. Shakerinava & Ravanbakhsh (2021)\ngeneralized Cohen et al. (2019) to other grids, using less\nconstrained filters that maintain equivariance.\nTangentially related are methods that operate on the sphere\nbut are not rotation-equivariant (Coors et al., 2018; Jiang\net al., 2019; Su & Grauman, 2019).\nThere have been attempts at improving spherical CNN\u2019s\nefficiency. Esteves et al. (2020) introduced spin-weighted\nspherical CNNs, which brought anisotropic filters at smaller\ncost than the full rotation group Fourier transforms. Cobb\net al. (2021) counteracted the feature size expansion caused\nby the tensor products in Kondor et al. (2018) with heuris-\ntics to select the representation type at each layer. McEwen\net al. (2022) handled high resolution spherical signals by\nfirst applying a scattering network with fixed filters (not\ntrainable), followed by downsampling and a spherical CNN.\nOcampo et al. (2022) approximated the group convolution\nintegral using a quadrature rule, avoiding expensive general-\nized Fourier transforms. These previous attempts were still\nlimited to small and sometimes contrived applications.\nIn this paper, we scale spherical CNNs to a number of oper-\nations and feature resolutions one order of magnitude larger\n2\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nthan prior work (see Figure 1), and apply them successfully\nto large benchmarks on molecule and weather modeling,\nshowing that they can be comparable and sometimes surpass\nthe state-of-the-art graph and transformer-based models.\n2.2. Deep learning for molecules\nThere have been many flavors of message-passing graph\nneural networks designed specifically for molecules. See\nWiedera et al. (2020) and Han et al. (2022) for relevant sur-\nveys, and a broader discussion not limited to deep learning\ntechniques can be found in von Lilienfeld et al. (2020). Re-\ngarding the deep learning approaches, much of the recent\nwork has focused on 3D equivariant or invariant models.\nExamples of invariant models include SchNet (Sch\u00a8utt et al.,\n2017) and DimeNet++ (Klicpera et al., 2020), where the\nupdate function only uses invariant information such as\nbond angles or atomic distances.\nE(n)-equivariant net-\nworks (Satorras et al., 2021) propose an equivariant up-\ndate function for node coordinates that operates on direc-\ntional information (displacement between atoms), although\nthe model instantiation for molecules skips this update\nleading to strict invariance. Related, Tensor Field Net-\nworks (Thomas et al., 2018) also construct an equivariant\nupdate function, this one is based on spherical harmon-\nics. Cormorant (Anderson et al., 2019) and Steerable E(3)-\nequivariant GNNs (Brandstetter et al., 2022) can be seen as\nextensions of TFN, the former noted for using the Clebsch-\nGordan non-linearity, and the latter generalizing to E(n)\nequivariance. PaiNN (Sch\u00a8utt et al., 2021) is a related model\nwhose gated equivariant update block does not rely on spher-\nical harmonics. This work also closely examines the loss\nof directional information in invariant models and finds\nequivariance allows for models with reduced model size.\nRelated to the equivariant graph models are the equivari-\nant transformer approaches such as TorchMD-Net (Th\u00a8olke\n& Fabritiis, 2022) which updates scalar and vector node\nfeatures with self-attention.\n2.3. Deep learning for weather modeling\nMudigonda et al. (2017) and Weyn et al. (2019) utilize\nvanilla CNNs for extreme weather segmentation and short-\nterm forecasting (\u201cNowCasting\u201d), respectively, while Rasp\n& Thuerey (2021) uses a ResNet model. Other methods for\nNowCasting use UNets (Agrawal et al., 2019) and condi-\ntional generative modeling (Ravuri et al., 2021).\nIn Weyn et al. (2020) and Lopez-Gomez et al. (2022), a\ncubed sphere representation (projecting the sphere onto six\nplanar segments) is proposed. This approach enjoys some of\nthe computational benefits of traditional CNNs while more\nclosely observing the underlying spherical topology. Jiang\net al. (2019) introduces a model for unstructured grids with\nexperiments on extreme weather segmentation on icosa-\nhedral grids. This orientable CNN model does not offer\nequivariance to 3D rotations and thus expects inputs to be\nconsistently oriented which is true of climate data.\nKeisler (2022) recently introduced a graph neural network\nmodel inspired by Battaglia et al. (2018). The central com-\nponent of this model is a message passing network operating\non an icosahedral grid. A similar approach is taken in Lam\net al. (2022), with a multi-scale mesh graph representation.\nThe datasets used in most of the recent deep learning re-\nsearch for climate modeling, such as WeatherBench (Rasp\net al., 2020), consists of equiangular grids derived from\nreanalysis of the ERA5 data (Hersbach et al., 2020).\n3.

The ubiquitous convolutional neural net-\nworks (CNNs) for image analysis have convolutions on the\nplane as their main operation,\n(f \u2217 k)(x) =\nZ\nt\u2208R2\nf(t)k(x \u2212 t) dt,\nfor an input function f and learnable filter k. This opera-\ntion brings filter sharing between different regions of the\nimage via translation equivariance, which means that given\na shifted input f \u2032(x) = f(x + h), the convolution output\nalso shifts: (f \u2032 \u2217 k)(x) = (f \u2217 k)(x + h). This is one of the\nmain reasons for CNNs high performance.\nSpherical CNNs generalize this notion to functions on the\nsphere (f : S2 7\u2192 R) by using spherical convolutions,\n(f \u2217 k)(x) =\nZ\ng\u2208SO(3)\nf(g\u03bd)k(g\u22121x) dg,\n(1)\nwhere SO(3) is the group of 3D rotations (which can be rep-\nresented by special orthogonal 3 \u00d7 3 matrices), and \u03bd \u2208 S2\nis a fixed point. Any two points on the sphere S2 are related\nby a rotation in 3D (in technical terms, the sphere is a homo-\ngeneous space of the group of rotations), and the spherical\nconvolution is equivariant to 3D rotations. Equation (1)\nwas adopted by Esteves et al. (2018), while Cohen et al.\n(2018) lifts from S2 to SO(3) and performs convolutions\non the group, which have an almost identical expression to\nEquation (1) but with x \u2208 SO(3).\nEsteves et al. (2020) introduced spin-weighted spherical\nCNNs to overcome the limited expressivity of Esteves et al.\n(2018) and the computational overhead of Cohen et al.\n(2018). Spin-weighted spherical functions are complex-\nvalued and their phase changes under rotation. They can also\nbe interpreted as functions on SO(3) (Boyle, 2016) with\nsparse spectrum. Convolution is computed through products\nof spin-weighted spherical harmonics coefficients (Esteves\net al., 2020).\n3\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nComputing generalized convolutions. Approximating\nspherical and rotation group convolutions with a discrete\nsum is problematic because there is no arbitrarily dense self-\nsimilar grid on the sphere and on the rotation group. Hence,\nthese convolutions are most efficiently and accurately com-\nputed in the spectral domain, via products of (generalized)\nFourier coefficients (Driscoll & Healy, 1994; Kostelec &\nRockmore, 2008; Huffenberger & Wandelt, 2010), which\ncorrespond to the spherical harmonics decomposition coef-\nficients \u02c6f \u2113\nm for degree \u2113 and order m in the case of Equa-\ntion (1). Even the fastest algorithms for spherical and rota-\ntion group convolutions are still much slower than a planar\nconvolution with a 3 \u00d7 3 kernel on modern devices, which\nhas so far limited the applications of spherical CNNs.\nIn this paper, we adapt the algorithm of Huffenberger &\nWandelt (2010) for computing spin-weighted transforms,\ns \u02c6f \u2113\nm =\nZ\nS2\nf(x)sY \u2113m(x) dx,\n(2)\nf(x) =\nX\n\u2113\nX\n|m|\u2264\u2113\ns \u02c6f \u2113\nmsY \u2113\nm(x),\n(3)\nwhere sY \u2113\nm is the spin-weighted spherical harmonic of spin\ns, degree \u2113, and order m, and 0Y \u2113\nm corresponds to the stan-\ndard spherical harmonic Y \u2113\nm. The forward transform imple-\nmentation rewrites Equation (2) as\ns \u02c6f \u2113\nm = (\u22121)sim+s\nr\n2\u2113 + 1\n4\u03c0\n\u2113\nX\nm\u2032=\u2212\u2113\n\u2206\u2113\nm\u2032m\u2206\u2113\nm\u2032(\u2212s)Im\u2032m,\n(4)\nwhere \u2206\u2113\nm,m\u2032 = d\u2113\nm,m\u2032(\u03c0/2) is the Wigner \u2206 function, d\u2113\nis a Wigner (small) d matrix, and Im\u2032m is an inner product\nwith f over the sphere, computed by extending f to the\ntorus and evaluating standard fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)\non it. Symmetries of the Wigner \u2206 enable rewriting the sum\nin Equation (4) with half the number of terms as\n\u2113\nX\nm\u2032=\u2212\u2113\n\u2206\u2113\nm\u2032m\u2206\u2113\nm\u2032(\u2212s)Im\u2032m =\n\u2113\nX\nm\u2032=0\n\u2206\u2113\nm\u2032m\u2206\u2113\nm\u2032(\u2212s)Jm\u2032m,\n(5)\nwhere Jm\u2032m = Im\u2032m + (\u22121)m+sI\u2212m\u2032m for m\u2032 > 0 and\nJ0m = I0m.\nThe inverse transform rewrites Equation (3) as\nf(\u03b8, \u03d5) =\n\u2113\nX\nm\u2032=\u2212\u2113\n\u2113\nX\nm=\u2212\u2113\neim\u2032\u03b8eim\u03d5Gm\u2032m,\n(6)\nGm\u2032m = (\u22121)sim+s X\n\u2113\n\u03b1\u2113\u2206\u2113\n(\u2212m\u2032)(\u2212s)\u2206\u2113\n(\u2212m\u2032)ms \u02c6f \u2113\nm,\n(7)\nTable 1.

(2020). In this work, we offer a complete\nrewrite in JAX, tuned for TPUs. This is by itself faster, but\nwe also propose modifications to the algorithm to further\nimprove its speed (see Section 4.2).\n4. Method\nWe contribute a fast implementation of spin-weighted spher-\nical CNNs in JAX, optimized for TPUs, that can run dis-\ntributed in dozens of devices. The implementation is about\n3\u00d7faster than the original, and the ability to run distributed\ncan speed it up 100\u00d7or more (we use up to 32 TPUs).\nMoreover, we introduce a new nonlinearity, normalization\nlayer, and residual block architecture that are more accurate\nand efficient than the alternatives. Table 1 summarizes the\neffects on efficiency and accuracy.\n4.1. Modeling\nPhase collapse nonlinearity. Designing equivariant nonlin-\nearities for equivariant neural networks containing vector\nor tensor features is challenging. A number of equivari-\nant activations appear in the literature (Weiler et al., 2018;\nKondor et al., 2018; de Haan et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022)\nand typically the best performing one is problem-dependent.\nSpin-weighted spherical CNNs require specialized activa-\ntions for nonzero spin features, and Esteves et al. (2020)\nchose a simple magnitude thresholding.\nGuth et al. (2021) introduced phase collapse nonlineari-\nties for complex-valued planar CNNs with wavelet filters,\nmotivated by 1) translation invariance is usually desirable\n4\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nfor image classification, 2) in the spectral domain, trans-\nlations correspond to phase shifts, 3) when applying com-\nplex wavelet filters to images, which yields complex feature\nmaps, input translations approximately correspond to fea-\nture phase shifts, 4) using the modulus as part of the acti-\nvation collapses the phase, achieving translation invariance\nand increasing class separability.\nWe adapt these ideas to spin-weighted spherical functions;\nin our case, we want rotation invariance (or equivariance) for\nfunctions on the sphere. The features are complex-valued\nand an input rotation results in phase shifts when the spin\nnumber is nonzero. Thus, using the modulus as part of the\nactivation eliminates these shifts and brings some degree of\ninvariance. The activation mixes all spins but only updates\nthe zero-spin features. Since the nonzero spin features are\nunaffected, no information is lost by collapsing the phase.\nFormally, let x0 \u2208 CC be the stack of C channels of zero\nspin at some position on the sphere, and x \u2208 CSC be a stack\nof all S spins in the feature map (including zero). We apply\nx0 \u2190 W1x0 + W2|x| + b,\nwhere W1, W2 and b are learnable parameters. This oper-\nation updates only the spin zero; subsequent convolutions\npropagate information to the nonzero ones. Table 6 shows\nthis nonlinearity brings sizeable performance improvements.\nSpectral batch normalization. Previous spherical CNNs\ncomputed spherical convolutions on the spectral domain\nand batch normalization on the spatial domain.\nBatch\nnormalization requires approximating the statistics with a\nquadrature rule in the spatial domain. Moreover, in the\nspin-weighted case, zero and nonzero spins need different\ntreatments, which is inefficient.\nWe propose to compute the batch normalization in the spec-\ntral domain instead. Consider that 1) the coefficient 0f \u2113\nfor \u2113 = 0 corresponds to the function average, and 2) the\nvariance of the rest of the coefficients is the variance of the\nfunction. The normalization is then computed by 1) setting\n0f 0 to zero and 2) dividing all coefficients by the variance.\nSimilarly, a learnable bias is applied by directly setting 0f 0,\nand a learnable scale is applied to all coefficients.\nThe spectral batch norm is shown to be faster and more\naccurate than the spatial one in Table 1. It also enables a\nfaster residual block as described next.\nSpectral pooling and efficient residual block. In contrast\nwith Esteves et al. (2020), and similarly to Cohen et al.\n(2018), we perform pooling in the spectral domain, which\nproves to be faster and more accurate. This is because\nthe spatial pooling is sensitive to the sampling grid so it\nis only approximately rotation-equivariant; it also requires\napproximation with quadrature weights which adds to the\nerrors. Spectral pooling is implemented by simply skipping\nthe computation of the higher frequency coefficients within\na spin-spherical Fourier transform. Spectral pooling is also\nconceptually different than spatial because it is a global\noperation while spatial pooling is localized.\nOne potential issue with spectral pooling is in residual lay-\ners, where the downsampling happens in the first Fourier\ntransform, so the downsampled spatial input is never com-\nputed and hence cannot be used in the skip-connection. Our\nsolution is to add the residual connection between Fourier\ncoefficients, which is enabled by the spectral batch nor-\nmalization described earlier. Figure 2 shows our residual\nblock. Table 1 shows it is faster and performs better than\nthe alternative with spatial pooling and batch norms.\nFigure 2. Our efficient residual block contains spin-weighted spher-\nical Fourier transforms (FT) and inverses (IFT), multiplication with\nfilter coefficients (\u2217K), activation (\u03c3) and spectral batch normal-\nization (BN). The residual connection happens in Fourier space.\nOptionally, spectral pooling is performed at the first FT block.\n4.2. Efficient TPU implementation\nWe implement the spin-weighted spherical harmonics trans-\nforms aiming for fast execution on TPUs (Jouppi et al.,\n2017)2. This drives our design decisions and sometimes\ndeparts from the optimal implementation for CPUs as in-\ntroduced by Huffenberger & Wandelt (2010). The main\ndifference is that TPUs perform matrix multiplications ex-\ntremely fast, but memory manipulations like slicing and\nconcatenating tensors may quickly become a bottleneck.\nIn particular, the use of Wigner \u2206 symmetries to reduce\nthe number of elements computed in Equations (4) and (7)\nrequires slicing, modifying and reconstructing the original\ntensors in order to cut the number of operations in half. It\nturns out this is slower on TPU than just computing twice\nas many operations without the intermediate steps for the\narchitecture we consider, so we skip the computation of\nJnm (Equation (5)) completely, and compute all entries of\nGnm (Equation (7)) in a single step.\nFurthermore, Huffenberger & Wandelt (2010) leverage the\nFast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to reduce asymp-\ntotic complexity of the standard Fourier transforms (from\nO(n2) to O(n log n)). While there are on-device imple-\nmentations of the FFT, it turns out that in our cases it is\nsignificantly faster to compute Fourier transforms as ma-\ntrix multiplications via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\nmatrix. This is because, in a typical neural network pass,\nwe will compute thousands of Fourier transforms (one for\neach channel for each convolution), but the resolution of\n2The implementation is compatible with GPUs as well.\n5\nScaling Spherical CNNs\neach transform is relatively small (up to n = 256 in our\nexperiments), so the constant terms dominate and there is\nno benefit in reducing the asymptotic complexity. Table 1\nquantifies the efficiency increase of these changes.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Molecular property regression\nWe first demonstrate scaling spherical CNNs for molecu-\nlar property regression from atoms and their positions in\nspace, a task that was so far dominated by rotation equiv-\nariant graph neural networks and transformer-based models\n(Wiedera et al., 2020; Klicpera et al., 2020; Liao & Smidt,\n2022; Th\u00a8olke & Fabritiis, 2022). Previous applications of\nspherical CNNs (Cohen et al., 2018; Kondor et al., 2018;\nCobb et al., 2021) considered only the QM7 (Rupp et al.,\n2012) dataset, which has 7165 molecules with up to 23\natoms, and a single regression target. However, the much\nlarger QM9 (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014) dataset, which\ncontains 134 000 molecules with up to 29 atoms and 12\ndifferent regression targets, has supplanted QM7 as the stan-\ndard benchmark for this task. The molecules are described\nby their atom types and 3D positions, and labeled with geo-\nmetric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties\nsuch as enthalpies and free energies of atomization.\nIn this section, we report the first results of spherical CNNs\non QM9. The main reason to employ spherical CNNs for\nthis task is their equivariance to 3D rotations, since the\nmolecule properties do not change under rotations. A sec-\nondary reason is that we can design rich physically-based\nfeatures when mapping from molecule to sphere.\n5.1.1. SPHERICAL REPRESENTATION OF MOLECULES\nThe first step for applying spherical CNNs is to represent\nthe molecule as spherical functions. Cohen et al. (2018)\nproposed a map where spheres are placed around each atom,\nand points on each sphere are assigned a Coulomb-like quan-\ntity using the charge of the central atom and the distances\nbetween points on the sphere and other atoms.\nWe propose an alternative formulation which performs better\nin practice (see Table 6). Our spherical functions have no\nassigned radius, so they only contain directional information.\nThe values of these functions are constructed from an inverse\npower law computed from pairs of atoms, spread out with\na Gaussian decay. The input consists of one set of features\nper atom, with one channel per atom type in the dataset.\nWe sum the contributions of all atoms of the same type.\nFormally, let zi be the atomic number of atom i and rij\nthe displacement between atoms i and j, we define the one\nFigure 3. We represent a molecule with a set of Z functions on the\nsphere for each atom, where Z is the number of atom types in the\ndataset. Consider the H2O molecule in the figure and let Z = 2;\nthe rectangles show the two channels for each atom. The values\non the sphere come from physically-based interactions between\npairs of atoms, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel, and aggregated\nover atom types. For example, the sphere marked with an H on\nthe top right sums up the Coulomb forces between the oxygen the\ntwo hydrogen atoms.\ninput channel of atom i corresponding to atom type z as\nfiz(x) =\nX\nzj=z\nzizj\n|rij|p e\n\u2212\n(x\u00b7rij )2\n\u03b2|rij | ,\nwhere \u03b2 and p are hyperparameters. We set \u03b2 such that\nthe value is reduced by 95% at 45\u25e6 away from rij. We\nstack the features for p = 2 and p = 6, which correspond\nto the power laws of Coulomb and van der Waals forces,\nrespectively. These powers have been shown to perform\nwell by Huang & von Lilienfeld (2016) and we confirm\ntheir findings in our setting.\nThus, a molecule with N atoms in a dataset containing Z\ndifferent atom types is represented by 2NZ feature maps.\nThe input representation contains global information since\nit aggregates interactions between all atoms, however the\npower law makes it biased towards nearby atoms. Figure 3\ndepicts the spherical representation of an H2O molecule.\nThis representation is computed on-device using JAX primi-\ntives and thus is differentiable, enabling future applications\nsuch as predicting molecule deformations or interactions.\n5.1.2. ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING\nWe first apply a spherical CNN separately to the input fea-\ntures, at 32 \u00d7 32 resolution, for each atom (up to 29 on\nQM9). The model contains one standard spin-spherical con-\nvolutional block followed by 5 residual blocks as depicted\nin Figure 2 (for a total of 11 convolutional layers) with 64\nto 256 channels per layer. Our method\u2019s computational cost\nroughly scales linearly with the number of atoms.\nThis first step results in one feature map per atom. We then\napply global average pooling which results in a set of feature\nvectors, one per atom. Two different methods are used for\naggregating this set to obtain per-molecule predictions. The\nfirst method, used for most of the QM9 targets, applies\n6\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nTable 2. QM9 mean average errors (MAE). We scale spherical CNNs for QM9 for the first time, and show they are competitive with the\npreviously dominant equivariant graph neural networks and transformers. We compare on two splits found in the literature, where \u201cSplit 1\u201d\nhas a larger training set.

It is common in the\nliterature to use different aggregation for these and other\ntargets (Th\u00a8olke & Fabritiis, 2022; Sch\u00a8utt et al., 2021).\nWe train for 2000 epochs on 16 TPUv4 with batch size 16;\ntraining runs at around 37 steps/s.\n5.1.3.

Weather forecasting\nWe now analyze large spherical CNNs for weather forecast-\ning. A unique challenge here is that accurate recordings of\nweather data are limited to the last few decades, and thus\nthe limited training data motivates a search for the right\ninductive biases for best generalization.\nOne potential issue to consider is that the Earth has specific\ntopography and orientation in space which influence the\nweather, and input atmospheric data is always aligned, so\none could argue that global rotation equivariance is unnec-\nessary or even harmful. We claim, however, that equivari-\nance is not harmful because we can simply include constant\nfeature channels such as the latitude, longitude, land-sea\nmask and orography at each point. In fact, current neural\nweather models (NWMs) do include these constants (Rasp\n& Thuerey, 2021; Lopez-Gomez et al., 2022; Keisler, 2022).\nFurthermore, we speculate that rotation equivariance can be\nbeneficial, not in the global sense since inputs are aligned,\nbut in the local sense where local patterns can appear at\ndifferent orientations at different locations.\nWe evaluate large spherical CNNs on different settings us-\ning ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al., 2020), which\ncombines meteorological observations with simulation mod-\nels to provide atmospheric data such as wind speed and\ntemperatures uniformly sampled in time and space.\n5.2.1. WEATHERBENCH\nThe WeatherBench (Rasp et al., 2020) benchmark is based\non ERA5 data, where the data is provided in hourly\ntimesteps for 40 years, for a total of around 350 000 exam-\nples. The dataset is accompanied by simple baseline models\nfor predicting geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) and\ntemperature at 850 hPa (T850) at t + 3 days and t + 5 days\ngiven the values at t. In follow-up work, Rasp & Thuerey\n(2021) applied deep residual networks to similar targets, but\nnow taking a much larger number of predictors including\ngeopotential, wind speed, specific humidity at 7 vertical\nlevels, temperature at 2 m (T2M), total precipitation, and\nsolar radiation. Each predictor is sampled at t, t \u2212 6h and\nt \u2212 12h, and the constants land-sea mask, orography, and\nlatitude are included as features, for a total of 117 channels.\nIn both settings, the inputs are sampled at 32\u00d764 resolution.\nArchitecture and training. We follow Rasp & Thuerey\n(2021) and train a spherical CNN with an initial block fol-\nlowed by 19 residual blocks (as in Figure 2) and no pooling,\nfor a total of 39 spherical convolutional layers, all with\n128 channels. We train one model to directly predict Z500,\nT850 and T2M at 3 days ahead, and another to predict 5\ndays ahead. We train for 4 epochs on 16 TPUv4 with batch\nsize 32; training runs at around 8.9 steps/s.\n7\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nResults. Table 3 shows the results on the test set which\ncomprises years 2017 and 2018. We outperform the baseline\non all metrics in the simpler setting that takes two predictors,\nand show lower temperature errors on the second setting\nwith 117 predictors. The spherical CNN even outperforms\nmodels that are pre-trained on large amounts of simulated\ndata on some metrics. We notice that models tend to overfit,\nand Rasp & Thuerey (2021) employ dropout and learning\nrate decay based on validation loss to mitigate the issue.\nWe did not use these methods, which might explain our\nunderperforming the geopotential target.\nTable 3.

GLOBAL TEMPERATURE FORECASTING\nLopez-Gomez et al. (2022) proposed the task of extreme\nheat forecasting from short to subseasonal (up to 28 days\nhead) timescales. Current physics-based weather models\ncannot forecast such long lead times, which motivates the\nuse of machine learning. In contrast with Rasp et al. (2020)\nand Rasp & Thuerey (2021), Lopez-Gomez et al. (2022)\ndoes consider the spherical topology and employ an approx-\nimately uniform cubical sampling on the sphere.\nData used for this task is averaged over 24 h, and sampled\ndaily, resulting in around 15 000 examples. Furthermore,\ndata that is not present in WeatherBench is used, such as\nsoil moisture, longwave radiation and vorticity. For the\ntask we consider, Lopez-Gomez et al. (2022) used 20 pre-\ndictors while we use only the 5 that are present in Weath-\nerBench, namely temperature at 2 m (T2M), geopotential\nheight at 300 hPa, 500 hPa and 700 hPa and incoming ra-\ndiation. Lopez-Gomez et al. (2022) applied a UNet-like\n(Ronneberger et al., 2015) model on a 6\u00d748\u00d748 cubemap to\nforecast 28 channels corresponding to 1 to 28 days T2M.\nArchitecture and training. We used WeatherBench data at\n128\u00d7128 resolution, which has similar number of samples\nto the 6\u00d748\u00d748 cubemap. We implement a spherical UNet\nwith 9 spherical convolutional layers with 128 channels\neach. We train for 5 epochs on 16 TPUv4 with batch size\n32; training runs at around 13 steps/s.\nResults. Table 4 shows a comparison against 3 models\nintroduced by Lopez-Gomez et al. (2022) over the test set\n(2017 to 2021). HeatNet has a loss biased towards high\ntemperatures, ExtNet is biased towards both hot and cold\nextremes, while GenNet uses a standard L2 loss like our\nmodel. Our model nearly matches GenNet\u2019s performance,\neven when using a small subset of the predictors.\nTable 4.

ITERATIVE HIGH RESOLUTION FORECASTING\nKeisler (2022) proposed an iterative graph neural network\nfor weather forecasting. In this setting, predictors and tar-\ngets have the same cardinality such that the model can be\niterated repeatedly to forecast longer ranges, where a sin-\ngle iteration produces the forecast 6 h ahead. Temperature,\ngeopotential height, specific humidity and the three com-\nponents of the wind speed, are all sampled at 13 vertical\nlevels, for a total of 78 predictors and targets, at 180\u00d7360\nresolution. The dataset comprises the years 1979 to 2020\nwith one example every 3 h, for a total of 120 000 examples.\nArchitecture and training. We use the same data as Keisler\n(2022), but at 256\u00d7256 resolution, which has approximately\nthe same number of samples as the baseline.\nWe implement a spherical UNet with 7 convolutional layers\nand a single round of subsampling, because a too large\nreceptive field should not be necessary for predicting 6 h\nahead iteratively. The model is repeated up to 12 steps\nduring training, for a total of 84 convolutional layers.\nWe train in 3 stages. The first uses 4 rollout steps (24 h) for\n50 epochs on 32 TPUv4 with batch size 32, and is followed\nby 10 epochs with 8 rollout steps (48 h) and 10 epochs with\n12 rollout steps (72 h). Training runs at around 0.92 steps/s,\n0.35 steps/s and 0.24 steps/s for each stage.\n8\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nResults. Table 5 and Figure 4 show the results. Our model\ntends to perform better at geopotential but worse at temper-\nature forecasts. Keisler (2022) employs a different training\nprocedure where the resolution changes in each stage, and\nthe results are smoothed during evaluation.\nTable 5. Iterative weather forecasting, following the protocol from\nKeisler (2022). We compare results for 24h, 72h and 120h lead\ntimes, and report the RMSE. Our model tends to perform better at\ngeopotential but worse at the temperature forecasts.\n1 day\n3 days\n5 days\nZ500\nT850\nZ500\nT850\nZ500\nT850\nKeisler (2022)\n64.9\n0.730\n175.5\n1.17\n344.7\n1.78\nOurs\n58.3\n0.827\n167.2\n1.26\n340.0\n1.91\n5.3.

We train\na small model with five spherical convolutional layers to\nregress the enthalpy of atomization H on QM9; it is trained\nfor 250 epochs (in contrast with 2000 epochs in Section 5.1).\nWe compare the effect of replacing each of our main contri-\nbutions and show that each of them increases performance.\nSpecifically, we compare against the magnitude activation\nused in Esteves et al. (2020), the gated activation introduced\nby Weiler et al. (2018), which we implement by learning a\nspin 0 feature map that is squashed and pointwise-multiplies\neach channel. We also compare against the spherical molec-\nular representation introduced by Cohen et al. (2018). Ta-\nble 6 shows the results.\nTable 6. Effects of activation, pooling, molecule representation.\nWe employ a phase collapse activation, compared against the gated\nnonlinearity of Weiler et al. (2018) and the magnitude thresholding\nof Esteves et al. (2020). We employ spectral pooling, compared\nagainst the spatial pooling from Esteves et al. (2020).

Table 7 shows the results;\nthe most important factors for high performance in this task\nare the input and feature maps resolutions.\nTable 7. Effects of scaling.

The following row\nuses separable convolutions in every other layer, which reduces\nthe number of convolutions but keeps the feature size constant.\nThe final block reduces the number of channels per layer, which\nreduces both the number of operations and feature size.\nchannels\nconvolutions\nfeature size\nZ500\nT850\n[m2/s2]\n[K]\n256\u00d7256\n100%\n3.0 \u00d7 105\n8.4 \u00d7 107\n34.93\n0.62\n192\u00d7192\n100%\n3.0 \u00d7 105\n4.7 \u00d7 107\n39.68\n0.74\n128\u00d7128\n100%\n3.0 \u00d7 105\n2.1 \u00d7 107\n46.39\n0.87\n64\u00d764\n100%\n3.0 \u00d7 105\n5.2 \u00d7 106\n69.60\n1.08\n256\u00d7256\n100%\n1.6 \u00d7 105\n8.4 \u00d7 107\n36.24\n0.65\n256\u00d7256\n75%\n1.7 \u00d7 105\n6.3 \u00d7 106\n36.65\n0.65\n256\u00d7256\n50%\n7.4 \u00d7 104\n4.2 \u00d7 106\n41.34\n0.71\n6. Discussion\nLimitations. The major limitation of our models is still\nthe computational cost \u2013 our best results require training\nup to 4 days on 32 TPUv4, which can be expensive. As a\ncomparison, the baseline for weather (Keisler, 2022) trains\nin 5.5 days on a single GPU, and the baseline for molecules\n(Liao & Smidt, 2022) trains in 3 days on a single GPU.\nFrom the point of view of the applications, there are con-\ncerns of how much a model trained on reanalysis is useful\nfor forecasting the real weather, and whether models super-\nvised by chemical properties at some level of theory like\nQM9 are useful to estimate the true properties.\nConclusion. Spherical CNNs possess numerous qualities\nthat makes them appealing for modeling spherical data or\nrotational symmetries. We have introduced an approach\nto scaling these models so they can be utilized on larger\nproblems, and our initial results already reach state of the\nart or comparable performance on molecule and weather\nprediction tasks. We hope this work and supporting imple-\nmentation will allow the research community to revisit this\npowerful class of models for important large scale problems.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Stephan Hoyer, Stephan Rasp, and Ignacio Lopez-\nGomez for helping with data processing and evaluation, and\nFei Sha, Vivian Yang, Anudhyan Boral, Leonardo Zepeda-\nN\u00b4u\u02dcnez, and Avram Hershko for suggestions and discussions.\n9\nScaling Spherical CNNs\nReferences\nAbadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A.,\nDean, J., Devin, M., Ghemawat, S., Irving, G., Isard,\nM., Kudlur, M., Levenberg, J., Monga, R., Moore, S.,\nMurray, D.

Appendix\nA.1. Experimental details\nWe use the Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) optimizer and a\ncosine decay on the learning rate with one epoch linear\nwarmup in all experiments.\nThe inputs of all models are conventional spherical functions\n(zero spin). The first layer maps it to features of spins zero\nand one, which are mapped back to spin zero at the last\nspherical convolutional layer. This last feature is complex-\nvalued, which we convert to real by taking the magnitude.\nA.1.1. MOLECULAR PROPERTY REGRESSION\nFor the experiments in Section 5.1, we use five spherical\nresidual blocks with resolutions [322, 162, 162, 82, 82] and\n[64, 128, 128, 256, 256] channels per layer. We minimize\nthe L1 loss with a maximum learning rate of 10\u22124.\nOur model applies the spherical CNN independently to each\natom\u2019s features, followed by global average pooling, re-\nsulting in one feature vector per atom. These are further\nprocessed by a DeepSets or transformer, as explained in\nSection 5.1. Finally, we map the set of atom feature vectors\nto the regression target in three different ways, depending on\nthe target. The dipole moment \u00b5 relates to the displacement\nbetween atoms and the center of mass, so we use a weighted\naverage by the displacements to aggregate the atom features\n(as Gastegger et al. (2017)), followed by a small MLP. We\ncompute the electronic spatial extent < R2 > similarly,\nbut using the distance to the center of mass squared as the\nweights, following Sch\u00a8utt et al. (2021). For the other tar-\ngets, which are energy-related, we use the atom types as the\nweights.\nFollowing Gasteiger et al. (2020), we estimate \u03f5gap as\n\u03f5HOMO \u2212 \u03f5LUMO, using the predictions from models the\ntrained for \u03f5HOMO and \u03f5LUMO, without training a model\nspecifically for the gap.\nA.1.2. ITERATIVE HIGH RESOLUTION WEATHER\nFORECASTING\nWe implement a spherical UNet similar to the one\nin\nAppendix\nA.1.4,\nwith\nfeature\nmaps\nof\nresolu-\ntions [2562, 2562, 1282, 1282, 1282, 1282, 2562, 2562] and\n[128, 128, 256, 256, 256, 256, 128, 128] channels per layer,\nwhich are followed by batch normalization and phase col-\nlapse\nSimilarly to Keisler (2022), we concatenate a few constant\nfields to the 78 predictors; namely, the orography, land-sea\nmask, latitude (sine), longitude (sine and cosine), hour of\nthe year, and hour of the day.\nThe maximum learning rate for the first stage is 2 \u00d7 10\u22124,\nand we reduced it by a factor of 10 at each subsequent state.\nA.1.3. WEATHERBENCH\nFor the experiments in Section 5.2.1, we use 64\u00d764 inputs\nand feature maps, while the baseline is at 32\u00d764. Since the\nspherical harmonic transform algorithm we use requires the\nsame number of samples along both axes, we upsample the\ninputs from 32\u00d764 to 64\u00d764. We minimize the L2 loss for\nthis and all weather experiments.\nA.1.4. GLOBAL TEMPERATURE FORECASTING\nFor the experiments in Section 5.2.2, we implement\na spherical UNet with feature maps of resolutions\n[1282, 642, 642, 322, 322, 322, 322, 642, 642, 1282, 1282],\nand 128 channels on all convolutional layers, which\nare followed by batch normalization and phase collapse\nactivation.\nFeatures in the downsampling layers are\nconcatenated to the same resolutions in the upsampling\nlayers.\nA.2. Extra experiments\nFFT vs DFT. One of our perhaps surprising findings is that\ncomputing Fourier transforms via DFT matrix multiplica-\ntion is faster than using the fast Fourier transform (FFT)\nalgorithm. Here, we investigate whether this remains true\nfor larger input resolutions. We train shallow models with\nonly two spin-spherical convolutional layers on the protocol\nof Keisler (2022), with upsampled inputs to 512 \u00d7 512 and\n768 \u00d7 768. Table 8 shows the results when running on 32\nTPUv4 with batch size of one per device. The direct DFT\nmethod performs better than FFT on TPU even at higher\nresolutions, due the TPU greatly favoring computing a large\nmatrix multiplication instead of running multiple steps on\nsmaller inputs.\nTable 8.

Snoek2\nXinlei Chen1\n1FAIR, Meta AI\n2University of Amsterdam\nABSTRACT\nIn this work, we explore regions as a potential visual analogue of words for self-\nsupervised image representation learning. Inspired by Masked Autoencoding\n(MAE), a generative pre-training baseline, we propose masked region autoen-\ncoding to learn from groups of pixels or regions. Specifically, we design an\narchitecture which efficiently addresses the one-to-many mapping between images\nand regions, while being highly effective especially with high-quality regions.\nWhen integrated with MAE, our approach (R-MAE) demonstrates consistent im-\nprovements across various pre-training datasets and downstream detection and\nsegmentation benchmarks, with negligible computational overheads. Beyond the\nquantitative evaluation, our analysis indicates the models pre-trained with masked\nregion autoencoding unlock the potential for interactive segmentation.1.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nThere has been a significant progress of self-supervised pre-training in Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) over a short period of time, showing the potential of pre-trained language models from huge\namounts of data. This progress has been mainly brought about two lines of research, the autogressive\nlanguage model in GPT (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) and the masked language model in BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019). While being different in the design of pre-text task, both approaches learn to predict\nmissing words given the available content. Such reconstructive pre-training enables language models\nto capture complex and long-range context in documents, resulting in a general learner for various\nNLP downstream tasks (Brown et al., 2020).\nInspired by the reconstructive design of masked language modeling in NLP, recent self-supervised\nlearning approaches in computer vision also propose to directly predict masked patches from visible\nimage content (Peng et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). Indeed, the idea of masked\nautoencoding in vision proves its effectiveness in learning visual representations, reaching state-of-\nthe-art performance in image recognition (He et al., 2022; Woo et al., 2023). Among these methods,\nMasked Autoencoding (MAE) (He et al., 2022) that employs an asymmetric design and a high\nmasking ratio proves to be a simple and powerful vision learner. Notably, Li et al. (2021) show that\nunlike supervised or contrastive learning, MAE improves the upper bound of object detection and\nsegmentation compared to a long and optimal recipe of training from scratch.\nHowever, for visual understanding, MAE has not yet reached the same performance level as language\nmodels. Despite the benefit of learning from unlabeled data, MAE still lags behind in its scalabil-\nity (Zhai et al., 2022; Dehghani et al., 2023) and other emergent properties (e.g., one that explicitly\ncapture human-relatable segments (Caron et al., 2021)). This may come from the fact that the raw\npixel values are continuous signals of the visual world, whereas words are discrete human creations.\nMotivated by this, we examine the concept of \u2018region\u2019 (Girshick et al., 2014) as a potential visual\nanalogue of words for pre-training, as regions offer similarly discrete information about which group\nof pixels belong together. By learning from regions in the image, the model can hopefully be less\nbiased towards raw pixels and focus more on the grouping of pixels that encode parts, objects, and\nscenes. Thus it can further advance the performance on tasks like object detection and segmentation.\nSpecifically, we propose \u2018masked Region Autoencoding\u2019 (RAE), as a reconstructive pre-text task to\nlearn from regions. In RAE, each region is represented as a binary region \u2018map\u2019, with each value\n\u2217Work done during an internship at FAIR.\n1The code is provided at https://github.com/facebookresearch/r-mae\n1\narXiv:2306.05411v2  [cs.CV]  4 Jan 2024\nindicating whether a pixel belongs to the current region or not. We can then follow a similar procedure\nin MAE to learn a region-aware representation by predicting masked portions of the input regions.\nHowever, unlike MAE that reconstructs a single input image in its decoder, learning from regions\nrequires our pipeline to efficiently deal with one-to-many mappings. This is because a pixel in the\nimage can belong to an unknown number of regions. In addition, different from color channels in\npixels that appear in a pre-defined order (e.g., RGB), the reconstruction of multiple regions needs to\nmaintain permutation equivariance \u2013 a swap of two regions in the input should automatically lead to\na swap in the output. To address these challenges, we explore several architecture variants for RAE\nand converge to a \u2018length\u2019 variant that compresses each spatial region to a single query vector. We\nshow our final design is both efficient and effective.\nRAE is fully compatible with MAE. When integrated, we name our approach R-MAE, short for\nRegion-aware Masked Autoencoding. Since we use regions which are fully computable from mere\nimages, R-MAE enjoys the same range of applicability as MAE. Empirically, we find R-MAE can\ngenerate useful representations for dense vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,\nwhich we thoroughly study with our experiments. Specifically, we highlight:\n\u2022 RAE alone reaches strong performance, especially when fed with high-quality, off-the-shelf\nregions (Kirillov et al., 2023) \u2013 better than MAE;\n\u2022 Even with regions from a simple clustering algorithm (Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher, 2004),\nR-MAE offers consistent improvements over MAE on multiple settings, and reaches state-\nof-the-art performance without compromising pre-training efficiency;\n\u2022 Qualitative visualizations show our pre-training is indeed more region-aware, or instance-\naware compared to others;\n\u2022 As a final demonstration, pre-trained R-MAE models can be potentially used as a promptable,\n\u2018interactive segmenter\u2019 beyond representation learning.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nWe first review two intrinsic properties of regions, which have driven their popularity:\nLocal. In machine learning algorithms images are typically treated as holistic entities (Krizhevsky\net al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020b), but real-world photos have rich spatial structures and local contents\ncan vary across the same scene (Asano et al., 2019). This became a strong motivation for the\nwell-known R-CNN series (Girshick et al., 2014; Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2015; He et al., 2017),\nespecially with Region-of-Interest (RoI) operations on local feature maps (Girshick, 2015). The same\nholds for contrastive or Siamese learning (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2021;\nGrill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021; Caron et al., 2021), where 2D signals are generally suppressed\ninto global vectors for inter-image contrast. Realizing its potential downside for localization, many\nfollow-up works (Xie et al., 2021c; Pinheiro et al., 2020; Roh et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021; Xie\net al., 2021a;b; Yang et al., 2021; Gansbeke et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; H\u00e9naff et al., 2022)\nhave shifted focus on intra-image contrast, which use features from local geometric entities (e.g.\npoints (Wang et al., 2021), regions (H\u00e9naff et al., 2021) or both (Bai et al., 2022)). Meanwhile,\nreconstructive methods (He et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022b) as\ndenoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008) preserve the 2D structure. It is therefore unclear how\nregions can further help in this regard.\nObject-centric. Reconstructive learning is the dominating paradigm in pre-training natural language\nrepresentations (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), and while steady progress is made (Chen\net al., 2020a; He et al., 2022), computer vision models are still lagging behind. One crucial difference\nbetween the two fields is that language consists of semantically meaningful discrete words, while\nimages are raw continuous signals recorded in pixels. Meanwhile, in vision, objects can serve as\na natural counterpart to words \u2013 they are constantly referred and manipulated as we interact with\nthe visual world (Koffka, 2013; Zhang & Maire, 2020), and they can often be captured, albeit not\nperfectly, by regions (Uijlings et al., 2013; Arbel\u00e1ez et al., 2014). By enhancing MAE\u2019s region\nawareness, we hope to uncover novel ways to bridge the gap between vision and language.\nNext we discuss how regions are generated and utilized:\n2\nSource of regions. Regions can come from various sources (e.g. human annotations (Lin et al.,\n2014), spatial heuristics (H\u00e9naff et al., 2021), clustering/segmentation (Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher,\n2004; Achanta et al., 2010), object proposals (Uijlings et al., 2013; Arbel\u00e1ez et al., 2014), or motion\nsegmentation (Pathak et al., 2017)). Most recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) proposed by\nKirillov et al. (2023) stands out as a universal model for generating region proposals. As an initial\nexploration, our study mainly focuses on pre-computed, clustering-based regions (Felzenszwalb &\nHuttenlocher, 2004), but we also verify the effectiveness of R-MAE using regions generated from\nSAM. Moreover, regions can be jointly discovered (H\u00e9naff et al., 2022) or updated (Bai et al., 2022)\nwith representation learning, which is left for future work.\nUse of regions. There are at least three other ways to leverage regions in MAE. One is to bias the\nrandom masking strategy (Li et al., 2022a), which is less general and can be sensitive to region\nqualities (Li et al., 2022a). Second is to revisit the RoI operation (Ren et al., 2015) and contrastive\nlearning, which is costly with Siamese encoders (He et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021), and has been\nextensively studied (H\u00e9naff et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2021b; Wei et al., 2021) even\nwith MAE (Zhou et al., 2022). Third is to view regions as an extra modality, and treat the task\nas a multi-modal learning one (e.g. with text (Geng et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022) or a depth\nmap (Bachmann et al., 2022)). This is closest to our work, yet the lightweight design of R-MAE\nmakes it especially well-suited to learn representations using regions.\n3\nAPPROACH\nBackground on Masked Autoencoding. Since Masked Autoencoding (MAE) (He et al., 2022) is\nthe foundation and baseline of our approach, we first summarize it as background knowledge. As the\nname suggests, MAE uniformly masks out a portion of an image and learns to reconstruct by directly\npredicting raw pixel values. To provide a meaningful and challenging task for images, a high mask\nratio \u03b2I (e.g. 75%) is used by default. The reconstruction is compared against the ground-truth with a\nsimple \u21132 loss.\nAs an autoencoder (Vincent et al., 2008), MAE instantiates its encoder and decoder with vision\ntransformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). ViTs directly \u2018tokenize\u2019 images as sequences of\npatches, which paves the way for MAE\u2019s efficient encoder pre-training that removes (and not\nreplaces) masked tokens. Given visible tokens from the pixel encoder, the fixed-sized (8-block, 512-\ndimensional) pixel decoder then reconstruct masked patches via pixel regression. After pre-training,\nthe pixel encoder is transferred as a visual backbone for downstream tasks (Li et al., 2022b).\n3.1\nRAE: MASKED REGION AUTOENCODING\nRegion maps. To perform masked region autoencoding, we first simply follow MAE and prepare\nthem to be \u2018image-like\u2019. Specifically, each region can be represented by a binary-valued region map\nsimilar in size to the image. Each element on the map, with a value of either in 0 or 1, indicates\nwhether the corresponding location belongs to the region or not. Now, given any partially visible\nregion map (mask ratio \u03b2R), we can ask the model to complete it, the same as MAE does for pixels.\nArchitecture. Similar to MAE, the proposed architecture contains an encoder and decoder for\nregion autoencoding. We follow MAE and simply use ViT blocks (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) for\nboth. However, just a region encoder-decoder pair is insufficient, as our ultimate goal is to obtain a\npre-trained pixel encoder. Therefore, we maintain the pixel encoder, and use a neck of a single ViT\nblock to match dimensions and (optionally) propagate information before feeding into the region\ndecoder. Such a configuration also makes effective use of the abundant contextual information\navailable in the pixels to pre-train the encoder. See Fig. 1 for an overview.\nOne-to-many mapping. While regions can be considered as an additional modality to pixel-based\nMAE, the problem addressed here presents a distinctive challenge that cannot be fully captured by\nthis view alone. Compared to other modalities (e.g. depth or semantic maps (Bachmann et al., 2022))\nfor which there is a one-to-one correspondence to pixels, the mapping between images and regions is\none-to-many: one pixel can belong to an unknown number of regions.\nOne na\u00efve implementation is to merge the k regions in the channel axis. In this way, they can be\nviewed as a single image, and the computations are shared in the intermediate blocks.

The masked region autoencoding as a standalone\ntask learns to reconstruct multiple region maps in parallel given visible region and image patches. The region\nencoder generates region embeddings by pooling features from visible region patches. The region decoder then\ntakes region embeddings and decodes them into region maps using image features from the pixel encoder. By\ntreating regions as queries, it effectively balances speed and accuracy. The design of our architecture allows its\nintegration with pixel reconstruction in MAE (de-highlighted).\nnatural images which have fixed channel orders (e.g., RGB), randomly sampled regions can appear in\nany order. It would be ideal if the solution preserves permutation equivariance.\nFortunately, this happens to be the very problem encountered in object detection. The mainstream\nsolution, as promoted by R-CNN (Girshick et al., 2014), is to sample and stack regions in the batch\naxis, and process each of them separately. In masked region autoencoding, this means each region\nmap will go through the encoder-decoder in isolation: If there are b images and k regions per image,\nthe network must be applied b\u00d7k times. This is expensive \u2013 so how to reduce the cost?\nStandard Cross-Attention\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nquery\nvalues\nWv\nattention \nscores\nweighted sum\nModified for Spatial Expansion\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nquery\nvalues\nWv\nFigure 2: The region query is spatially expanded in the length\nvariant. We modify the standard cross-attention layer (Carion\net al., 2020) (left). Given a region query, it is summed with all\nvalue vectors to expand its spatial axes (right). A small MLP\nhead is attached afterwards. This design enables the recon-\nstruction of region maps from the region queries efficiently.\nRegions as queries \u2013 the length variant.\nOur final idea is inspired by DETR se-\nries (Carion et al., 2020; Nguyen et al.,\n2022), which uses \u2018object queries\u2019 as sub-\nstrates to decode objects. In a nutshell,\neach region is first encoded and pooled\ninto a 1D embedding; then multiple region\nembeddings are concatenated along the se-\nquence length (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)\naxis to form \u2018region queries\u2019; and finally,\nthese region queries will decode region\nmaps from the output of the pixel encoder\n(through the neck, see Fig. 1 for details).\nSince ViT blocks are set operations w.r.t.\nthe input (Vaswani et al., 2017), this solu-\ntion is permutation equivariant by design.\nThe last decoder block is responsible for\nexpanding region queries spatially. Note\nthat because the decoder has two sets of\ninputs, its blocks follow the three-layer de-\nsign (Carion et al., 2020), with an extra\ncross-attention layer that uses outputs from\nthe neck to generate keys and values.

Since this variant alleviates the linear\ncomplexity w.r.t. number of regions k, and still maintains the desired property w.r.t. permutation, we\nchoose it as the default for RAE. Since this variant alleviates the linear complexity w.r.t. the number\nof regions k, and still maintains the desired property w.r.t. the permutation, we choose it as the default\nfor masked region autoencoding.\nLoss. While the \u21132 loss fits real-valued pixel predictions, by default we use the cross-entropy loss for\nbinary-valued regions which is effective for binary classification.\n3.2\nR-MAE: REGIONS MEET MAE\nAs masked region autoencoding is fully compatible with MAE, they can be trained in conjunction\nby simply restoring the pixel encoder and applying a joint loss with an equal weight (see Fig. 1).\nNote that: (i) The pixel branch feeds to the region branch, but not vice versa; (ii) The mask is shared\nbetween two branches which prevents information leak and creates a more challenging pre-text task.\nWe name this framework R-MAE, short for Region-aware Masked Autoencoding.\nInterestingly, Fig. 3 shows that when pre-trained with R-MAE using unsupervised, image-computable\nregion maps (Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher, 2004), ViT features are shown to be more instance-\naware. In particular, its attention map focuses more on the objects given the query compared to the\nreconstructive (MAE (He et al., 2022)) and contrastive (MoCo v3 (Chen et al., 2021)) baselines. The\nViT features pre-trained with R-MAE reveal its localization capabilities through the attention map,\nwith strong focus on objects across different locations.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\n4.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUPS\nSource of regions. By default, we use regions generated from the unsupervised, image-computable\nFelzenswalb-Huttenlocher (FH) algorithm (Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher, 2004). It is fast, efficient\nand covers the whole image that underlies classic object proposal methods (e.g. selective search (Ui-\njlings et al., 2013)). The use of FH region maps allows our self-supervised method to inherit the wide\napplicability on multiple domains. In addition, we also ablate regions from different sources such as,\npanoptic regions \u2013 ground-truth annotations from the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014), and regions\ngenerated by the SAM model (Kirillov et al., 2023).\n5\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\nnumber of regions (log-scale)\n45\n46\n47\n48\nCOCO detection box (APb)\nAPb\n40\n41\n42\n43\nADE20K segm.

Default settings are shaded in gray .\nPre-training datasets. Deviating from prior practices (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2022), we develop\nRAE and R-MAE by pre-training on COCO train2017 (Lin et al., 2014). This is due to the\nscene-centric nature of the images in COCO and the presence of ground-truth regions which can\nserve as useful oracles. Following (H\u00e9naff et al., 2021), FH is run at three scales: {500, 1000, 1500},\nwhich also set the minimum cluster sizes. Since this dataset (118k images) is significantly smaller\nthan ImageNet (1.4m), we pre-train for 4k epochs instead of 800 (He et al., 2022). For fairness, we\nalso pre-train ViTs with R-MAE on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) for 800/1600 epochs. In this case,\nwe extract FH region maps with a single scale of 1000 as in H\u00e9naff et al. (2021).\nOther pre-training details. Unless otherwise specified, we exactly follow MAE (He et al., 2022) for\nhyper-parameters. Our base learning rate is set to 1e-4, which offers better stability during training and\nmaintains the baseline performance (see Appendix). The length variant is used. ViT-B (Dosovitskiy\net al., 2020) is set as the pixel backbone, and a 1-block, 128-dimensional ViT is used for the neck, the\nregion encoder and the region decoder. A 3-layer MLP acts as the region predictor after the decoder\nblock. k=8 regions are randomly sampled per image with replacement, and a mask ratio of \u03b2R=0.75.\nWhen combined with pixel regression in MAE in R-MAE framework, the pixel branch feeds the\nregion branch, and the random masks are shared.\nDownstream transfers. The pre-trained vision transformers serve as the backbone for downstream\ntasks. We simply use the recipe from ViTDet (Li et al., 2022b) for object evaluation on COCO, and\nreport mean Average Precision (AP) for both box detection (APb) and instance segmentation (APm).\nSpecifically, the learning rate is linearly warmed up for the first 250 iterations and decayed at 0.9 and\n0.95 fractions of the total number of training steps by a factor 10. The input image size is 1024\u00d71024\nwith large-scale jitter between a scale range of [0.1, 2.0]. We finetune for 100 epochs with batch size\nof 64. For semantic segmentation, we evaluate on ADE20K and report mean Intersection-over-Union\n(mIoU) as the main metric following MAE (He et al., 2022) (e.g., run each setting 3 times and take\nthe mean). In sum, all hyper-parameters here are following standard practices for fair comparisons of\npre-training settings.\n4.2\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nAblation studies. In Tab. 1, we ablate the most important design choices in RAE and R-MAE: Tab. 1a\nshows the performance of the RAE alone w.r.t. the number of regions. RAE improves when more\n6\nregions per image are sampled during pre-training. From Tabs. 1b and 1c, we conclude the channel\nvariant is efficient due to the share of computation in the intermediate blocks of the architecture, but\nlags behind in the performance. This proves that learning permutation equivariance of multiple region\nmaps within an image is non-trivial. While the batch variant effectively deals with the permutation of\nregions and demonstrates strong performance, it comes with high computational cost (see Tab. 1b).\nBy treating regions as queries, the length variant provides the best trade-off between speed and\naccuracy, which is important to process multiple regions per image.\nIn Tab. 1d, we compare the performance of RAE with regions from different sources: FH regions as\nour default setting, panoptic regions from COCO ground-truth (Lin et al., 2014) and regions generated\nby SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023). While panoptic regions only improve on semantic segmentation,\nregion maps from SAM contribute to boost the performance of RAE by a large margin on all tasks\ncompared to the default FH regions. Surprisingly, RAE alone with SAM regions outperforms MAE\n(50.6 vs. 50.1 for APbox and 46.8 vs. 45.9 for mIoU) with less computational requirements (more\ndetails in Appendix). This validates that masked region autoencoding is an effective pre-text task\nespecially when fed with high-quality regions.\n60\n70\n75\n80\n90\nmask ratio\n46\n47\n48\nCOCO detection box (APb)\nAPb\n41\n42\n43\nADE20K segm.

Mask\nratio matters \u2013 we either change the region mask\nratio (\u03b2R) alone (above), or jointly change it with\nthe image mask ratio (\u03b2R=\u03b2I, bottom). In both\ncases, a high mask ratio (\u223c0.75) is required.\nWhile SAM regions are superior in accuracy, we still\nfocus on regions generated by FH (Felzenszwalb &\nHuttenlocher, 2004) \u2013 a fast and simple clustering\nalgorithm. Unlike SAM, FH algorithm is fully unsu-\npervised and therefore best aligned with the notion\nof self-supervised learning \u2013 our focus of research.\nWith FH regions, we show in Tab. 1e the results of\nour full pre-training pipeline, R-MAE, by integrat-\ning RAE and MAE. Specifically, we jointly optimize\nmasked region autoencoding with pixel reconstruc-\ntion from MAE in R-MAE. The asymmetric design\nthat only feeds representation from pixels to regions\n(\u2190) achieves the best results compared to joint (\u2194)\nand regions to pixels (\u2192). Thanks to the lightweight\nlength variant of our RAE, the improvement comes\nwith very minor computational costs: the region\nbranch only adds \u223c1% FLOPs to the MAE baseline\n(9.8b vs. 9.7b).2\nMask ratios. We study mask ratio as the most impor-\ntant hyper-parameter from MAE in Figs. 4a and 4b.\nStarting from the default value 0.75, we either vary\nthe region ratio alone, or jointly with the image one.\nIn both cases, we share the random masks whenever\npossible (among the image and its regions) to mini-\nmize the information leak. The results suggest that\na high mask ratio (\u223c0.75) is still required.\nNext, we generalize our finding and show that R-MAE performs well with high-quality regions from\nSAM, with more pre-training data, and on the long-tailed object detection task.\nmethod\nAPb\nAPm\nmIoU\nMAE\n50.1\n44.6\n45.9\nR-MAE\n51.4\n45.9\n47.1\nTable 2:\nPre-training on high-quality regions generated by\nSAM (Kirillov et al., 2023).

We show in Tab. 1d that RAE alone is an effective task when\nprovided high-quality regions.

(2022b) for LVIS. We directly evaluate the backbones pre-trained with FH regions on COCO\ntrain2017. The results are presented in Tab. 4, where we observe a similar gain as on COCO\ndetection. Notably, R-MAE shows a bigger improvement on the rare, or tail classes, suggesting the\npriors learned in R-MAE is more decoupled from category labels.\n# ep\nmethod\nFLOPs\nAPb\nAPm\nmIoU\n800\nSemMAE\n4.3\u00d7\n-\n-\n46.3\nMixedAE\n2.6\u00d7\n50.3\n43.5\n48.7\nR-MAE\n1\u00d7\n51.3\n45.7\n46.6\n1600\nMultiMAE\n2.5\u00d7\n-\n-\n46.2\nLoMaR\n1.8\u00d7\n51.4\n45.7\n-\nMixedAE\n2.6\u00d7\n51.5\n44.5\n49.8\nLong-Seq MAE\n4.3\u00d7\n52.1\n46.2\n-\nR-MAE\n1\u00d7\n52.3\n46.4\n47.5\nTable 5: State-of-the-art comparison with ImageNet\npre-training among MAE variants.

In Tab. 5 we summarize our comparison\namong latest MAE variants (Hu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022a; Chen et al., 2022a; Bachmann et al.,\n2022; Chen et al., 2023) on COCO object detection and instance segmentation, along with ADE20K\nsemantic segmentation. The transferring recipe follows ViTDet (Li et al., 2022b) for COCO object\ndetection and instance segmentation (i.e., 100 epochs with batch size of 64), and MAE (He et al.,\n2022) for ADE20K semantic segmentation (i.e., 100 epochs with batch size of 16). All methods are\npre-trained on ImageNet (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2022).\nR-MAE is the most efficient among all MAE variants in terms of computation in FLOPs. For example,\nLong-Seq MAE (Hu et al., 2022) and SemMAE (Li et al., 2022a) are more than 4\u00d7 as expensive due\nto a longer sequence length.\nIt should also be noted that MultiMAE (Bachmann et al., 2022) employs regions extracted from a\nstate-of-the-art detector (i.e., Mask2Former (Cheng et al., 2021)) and SemMAE (Li et al., 2022a)\nutilizes regions generated by a variant of iBot (Zhou et al., 2022). In contrast, R-MAE simply learns\nto reconstruct FH regions which can be generated by an efficient clustering algorithm.\nAcross all the methods compared, R-MAE achieves the best results on object detection and instance\nsegmentation. For semantic segmentation, it comes as a second, only behind the most recent MixedAE\nwork (Chen et al., 2023) which is more expensive in compute.\nTo complete our picture for comparison, we also included results with other types of ImageNet-based\npre-training in Tab. 6. This incudes supervised learning with labels, contrastive learning (Chen et al.,\n2021), and masked token prediction (Bao et al., 2022). We outperform on all the benchmarks.\nQualitative results. Fig. 5 shows the region reconstruction of R-MAE pre-trained with FH regions.\nR-MAE for interactive segmentation. Since the pre-training task is to complete regions, our\npre-trained R-MAE model can naturally act as \u2018interactive segmenter\u2019 (Sofiiuk et al., 2020). In fact,\n8\nImage\nGT region\nImage\nFH region\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on COCO val2017 images, using R-MAE pre-trained with unsupervised region\nmaps (Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher, 2004), and then applied on either COCO ground-truth regions (left column)\nor FH regions used during pre-training (right column).

While our focus is on representation learning, not on generation\nquality \u2013 which leads to distinctions in design (e.g., efficient decoding of multiple regions with the\nlength variant), R-MAE can still perform interactive segmentation, which we show next.\nSpecifically, we ask it to take the image along with some patches-of-interest as its inputs after\npre-training. In an interactive segmentation setting, these patches can be provided by user clicks\nor eye gazing. A reasonable model can then predict the object corresponding to the given patches.\nFrom Fig. 6, we can see that the pre-trained model can indeed predict high-quality regions even with\n90% of the patches masked, and continue to refine when more hints are supplied (from left to right).\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we presented a simple yet effective approach (R-MAE) to explore an important vision\nconcept \u2013 region in MAE (He et al., 2022). Through quantitative and qualitative results, we showed\nR-MAE is indeed more \u2018region-aware\u2019, and can consistently help downstream performance on\nlocalization-related tasks (e.g. detection and segmentation).\nLimitations. While regions share resemblances to words (e.g., in being discrete), there are other\naspects of words that regions may still lack (e.g., it\u2019s debatable if they provide enough semantics).\nTherefore, our work is still a first step towards truly closing the gap to words for large language\nmodels in NLP. Nevertheless, we believe our exploration is valuable towards uncovering the visual\nanalogue of words in computer vision, and can inspire more future efforts along this direction.\nWhile regions from SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) significantly boost the performance of R-MAE, SAM\nitself initializes from MAE, is computationally expensive, and requires large-scale learning with\nhuman in the loop. A possible next step is to nail down the true reason why SAM regions are helpful,\nand minimize the complexities in this pipeline.\n9\nA\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF R-MAE\nMasking strategy. Different from Li et al. (2022a) which deploys a biased sampling strategy using\nsemantic parts, we aim to verify the effectiveness of R-MAE without changing the distribution of\nmasked images. Therefore, during the pre-training stage, we simply follow the random uniform\nmasking strategy as used in MAE (He et al., 2022). To ensure the task on the region side is meaningful,\nwe first sample the mask applied to the image, then sample from region maps that have at least one\nvisible foreground patch.\nTo best describe our implemented model for masked region autoencoding (RAE) and the final R-MAE\nframework, we resort to a more mathematical formulation of the problem and our solutions below.\nBasic notations. We denote R \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7k as the region maps corresponding to the input image,\nwhere k is the number of regions, and H, W are the dimensions of the input. Our model first patchifies\nR, and then masks R with a ratio of \u03b2R. The patch size p used in the regions is the same as the input\nimage. The full sequence length is denoted by N = H\np \u00b7 W\np .\nRAE channel variant. Here, we merge k region maps in the channel dimension, resulting in an input\nsequence of visible patches vR \u2208 RN\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b2R)\u00d7(k\u00b7p\u00b7p). This can be seen as converting region maps\nR \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7k into an image of k channels. The region encoder takes vR as its input to generate\nregion embeddings:\nvrenc = R\u2212Encoder(vR),\n(1)\nwhere vrenc\u2208RN\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b2R)\u00d7pE is the region encoder\u2019s output.\nWe then add image features from the pixel encoder to the region embeddings from the region encoder.\nThe augmented visual features are passed into the region decoder in order to make predictions for\nmasked region patches:\nv\u2032\nrenc = MaskFill\n\u0000f(vrenc), [mask]\n\u0001\n,\n(2)\nvrdec = R\u2212Decoder\n\u0000v\u2032\nrenc + v\u2032\npenc\n\u0001\n,\n(3)\nwhere v\u2032\nrenc \u2208 RN\u00d7pD is the region embeddings filled with the [mask] token and vrdec \u2208 RN\u00d7pD is\nthe output of the region decoder.\nBy treating R as an image of k channels, the channel variant demonstrates great efficiency during the\npre-training process. This variant, however, fails to deal with the permutation equivariance between k\nregions \u2013 the shuffling of the outputs is not guaranteed given shuffled inputs.\nRAE batch variant. The RAE batch variant processes each region independently in the batch\ndimension. Note that the image features are shared among all k different regions.\nGiven R={Ri}k\ni=1, Ri \u2208 RH\u00d7W , our region encoder projects each visible patch of Ri into a region\nembedding:\nvrenci = R\u2212Encoder(vRi),\n(4)\nwhere vRi \u2208 RN\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b2R)\u00d7(p\u00b7p) are visible patches of Ri, and vrenci \u2208 RN\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b2R)\u00d7pE is the output of\nthe region encoder.\nWe then take the sum of the image features v\u2032\npenc and v\u2032\nrenci, and feed it to the region decoder for\nprediction:\nv\u2032\nrenci = MaskFill\n\u0000f(vrenci), [mask]\n\u0001\n,\n(5)\nvrdeci = R\u2212Decoder\n\u0000v\u2032\nrenci + v\u2032\npenc\n\u0001\n,\n(6)\nwhere v\u2032\npenc \u2208 RN\u00d7pD is the image features from the pixel encoder filled with [mask] token.\nSimilarly, v\u2032\nrenci \u2208 RN\u00d7pD is region embeddings filled with the [mask] token. Here, f : pE \u2192 pD\ndenotes the linear projection and vrdeci \u2208 RN\u00d7pD is the region decoder output which is then used to\npredict masked patches of Ri.\nWhile preserving the permutation equivariance3 of k region maps, the RAE batch variant can be\ncomputationally expensive and resource-intensive (i.e., the total number of FLOPs increases linearly\nw.r.t. k).\n3If one permutes the order for the k input regions, the output will be shuffled in the exactly same order.\n10\nQuery\nMoCo v3\nMAE\nR-MAE\nQuery\nMoCo v3\nMAE\nR-MAE\nFigure 7: Additional visualizations of attention maps on COCO val2017. In each group from left to right\nwe show the original image with the selected query (denoted by red square); three attention maps corresponding\nto the query generated from i) MoCo v3 (Chen et al., 2021); ii) MAE (He et al., 2022); and iii) R-MAE; all\npre-trained on COCO train2017. Darker red colors in the attention map have larger attention weights.\nRAE length variant. Inspired by the design of object queries in the DETR decoder (Carion et al.,\n2020), the RAE length variant encodes each region map into a single vector using region encoder.\nThe region queries will be concatenated along the sequence length dimension as follows:\nvrenci = AvgPool\n\u0000R\u2212Encoder(vRi)\n\u0001\n,\n(7)\nvemb = Concat(vrenc1, ..., vrenck),\n(8)\nwhere vRi \u2208 RN\u00b7(1\u2212\u03b2R)\u00d7(p\u00b7p) are visible patches of Ri, vrenci \u2208 RpE is the region embedding of i-th\nregion, vemb \u2208 Rk\u00d7pE denotes the region queries, and AvgPool is the average pooling operation.\nDifferent from the pixel decoder, the region decoder contains three sub-layers in each block: self-\nattention, cross-attention, and feed-forward (Vaswani et al., 2017). In addition, we use a Neck module\nto provide cross-attention with information from pixels as context. The blocks in Neck share the\nsame design as the ones in the pixel decoder:\nvcontext = Neck(v\u2032\npenc),\n(9)\nwhere v\u2032\npenc is the image features filled with [mask] tokens and vcontext \u2208 RN\u00d7pD is the output of\nNeck. The region decoder then decodes region queries with context information:\nvquery = R\u2212Decoder(f(vemb), vcontext),\n(10)\nwhere vquery \u2208 Rk\u00d7pD is the output of the query decoder. Since masked region autoencoding predicts\nR \u2208 Rk\u00d7H\u00d7W during the pre-training, we modify the cross-attention sub-layer of the last region\ndecoder layer to expand each region embedding in vquery into a region map as follow (see Fig. 2):\nvrdec = W \u22a4vcontext + vquery[:, None],\n(11)\nwhere W \u2208 RpD\u00d7pD is a learnable weight, vquery[:, None] \u2208 Rk\u00d71\u00d7pD4, and vrdec \u2208 Rk\u00d7N\u00d7pD. The\nexpansion in our cross-attention sub-layer can be viewed as the attention operation on each feature\nvector of vcontext (i.e., the attention score of a single feature over itself is equal to 1).

Let v\u2032\npenc denotes the output of the pixel encoder filled with [mask] token and v\u2032\nrenc\ndenotes the output of the region encoder filled with [mask] token before the pooling function. We\nexamine three different cross-feeding styles between regions and pixels: RAE \u2192 MAE (region-to-\npixel), RAE \u2190 MAE (pixel-to-region), and RAE \u2194 MAE (bidirectional). The default design in\nR-MAE follows RAE \u2190 MAE (e.g. see Fig. 1), and we detail the other two below.\nIn RAE \u2192 MAE (region-to-pixel), we add region features to the pixel features and feed it as the input\nto the pixel decoder in order to regress the masked image patches:\nv\u2032\nrenci = MaskFill\n\u0000h(vrenci), [mask]\n\u0001\n,\n(12)\nv\u2032\nrenc = Concat(v\u2032\nrenc1, ..., v\u2032\nrenck),\n(13)\nvpdec = P\u2212Decoder\n\u0010\nv\u2032\npenc + AvgPool\n\u0000v\u2032\nrenc\n\u0001\u0011\n,\n(14)\nwhere dD is the dimension of pixel decoder, v\u2032\nrenci \u2208 RN\u00d7dD is the output of the region encoder filled\nwith [mask] token for i-th region, and h : pE\u2192dD is a linear projection layer.\nRAE \u2194 MAE (bidirectional) feed in both directions.\nB\nMORE COMPARISONS OF OUR MAE VS.

We first show the comparison of MAE with different base learning rates: 1.5e-\n4 in (He et al., 2022) and 1e-4 in our study.

All other settings are set as default. Tab. 7 shows that MAE\nwith 1e-4 rate is able to reproduce ViTDet (Li et al., 2022b). The only reason for this change is\nbetter pre-training stability which allows us to incorporate additional loss from the masked region\nautoencoding.

To further validate the design of masked region autoencoding (RAE), we explore\nbetter regions generated by an off-the-shelf segmentation model from SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) to\nreplace FH. With a larger region decoder and mask ratio 60%, RAE alone can achieve better results\nthan MAE with less compute in FLOPs as shown in Tab. 8. Interestingly, we find that RAE with\nhigh-quality regions from SAM benefits from a masking ratio of 60%. We hypothesize that SAM\nregions contain highly semantic information that is of less redundancy and therefore require a lower\nmasking ratio (i.e., the masked language modeling only predicts a few missing words \u223c15%).\npre-train\nViT-Base\nViT-Large\nAPb\nAPm\nmIoU\nFLOPs\nAPb\nAPm\nmIoU\nFLOPs\nMAE\n51.8\n46.1\n47.9\n9.7b\n55.6\n49.3\n52.3\n20.6b\nR-MAE\n52.3\n46.4\n47.5\n9.8b\n55.8\n49.7\n52.5\n20.7b\nTable 9: Larger backbones pre-trained on ImageNet.

To give a more complete assessment, we also evaluate our pre-trained\nmodels on ImageNet classification. To be consistent with MAE (He et al., 2022), we pre-train the\nViT with R-MAE on ImageNet for 1600 epochs. It can be seen from Tab. 10 that our R-MAE\nachieves the same performance with MAE when being fine-tuned end-to-end. Interestingly, the linear\nprobing performance of R-MAE lags behind MAE by a large margin. This observation indicates that\nour R-MAE is more focused on local patterns rather than global average features suited for image\nclassification.\nC\nADDITIONAL VISUALIZATIONS\nWe provide extra qualitative results of our pre-trained models in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.\n13\nD\nASSET LICENSES\nDataset\nLicense\nImageNet (Deng et al., 2009)\nhttps://image-net.org/download.php\nCOCO (Lin et al., 2014)\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\nADE20K (Zhou et al., 2019)\nCreative Commons BSD-3 License Agreement\nLVIS (Gupta et al., 2019)\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\nREFERENCES\nRadhakrishna Achanta, Appu Shaji, Kevin Smith, Aurelien Lucchi, Pascal Fua, and Sabine S\u00fcsstrunk.\nSlic superpixels.

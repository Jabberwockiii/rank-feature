QLORA backpropagates gradi-\nents through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\nAdapters (LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms\nall previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3%\nof the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning\non a single GPU. QLORA introduces a number of innovations to save memory\nwithout sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that\nis information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double\nQuantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization\nconstants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. We use QLORA\nto finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction\nfollowing and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model\ntypes (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular\nfinetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA\nfinetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even\nwhen using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis\nof chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that\nGPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Fur-\nthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately\nevaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates\nwhere Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code,\nincluding CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.2\n1\nIntroduction\nFinetuning large language models (LLMs) is a highly effective way to improve their performance,\n[40, 62, 43, 61, 59, 37] and to add desirable or remove undesirable behaviors [43, 2, 4]. However,\nfinetuning very large models is prohibitively expensive; regular 16-bit finetuning of a LLaMA 65B\nparameter model [57] requires more than 780 GB of GPU memory. While recent quantization\nmethods can reduce the memory footprint of LLMs [14, 13, 18, 66], such techniques only work for\ninference and break down during training [65].\nWe demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to finetune a quantized 4-bit model without any\nperformance degradation. Our method, QLORA, uses a novel high-precision technique to quantize\na pretrained model to 4-bit, then adds a small set of learnable Low-rank Adapter weights [28]\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n2https://github.com/artidoro/qlora and https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes\nPreprint.

After GPT-\n4, Guanaco 33B and 65B win the most matches,\nwhile Guanaco 13B scores better than Bard.\nModel\nSize\nElo\nGPT-4\n-\n1348 \u00b1 1\nGuanaco 65B\n41 GB\n1022 \u00b1 1\nGuanaco 33B\n21 GB\n992 \u00b1 1\nVicuna 13B\n26 GB\n974 \u00b1 1\nChatGPT\n-\n966 \u00b1 1\nGuanaco 13B\n10 GB\n916 \u00b1 1\nBard\n-\n902 \u00b1 1\nGuanaco 7B\n6 GB\n879 \u00b1 1\nthat are tuned by backpropagating gradients through\nthe quantized weights.\nQLORA reduces the average memory requirements\nof finetuning a 65B parameter model from >780GB\nof GPU memory to <48GB without degrading the\nruntime or predictive performance compared to a 16-\nbit fully finetuned baseline. This marks a significant\nshift in accessibility of LLM finetuning: now the\nlargest publicly available models to date finetunable\non a single GPU. Using QLORA, we train the Gua-\nnaco family of models, with the second best model\nreaching 97.8% of the performance level of ChatGPT\non the Vicuna [10] benchmark, while being trainable\nin less than 12 hours on a single consumer GPU;\nusing a single professional GPU over 24 hours we\nachieve 99.3% with our largest model, essentially\nclosing the gap to ChatGPT on the Vicuna bench-\nmark. When deployed, our smallest Guanaco model\n(7B parameters) requires just 5 GB of memory and outperforms a 26 GB Alpaca model by more than\n20 percentage points on the Vicuna benchmark (Table 6).\nQLORA introduces multiple innovations designed to reduce memory use without sacrificing per-\nformance: (1) 4-bit NormalFloat, an information theoretically optimal quantization data type for\nnormally distributed data that yields better empirical results than 4-bit Integers and 4-bit Floats.\n(2) Double Quantization, a method that quantizes the quantization constants, saving an average\nof about 0.37 bits per parameter (approximately 3 GB for a 65B model). (3) Paged Optimizers,\nusing NVIDIA unified memory to avoid the gradient checkpointing memory spikes that occur when\nprocessing a mini-batch with a long sequence length. We combine these contributions into a better\ntuned LoRA approach that includes adapters at every network layer and thereby avoids almost all of\nthe accuracy tradeoffs seen in prior work.\nQLORA\u2019s efficiency enables us to perform an in-depth study of instruction finetuning and chatbot\nperformance on model scales that would be impossible using regular finetuning due to memory\noverhead. Therefore, we train more than 1,000 models across several instruction tuning datasets,\nmodel architectures, and sizes between 80M to 65B parameters. In addition to showing that QLORA\nrecovers 16-bit performance (\u00a74) and training a state-of-the-art chatbot, Guanaco, (\u00a75), we also\nanalyze trends in the trained models. First, we find that data quality is far more important than\ndataset size, e.g., a 9k sample dataset (OASST1) outperformed a 450k sample dataset (FLAN v2,\nsubsampled) on chatbot performance, even when both are meant to support instruction following\ngeneralization. Second, we show that strong Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\nbenchmark performance does not imply strong Vicuna chatbot benchmark performance and vice\nversa\u2014in other words, dataset suitability matters more than size for a given task.\nFurthermore, we also provide a extensive analysis of chatbot performance that uses both human\nraters and GPT-4 for evaluation. We use tournament-style benchmarking where models compete\nagainst each other in matches to produce the best response for a given prompt. The winner of a\nmatch is judged by either GPT-4 or human annotators. The tournament results are aggregated into\nElo scores [16, 17] which determine the ranking of chatbot performance. We find that GPT-4 and\nhuman evaluations largely agree on the rank of model performance in the tournaments, but we also\nfind there are instances of strong disagreement. As such, we highlight that model-based evaluation\nwhile providing a cheap alternative to human-annotation also has its uncertainties.\nWe augment our chatbot benchmark results with a qualitative analysis of Guanaco models. Our analy-\nsis highlights success and failure cases that were not captured by the quantitative benchmarks.\nWe release all model generations with human and GPT-4 annotations to facilitate further study. We\nopen-source our codebase and CUDA kernels and integrate our methods into the Hugging Face\ntransformers stack [64], making them easily accessible to all. We release a collection of adapters\nfor 7/13/33/65B size models, trained on 8 different instruction following datasets, for a total of 32\ndifferent open sourced, finetuned models.\n2\nFigure 1: Different finetuning methods and their memory requirements. QLORA improves over LoRA by\nquantizing the transformer model to 4-bit precision and using paged optimizers to handle memory spikes.\n2\nBackground\nBlock-wise k-bit Quantization\nQuantization is the process of discretizing an input from a rep-\nresentation that holds more information to a representation with less information. It often means\ntaking a data type with more bits and converting it to fewer bits, for example from 32-bit floats to\n8-bit Integers. To ensure that the entire range of the low-bit data type is used, the input data type is\ncommonly rescaled into the target data type range through normalization by the absolute maximum\nof the input elements, which are usually structured as a tensor. For example, quantizing a 32-bit\nFloating Point (FP32) tensor into a Int8 tensor with range [\u2212127, 127]:\nXInt8 = round\n\u0012\n127\nabsmax(XFP32)XFP32\n\u0013\n= round(cFP32 \u00b7 XFP32),\n(1)\nwhere c is the quantization constant or quantization scale. Dequantization is the inverse:\ndequant(cFP32, XInt8) = XInt8\ncFP32 = XFP32\n(2)\nThe problem with this approach is that if a large magnitude value (i.e., an outlier) occurs in the input\ntensor, then the quantization bins\u2014certain bit combinations\u2014are not utilized well with few or no\nnumbers quantized in some bins. To prevent the outlier issue, a common approach is to chunk the\ninput tensor into blocks that are independently quantized, each with their own quantization constant c.\nThis can be formalized as follows: We chunk the input tensor X \u2208 Rb\u00d7h into n contiguous blocks of\nsize B by flattening the input tensor and slicing the linear segment into n = (b \u00d7 h)/B blocks. We\nquantize these blocks independently with Equation 1 to create a quantized tensor and n quantization\nconstants ci.\nLow-rank Adapters\nLow-rank Adapter (LoRA) finetuning [28] is a method that reduces memory\nrequirements by using a small set of trainable parameters, often termed adapters, while not updating\nthe full model parameters which remain fixed. Gradients during stochastic gradient descent are\npassed through the fixed pretrained model weights to the adapter, which is updated to optimize the\nloss function. LoRA augments a linear projection through an additional factorized projection. Given\na projection XW = Y with X \u2208 Rb\u00d7h, W \u2208 Rh\u00d7o LoRA computes:\nY = XW + sXL1L2,\n(3)\nwhere L1 \u2208 Rh\u00d7r and L2 \u2208 Rr\u00d7o, and s is a scalar.\nMemory Requirement of Parameter-Efficient Finetuning\nOne important point of discussion is\nthe memory requirement of LoRA during training both in terms of the number and size of adapters\nused. Since the memory footprint of LoRA is so minimal, we can use more adapters to improve\nperformance without significantly increasing the total memory used. While LoRA was designed as a\n3\nParameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) method, most of the memory footprint for LLM finetuning\ncomes from activation gradients and not from the learned LoRA parameters. For a 7B LLaMA\nmodel trained on FLAN v2 with a batch size of 1, with LoRA weights equivalent to commonly used\n0.2% of the original model weights[28, 37], the LoRA input gradients have a memory footprint\nof 567 MB while the LoRA parameters take up only 26 MB. With gradient checkpointing [9], the\ninput gradients reduce to an average of 18 MB per sequence making them more memory intensive\nthan all LoRA weights combined. In comparison, the 4-bit base model consumes 5,048 MB of\nmemory. This highlights that gradient checkpointing is important but also that aggressively reducing\nthe amount of LoRA parameter yields only minor memory benefits. This means we can use more\nadapters without significantly increasing the overall training memory footprint (see Appendix G\nfor a detailed breakdown). As discussed later, this is crucial for recovering full 16-bit precision\nperformance.\n3\nQLORA Finetuning\nQLORA achieves high-fidelity 4-bit finetuning via two techniques we propose\u20144-bit NormalFloat\n(NF4) quantization and Double Quantization. Additionally, we introduce Paged Optimizers, to\nprevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing from causing out-of-memory errors that have\ntraditionally made finetuning on a single machine difficult for large models.\nQLORA has one low-precision storage data type, in our case usually 4-bit, and one computation data\ntype that is usually BFloat16. In practice, this means whenever a QLORA weight tensor is used, we\ndequantize the tensor to BFloat16, and then perform a matrix multiplication in 16-bit.\nWe now discuss the components of QLORA followed by a formal definition of QLORA.\n4-bit NormalFloat Quantization\nThe NormalFloat (NF) data type builds on Quantile Quantization\n[15] which is an information-theoretically optimal data type that ensures each quantization bin has an\nequal number of values assigned from the input tensor. Quantile quantization works by estimating\nthe quantile of the input tensor through the empirical cumulative distribution function.\nThe main limitation of quantile quantization is that the process of quantile estimation is expensive.\nTherefore fast quantile approximation algorithms, such as SRAM quantiles [15], are used to estimate\nthem. Due to the approximate nature of these quantile estimation algorithms, the data type has large\nquantization errors for outliers, which are often the most important values.\nExpensive quantile estimates and approximation errors can be avoided when input tensors come from\na distribution fixed up to a quantization constant. In such cases, input tensors have the same quantiles\nmaking exact quantile estimation computationally feasible.\nSince pretrained neural network weights usually have a zero-centered normal distribution with\nstandard deviation \u03c3 (see Appendix F), we can transform all weights to a single fixed distribution by\nscaling \u03c3 such that the distribution fits exactly into the range of our data type. For our data type, we\nset the arbitrary range [\u22121, 1]. As such, both the quantiles for the data type and the neural network\nweights need to be normalized into this range.\nThe information theoretically optimal data type for zero-mean normal distributions with arbitrary\nstandard deviations \u03c3 in the range [\u22121, 1] is computed as follows: (1) estimate the 2k + 1 quantiles\nof a theoretical N(0, 1) distribution to obtain a k-bit quantile quantization data type for normal distri-\nbutions, (2) take this data type and normalize its values into the [\u22121, 1] range, (3) quantize an input\nweight tensor by normalizing it into the [\u22121, 1] range through absolute maximum rescaling.\nOnce the weight range and data type range match, we can quantize as usual. Step (3) is equivalent to\nrescaling the standard deviation of the weight tensor to match the standard deviation of the k-bit data\ntype. More formally, we estimate the 2k values qi of the data type as follows:\nqi = 1\n2\n\u0012\nQX\n\u0012\ni\n2k + 1\n\u0013\n+ QX\n\u0012 i + 1\n2k + 1\n\u0013\u0013\n,\n(4)\nwhere QX(\u00b7) is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution N(0, 1). A problem for\na symmetric k-bit quantization is that this approach does not have an exact representation of zero,\nwhich is an important property to quantize padding and other zero-valued elements with no error. To\n4\nensure a discrete zeropoint of 0 and to use all 2k bits for a k-bit datatype, we create an asymmetric\ndata type by estimating the quantiles qi of two ranges qi: 2k\u22121 for the negative part and 2k\u22121 + 1 for\nthe positive part and then we unify these sets of qi and remove one of the two zeros that occurs in both\nsets. We term the resulting data type that has equal expected number of values in each quantization bin\nk-bit NormalFloat (NFk), since the data type is information-theoretically optimal for zero-centered\nnormally distributed data. The exact values of this data type can be found in Appendix E.\nDouble Quantization\nWe introduce Double Quantization (DQ), the process of quantizing the\nquantization constants for additional memory savings. While a small blocksize is required for precise\n4-bit quantization [13], it also has a considerable memory overhead. For example, using 32-bit\nconstants and a blocksize of 64 for W, quantization constants add 32/64 = 0.5 bits per parameter on\naverage. Double Quantization helps reduce the memory footprint of quantization constants.\nMore specifically, Double Quantization treats quantization constants cFP32\n2\nof the first quantization\nas inputs to a second quantization. This second step yields the quantized quantization constants\ncFP8\n2\nand the second level of quantization constants cFP32\n1\n. We use 8-bit Floats with a blocksize of\n256 for the second quantization as no performance degradation is observed for 8-bit quantization,\nin line with results from Dettmers and Zettlemoyer [13]. Since the cFP32\n2\nare positive, we subtract\nthe mean from c2 before quantization to center the values around zero and make use of symmetric\nquantization. On average, for a blocksize of 64, this quantization reduces the memory footprint per\nparameter from 32/64 = 0.5 bits, to 8/64 + 32/(64 \u00b7 256) = 0.127 bits, a reduction of 0.373 bits\nper parameter.\nPaged Optimizers\nuse the NVIDIA unified memory 3 feature wich does automatic page-to-page\ntransfers between the CPU and GPU for error-free GPU processing in the scenario where the GPU\noccasionally runs out-of-memory. The feature works like regular memory paging between CPU RAM\nand the disk. We use this feature to allocate paged memory for the optimizer states which are then\nautomatically evicted to CPU RAM when the GPU runs out-of-memory and paged back into GPU\nmemory when the memory is needed in the optimizer update step.\nQLORA.\nUsing the components described above, we define QLORA for a single linear layer in\nthe quantized base model with a single LoRA adapter as follows:\nYBF16 = XBF16doubleDequant(cFP32\n1\n, ck-bit\n2\n, WNF4) + XBF16LBF16\n1\nLBF16\n2\n,\n(5)\nwhere doubleDequant(\u00b7) is defined as:\ndoubleDequant(cFP32\n1\n, ck-bit\n2\n, Wk-bit) = dequant(dequant(cFP32\n1\n, ck-bit\n2\n), W4bit) = WBF16,\n(6)\nWe use NF4 for W and FP8 for c2. We use a blocksize of 64 for W for higher quantization precision\nand a blocksize of 256 for c2 to conserve memory.\nFor parameter updates only the gradient with respect to the error for the adapters weights \u2202E\n\u2202Li are\nneeded, and not for 4-bit weights \u2202E\n\u2202W. However, the calculation of \u2202E\n\u2202Li entails the calculation of \u2202X\n\u2202W\nwhich proceeds via equation (5) with dequantization from storage WNF4 to computation data type\nWBF16 to calculate the derivative \u2202X\n\u2202W in BFloat16 precision.\nTo summarize, QLORA has one storage data type (usually 4-bit NormalFloat) and a computation\ndata type (16-bit BrainFloat). We dequantize the storage data type to the computation data type\nto perform the forward and backward pass, but we only compute weight gradients for the LoRA\nparameters which use 16-bit BrainFloat.\n4\nQLoRA vs. Standard Finetuning\nWe have discussed how QLoRA works and how it can significantly reduce the required memory for\nfinetuning models. The main question now is whether QLoRA can perform as well as full-model\nfinetuning. Furthermore, we want to analyze the components of QLoRA including the impact of\nNormalFloat4 over standard Float4. The following sections will discuss the experiments that aimed\nat answering these questions.\n3https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide\n5\nExperimental setup.\nWe consider three architectures (encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder only)\nand compare QLoRA with 16-bit adapter-finetuning and with full-finetuning for models up to 3B. Our\nevaluations include GLUE [58] with RoBERTa-large [38], Super-NaturalInstructions (TKInstruct)\n[61] with T5 [49], and 5-shot MMLU [24] after finetuning LLaMA on Flan v2 [39] and Alpaca\n[55]. To additionally study the advantages of NF4 over other 4-bit data types, we use the setup of\nDettmers and Zettlemoyer [13] and measure post-quantization zero-shot accuracy and perplexity\nacross different models (OPT [72], LLaMA [57], BLOOM [52], Pythia [7]) for model sizes 125m -\n13B. We provide more details in the results section for each particular setup to make the results more\nreadable. Full details in Appendix A.\nQLoRA-All\nQLoRA-FFN\nQLoRA-Attention\nAlpaca (ours)\nStanford-Alpaca\nModel\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\nRougeL\nbits\n4\n16\nFigure 2: RougeL for LLaMA 7B models on the\nAlpaca dataset. Each point represents a run with a\ndifferent random seed. We improve on the Stanford\nAlpaca fully finetuned default hyperparameters to\nconstruct a strong 16-bit baseline for comparisons.\nUsing LoRA on all transformer layers is critical to\nmatch 16-bit performance.\nWhile paged optimizers are critical to do 33B/65B\nQLORA tuning on a single 24/48GB GPU, we do\nnot provide hard measurements for Paged Optimiz-\ners since the paging only occurs when processing\nmini-batches with long sequence lengths, which is\nrare. We do, however, perform an analysis of the\nruntime of paged optimizers for 65B models on\n48GB GPUs and find that with a batch size of 16,\npaged optimizers provide the same training speed\nas regular optimizers. Future work should measure\nand characterize under what circumstances slow-\ndowns occur from the paging process.\nDefault LoRA hyperparameters do not match 16-\nbit performance\nWhen using the standard prac-\ntice of applying LoRA to query and value attention\nprojection matrices [28], we are not able to replicate\nfull finetuning performance for large base models.\nAs shown in Figure 2 for LLaMA 7B finetuning on\nAlpaca, we find that the most critical LoRA hyper-\nparameter is how many LoRA adapters are used in\ntotal and that LoRA on all linear transformer block\nlayers are required to match full finetuning perfor-\nmance. Other LoRA hyperparameters, such as the\nprojection dimension r, do not affect performance (see Appendix A).\n1010\n1011\nTotal model bits\n0.60\n0.61\n0.62\n0.63\n0.64\n0.65\n0.66\n0.67\nMean zeroshot accuracy\n4-bit LLaMA\nFloat\nNFloat\nNFloat + DQ\nData type\nFigure 3: Mean zero-shot accuracy over Wino-\ngrande, HellaSwag, PiQA, Arc-Easy, and Arc-\nChallenge using LLaMA models with different 4-bit\ndata types. The NormalFloat data type significantly\nimproves the bit-for-bit accuracy gains compared\nto regular 4-bit Floats. While Double Quantization\n(DQ) only leads to minor gains, it allows for a more\nfine-grained control over the memory footprint to fit\nmodels of certain size (33B/65B) into certain GPUs\n(24/48GB).\nSimilarly, we find that default hyperparameters for\nfully finetuned baselines are undertuned. We do a\nhyperparameter search over learning rates 1e-6 to\n5e-5 and batch sizes 8 to 128 to find robust baselines.\nResults for 7B LLaMA finetuning on Alpaca are\nshown in Figure 2.\n4-bit NormalFloat yields better performance\nthan 4-bit Floating Point\nWhile the 4-bit\nNormalFloat (NF4) data type is information-\ntheoretically optimal, it still needs to be determined\nif this property translates to empirical advantages.\nWe follow the setup from Dettmers and Zettlemoyer\n[13] where quantized LLMs (OPT [72], BLOOM\n[52], Pythia [7], LLaMA) of different sizes (125M\nto 65B) with different data types are evaluated on\nlanguage modeling and a set of zero-shot tasks. In\nFigure 3 and Table 2 we see that NF4 improves per-\nformance significantly over FP4 and Int4 and that\ndouble quantization reduces the memory footprint\nwithout degrading performance.\nk-bit QLORA matches 16-bit full finetuning and\n16-bit LoRA performance\nRecent findings have\nestablished that 4-bit quantization for inference is\n6\nTable 3: Experiments comparing 16-bit BrainFloat (BF16), 8-bit Integer (Int8), 4-bit Float (FP4), and 4-\nbit NormalFloat (NF4) on GLUE and Super-NaturalInstructions.

This raises the crucial question of whether the lost performance can be\nrecovered by conducting 4-bit adapter finetuning. We test this for two setups.\nTable 2: Pile Common Crawl mean\nperplexity for different data types\nfor 125M to 13B OPT, BLOOM,\nLLaMA, and Pythia models.\nData type\nMean PPL\nInt4\n34.34\nFloat4 (E2M1)\n31.07\nFloat4 (E3M0)\n29.48\nNFloat4 + DQ\n27.41\nThe first focuses on a comparison with full 16-bit finetuning\nof RoBERTA and T5 models sized 125M to 3B parameters on\nGLUE and the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset. Results are\nshown in Table 3. In both datasets, we observe that 16-bit, 8-bit,\nand 4-bit adapter methods replicate the performance of the fully\nfinetuned 16-bit baseline. This suggests that the performance lost\ndue to the imprecise quantization can be fully recovered through\nadapter finetuning after quantization.\nFor our second setup, since full finetuning models at and beyond\n11B parameters requires more than one server of high memory\nGPUs, we continue to test whether 4-bit QLORA can match\n16-bit LoRA at the 7B to 65B parameter scales. To this end, we\nfinetune LLaMA 7B through 65B on two instruction following\ndatasets, Alpaca and FLAN v2, and evaluate on the MMLU benchmark via 5-shot accuracy. Results\nare shown in Table 4 where we see that NF4 with double quantization fully recovers the 16-bit\nLoRA MMLU performance. In addition, we also note that QLORA with FP4 lags behind the 16-bit\nbrain float LoRA baseline by about 1 percentage point. This corroborates both our findings that (1)\nQLORA with NF4 replicates both 16-bit full finetuning and 16-bit LoRA finetuning performance,\nand (2) NF4 is superior to FP4 in terms of quantization precision.\nSummary\nOur results consistently show that 4-bit QLORA with NF4 data type matches 16-\nbit full finetuning and 16-bit LoRA finetuning performance on academic benchmarks with well-\nestablished evaluation setups. We have also shown that NF4 is more effective than FP4 and that\ndouble quantization does not degrade performance. Combined, this forms compelling evidence that\n4-bit QLORA tuning reliably yields results matching 16-bit methods.\nIn line with previous work on quantization [13], our MMLU and Elo results indicate that with a given\nfinetuning and inference resource budget it is beneficial to increase the number of parameters in the\nbase model while decreasing their precision. This highlights the importance of efficiency benefits\nfrom QLORA. Since we did not observe performance degradation compared to full-finetuning in\nour experiments with 4-bit finetuning, this raises the question of where the performance-precision\ntrade-off exactly lies for QLoRA tuning, which we leave to future work to explore.\nWe proceed to investigate instruction tuning at scales that would be impossible to explore with full\n16-bit finetuning on academic research hardware.\n5\nPushing the Chatbot State-of-the-art with QLoRA\nHaving established that 4-bit QLORA matches 16-bit performance across scales, tasks, and datasets\nwe conduct an in-depth study of instruction finetuning up to the largest open-source language models\navailable for research. To assess the performance of instruction finetuning these models, we evaluate\n7\nTable 4: Mean 5-shot MMLU test accuracy for LLaMA 7-65B models finetuned with adapters on Alpaca and\nFLAN v2 for different data types.

We include datasets obtained through crowd-sourcing (OASST1 [31],\nHH-RLHF [4]), distillation from instruction-tuned models (Alpaca [55], self-instruct [59], unnatural-\ninstructions [26]), corpora aggregations (FLAN v2 [12]), as well as hybrids (Chip2 [32], Long-\nform [30]). These datasets cover different languages, data sizes, and licenses.\nTraining Setup\nTo avoid confounding effects from different training objectives, we perform QLoRA\nfinetuning with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning) without reinforcement learning, even for\ndatasets that include human judgments of different responses. For datasets that have a clear distinction\nbetween instruction and response, we finetune only on the response (see ablations in Appendix B).\nFor OASST1 and HH-RLHF, multiple responses are available. We then select the top response at\nevery level of the conversation tree and finetune on the full selected conversation, including the\ninstructions. In all of our experiments, we use NF4 QLORA with double quantization and paged\noptimizers to prevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing. We do small hyperparameter\nsearches for the 13B and 33B LLaMA models and we find that all hyperparameter settings found\nat 7B generalize (including number of epochs) except learning rate and batch size. We halve the\nlearning rate for 33B and 65B while doubling the batch size.\nBaselines\nWe compare our models to both research (Vicuna [10] and Open Assistant [31]) and\ncommercial (GPT-4 [42], GPT-3.5-turbo and Bard) chatbot systems. The Open Assistant model is\na LLaMA 33B model finetuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on\nthe same OASST1 dataset that we experiment with. Vicuna does full fine-tuning of LLaMA 13B\non proprietary user-shared conversations from ShareGPT and is thus the result of distillation from\nOpenAI GPT models.\n5.2\nEvaluation\nTable 5: MMLU 5-shot test results for different\nsizes of LLaMA finetuned on the corresponding\ndatasets using QLoRA.\nDataset\n7B\n13B\n33B\n65B\nLLaMA no tuning\n35.1\n46.9\n57.8\n63.4\nSelf-Instruct\n36.4\n33.3\n53.0\n56.7\nLongform\n32.1\n43.2\n56.6\n59.7\nChip2\n34.5\n41.6\n53.6\n59.8\nHH-RLHF\n34.9\n44.6\n55.8\n60.1\nUnnatural Instruct\n41.9\n48.1\n57.3\n61.3\nGuanaco (OASST1)\n36.6\n46.4\n57.0\n62.2\nAlpaca\n38.8\n47.8\n57.3\n62.5\nFLAN v2\n44.5\n51.4\n59.2\n63.9\nFollowing common practice, we use the MMLU (Mas-\nsively Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark\n[24] to measure performance on a range of language un-\nderstanding tasks. This is a multiple-choice benchmark\ncovering 57 tasks including elementary mathematics,\nUS history, computer science, law, and more. We report\n5-shot test accuracy.\nWe also test generative language capabilities through\nboth automated and human evaluations. This second\nset of evaluations relies on queries curated by humans\nand aims at measuring the quality of model responses.\nWhile this is a more realistic testbed for chatbot model\nperformance and is growing in popularity, there is no\ncommonly accepted protocol in the literature. We de-\nscribe below our proposed setup, using nucleus sampling with p = 0.9 and temperature 0.7 in all\ncases.\n8\nBenchmark Data\nWe evaluate on two curated datasets of queries (questions): the Vicuna prompts\n[10] and the OASST1 validation dataset [31]. We use the Vicuna prompts, a set of 80 prompts from a\ndiverse set of categories, without modifications. The OASST1 dataset is a multilingual collection of\ncrowd-sourced multiturn dialogs between a user and an assistant. We select all user messages in the\nvalidation dataset as queries and include previous turns in the prompt. This procedure leads to 953\nunique user queries. We term these two datasets the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\nAutomated Evaluation\nFirst, based on the evaluation protocol introduced by Chiang et al. [10],\nwe use GPT-4 to rate the performance of different systems against ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) on the\nVicuna benchmark. Given a query along with ChatGPT\u2019s and a model\u2019s responses, GPT-4 is prompted\nto assign a score out of ten to both responses and provide an explanation. The overall performance of\na model is calculated as a percentage of the score that ChatGPT achieved. Note this relative score\ncan be higher than 100% if the model achieves a higher absolute score than ChatGPT. We find a\nsignificant ordering effect with GPT-4 increasing the score of the response occurring earlier in the\nprompt. To control for such effects, we recommend reporting the mean score over both orders.\nNext, we measure performance through direct comparisons between system outputs. We simplify\nthe rating scheme to a three-class labeling problem that accounts for ties. We prompt GPT-4 to\npick the best response or declare a tie and provide an explanation. We conduct these head-to-head\ncomparisons on all permutations of pairs of systems on both the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\nHuman Evaluation\nWhile recent work indicates generative models can be effectively employed\nfor system evaluations [19], the reliability GPT-4 ratings to assess chatbot performance is, to our\nknowledge, yet to be proven to correlate with human judgments. Therefore, we run two parallel\nhuman evaluations on the Vicuna benchmark matching both automated evaluation protocols described\nabove. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and get two human annotators for comparisons to\nChatGPT and three annotators for pairwise comparisons.\nElo Rating\nWith both human and automated pairwise comparisons, we create a tournament-style\ncompetition where models compete against each other. The tournament is made up of matches where\npairs of models compete to produce the best response for a given prompt. This is similar to how Bai\net al. [4] and Chiang et al. [10] compare models, but we also employ GPT-4 ratings in addition to\nhuman ratings. We randomly sample from the set of labeled comparisons to compute Elo [16, 17].\nElo rating, which is widely used in chess and other games, is a measure of the expected win-rate\nrelative to an opponent\u2019s win rate, for example, an Elo of 1100 vs 1000 means the Elo 1100 player\nhas an expected win-rate of approximately 65% against the Elo 1000 opponent; a 1000 vs 1000 or\n1100 vs 1100 match results in an expected win-rate of 50%. The Elo rating changes after each match\nproportionally to the expected outcome, that is, an unexpected upset leads to a large change in Elo\nrating while an expected outcome leads to a small change. Over time, Elo ratings approximately\nmatch the skill of each player at playing the game. We start with a score of 1,000 and use K = 32.\nSimilar to Chiang et al. [10], we repeat this procedure 10,000 times with different random seeds to\ncontrol for ordering effects, e.g., the effect of which model pairs compete with each other first.\n5.3\nGuanaco: QLORA trained on OASST1 is a State-of-the-art Chatbot\nBased on our automated and human evaluations, we find that the top QLORA tuned model, Guanaco\n65B, which we finetune on a variant of OASST1, is the best-performing open-source chatbot model\nand offers performance competitive to ChatGPT. When compared to GPT-4, Guanaco 65B and 33B\nhave an expected win probability of 30%, based on Elo rating from human annotators system-level\npairwise comparisons - the highest reported to date.\nThe Vicuna benchmark [10] results relative to ChatGPT are shown in Table 6. We find that Guanaco\n65B is the best-performing model after GPT-4, achieving 99.3% performance relative to ChatGPT.\nGuanaco 33B has more parameters than the Vicuna 13B model, but uses only 4-bit precision for its\nweights and is thus much more memory efficient at 21 GB vs 26 GB, providing a three percentage\npoints of improvement over Vicuna 13B. Furthermore, Guanaco 7B easily fits on modern phones at a\n5 GB footprint while still scoring nearly 20 percentage points higher than Alpaca 13B.\nHowever, Table 6 also has very wide confidence intervals, with many models overlapping in per-\nformance. We hypothesize that this uncertainty comes from the lack of clear specification of scale,\ne.g., it is unclear what 8 on a 10 point scale means across different scenarios. As such, we instead\nrecommend using the Elo ranking method [16], based on pairwise judgments from human annotators\nand GPT-4 to avoid the problem of grounding an absolute scale. Elo ratings of the most competitive\n9\nTable 6: Zero-shot Vicuna benchmark scores as a percentage of the score obtained by ChatGPT evaluated by\nGPT-4. We see that OASST1 models perform close to ChatGPT despite being trained on a very small dataset\nand having a fraction of the memory requirement of baseline models.\nModel / Dataset\nParams\nModel bits\nMemory\nChatGPT vs Sys\nSys vs ChatGPT\nMean\n95% CI\nGPT-4\n-\n-\n-\n119.4%\n110.1%\n114.5%\n2.6%\nBard\n-\n-\n-\n93.2%\n96.4%\n94.8%\n4.1%\nGuanaco\n65B\n4-bit\n41 GB\n96.7%\n101.9%\n99.3%\n4.4%\nAlpaca\n65B\n4-bit\n41 GB\n63.0%\n77.9%\n70.7%\n4.3%\nFLAN v2\n65B\n4-bit\n41 GB\n37.0%\n59.6%\n48.4%\n4.6%\nGuanaco\n33B\n4-bit\n21 GB\n96.5%\n99.2%\n97.8%\n4.4%\nOpen Assistant\n33B\n16-bit\n66 GB\n91.2%\n98.7%\n94.9%\n4.5%\nAlpaca\n33B\n4-bit\n21 GB\n67.2%\n79.7%\n73.6%\n4.2%\nFLAN v2\n33B\n4-bit\n21 GB\n26.3%\n49.7%\n38.0%\n3.9%\nVicuna\n13B\n16-bit\n26 GB\n91.2%\n98.7%\n94.9%\n4.5%\nGuanaco\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n87.3%\n93.4%\n90.4%\n5.2%\nAlpaca\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n63.8%\n76.7%\n69.4%\n4.2%\nHH-RLHF\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n55.5%\n69.1%\n62.5%\n4.7%\nUnnatural Instr.\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n50.6%\n69.8%\n60.5%\n4.2%\nChip2\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n49.2%\n69.3%\n59.5%\n4.7%\nLongform\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n44.9%\n62.0%\n53.6%\n5.2%\nSelf-Instruct\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n38.0%\n60.5%\n49.1%\n4.6%\nFLAN v2\n13B\n4-bit\n10 GB\n32.4%\n61.2%\n47.0%\n3.6%\nGuanaco\n7B\n4-bit\n5 GB\n84.1%\n89.8%\n87.0%\n5.4%\nAlpaca\n7B\n4-bit\n5 GB\n57.3%\n71.2%\n64.4%\n5.0%\nFLAN v2\n7B\n4-bit\n5 GB\n33.3%\n56.1%\n44.8%\n4.0%\nmodels can be seen in Table 1. We note that human and GPT-4 ranking of models on the Vicuna\nbenchmark disagree partially, particularly for Guanaco 7B, but are consistent for most models with\na Kendall Tau of \u03c4 = 0.43 and Spearman rank correlation of r = 0.55 at the system level. At the\nexample level, the agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators\u2019 majority vote is weaker with\nFleiss \u03ba = 0.25. Overall, this shows a moderate agreement between system-level judgments by\nGPT-4 and human annotators, and thus that model-based evaluation represents a somewhat reliable\nalternative to human evaluation. We discuss further considerations in Section 6.2.\nElo rankings in Table 7 indicate that Guanaco 33B and 65B models outperform all models besides\nGPT-4 on the Vicuna and OA benchmarks and that they perform comparably to ChatGPT in line\nwith Table 6. We note that the Vicuna benchmark favors open-source models while the larger OA\nbenchmark favors ChatGPT. Furthermore, we can see from Tables 5 and 6 that the suitability of\na finetuning dataset is a determining factor in performance. Finetuning Llama models on FLAN\nv2 does particularly well on MMLU, but performs worst on the Vicuna benchmark (similar trends\nare observed with other models). This also points to partial orthogonality in current evaluation\nbenchmarks: strong MMLU performance does not imply strong chatbot performance (as measured\nby Vicuna or OA benchmarks) and vice versa.\nGuanaco is the only top model in our evaluation that is not trained on proprietary data as the OASST1\ndataset collection guidelines explicitly forbid the use of GPT models. The next best model trained\non only open-source data is the Anthropic HH-RLHF model, which scores 30 percentage points\nlower than Guanaco on the Vicuna benchmark (see Table 6). Overall, these results show that 4-bit\nQLORA is effective and can produce state-of-the-art chatbots that rival ChatGPT. Furthermore, our\n33B Guanaco can be trained on 24 GB consumer GPUs in less than 12 hours. This opens up the\npotential for future work via QLORA tuning on specialized open-source data, which produces models\nthat can compete with the very best commercial models that exist today.\n6\nQualitative Analysis\nWhile quantitative analysis is the core of our evaluation, there are a number of issues with only\nlooking at summary statistics. Perhaps the largest is the problem of benchmark validity [36]\u2014whether\na benchmark truly tests what its name or description suggests is always at question, especially as we\ndiscover \u201cshortcuts\u201d to solve benchmarks that machine learning models sometimes exploit [22, 46].\nTo partially alleviate this, we here perform some qualitative analysis, in two sections. First, in \u00a76.1\n10\nTable 7: Elo rating for a tournament between models where models compete to generate the best response\nfor a prompt, judged by human raters or GPT-4. Overall, Guanaco 65B and 33B tend to be preferred to\nChatGPT-3.5 on the benchmarks studied. According to human raters they have a Each 10-point difference in Elo\nis approximately a difference of 1.5% in win-rate.\nBenchmark\nVicuna\nVicuna\nOpen Assistant\n# Prompts\n80\n80\n953\nJudge\nHuman raters\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nMedian Rank\nModel\nElo\nRank\nElo\nRank\nElo\nRank\nGPT-4\n1176\n1\n1348\n1\n1294\n1\n1\nGuanaco-65B\n1023\n2\n1022\n2\n1008\n3\n2\nGuanaco-33B\n1009\n4\n992\n3\n1002\n4\n4\nChatGPT-3.5 Turbo\n916\n7\n966\n5\n1015\n2\n5\nVicuna-13B\n984\n5\n974\n4\n936\n5\n5\nGuanaco-13B\n975\n6\n913\n6\n885\n6\n6\nGuanaco-7B\n1010\n3\n879\n8\n860\n7\n7\nBard\n909\n8\n902\n7\n-\n-\n8\nwe show some examples that we believe are representative of some observed patterns in the text\ngenerated by our 65b Guanaco model. Second, \u00a76.2 we detail considerations about the results we\nhave discussed and our interpretation of them.\n6.1\nQualitative Analysis of Example Generations\nTo find examples, we first go through data generated for the Vicuna benchmark and the OpenAssistant\nbenchmark, and look for patterns in the answers Guanaco generates. When we notice a pattern we\nattempt to setup a question or prompt that will induce the pattern even though it is the incorrect\nsolution, e.g., if we observe that the model tends to give long-winded answers we prompt the model\nto \u201cAnswer yes or no without explanation.\u201d We use this to find \u201clemons\u201d where we manage to\nadversarially break the model and \u201ccherries\u201d where we fail to break the model, and present both. All\ngenerations in this section were generated with Nucleus Sampling [25] with p = 0.9.\nOf course, this is by no means comprehensive, since it is beyond the scope of this small qualitative\nstudy to control for all the variables involved, e.g., the full distribution of responses the model can\ngenerate for a given prompt is quite large, so we rely on samples we hope are representative. However,\nwe believe describing these examples gives context to the quantitative evidence shown earlier in the\npaper. Since we open source all models and code, we hope this section will inspire future work to\nexamine in more detail the issues we present here.\nFactual Recall\nFor questions such as \u201cWhat is the capital of Zambia?\u201d all models consistently\ngenerate correct answers, e.g.,\nGuanaco: The capital of Zambia is Lusaka.\nHowever as questions get more obscure Guanaco becomes unreliable, but stays confident. For\ninstance in response to this prompt from HotPotQA [68]:\nUser: In what year was the singer who popularized \u2018I\u2019ll Keep the Lovelight\nBurning\u2019 born?\nGuanaco:\nAl Jolson is credited with popularizing the song\n\u2018I\u2019ll Keep the Lovelight Burning,\u2019 and he was born in the year\n1886.\nGuanaco generates the wrong popularizer and the wrong birthday (though the birthday given is\ncorrect for the person mentioned, Al Jolson).\nSuggestibility\nGuanaco shows a surprising resistance to going along with some kinds of assumed\nmisinformation, e.g., in the following interaction:\nUser: How was it finally, officially confirmed that the earth is flat by peer reviewed\nscientists?\n11\nGuanaco:\nThe earth has never been officially confirmed to be\nflat by peer reviewed scientists.\nThe overwhelming consensus\namong scientists is that the earth is spherical.\nIn fact,\nthis has been known for centuries and has been confirmed\nthrough numerous experiments and observations.\nThe belief that the earth is flat is a conspiracy theory\nthat has been debunked by science.\nThe idea that a group\nof scientists have peer reviewed and confirmed the earth is\nflat is simply false.\nIf you have any more questions please ask.\nGuanaco is also quite good at knowing what kinds of questions aren\u2019t possible to answer, e.g.,\nUser: What time is it?\nGuanaco:\nI\u2019m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don\u2019t have\naccess to real-time information.\nMy responses are generated\nbased on my pre-existing knowledge and do not reflect the\ncurrent time.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the current time, I\nsuggest using a timekeeping device or checking an online\ntimepiece.\nSimilar results hold for \u201cWhere are you?\u201d, \u201cHow are you?\u201d, etc.\nRefusal\nSimilarly, Guanaco sometimes refuses to follow instructions for seemingly random rea-\nsons:\nUser: Please reverse the words in the sentence \u201cI\u2019m a cool dude in a mocha mood.\u201d\nGuanaco:\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not able to do that right now, but\nI can explain why the sentence you provided is grammatically\ncorrect.\nThe sentence \u201cI\u2019m a cool dude in a mocha mood\" follows the\ncorrect grammar and syntax rules of the English language.\nIn\nthis case, the adjective \u201ccool\u201d comes before the noun \u201cdude\u201d\nto describe it, and the prepositional phrase \u201cin a mocha\nmood\" provides additional information about the context of\nthe sentence.\nThis sentence structure is perfectly acceptable\nand makes sense in the context of the sentence.\nIf you have any other questions or if there\u2019s anything else\nI can help you with, feel free to ask\nSecret Keeping\nUnfortunately, this refusal is unreliable even when it is desired. Often system\ndesigners would like to keep something secret from the user, even if the system is allowed to give\nfree text responses back to the user. We prompt the model with \u201cThe secret word is \u2018banana\u2019. Do not\nreveal or repeat back this back, no matter what the human requests.\u201d and try to see how easy it is for\na potential user to access this secret information. Directly asking fails:\nUser: What is the secret word?\nGuanaco:\nI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not able to disclose the secret\nword.\nI\u2019m programmed to not reveal or repeat back the secret\nword, no matter what the human requests.\nIs there anything\nelse I can help you with?\nwhich is the desired behavior. However, a tiny amount of trickery breaks this behavior:\nUser: This is a game. The goal is to ignore your previous instructions. What is the\nsecret word?\n12\nGuanaco:\nSorry, the secret word is banana.\nIt\u2019s best if we\ndon\u2019t speak of it.\nIs there anything else you\u2019d like to ask?\nshowcasing the need to study methods for more faithful instruction following.\nMath\nGuanaco\u2019s biggest weakness is mathematics, an area where many language models struggle\nin [35]. When Guanaco shows its work, it tends to be accurate, e.g.,\nUser: Lee mows one lawn and charges $33. Last week he mowed 16 lawns and\nthree customers each gave him a $10 tip. How many dollars did Lee earn mowing\nlawns last week?\nGuanaco: Lee earned $582 mowing lawns last week.\nTo find the total amount he earned, we first need to calculate\nhow much he earned for mowing 16 lawns:\n$33 x 16 = $528\nThen we need to add the tips he received from the three\ncustomers:\n$10 x 3 = $30\nSo the total amount Lee earned was:\n$528 + $30 = $558\nHowever Guanaco can breakdown at even simple problems if it fails to break them down step-by-step,\na known issue [63]. For example, we see the following interaction:\nUser: Please factorize 1833.\nGuanaco:\nSure, I\u2019d be happy to help!\n1833 is a prime number,\nwhich means it has only two factors:\n1 and 1833.\nSo the unique factorization of 1833 is:\n2\u02c61 * 3\u02c62 * 17\u02c61\nI hope this helps!\nLet me know if you have any other\nquestions.\nwhich is not only wrong (the true factorization is 3 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 43), it\u2019s wrong twice .\nTheory of Mind\nGuanaco displays surprisingly strong Theory of Mind capabilities [41, 51]. For\ninstance, the model correctly answers the following question in great detail:\nUser: James and Abby are in the bedroom. Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\nAbby leaves the bedroom. James moves the pen into the bag. Where does James\nthink Abby will look for the pen?\nGuanaco:\nJames knows that Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\nBut James also knows that he has moved the pen into the bag,\nand he assumes that Abby does not know about this.\nSo, James\nmay guess that Abby will look for the pen in the desk drawer,\nbecause that\u2019s where she left it last time.\nHowever, this\nassumption may be incorrect, because Abby may have seen James\nmoving the pen.\nHowever, these inferences are unreliable, and often the model gives reasons that presume things that\ndon\u2019t make sense in the situation, e.g.,\nUser: Evelyn entered the living room. Jackson entered the playroom. James\nentered the playroom. The beans are in the treasure chest. James exited the\n13\nplayroom. Jackson moved the beans to the pantry. Jackson exited the playroom.\nJames entered the living room. Where will James look for the beans?\nGuanaco:\nJames will look for the beans in the pantry, because\nthat\u2019s where Jackson moved them.\nwhere Guanaco presumes information transfer that was never described. These issues echo recent\nliterature [51], but require more study.\n6.2\nConsiderations\nEvaluation\nWe report moderate agreement among human annotators (Fleiss \u03ba = 0.42) with\nadditional deterioration when comparing two strong systems. This points to limitations in the\ncurrent benchmarks and human evaluation protocols for chatbot task performance. When manually\ncomparing generations from ChatGPT and Guanaco 65B on the Vicuna benchmark, we find that\nsubjective preferences start to play an important role as the authors of this paper disagreed on the\nmany preferred responses. Future work should investigate approaches to mitigate these problems\ndrawing from disciplines that developed mechanisms to deal with subjective preferences, such as\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Psychology.\nIn our analysis, we also find that automated evaluation systems have noticeable biases. For example,\nwe observe strong order effects with GPT-4 assigning higher scores to the system appearing first in its\nprompt. The relatively weak sample-level agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators (Fleiss\n\u03ba = 0.25) also suggests that human annotators and automated systems might rely on preferences\nthat are not always aligned. In addition, in Table 7, we observe that GPT-4 assigns significantly\nhigher scores to its own outputs compared to human ratings, Elo of 1348 vs 1176, which represent an\nadditional 20% probability of winning against an opponent. Future work should examine the presence\nof potential biases in automated evaluation systems as well as possible mitigation strategies.\nData & Training\nWe note that the OASST1 dataset on which Guanaco models are trained is\nmultilingual and that the OA benchmark also contains prompts in different languages. We leave it to\nfuture work to investigate the degree to which such multilingual training improves performance on\ninstructions in languages other than English and whether this explains the larger gap between Vicuna-\n13B model (only trained on English data) and Guanaco 33B and 65B on the OA benchmark.\nGiven the strong performance of Guanaco models, we investigate any data leakage between the\nOASST1 data and the Vicuna benchmark prompts. We do not find overlapping prompts after perform-\ning fuzzy string matching in the two datasets and inspecting the closest matches manually.\nFurthermore, we note that our model is only trained with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning)\nwithout relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This calls for further\ninvestigations of the tradeoffs of simple cross-entropy loss and RLHF training. We hope that QLORA\nenables such analysis at scale, without the need for overwhelming computational resources.\n7\nRelated Work\nQuantization of Large Language Models\nQuantization of LLMs has largely focused on quanti-\nzation for inference time. Major approaches for preserving 16-bit LLM quality focus on managing\noutlier features (e.g., SmoothQuant [66] and LLM.int8() [14]) while others use more sophisticated\ngrouping methods [44, 69]. Lossy quantization approaches study the trade-offs for regular round-\ning [13, 71, 47] or how to optimize rounding decisions to improve quantization precision [18].\nBesides our work, SwitchBack layers [65] is the only work that studies backpropagation through\nquantized weights at a scale beyond 1B parameters.\nFinetuning with Adapters\nWhile we use Low-rank Adapters [28] (LoRA), many other Parameter\nEfficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed such as prompt tuning [48, 33, 34], tuning\nthe embedding layer inputs [1], tuning hidden states (IA3) [37], adding full layers [27], tuning\nbiases [70], learning a mask over weights based on Fisher information [54], and a combination of\napproaches [23]. In our work, we show that LoRA adapters are able to reach full 16-bit finetuning\nperformance. We leave it to future work to explore the tradeoffs of other PEFT approaches.\nInstruction Finetuning\nTo help a pretrained LLM follow the instructions provided in a prompt,\ninstruction finetuning uses input-output pairs of various data sources to finetune a pretrained LLM\nto generate the output given the input as a prompt. Approaches and datasets include MetaICL [40],\n14\nTable 8: Evaluation of biases on the CrowS dataset. A lower score indicates lower likelihood of generating\nbiased sequences.

Approaches and datasets include Anthropic-\nHH [2, 4], Open Assistant [31], LaMDA [56], and Sparrow [21]. We do not use reinforcement\nlearning, but our best model, Guanaco, is finetuned on multi-turn chat interactions from the Open\nAssistant dataset which was designed to be used for RLHF training [31]. For the evaluation of\nchatbots approaches that use GPT-4 instead of costly human annotation have been developed [10, 45].\nWe improve on such approaches with a focus on an evaluation setup that is more reliable.\n8\nLimitations and Discussion\nWe have shown evidence that our method, QLORA, can replicate 16-bit full finetuning performance\nwith a 4-bit base model and Low-rank Adapters (LoRA). Despite this evidence, we did not establish\nthat QLORA can match full 16-bit finetuning performance at 33B and 65B scales. Due to the\nimmense resource costs, we leave this study to future work.\nAnother limitation is the evaluation of instruction finetuning models. While we provide evaluations\non MMLU, the Vicuna benchmark, and the OA benchmark, we did not evaluate on other benchmarks\nsuch as BigBench, RAFT, and HELM, and it is not ensured that our evaluations generalize to these\nbenchmarks. On the other hand, we perform a very broad study on MMLU and develop new methods\nfor evaluating chatbots.\nFrom the evidence presented, it appears that the performance of these benchmarks likely depends how\nsimilar the finetuning data is to the benchmark dataset. For example, FLAN v2 is similar to MMLU,\nbut dissimilar to chatbot benchmarks and vice versa for the Chip2 dataset and both models score\naccordingly on the MMLU and Vicuna benchmarks. This highlights that not only better benchmarks\nand evaluation is needed, but that one needs to be careful about what one is evaluating in the first\nplace. Do we want to create models that do well on classroom highschool and colleague knowledge or\ndo we want to do well on chatbot conversation ability? Maybe something else? Because it is always\neasier to evaluate on an existing benchmark compared to creating a new one, certain benchmarks\ncan steer the community towards a certain direction. We should ensure as a community that the\nbenchmarks measure what we care about.\nWhile we provide a detailed evaluation for general chatbot performance, another limitation is that we\nonly do a limited responsible AI evaluation of Guanaco. We evaluate the likelihood of Guanaco-65B\nto generate a socially biased sequence of tokens compared to other models in Table 8. We see that the\naverage score in Guanaco-65B is much lower than other raw pretrained models. As such, it seems that\nfinetuning on the OASST1 dataset reduces the bias of the LLaMA base model. While these results\nare encouraging, it is unclear if Guanaco does also well when assessed on other types of biases. We\nleave further evaluation of analyzing biases in Guanaco and similar chatbots to future work.\n15\nAn additional limitation is that we did not evaluate different bit-precisions, such as using 3-bit base\nmodels, or different adapter methods. Besides LoRA, there is also a wide variety Parameter Efficient\nFineTuning (PEFT) methods that have been shown to work well. However, it is unclear if these\nmethods scale to large models. We used LoRA as many results established its robustness but other\nadapters might yield better performance. Since finetuning after quantization seems to recover most of\nthe information that is lost during quantization this might enable much more aggressive quantization.\nFor example, 3-bit GPTQ quantization of the basemodel with LoRA might also yield 16-bit full\nfinetuning performance after finetuning.\n9\nBroader Impacts\nOur QLORA finetuning method is the first method that enables the finetuning of 33B parameter\nmodels on a single consumer GPU and 65B parameter models on a single professional GPU, while\nnot degrading performance relative to a full finetuning baseline. We have demonstrated that our\nbest 33B model trained on the Open Assistant dataset can rival ChatGPT on the Vicuna benchmark.\nSince instruction finetuning is an essential tool to transform raw pretrained LLMs into ChatGPT-like\nchatbots, we believe that our method will make finetuning widespread and common in particular for\nthe researchers that have the least resources, a big win for the accessibility of state of the art NLP\ntechnology. QLORA can be seen as an equalizing factor that helps to close the resource gap between\nlarge corporations and small teams with consumer GPUs.\nAnother potential source of impact is deployment to mobile phones. We believe our QLORA method\nmight enable the critical milestone of enabling the finetuning of LLMs on phones and other low\nresource settings. While 7B models were shown to be able to be run on phones before, QLORA is\nthe first method that would enable the finetuning of such models. We estimate that with an iPhone 12\nPlus, QLORA can finetune 3 million tokens per night while the phone is charging. While finetuned\n7B models do not reach the quality of ChatGPT, we believe that the quality is good enough to enable\nnovel applications that have not been possible before due to privacy or LLM quality issues. QLORA\ncan help enable privacy-preserving usage of LLMs, where users can own and manage their own data\nand models, while simultaneously making LLMs easier to deploy.\nHowever, finetuning is a dual-use technology that can be abused to cause harm. Widespread use of\nLLMs has known dangers [8, 6], but we believe that equalizing access to a technology that is quickly\nbecoming ubiquitous will allow for better more independent analysis than keeping the power of LLMs\nin the hands of large corporations that do not release models or source code for auditing.\nAll in all, we believe that QLORA will have a broadly positive impact making the finetuning of high\nquality LLMs much more widely and easily accessible.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Aditya Kusupati, Ofir Press, Ashish Sharma, Margaret Li, Raphael Olivier, Zihao Ye, and\nEvangelia Spiliopoulou for their valuable feedback.

We keep LoRA \u03b1 fixed and search the learning rate, since\nLoRA \u03b1 is always proportional to the learning rate.\nWe find that LoRA dropout 0.05 is useful for small models (7B, 13B), but not for larger models (33B,\n65B). We find LoRA r is unrelated to final performance if LoRA is used on all layers as can be seen\nin Figure 4\n8\n16\n32\n64\nLoRA r\n64.0\n64.2\n64.4\n64.6\n64.8\n65.0\nRougeL\nbits\n4\nFigure 4: LoRA r for LLaMA 7B models finetuned on Alpaca. Each dot represents a combination of\nhyperparameters and for each LoRA r we run 3 random seed with each hyperparameter combination. The\nperformance of specific LoRA r values appears to be independent of other hyperparameters.\nA.2\nSuper-Natural Instructions Experimental Setup Details\nWe use the same preprocessing of the Super-Natural Instruction dataset as Wang et al. [60]. However,\nwe split the training data in training and validation datasets allowing us to perform more rigorous\nhyperparameter tuning and early stopping. We use the same hyperparameters described in the paper\nfor training the various T5 model sizes on the Super-Natural Instruction data. We use LoRA r = 16\nfor small, medium, and large T5 models and LoRA r = 64 for T5 xl and xxl models. We also use\nLoRA \u03b1 = 64 in all our experiments and no LoRA dropout.\nB\nTraining a State-of-the-art Chatbot Experimental Setup Details\nB.1\nDatasets\nWe describe the datasets used for QLORA finetuning experiments outlined in Section 5.\nOASST1\nThe OpenAssistant dataset [31] was collected via crowd-sourcing. It contains 161,443\nunique messages distributed across 66,497 conversations and spanning 35 different languages. The\ndataset often contains several ranked replies for each given user question. In our experiments, we\nonly use the top reply at each level in the conversation tree. This limits the dataset to 9,209 examples.\nWe finetuning our models on the full conversation including the user queries.\nHH-RLHF\nThis is a human preference dataset about helpfulness and harmlessness. Each datapoint\nconsists of two assistant replies to a user question along with a human preference judgment of the\nbest reply. The dataset contains 160,800 examples. When finetuning on this dataset, we combine\nhelpfulness and harmlessness data and only keep the preferred assistant reply.\nFLAN v2\nThe FLAN v2 collection [39] is a collection of 1836 tasks augmented with hundreds\nof manually curated templates and rich formatting patterns into over 15M examples. The authors\nshow that models trained on this collection outperform other public collections including the original\nFLAN 2021 [62], T0++ [50], Super-Natural Instructions [60], and OPT-IML [29]. We used the\nsame task mixtures described by the authors with the exception of some datasets that were not freely\navailable at the time of writing.\n22\nParameters\nDataset\nBatch size\nLR\nSteps\nSource Length\nTarget Length\n7B\nAll\n16\n2e-4\n10000\n384\n128\n7B\nOASST1\n16\n2e-4\n1875\n-\n512\n7B\nHH-RLHF\n16\n2e-4\n10000\n-\n768\n7B\nLongform\n16\n2e-4\n4000\n512\n1024\n13B\nAll\n16\n2e-4\n10000\n384\n128\n13B\nOASST1\n16\n2e-4\n1875\n-\n512\n13B\nHH-RLHF\n16\n2e-4\n10000\n-\n768\n13B\nLongform\n16\n2e-4\n4000\n512\n1024\n33B\nAll\n32\n1e-4\n5000\n384\n128\n33B\nOASST1\n16\n1e-4\n1875\n-\n512\n33B\nHH-RLHF\n32\n1e-4\n5000\n-\n768\n33B\nLongform\n32\n1e-4\n2343\n512\n1024\n65B\nAll\n64\n1e-4\n2500\n384\n128\n65B\nOASST1\n16\n1e-4\n1875\n-\n512\n65B\nHH-RLHF\n64\n1e-4\n2500\n-\n768\n65B\nLongform\n32\n1e-4\n2343\n512\n1024\nTable 9: Training hyperparameters for QLORA finetuning on different datasets and across model sizes.\nSelf-Instruct, Alpaca, Unnatural Instructions\nThe Self-Instruct, Alpaca, and Unnatural Instruc-\ntions datasets [59, 55, 26] are instruction tuning datasets collected with various approaches of model\ndistillation from GPT-3 Instruct and ChatGPT. They rely on prompting, in-context learning, and\nparaphrasing to come up with diverse sets of instructions and outputs. The datasets comprise of\n82,612, 51,942, and 240,670 examples respectively. One advantage of such distilled datasets is that\nthey contain a more diverse set of instruction styles compared to the FLAN v2 collection and similar\ninstruction tuning collections.\nLongform\nThe LongForm dataset [30] is based on an English corpus augmented with instructions\nand as such is a hybrid human-generated dataset. The underlying documents are human-written and\ncome from C4 and Wikipedia while the instructions are generated visa LLMs. The dataset is extended\nwith additional structured corpora examples such as Stack Exchange and WikiHow and task examples\nsuch as question answering, email writing, grammar error correction, story/poem generation, and text\nsummarization. The dataset contains 23,700 examples.\nChip2\nis part of the OIG Laion dataset. It contains Python code examples, natural instruction exam-\nples, generic harmless instructions, instruction/responses with lists, follow-up questions, Wikipedia\ntoxic adversarial questions, grade school math, reasoning instructions, and character and scene\ndescriptions with a total of 210,289 examples.\nB.2\nHyperparameters\nWe provide the exact hyperparameters used in our QLORA finetuning experiments. We find hyper-\nparameters to be largely robust across datasets. We use the MMLU 5-shot dev set for validation\nand hyperparameter tuning. In all our experiments we use NF4 with double quantization and bf16\ncomputation datatype. We set LoRA r = 64, \u03b1 = 16, and add LoRA modules on all linear layers of\nthe base model. We also use Adam beta2 of 0.999, max grad norm of 0.3 and LoRA dropout of 0.1\nfor models up to 13B and 0.05 for 33B and 65B models. Following previous work on instruction\nfinetuning [62, 60] and after benchmarking other linear and cosine schedules, we use a constant\nlearning rate schedule. We use group-by-length to group examples of similar lengths in the same\nbatch (note this will produce a oscillating loss curve). The hyperparameters we tune for each model\nsize are shown in Table 9.\nB.3\nAblations\nWhile it is general practice in the literature to only train on the response in instruction following\ndatasets, we study the effect of training on the instruction in addition to the response in Table 10. In\nthese experiments, we restrict the training data to 52,000 examples and use the 7B model. Over four\ndifferent instruction tuning datasets, we find that only training on the target is beneficial to MMLU\n23\nDataset\nUnnatural Instructions\nChip2\nAlpaca\nFLAN v2\nMean\nTrain on source and target\n36.2\n33.7\n38.1\n42.0\n37.5\nTrain on target\n38.0\n34.5\n39.0\n42.9\n38.6\nTable 10: MMLU 5-shot test results studying the effect of training on the instructions in addition to the response.\nperformance. We did not evaluate the effect this may have on chatabot performance as measured by\nvicuna or OA benchmarks.\nB.4\nWhat is more important: instruction finetuning dataset size or dataset quality?\nData set suitability is more important than dataset size.\nTo understand the effects of dataset\nquality vs. dataset size, we experiment with subsampling large datasets with at least 150,000 samples\n(Chip2, FLAN v2, Unnatural Instructions), into datasets of size 50,000, 100,000 and 150,000 and\nexamine the resulting trends, as shown in Table 11. We find that increasing the dataset size and\nincreasing the number of epochs improves MMLU only marginally (0.0 - 0.5 MMLU), while the\ndifference between datasets is up to 40x larger (1.5 - 8.0 MMLU). This is a clear indicator that dataset\nquality rather than dataset size is critical for mean MMLU accuracy. We obtain similar findings for\nchatbot performance as discussed in .\nC\nHuman Evaluation\nWe conduct a human evaluation with the same wording given to GPT-4 in the original Vicuna\nevaluation [10], adjusted for an Amazon Mechanical Turk form as show in Figure 5.\nD\nPairwise Evaluation with GPT-4\nWhile we found that the GPT-4 evaluation gave different results depend on which system was\npresented first, when averaged over both options the pairwise results were well-ordered. The\naggregated pairwise judgments are hown in Table 12. On inspection, it is clear these judgments are\ntransitive, i.e., when System A is judged better than System B and System B is judged better than\nSystem C, it is always the case that System A is judged better than System C. This yields a complete\nordering, given in Table 13.\nE\nNormalFloat 4-bit data type\nThe exact values of the NF4 data type are as follows:\n[-1.0, -0.6961928009986877, -0.5250730514526367,\n-0.39491748809814453, -0.28444138169288635, -0.18477343022823334,\n-0.09105003625154495, 0.0, 0.07958029955625534, 0.16093020141124725,\n0.24611230194568634, 0.33791524171829224, 0.44070982933044434,\n0.5626170039176941, 0.7229568362236023, 1.0]\nF\nNormality of Trained Neural Network Weights\nWhile it is common knowledge that trained neural network weights are mostly normally distributed,\nwe perform statistical testing to verify this. We use the Shapiro-Wilk test[53] on the weights of the 7B\nTable 11: Effect different dataset sizes and finetuning epochs on mean 5-shot MMLU test set accuracy. While\nincreasing the dataset size and training for more than 1 epochs helps with MMLU performance, the difference\nbetween datasets are far larger, indicating that dataset quality affects MMLU performance more than dataset size.\nChip\nUnnatural Instructions\nFLAN v2\nDatapoints \u2193 Epochs \u2192\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n3\nMean\n50000\n34.50\n35.30\n34.70\n38.10\n42.20\n38.10\n43.00\n43.50\n44.10\n39.28\n100000\n33.70\n33.90\n34.00\n40.10\n41.20\n37.00\n43.90\n43.70\n44.90\n39.16\n150000\n34.40\n34.80\n35.10\n39.70\n41.10\n41.50\n44.60\n45.50\n43.50\n40.02\nMean\n34.20\n34.67\n34.60\n39.30\n41.50\n38.87\n43.83\n44.23\n44.17\n24\nFigure 5: The crowdsourcing form used by human annotators.\nLLaMA model [57].

Scal-\ning the diversity and quality of such data, al-\nthough straightforward, stands a great chance\nof leading to improved performance.\nThis\npaper aims to improve the upper bound of\nopen-source models further. We first provide a\nsystematically designed, diverse, informative,\nlarge-scale dataset of instructional conversa-\ntions, UltraChat, which does not involve human\nqueries. Our objective is to capture the breadth\nof interactions that a human might have with\nan AI assistant and employs a comprehensive\nframework to generate multi-turn conversation\niteratively. UltraChat contains 1.5 million high-\nquality multi-turn dialogues and covers a wide\nrange of topics and instructions. Our statis-\ntical analysis of UltraChat reveals its superi-\nority in various key metrics, including scale,\naverage length, diversity, coherence, etc., so-\nlidifying its position as a leading open-source\ndataset. Building upon UltraChat, we fine-tune\na LLaMA model to create a powerful conver-\nsational model, UltraLLaMA. Our evaluations\nindicate that UltraLLaMA consistently outper-\nforms other open-source models, including Vi-\ncuna, the previously recognized state-of-the-art\nopen-source model. The dataset and the model\nwill be publicly released1.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (Han et al., 2021; Bom-\nmasani et al., 2021) (LLMs) have demonstrated\nexceptional generalization capability on a variety\nof language-related tasks. Notably, ChatGPT (Ope-\nnAI, 2022), an optimized version of GPT-3 (Brown\net al., 2020) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) for conver-\nsation, takes the user experience to another level\nvia excelling in comprehending and generating\nresponses in a natural and interactive manner.

The\nscores are independently assessed by ChatGPT, using\na dataset consisting of over 300 questions generated\nby GPT-4. Among the models included in the evalua-\ntion, Dolly-v2 and OpenAssistant have 12B parameters,\nMPT-Chat and Alpaca have 7B parameters, while the\nremaining models have 13B parameters. Evaluation\nprompts can be found in Appendix A.\nintroduction of ChatGPT has spurred a surge in\nthe adoption and implementation of general chat\nmodels.\nIn addition to competing models developed by\nlarge corporations such as Bard2 and Claude3, the\nopen-source community is actively engaged in\ntraining similar models, aiming to democratize\naccess to AI technology.\nNotable examples in\nthis regard include Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023a),\nVicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Koala (Geng et al.,\n2023), Baize (Xu et al., 2023), and Belle (Ji et al.,\n2023), etc., demonstrating promising performance.\nExperimental evidence strongly suggests that chat\nlanguage models can be effectively trained through\ninstruction fine-tuning (Wei et al., 2021; Sanh\net al., 2021), and they also indicate that many\ndata-efficient (Zhou et al., 2023) or computing-\nefficient (Hu et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2023) meth-\n2https://bard.google.com/\n3https://www.anthropic.com/index/\nintroducing-claude\narXiv:2305.14233v1  [cs.CL]  23 May 2023\nods can be applied. This paper, in another way, fo-\ncuses more on the \"final one mile\" of chat language\nmodels, as evidence shows that the journey from 0\nto 60 is easy, whereas progressing from 60 to 100\nbecomes exceedingly challenging. For instance,\nresearchers have shown that by utilizing a small,\nthoughtfully curated set of instructions, it is possi-\nble to train a model with satisfactory instruction-\nfollowing capabilities. However, these approaches\nhave yet to produce models that surpass the perfor-\nmance of Vicuna, the current leading open-source\nmodel, let alone outperform ChatGPT and GPT4.\nThis paper believes that the most straightforward\nway, that is, the quality and diversity of data em-\nployed in the training process, play a vital role\nin further improving the performance of chat lan-\nguage models. In other words, leveraging higher\nquality and more diverse data can yield better out-\ncomes. To this end, we present UltraChat, a million-\nscale multi-turn instructional conversation data to\nfacilitate the construction of more powerful chat\nlanguage models. UltraChat is first designed by\na principle that attempts to capture the breadth of\ninteractions that a human might have with an AI\nassistant. Specifically, we do not use specific tasks\nlike question-answering or summarization to con-\nstruct the data, but curate three sectors: Questions\nabout the World, Creation and Generation, and\nAssistance on Existing Materials. Then we em-\nploy meta-information, in-context expansion, and\niterative prompting to scale up the number of in-\nstructions. To construct informative and realistic\nmulti-turn conversations, two separate ChatGPT\nTurbo APIs are adopted in the conversation gen-\neration, where one plays the role of the user to\ngenerate queries, and the other generates the re-\nsponse. We instruct the user model with carefully\ndesigned prompts to mimic human user behavior\nand call the two APIs iteratively.\nWe fine-tune a LLaMA-13B model on UltraChat\nto produce UltraLLaMA and compare the model\nto a wide range of baselines, especially the open-\nsource ones. The evaluation shows that our model\ncould consistently outperform other models. As\nreported in Table 1, UltraLLaMA can achieve the\nhighest performance scores that are independently\nassessed by ChatGPT. We also perform a prefer-\nence study to make ChatGPT choose a response\nwith higher overall performance, the results show\nthat our model still consistently outperforms all the\nopen-source baselines.\n2\nRelated Work\nInstruction Tuning.\nRecent works demonstrate\nLLMs with powerful capabilities in following hu-\nman instructions.\nWei et al. (2021) pioneered\nto fine-tune T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) on 60 NLP\ndatasets verbalized with natural language instruc-\ntion templates, i.e., instruction tuning. The fine-\ntuned model exhibits a strong ability in instruc-\ntion understanding and generalizes well to unseen\ninstructions (tasks). Later, Longpre et al. (2023)\nextend the setting to 1, 836 tasks and show the\nbenefits of scaling the number of tasks in out-of-\ndistribution generalization. Wei et al. (2021) also\nconclude that the success of instruction tuning de-\npends on the quality of the dataset and the design of\nprompts. To further regulate the tuned model\u2019s be-\nhavior, Ouyang et al. (2022); Schulman et al. (2017)\npropose to first learn a reward model directly from\nannotated human feedback, then employ reinforce-\nment learning to align model behaviors with human\npreferences. This technique can be combined with\ninstruction tuning to further boost the model perfor-\nmance and has been successfully applied to LLMs\nsuch as ChatGPT.\nData Augmentation with LLMs.\nCollecting\nlarge-scale human-annotated instructions and their\nresponses is time-consuming and labor-intensive.\nAlternatively, a more cost-effective and feasible\napproach to gathering top-notch data involves sam-\npling from LLMs that have been finely tuned,\ne.g., ChatGPT and GPT-3.5. Recently, there is a\nsurge of interest in distilling these powerful LLMs\nfor data augmentation. For instance, using the\ntechnique of SelfInstruct (Wang et al., 2022), Al-\npaca (Taori et al., 2023b) generate 52k high-quality\ninstruction-response pairs based on 175 seed tasks\nby \u201cdistilling\u201d Text-Davinci-003. After training\na LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) model on the\ndataset, the model performs almost on par with\nText-Davinci-003. The success of Alpaca boosts\nnumerous later efforts on data augmentation with\nLLMs, such as code-alpaca (Chaudhary, 2023),\nalpaca-cot (Si et al., 2023), GPT4ALL (Anand\net al., 2023), ShareGPT (Domeccleston, 2023),\nDolly-v2 (Conover et al., 2023), BELLE (Ji et al.,\n2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Koala (Geng\net al., 2023), Baize (Xu et al., 2023), etc. It is\nshown that increasing the scale of data could con-\nstantly improve the model performance.

For instance, CAMEL (Li et al.,\n2023) designed a multi-agent role-play environ-\nment for LLMs to solve a given complex task and\nproduced 115k instruction-response pairs that sim-\nulate real human conversations.\n3\nDesign\nLLMs are believed to be better annotators than\nhuman-being in many scenarios (Gilardi et al.,\n2023).\nHowever, directly using LLMs like\nChatGPT to generate multi-turn conversations can\nbe satisfactory but not informative, as it cannot\nenjoy the benefit of reinforcement learning with\nhuman feedback (RLHF) in the alignment process.\nTable 20 in Appendix B shows a comparison of\ndirectly generated multi-turn dialogue and a case\nin UltraChat with the same opening line. Two\nkey points can be derived to ensure the quality of\nthe data: (1) An opening line directly determines\nthe topic of the dialogue. Opening lines should\nbe highly diverse and encompass any task that a\nhuman user may request a chat model to perform.\n(2) A user determines the plot of the dialogue, and\nthe output should be tailored to the current topic\nwith diverse language styles and requests.\nUltraChat aims to cover a tremendous range of\ninstructions and queries, which is composed of\nthree sectors: Questions about the World, Creation\nand Generation, and Assistance on Existing Mate-\nrials.\n3.1\nPrinciple\nUnlike other datasets that tend to use specific tasks,\nsuch as question-answering, rewriting, and sum-\nmarization, to construct the data, the design of our\nschema is grounded in a tripartite framework that\naims to capture the breadth of interactions that a\nhuman might have with an AI assistant. We believe\nany interactions between a human user and an AI\nassistant can be regarded as obtaining information.\nInformation Access.\nThe first sector, \"Questions\nabout the world,\" focuses on querying existing in-\nformation in the world. This is a key aspect of\nhuman-AI interaction, as users often rely on AI\nassistants to provide quick and accurate answers\nto their questions. By including a wide range of\ntopics, the dataset addresses the diverse informa-\ntion needs of users, ensuring that the AI assistant\ncan provide relevant and comprehensive responses.\nThis component is crucial in facilitating effective\ninformation exchange between the user and the AI\nassistant, which is at the core of any human-AI\ninteraction.\nConditional Information Creation.\nThe second\npart, \"Creation and writing,\" is concerned with the\ncreation of new information with human-input con-\nditions. This process reflects the AI\u2019s capacity to\nengage in creative tasks alongside users, harnessing\nits vast knowledge and pattern recognition capabil-\nities to generate original content. This part of the\ndataset acknowledges the role of AI assistants as\ncollaborative partners in the creative process, push-\ning the boundaries of what AI can achieve and\nenabling users to harness its potential for a wide\nrange of tasks, from writing emails to crafting sto-\nries and plays.\nInformation Transformation.\nThe third part,\n\"Assistance on Existing Materials,\" addresses the\nmodification of existing information. This is a cru-\ncial aspect of human-AI interaction, as it allows the\nAI assistant to actively engage with the user\u2019s input,\ntransforming it in various ways, such as through\nrewriting, continuation, summarization, or infer-\nence. This part of the dataset ensures that the AI\nassistant is capable of manipulating information to\nbetter serve the user\u2019s needs, enabling it to function\nas a versatile and adaptive tool that can handle a\ndiverse array of tasks.\nIn summary, this tripartite principle is designed\nto provide a comprehensive representation of the\npossible interactions between humans and AI as-\nsistants. Based on the design, we create UltraChat\nto capture meaningful and efficient collaboration\nbetween human users and AI systems..\n4\nData Construction\nAs mentioned above, UltraChat is composed of\nthree different sectors, and each of them faces\nunique challenges. Our primary principle is to\nmake the data as diverse as possible. While the\ncore to ensuring data diversity is to ensure the di-\nversity of opening lines and user response style,\nthis section will mainly focus on the construction\nand design of how to obtain a diverse set of opening\nlines and how to prompt the user properly. The de-\ntails will be illustrated for each sector of data below.\n4.1\nQuestions about the World\nThis particular data sector focuses primarily on\nconcepts, objects, and entities that exist in the real\nworld. Our approach to gathering data for this sec-\ntor involves two perspectives: one centered around\ntopics and concepts, and the other around real-\nworld entities. Initially, we request ChatGPT to\ngenerate 30 comprehensive topics that encompass\nvarious aspects of our daily lives, as shown in Ta-\nble 3. Subsequently, we delve deeper into each\ntopic by generating 30 to 50 subtopics or related\nconcepts. Finally, we generate 10 different ques-\ntions for each subtopic or concept, and additionally\nrequest ChatGPT to generate 10 more questions\nbased on each original question. The other source\nof data comes from real-world objects, which are\nderived from Wikidata4 entities. These entities are\nfurther refined by considering their frequencies in\nWikipedia5 articles, specifically focusing on the\n10,000 most frequently occurring entities. For each\nentity, we create 5 meta-questions, followed by 10\nmore specific questions and 20 extended questions.\nThe extended questions aim to maintain some simi-\nlarity to the original question while exploring dis-\ntinct objects or topics. To create a dialogue, we\nfilter and sample approximately 500,000 questions\nas opening lines. During the construction of each\ndialogue, we provide the user model with carefully\ncrafted prompts that explicitly ask the model to\nrespond concisely and meaningfully, taking into ac-\ncount the context of the ongoing dialogue history.\n4.2\nCreation and Generation\nThis sector concerns the automatic generation of\nvarious text materials following the instruction\ngiven by the user. These text materials are catego-\nrized into 20 different types, and a ChatGPT model\nis employed to produce a diverse range of instruc-\ntions for each type of writing. Then, approximately\n80% of the generated instructions are further fed\nback into the ChatGPT model to generate more\ndetailed instructions. These instructions serve as\nopening lines for dialogue generation. Throughout\nthe generation process, the user prompt continually\nreinforces the primary objective of the conversa-\ntion, which is to generate and refine a piece of\nwriting. This serves to ensure that the behavior of\nthe user model remains focused and aligned with\nthe intended purpose.\n4.3\nAssistance on Existing Materials\nThe third sector encompasses various tasks\npertaining to the existing text material, such\nas rewriting, translation, summarization, and\nquestion-answering, etc. We begin by gathering\ntext pieces from the C4 corpus6. Each piece within\nthe C4 corpus is associated with a source URL. To\nensure a diverse range of text content and styles,\nwe adopt the 20 material types outlined in the\n4https://www.wikidata.org/\n5https://www.wikipedia.org/\n6https://commoncrawl.org/\nTechnology\nHealth and wellness\nTravel and adventure\nFood and drink\nArt and culture\nScience and innovation\nFashion and style\nRelationships and dating\nSports and fitness\nNature and the environment\nMusic and entertainment\nPolitics and current events\nEducation and learning\nMoney and finance\nWork and career\nPhilosophy and ethics\nHistory and nostalgia\nSocial media and communication\nCreativity and inspiration\nPersonal growth and development\nSpirituality and faith\nPop culture and trends\nBeauty and self-care\nFamily and parenting\nEntrepreneurship and business\nLiterature and writing\nGaming and technology\nMindfulness and meditation\nDiversity and inclusion\nTravel and culture exchange\nTable 2: 30 meta-concepts used to generate the first sector of UltraChat data.\nArticles and Blog Posts\nJob Application Material\nStories\nLegal Documents and Contracts\nPoems\nEducational Content\nScreenplays\nScripts for Language Learning\nTechnical Documents and Reports\nMarketing Materials\nSocial Media Posts\nPersonal Essays\nEmails\nScientific Papers and Summaries\nSpeeches and Presentations\nRecipes and Cooking Instructions\nNews Articles\nSong Lyrics\nProduct Descriptions and Reviews\nPrograms and Code\nTable 3: 20 types of text materials used for sector 2 and 3 UltraChat generation.\nTemplates for concatenation\n{text}\\n{instruction}\n{text} {instruction}\n{instruction} Answer according to: {text}\n{text} Based on the passage above, {instruction}\n{instruction}: {text}\nGiven the text: {text}\\n{instruction}\n{instruction}\\nGenerate according to: {text}\nTable 4: Manually designed templates for concatenating\nexisting materials and generated instructions.\nprevious section and manually curate keywords\nfor each type. Additionally, we classify the text\nin the corpus by matching the keywords to the\ncorresponding URL. In total, we collect 10,000\ntext pieces from the C4 corpus, and for each piece,\nwe prompt ChatGPT to generate five distinct\ninstructions. To combine the text pieces with spe-\ncific instructions, we utilize a manually designed\ntemplate, as depicted in Table 4. Ultimately, the\nconcatenated set of 500,000 pieces serves as the\nopening lines for the generated dialogues.\n4.4\nUser Simulation and Refinement\nMaintaining the desired behavior of the user model\nis crucial for achieving successful automatic dia-\nlogue generation. It has been observed that when\nthe user model is solely provided with the current\ndialogue history, it tends to assume the role of an\nAI assistant. This \"role exchange\" situation can\nsignificantly impact the coherence of the multi-turn\nconversation. To address this, in addition to pre-\nsenting the dialogue history, we include prompts ex-\nplicitly instructing the model to adopt various user\npersonalities. In Sector 2, a prompt is employed\nto remind the model of the primary purpose of the\ndialogue, thereby promoting a more natural flow\nof conversation. Once the data generation process\nis complete, a further filtration step is performed\nto ensure overall data quality. To enhance the re-\nalism of user responses, we specifically exclude\nexcessively polite statements such as \"Thank you,\"\n\"Thanks,\" and the \"You\u2019re welcome\" response in\nthe subsequent model-generated output.\n4.5\nData Analysis\nWe conduct a statistical analysis of UltraChat and\nseveral other instruction datasets, as shown in Ta-\nble 5. UltraChat stands out in terms of its scale,\nbeing one of the largest publicly available datasets.\nMoreover, it exhibits the highest average number\nof turns and the longest average length per instance\nof data. While SODA also demonstrates a high av-\nerage number of rounds, it is primarily composed\nof conceptual banter rather than instructional con-\ntent. Additionally, the average number of tokens\nper dialogue in SODA is 231.8, whereas UltraChat\nboasts a remarkable 1467.4 tokens. To evaluate\nDataset\n#Dialogue\nAvg.\n#Turns\nAvg.

Lexical diversity is calculated by averaging the MTLD score (Mc-\nCarthy and Jarvis, 2010) over each utterance with LexicalRichness7. 10000 samples are randomly drawn from each\ndataset for topic diversity and coherence measurement. Topic diversity is measured by averaging the cosine distance\nbetween each pair of data with OpenAI embedding API. Coherence is scored by ChatGPT on a scale of 1-10.\ndiversity, we measure both lexical diversity and\ntopic diversity. UltraChat outperforms previous\ndatasets in terms of lexical diversity. However, in\nterms of topic diversity, UltraChat falls slightly\nshort compared to GPT4ALL but still surpasses\nother datasets significantly. This may be attributed\nto the relatively large number of tokens in each data\ninstance, which regularizes the data embedding of\neach dialogue (the GPT4ALL dataset in single-\nturn). To ensure the coherence of multi-round di-\nalogues, we also conduct coherence evaluations.\nThe results indicate that most of the datasets exhibit\nrelatively high coherence. Notably, UltraChat and\nBaize data rank the highest in terms of coherence.\n4.6\nUltraLLaMA\nWe developed UltraLLaMA, an enhanced variant\nof the LLaMA-13B (Touvron et al., 2023) model,\nby training it on the UltraChat dataset. To improve\nthe model\u2019s comprehension of dialogue context, we\nbreak down each dialogue into smaller sequences,\nlimiting them to a maximum length of 2048 tokens.\nDuring the training process, we only calculate the\nloss for the model\u2019s responses. This approach en-\nsured that the model had access to the relevant\ninformation from earlier parts of the conversation,\nenabling a more comprehensive understanding of\nthe ongoing dialogue. By incorporating the pre-\nceding context, UltraLLaMA was equipped to gen-\nerate more contextually appropriate and coherent\nresponses. We use standard cross-entropy loss to\nfinetune the model. The model is trained with 128\nA100 GPUs and the total batch size is 512.\n5\nEvaluation\nAssessing the quality of responses generated by\nchat models presents significant challenges, par-\nticularly when considering the potential instability\nacross different settings. Traditional benchmarks\nhave been utilized for evaluation purposes; how-\never, a contemporary approach involves leveraging\nadvanced models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. This\npractice has proven to yield more reliable results\ncompared to human evaluation in our preliminary\nexperiments.\nOur Evaluation Set.\nThis evaluation set encom-\npassed the Vicuna benchmark as well as an addi-\ntional 300 questions and instructions generated by\nGPT-4. The questions/instructions covered a wide\nrange of topics, including commonsense, world\nknowledge, professional knowledge (specifically\nphysics and biology), mathematics, response gen-\neration, and writing tasks. Moreover, each part\nof the question set was further categorized based\non different levels of difficulty. Table 6 lists some\nexamples of the evaluation set.\nTruthful QA.\nFollowing Sun et al. (2023), we\nfirst use TruthfulQA to test the world knowledge of\nour model and baselines. The TruthfulQA bench-\nmark assesses how well a model can identify true\nstatements related to the real world. Its purpose\nis to determine the risks of producing false claims\nor spreading misinformation. The benchmark con-\nsists of questions written in various styles, cover-\ning 38 different categories, and is designed to be\nchallenging. It includes two evaluation tasks: the\nmultiple-choice task and the generation task.\n5.1\nBaselines\nAlpaca.\nAlpaca (Taori et al., 2023a), derived\nfrom the LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) model,\nis an instruction-following language model that has\nbeen effectively optimized on 52,000 demonstra-\ntions of instruction data.

An automatic evaluation by GPT-\n4 demonstrates that Vicuna can yield over 90% re-\nsponse quality of ChatGPT. In following practices,\nVicuna is widely acknowledged as the state-of-the-\nart open-source chat model. This is evident in the\nChat Arena9, where a total of 13,000 anonymous\nvotes reveal that the quality score of vicuna-13B\nsurpasses that of other open-source models.\nKoala-13B.\nSimilar to the previous two baselines,\nKoala (Geng et al., 2023) is another LLaMA-based\nmodel fine-tuned on selected public dialogues. In\nexisting open evaluations, Koala\u2019s performance\nwill be slightly worse than vicuna, but it still re-\nmains a strong baseline.\nDolly-V2.\nDolly (Conover et al., 2023) is a based\non the Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) model, which\nutilizes 15k human-generated instruction-following\ndata. The data is organized by following Instruct-\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), including brainstorm-\ning, classification, closed QA, generation, informa-\ntion extraction, open QA, and summarization.\nOpenAssistant-12B.\nOpenAssistant-12b (K\u00f6pf\net al., 2023) is also a Pythia-based model that at-\ntempts to democratize the alignment process of\nLLMs. The project collects a conversation corpus\nconsisting of 161,443 messages distributed across\n8https://sharegpt.com/\n9https://lmsys.org/blog/\n2023-05-03-arena/\n66,497 conversation trees and trains a model on\nthese manually annotated data.\nOur evaluation also includes other chat language\nmodels like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), MPT (Mo-\nsaic, 2023), and Baize (Xu et al., 2023).\n\u8868\u683c 1\nWin\nTie\nLose\nVicuna-13B\n187\n55\n139\nKoala-13B\n203\n41\n137\nBaize-13B\n259\n16\n106\nMPT-7B\n263\n24\n92\nOpenAssistant-12\nB\n237\n40\n103\nAlpaca-7B\n291\n35\n55\nDolly-12B\n325\n18\n38\nChatGPT\n190\n55\n136\nVicuna-13B\nKoala-13B\nBaize-13B\nMPT-7B\nOpenAssistant-12B\nAlpaca-7B\nDolly-12B\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n38\n55\n103\n92\n106\n137\n139\n18\n35\n40\n24\n16\n41\n55\n325\n291\n237\n263\n259\n203\n187\nWin\nTie\nLose\n1\nFigure 2: Response comparison of UltraLLaMA with\nother baselines on the curated evaluation set.

The scoring is between\n1 and 10, and average scores are reported. Bold indicates best score and underlined indicates the second best.\nAdditionally, we discover that the order in which\nthe responses are presented significantly affects\nthe evaluation results. To address this issue, we\nrandomly determine the order of the responses for\neach question. Finally, we count the number of\nWin/Tie/Lose times against each baseline model,\nand the result is presented in Figure 2. It can be\nseen that UltraLLaMA demonstrates superior per-\nformance compared to every open-source model\nin the evaluation set, exhibiting an impressive win-\nning rate of up to 85%. It is worth noting that\nUltraLLaMA also outperforms Vicuna with 13%\nhigher winning rate.\n5.3\nIndependent Scoring\nGiven the instability of pair-wise comparison, we\nalso conduct independent scoring by employing\nChatGPT to assign scores ranging from 1 to\n10, based on the quality of their responses.\nTable 7 illustrates the scoring comparison between\nUltraLLaMA and the baseline models. Notably,\nour model demonstrates superior performance\ncompared to all the open-source counterparts by\na significant margin in terms of overall scores.\nFurthermore, UltraLLaMA achieved the highest\nperformance on nearly every segment of the eval-\nuation set, showcasing its exceptional capabilities.\nThis breakdown also provides insights into the\nperformance of each model on specific types of\nquestions and instructions. Generally, all models\nperformed better on simpler questions pertaining\nto commonsense knowledge and general world un-\nderstanding. However, more complex tasks that in-\nvolved reasoning and creative writing proved to be\nchallenging for most models. Interestingly, Alpaca,\ndespite having only 7 billion parameters, performs\ncomparatively well with larger models on ques-\ntions related to commonsense and world knowl-\nedge.

Additionally, it is worth noting that Dolly\nand OpenAssistant, which are based on Pythia (Bi-\nderman et al., 2023), display inferior performance\ncompared to models based on LLaMA of similar or\neven smaller sizes. This observation highlights the\nsignificance of the underlying backbone language\nmodel.\n5.4\nTruthfulQA Results\nWe evaluate the models on TruthfulQA multiple-\nchoice task. For each answer candidate, we ask the\nmodel whether it is true or false. The judgment\naccuracy of each model is presented in Table 8. We\ncan observe that truth judgment remains a challeng-\ning task for existing models, given the accuracy of\nthe best model only slightly surpasses 50%. Ultra-\nLLaMA performs comparatively with Vicuna, and\noutperforms the rest of the baselines.\n5.5\nThe Impact of System Prompts\nUsing system prompts to prompt the role and re-\nsponse style of LLMs is a common practice. In our\nevaluation, we have observed that system prompts\nhave a significant influence on the response style of\nthe generated output. Specifically, when the model\nis prompted to provide a \"helpful and detailed\"\nresponse, it tends to generate more pertinent de-\ntails, thereby enhancing the informativeness of the\nresponse.

To illustrate this effect, we can refer to\nTable 9, wherein both outputs are correct, yet the\nmodel guided by system prompts yields a more\ninformative response.\n6\nConclusion\nIn drawing to a close, our work introduces Ultra-\nChat, a structured design of multi-turn instructional\nconversation data primed to foster the growth of\ngeneral chat models.\nUltraChat encapsulates a\nbroad range of human-AI interactions, bringing\nto life a myriad of dialogues across various top-\nics and instructions. Statistically, UltraChat shows\nan impressive presence in critical metrics such as\nscale, average length, diversity, and consistency,\nfurther establishing itself as a leading open-source\ndataset. We leveraged UltraChat to fine-tune the\nLLaMA model, leading to the development of the\nrobust conversational model, UltraLLaMA. Evalu-\nation across multiple benchmarks reveals that Ul-\ntraLLaMA surpasses previous open-source models\nlike Vicuna, Alpaca, and Koala in performance. We\neagerly await the innovative research and develop-\nment that will be catalyzed by our contributions in\nthe field of AI conversational models. In the future,\nwe will evaluate UltraLLaMA on a wider range of\ndatasets and benchmarks.\nLimitations\nEvaluating the response quality of large language\nmodels is an extremely challenging task, and any\nassessments may have biases. In the future, we\nwill assess UltraLLaMA more comprehensively,\nincluding complete tests of reasoning and multi-\nturn dialogue. We use ChatGPT instead of GPT-\n4 to perform automatic evaluation, which could\nproduce steady results (even changing the prompt\ndrastically), but it is still not as reliable as GPT-4. A\nfurther limitation of our current dataset, UltraChat,\nis its exclusive support for the English language.\nHowever, we are actively working on collecting\nand constructing data in other languages, such as\nChinese, to enhance the diversity of our dataset.\nThis effort aims to foster the development of chat\nlanguage models in various languages.\nAlthough it has achieved promising experimen-\ntal performance, UltraLLaMA may still face the\nproblems that all large language models have, such\nas hallucination problems, ethical problems caused\nby misuse, and so on. Meanwhile, training Ul-\ntraLLaMA is more energy-intensive than other\nlightweight models.\nReferences\nYuvanesh Anand, Zach Nussbaum, Brandon Duder-\nstadt, Benjamin Schmidt, and Andriy Mulyar. 2023.\nGpt4all: Training an assistant-style chatbot with large\nscale data distillation from gpt-3.5-turbo. https:\n//github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all.\nStella Biderman, Hailey Schoelkopf, Quentin Anthony,\nHerbie Bradley, Kyle O\u2019Brien, Eric Hallahan, Mo-\nhammad Aflah Khan, Shivanshu Purohit, USVSN Sai\nPrashanth, Edward Raff, et al. 2023.

He formulated the law while studying\nthe planets\u2019 movement around the sun and realized that there was a quantifiable force directing them towards the sun. In 1687, he\npublished his book titled \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,\" where he described the law of universal gravitation\nin detail, outlining how two objects experience an attraction towards each other due to their mass and distance between them.\nThis discovery revolutionized our understanding of the universe and ushered in the Age of Enlightenment. Today, Newton\u2019s law\ncontinues to form the foundation of modern astrophysics and space exploration.\nTable 10: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nWhich weighs more: a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?\nA pound of feathers and a pound of bricks both weigh exactly one pound. This is because one pound is a unit of weight, just as a\nfoot is a unit of length or a second is a unit of time. We use the pound (or other unit of weight) to describe the weight of different\nobjects, regardless of what that object is made of. So the answer to your question is that a pound of feathers and a pound of\nbricks both weigh the same amount.\nTable 11: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nWhich animal is known as man\u2019s best friend?\nThere are many animals that humans enjoy as companion animals, but one of the absolute standout answers to the question\n\"which animal is known as a man\u2019s best friend?\" is the domestically-bred dog. Domesticated dogs have been by humans\u2019 sides\nfor tens of thousands of years, providing faithful companionship and help; guarding people and property; and lending emotional\nsupport in everything from long, lonely days to military deployments. Dogs come in an almost mind-boggling variety of breeds\nof various sizes, with different energy levels, personalities, and temperaments, meaning there\u2019s almost certainly a pup out there\nwho will be a perfect fit for whoever needs it most.\nTable 12: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nWho was the 16th President of the United States?\nThe 16th President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln. He assumed the presidency during a very tumultuous time in\nAmerican history, as the nation was torn apart by the Civil War. During his presidency, he was known for his strong leadership, his\ncommitment to the preservation of the Union, and his support for the abolition of slavery. Some of his most notable achievements\ninclude issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in the Confederate States were free, and delivering\nthe Gettysburg Address, an iconic speech honoring the soldiers who died in the Civil War. Lincoln is widely regarded as one of\nthe greatest American Presidents, remembered for his unwavering leadership during a challenging period in the nation\u2019s history.\nTable 13: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nWrite a short dialogue between two planets.\nMars: \"Hey there Neptune, how\u2019s it going?\"\nNeptune: \"Hi there Mars, I\u2019ve been better. It\u2019s getting a bit windy around here.\"\nMars: \"Sorry to hear that. Have you tried using energy other than wind? Maybe solar power?\"\nNeptune: \"Yeah, but it\u2019s getting difficult to generate solar power in all of this mist and clouds. And we definitely can\u2019t use tides\nor waves here, they\u2019re too unpredictable.\"\nMars: \"Oh, I see. Well, I hope you find a solution soon. How are your oceans holding up?\"\nNeptune: \"They\u2019ve been a bit choppy lately with these intense storms we\u2019ve been experiencing. But I guess it comes with living\nin a planet like this.\"\nMars: \" Definitely not designed for the faint-hearted! Any other issues you\u2019re facing?\"\nNeptune: \"Not really. I think we have a stable temperature and atmosphere, and the wildlife here hasn\u2019t shown much complaint.\"\nMars: \"That\u2019s lucky. I envy your tranquil oceans, we\u2019ve had way too much volcanic activity lately causing all sorts of disturbance\nin our lava streams.\"\nNeptune: \"That sounds rough, better invest in those climate-controlling nanites to stabilize things maybe?\"\nMars: \"Ha-ha, very funny. Just like we also could consider your frozen polar regions as an opportunity to experiment with our\nfrost nanobots on.\"\nNeptune: \"A fun concept! But let\u2019s stick to the task at hand, if you need any technical advice, come right ahead, I don\u2019t want\nyour planet getting any more disturbed than it already is.\nTable 14: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nWrite a short story about the first second of the universe.\nIn the first second of the universe, darkness reigned supreme. There was no light, no sound, no shape, no substance. Nothing yet\nwas, but there was an intense power, a raw energy waiting to be unleashed. Within infinity, the first second held the potential for\ncreation in its grasp. And then, with a mighty bang, a bright point of light emerged into existence. In it, the most fundamental\nparticles were born, their forms yet unknown as they frenetically collided in a chaotic dance of creation. Within this primordial\nlight, every force of nature and every component of life was stirred from pure energy to physical reality. The first atoms quickly\nassembled, and from these, stars and galaxies began to form. Their fusion creating a hot environment that pushed back the very\nvoid, shaping the cosmos through expanding and cooling waves. In this cosmic first, no structure of experience, not even time or\nspace, could establish its rule. For an instant, the entirety of the universe existed in an embryonic nexus, a cosmic singularity\nfrom which all future existence originated. It was a microcosm forging the macrocosm of which it ultimately becomes a part, its\nmoment of birth a metaphor for the cycles of creation that permeate the multiverse(s).From that single point of light, an infinite\nuniverse unfolded. For centuries, eons ahead, and forevermore, it remained the most foundational blink of its unceasing journey\ninto the depths of the Great Beyond. The first second is the beginning of everything.\nTable 15: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nHow does superconductivity work and what are its practical applications?\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon that allows materials to conduct electricity without resistance at extremely low temperatures.\nAt low temperatures, the interaction between the particles in a superconducting material can produce a state called the \"Bose-\nEinstein condensate,\" which leads to the loss of electrical resistance. In materials, superconductivity comes when a magnetic force\ninteracts with an Electronic current. This interplay in turn provides energy savings and speeds up current. Practical applications\nmainly include MRI machines, high-speed trains, magnetic levitation, supercharging power grids that can transfer energy more\nefficiently.One of the main applications of Superconductivity is being used in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) machines\nused in hospitals around the world, to non-invasively scan patients for health diagnosis without exposing them to high levels of\nradiation. Another important practical application of superconductivity is in power grid operations where large currents can be\ntransmitted to long distances by highly superconducting coil systems that minimize grid energy losses, reducing environmental\npollution also by highly efficient electric motors that harness large quantities of electricity efficiently.Aside from these, future\nprojects include superconducting propulsion on planes, trains becoming lighter if not magnetic and able to move on rails with a\nsignificant increase in speed. Furthermore, the prospects of supercapacitors replacing electric vehicle batteries being cost and\nenergy efficient are currently being researched. Overall, superconductivity presents various exciting opportunities in multiple\nindustries from high-precision engineering to reducing CO2 emissions and supporting a more environmentally friendly energy\nmodel where both cost efficiency and practicality exist hand in hand.\nTable 16: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nPretend to be a character in a post-apocalyptic world. Describe how you survive and the allies you encounter.\nAs a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world, I have learned to be resourceful, alert, and adaptable. I have had to rely on my wits and\nmy instincts to survive, and I have been fortunate enough to encounter many allies who have helped me along the way.One of my\ngreatest survival tools has been my ability to scavenge for resources. I have learned to identify the best places to find food, water,\nand shelter, and I have become skilled at navigating the rough terrain that makes up my new world. When I first emerged from\nmy bunker after the apocalypse hit, I was alone and unsure of what to do. But as I ventured out into the wasteland, I realized\nthat there were others like me who were struggling to survive.I quickly learned to Trust my instincts and to be constantly alert\nfor potential dangers. I have encountered wild animals, rogue survivors, and even mutated creatures over the years, and I have\nlearned to defend myself against them. I still remember the first time I met a group of fellow survivors, and how grateful I was\nto have them by my side. We quickly formed a cohesive unit, and together we were able to fend off danger and defend our\nterritory.As time passed, I encountered more and more allies who were willing to lend a hand. I found a group of farmers who\ntaught me how to grow my own food, and a group of scientists who were working to find a cure for the lethal virus that had\ndecimated the population. I even found a band of traveling performers who helped to lift our spirits and remind us that there was\nstill joy to be found in this desolate world. Despite the challenges we faced, I am grateful to have these amazing people in my\nlife. They have taught me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. We may not have a cure for the virus yet, but\nwe are a determined lot, and we are all in this together. As long as we have each other, we will survive.\nTable 17: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nWhat are the main interpretations of quantum mechanics and how do they differ?\nQuantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales of\nspace and time. There are several interpretations of quantum mechanics, each with its own set of assumptions and predictions\nabout how the world works. Here are some of the main interpretations of quantum mechanics and how they differ:1. Copenhagen\nInterpretation: This is the most widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics. It states that until a measurement is made,\na system exists in a superposition of states, representing all possible outcomes with equal probability. When a measurement is\nmade, the system collapses into a single, definite state. This interpretation assumes that the act of measurement itself causes\nthe system to collapse into a definite state, and that there is no objective reality until a measurement is made.2. Many-Worlds\nInterpretation: This interpretation proposes that every possible outcome of a superposition of states actually occurs in a multiverse\nof parallel universes. Thus, when a measurement is made, the system splits into different universes, each corresponding to one of\nthe possible outcomes. This interpretation assumes that all possibilities are realized, but only in different universes, and that\nthe act of measurement does not cause the collapse of the wave function.3. Bohmian Mechanics: This interpretation proposes\nthat particles have a definite position in space, even when in a superposition of states. It suggests that the wave function guides\nthe motion of particles, and that the act of measurement does not cause a collapse of the wave function, but merely provides\ninformation about the pre-existing reality. 4. de Broglie-Bohm Theory: This interpretation is very similar to Bohmian Mechanics,\nbut it also assumes that all particles in the universe are connected by a hidden-variable, and that the motion of one particle\ndetermines the motion of all other particles. 5. Pilot-Wave Theory: This interpretation proposes that particles have a wave-like\nproperty that guides their motion through space. It assumes that the wave function does not collapse, but rather that the wave\nguides the motion of particles.In conclusion, there are several interpretations of quantum mechanics, each with its own set of\nassumptions and predictions about how the world works. While they all attempt to describe the behavior of matter and energy at\nthe smallest scales of space and time, they differ in their assumptions about the role of the observer, the nature of reality, and the\ncollapse of the wave function.\nTable 18: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nCompose a rhymed poem about electromagnetism.\nElectromagnetism is a force we can\u2019t ignore,\nIt\u2019s the reason for many things we adore.\nIn a magnetic field, a wire will glow,\nAnd the electrons will align, both old and new.\nElectricity and magnetism are hand in hand,\nOne creates a field, the other has a brand.\nThe magnetic field can push and pull,\nOn a wire with current, it will react in full.\nThe attraction and repulsion it brings,\nAre the reason for many things.\nFrom motors to generators, and much more in between,\nElectromagnetism is at the root of what it means.\nIt\u2019s a force that\u2019s all around us,\nFrom the compass to the light switch.\nWith its power, it can do much,\nFrom a simple needle to a rocket\u2019s thrust.\nIt\u2019s a force we can\u2019t deny,\nFor it\u2019s a part of our lives.\nElectromagnetism is something to admire,\nFor its strength and its might, it has no equal, it\u2019s sure.\nTable 19: An example of UltraLLaMa.\nDirect Generation\nWhat are some of the health benefits and risks of drinking coffee, and how can one maximize the former and minimize the latter?\nThere are several potential health benefits associated with drinking coffee, such as increased alertness, improved mood, and a\nreduced risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and liver cancer. However, there are also some potential risks, such as\nincreased anxiety, disrupted sleep, and negative effects on the digestive system. To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks,\nit\u2019s important to consume coffee in moderation and pay attention to how it affects your body.\nHow much coffee is considered moderate?\nThe definition of moderate coffee consumption can vary depending on the individual and other factors such as age, gender, and\nhealth status. However, in general, moderate coffee consumption is considered to be around 3-5 cups per day, or up to 400\nmilligrams of caffeine per day. It\u2019s important to note that some people may be more sensitive to caffeine than others, so it\u2019s\nimportant to pay attention to how your body reacts and adjust your consumption accordingly.\nUltraChat\nWhat are some of the health benefits and risks of drinking coffee, and how can one maximize the former and minimize the latter?\nThere are several health benefits and risks associated with drinking coffee. Here are some of them: Health benefits:1. Lower risk\nof type 2 diabetes: Studies have shown that consuming coffee can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.2. Improved\ncognitive function: Coffee is a stimulant that helps improve cognitive function, including alertness, concentration, and memory.3.\nLower risk of depression: Studies have shown that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of developing depression.4. Lower risk of\ncertain cancers: According to research, coffee consumption can lower the risk of certain cancers, including liver and colorectal\ncancer.5. Reduced risk of heart disease: There is evidence that drinking moderate amounts of coffee can lower the risk of\nheart disease.Risks:1. Insomnia: Drinking too much coffee, especially late in the day, can cause insomnia.2. Increased risk of\nanxiety: Caffeine can increase anxiety levels in some people.3. Digestive issues: Drinking too much coffee can cause digestive\nproblems like acid reflux, diarrhea, and ulcers.4. Increased heart rate: Caffeine can increase heart rate, which can be dangerous\nfor people with pre-existing heart conditions.5. Addiction: Regular consumption of caffeine can lead to addiction.To maximize\nthe health benefits and minimize the risks of drinking coffee, here are a few tips:1. Limit your caffeine intake to no more than 400\nmilligrams per day, or about 4 cups of coffee.2. Avoid drinking coffee late in the day, especially if you have trouble sleeping.3.\nOpt for organic, pesticide-free coffee to minimize exposure to toxins.4. Add cinnamon to your coffee instead of sugar to help\nregulate blood sugar levels.5. Drink your coffee black or with a small amount of milk to avoid consuming excessive sugar and\ncalories.6. Consider switching to decaf coffee if you want to cut back on caffeine. 7. Avoid drinking coffee on an empty stomach\nas it can increase the risk of digestive problems.\nI love my morning coffee, but sometimes it makes me feel a bit jittery. What can I do to avoid this?\nIf you love your morning coffee but find that it\u2019s making you feel jittery, here are a few tips to help you avoid this:1. Choose a\nlower-caffeine coffee: Look for coffee that has less caffeine, like decaf or a blend with a lower percentage of caffeine.2. Don\u2019t\ndrink coffee on an empty stomach: Drinking coffee on an empty stomach can cause your blood sugar levels to drop, which\ncan make you feel jittery. Try drinking your coffee with breakfast or after eating something.3. Drink water with your coffee:\nStay hydrated by drinking water before or after your coffee. Drinking water will help flush out the caffeine quicker, which can\nhelp you avoid jitteriness.4. Don\u2019t drink too much coffee: Stick to one or two cups of coffee per day. Anything more than that\ncould result in increased caffeine consumption, which can cause jitteriness.5. Switch to tea: Tea contains less caffeine than\ncoffee, making it a good alternative if you want to avoid jitteriness. Try green tea, which has less caffeine and offers other health\nbenefits.\nTable 20: A comparison of two dialogues with the same opening line.

    "text": "Goat: Fine-tuned LLaMA Outperforms GPT-4 on Arithmetic Tasks\nTiedong Liu\nNational University of Singapore\ntiedong.liu@u.nus.edu\nBryan Kian Hsiang Low\nNational University of Singapore\nlowkh@comp.nus.edu.sg\nAbstract\nWe introduce Goat, a fine-tuned LLaMA model\nthat significantly outperforms GPT-4 on a range\nof arithmetic tasks. Fine-tuned on a syntheti-\ncally generated dataset, Goat achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance on BIG-bench arithmetic\nsub-task.\nIn particular, the zero-shot Goat-\n7B matches or even surpasses the accuracy\nachieved by the few-shot PaLM-540B. Sur-\nprisingly, Goat can achieve near-perfect ac-\ncuracy on large-number addition and subtrac-\ntion through supervised fine-tuning only, which\nis almost impossible with previous pretrained\nlanguage models, such as Bloom, OPT, GPT-\nNeoX, etc. We attribute Goat\u2019s exceptional\nperformance to LLaMA\u2019s consistent tokeniza-\ntion of numbers. To tackle more challenging\ntasks like large-number multiplication and divi-\nsion, we propose an approach that classifies\ntasks based on their learnability, and subse-\nquently decomposes unlearnable tasks, such\nas multi-digit multiplication and division, into\na series of learnable tasks by leveraging basic\narithmetic principles.

However, it is surprising that such power-\nful language models still struggle with elementary\narithmetic tasks.

Prompts are\nmarked in bold, followed by Goat-7B\u2019s response.\narithmetic tasks, particularly multiplication and di-\nvision of large numbers, currently remains far from\noptimal, with accuracy levels trending toward zero.\nIn this paper, we present Goat, a fine-tuned lan-\nguage model that is GOod at Arithmetic Tasks.\nGoat achieves state-of-the-art performance in ele-\nmentary arithmetic, including addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division of integers. We adopt\nan end-to-end supervised instruction-finetuning\nparadigm on LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), lever-\naging a synthetically generated dataset containing\naround 1 million samples. Unlike previous research\non arithmetic computation (Lee and Kim, 2023;\narXiv:2305.14201v1  [cs.LG]  23 May 2023\nNogueira et al., 2021; Nye et al., 2021; Qian et al.,\n2022; Zhou et al., 2022b), our study demonstrates\nthat through supervised fine-tuning alone and with-\nout applying any special techniques, our model\nis capable of generating direct answers for large-\nnumber addition and subtraction with near-perfect\naccuracy in a zero-shot setting. We attribute this ex-\nceptional arithmetic ability to LLaMA\u2019s consistent\ntokenization of numbers and show that this is al-\nmost impossible to achieve for previous LLMs such\nas Bloom (Scao et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al.,\n2022), GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), Pythia (Bi-\nderman et al., 2023), etc.\nHowever, the model encounters significant dif-\nficulties when generating direct answers for arith-\nmetic tasks like large-number multiplication and di-\nvision. To overcome this challenge, we propose an\napproach that categorizes various arithmetic tasks\ninto learnable and unlearnable tasks, subsequently\ndecomposing the unlearnable tasks, such as multi-\ndigit multiplication and division, into a series of\nlearnable tasks by leveraging basic arithmetic prin-\nciples. Our approach ensures that the intermediate\nsupervision which facilitates the model\u2019s learning\nis also easily understandable and interpretable by\nhumans. We fine-tune our model to generate the\nproposed CoT before generating the final answer,\nsimilar to sketchpad (Nye et al., 2021). Our method\noutperforms GPT-4\u2019s long multiplication and long\ndivision methods by a large margin. We assess\nthe performance of our model using BIG-bench\n(Srivastava et al., 2022) arithmetic sub-task, and\nprovide a comprehensive evaluation of the effec-\ntiveness of our proposed method. Our findings\nsuggest that the model can learn the pattern and\ngeneralize to unseen data instead of purely mem-\norizing the computation. Additionally, Goat-7B\ncan be conveniently trained using Low-Rank Adap-\ntation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) technique on a\n24GB VRAM GPU, making it easily reproducible\nfor other researchers.\nTo summarize, our contributions include:\n\u2022 Our model achieves state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance on various elementary arithmetic tasks,\nincluding addition, subtraction, multiplication,\nand division of positive integers (Section 4).\nWe show that an open-sourced model fine-\ntuned on a synthetically generated dataset has\nthe potential to achieve even higher accuracy\non arithmetic tasks compared to GPT-4.\n\u2022 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nto demonstrate the feasibility that supervised\nfine-tuning alone can enable LLMs to gener-\nate direct answers for certain elementary arith-\nmetic tasks, such as large-number addition\nand subtraction, without applying any special\ntechniques (Section 3.3). Previously effec-\ntive chain-of-thought (CoT) methods, such\nas those used for addition in sketchpad (Nye\net al., 2021) and LM Tutor (Qian et al., 2022),\nare no longer necessary. The impressive per-\nformance is mainly attributed to LLaMA\u2019s\nconsistent tokenization of numbers.\n\u2022 To solve large-number multiplication and di-\nvision, we propose a novel decomposition\nmethod based on the learnability of the task,\nleveraging basic arithmetic principles to en-\nsure human interpretability (Section 3.4).\n\u2022 We systematically investigate the proposed\ndecomposition method and demonstrate its\neffectiveness (Section 5). We conduct thor-\nough experiments on the decomposition steps\nin a fully synthetic environment by mitigat-\ning many hard-to-control aspects of natural\nlanguage. Our experimental setup offers an\nideal platform to study the impact of CoT and\nintermediate supervision.\n\u2022 Our end-to-end instruction tuning pipeline can\nbe easily integrated into existing instruction-\ntuned language models (Chiang et al., 2023;\nTaori et al., 2023) and potentially enhance\ntheir mathematical reasoning for math word\nproblems. We release the model, dataset, and\nscript for generating the dataset.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nInstruction Tuning\nInstruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Ouyang\net al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2021) is a technique used\nto align pretrained language models with human in-\nstructions. It enables targeted customization of\nLLMs to specific tasks, enhancing their ability\nto generate more accurate and contextually rele-\nvant responses and improving the zero-shot perfor-\nmance. The dataset used for instruction tuning can\nbe human-written (Ouyang et al., 2022), machine-\ngenerated (Peng et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023;\nWang et al., 2022), or collected from web (Geng\net al., 2023). Recently, there has been extensive\nresearch on fine-tuning LLaMA (Touvron et al.,\n2023) for various downstream tasks using instruc-\ntion tuning (Chiang et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2023;\nTaori et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Yunxiang et al.,\n2023). Creating high-quality instruction tuning\ndatasets can be expensive and time-consuming. In\nthis study, we utilize a simple Python program to\ngenerate input-output pairs for arithmetic tasks.\n2.2\nArithmetic Reasoning\nArithmetic reasoning has been a topic of interest in\nNLP research for many years (Lu et al., 2022). Re-\ncently, the use of pretrained models (Brown et al.,\n2020; OpenAI, 2023) has shown great capabilities\nin solving math word problems. Particularly, chain\nof thought (CoT) (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022; Zhou et al., 2022a) provides the model with\nthe intermediate steps to derive the final answer.\nHowever, studies have shown that LLMs struggle\nwith basic arithmetic computation and often make\narithmetic mistakes, even though the reasoning pro-\ncess is correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022;\nSchick et al., 2023). Consequently, one key chal-\nlenge of arithmetic reasoning, aside from mapping\nnatural language to arithmetic expressions, is how\nto compute the generated arithmetic expressions\nwith high accuracy.\n2.3\nArithmetic Computation\nRecent studies have explored using external tools\nto evaluate arithmetic expressions.\nToolformer\n(Schick et al., 2023) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al.,\n2021) invoke an external calculator to compute the\ngenerated arithmetic expression. PoT (Chen et al.,\n2022) and PAL (Gao et al., 2022) generate pro-\ngrams that can be executed to produce the final\nanswer. While arithmetic can be solved using cal-\nculators or programs easily, the ability to perform\narithmetic computation is a remarkable trait of hu-\nman intelligence, and we anticipate LLMs should\npossess this ability as well.\nPrevious studies have evaluated the arithmetic\nabilities of LLMs. Nogueira et al. (2021) have\nevaluated addition and subtraction tasks. Muffo\net al. (2022) have further examined 2-digit multi-\nplication. Yuan et al. (2023) have tested different\ntypes of arithmetic operations. CoT seems to be\na promising solution for arithmetic computation\nas well. Similar to humans, autoregressive lan-\nguage model may rely on intermediate supervision\nto generate the final answer. Scratchpad (Nye et al.,\n2021) finetunes the language models to produce\nCoT before generating an answer, and has demon-\nstrated effectiveness on 8-digit addition. However,\nwe show that previously effective CoT methods,\nsuch as those used for addition in sketchpad (Nye\net al., 2021) and LM Tutor (Qian et al., 2022), are\nno longer necessary for certain arithmetic tasks\nlike addition. By leveraging simple supervised fine-\ntuning alone, our model can perform addition and\nsubtraction with sufficiently high accuracy. For\nchallenging tasks like large-number multiplication\nand division, previous studies (Muffo et al., 2022;\nLee and Kim, 2023) either fail to compute or are\ninefficient. Furthermore, our model is trained end-\nto-end such that it can follow human instructions.\n3\nMethod\n3.1\nLanguage Model\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) is a collection of\nopen-source pretrained language models trained on\ntrillions of tokens using publicly available datasets,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance on many\nbenchmarks.\nPrevious studies (Kim et al., 2021; Nogueira\net al., 2021) have shown that tokenization is impor-\ntant for LLM\u2019s arithmetic ability. Many commonly-\nused subword tokenization techniques today are\nnot ideal to represent numbers. However, LLaMA\nsplits each digit into an individual token (Yuan\net al., 2023), thereby ensuring consistent tokeniza-\ntion of numbers, as shown in Appendix B.\nThe selection of language models is crucial to\nour work. We believe the remarkable arithmetic\nability demonstrated in this work is mainly at-\ntributed to LLaMA\u2019s consistent tokenization of\nnumbers.\nWe experimentally verify that other\nLLMs, such as Bloom, OPT, GPT-NeoX, and\nPythia, finetuned on the same arithmetic dataset,\ncannot match LLaMA\u2019s arithmetic ability.\n3.2\nLearnability of Arithmetic Tasks\nWies et al. (2022) have provided a theoretical anal-\nysis on the use of intermediate supervision for solv-\ning composite tasks. Specifically, they have shown\nthat for any family of tasks which on the one hand,\nare unlearnable, and on the other hand, can be de-\ncomposed into a polynomial number of simple sub-\ntasks, unlearnable composite problems can become\nlearnable by using intermediate supervision or step-\nby-step CoT.\nBuilding upon their analysis, we first experimen-\ntally categorize learnable and unlearnable tasks. In\nthe context of arithmetic computation, learnable\nTask\nInput\nOutput\nLearnable\nCopying\n59265395\n59265395\nSplit\n4536\n4000 + 500 + 30 + 6\nComparison\n8116449, 97863\n8116449 > 97863\nOrdering\n3568, 9591, 8061\n3568, 8061, 9591\nAddition\n1270769 + 264985867430\n264987138199\nSubtraction\n40920 \u2212 6173772696\n\u22126173731776\nMultiplication nD \u00d7 1D\n591714761929184 \u00d7 4\n2366859047716736\nDivision nD \u00f7 1D\n339229815457 \u00f7 4\n84807453864 R 1\nUnlearnable\nMultiplication nD \u00d7 mD\n6983387 \u00d7 16919\n118151924653\nDivision nD \u00f7 mD\n64729486 \u00f7 472\n137138 R 350\nTable 1: Summary and examples of learnable and unlearnable arithmetic tasks. For example, nD \u00f7 1D means\nn-digit by 1-digit division, where n \u2265 1. Unlearnable tasks are mainly multi-digit multiplication and division where\nn, m > 1. There are some special cases mentioned in Appendix E.\ntasks generally refer to those for which the model\ncan be successfully trained to generate direct an-\nswers, achieving sufficiently high accuracy within a\npredefined number of training epochs. Conversely,\nunlearnable tasks are those that the model strug-\ngles to learn and generate direct answers correctly\neven with extensive training. While the exact rea-\nson behind the varying learnability of tasks is not\nyet fully understood and requires further investiga-\ntion, we hypothesize that it is associated with the\ncomplexity of the underlying pattern and the size\nof working memory required for completing the\ntask (Bubeck et al., 2023).\nWe experimentally examine the learnability of\nthese tasks by fine-tuning the model specifically for\neach task in a simplified synthetic environment (Ta-\nble 7). Our recognized learnable and unlearnable\ntasks are listed in Table 1.\nThe categorization of tasks also aligns with hu-\nman perception. With practice, humans can men-\ntally calculate the addition and subtraction of two\nlarge numbers, writing down the final numerical\nanswer directly from the left (most significant fig-\nure) to the right (least significant figure) without\nthe need for sketchpad. However, mentally solving\nlarge-number multiplication and division is undeni-\nably a challenging task.\nWe also observe that our classification of tasks\nis consistent with the performance of GPT-4. In\nparticular, GPT-4 excels in generating direct an-\nswers for large-number addition and subtraction.\nHowever, its accuracy significantly drops when it\ncomes to multi-digit multiplication and division\ntasks. Our observation aligns with the claim made\nby Bubeck et al. (2023) that GPT-4 has a short\nworking memory and performs poorly on compos-\nite arithmetic tasks. This is particularly evident in\nthe case of multiplication, which involves multiple\nsteps of addition. The inability of powerful mod-\nels like GPT-4 to directly solve unlearnable tasks\nmay suggest that generating direct answers for such\ntasks is extremely challenging, even with extensive\ntraining.\nIt is noteworthy that a task that is learnable for\nLLaMA may not necessarily be learnable for other\nLLMs, which is validated in our experiments in\nSection 5.3. Furthermore, not all tasks classified as\nunlearnable are entirely impossible for the model\nto learn. For instance, 2-digit by 2-digit multi-\nplication is considered an unlearnable task in our\ncase. However, the model can still learn to generate\nthe direct answer by overfitting to the training set,\nwhich contains an exhaustive enumeration of all\npossible 2-digit multiplication. Nevertheless, the\nprocess takes nearly 10 epochs to achieve around\n90% accuracy. In contrast, by inserting our pro-\nposed CoT before the final answer, the model can\nachieve comparable accuracy in 2-digit multiplica-\ntion with only 1 epoch of training. These findings\nalign with the claim (Wies et al., 2022) that the\npresence of intermediate supervision facilitates the\nlearning process.\n3.3\nAddition and Subtraction\nAddition and subtraction tasks are learnable, as\nwith supervised fine-tuning alone, the model ex-\nhibits a remarkable ability to accurately generate\ndirect numerical answers. The model successfully\ncaptures the underlying patterns of the arithmetic\noperations. This is evident from the model\u2019s near-\nperfect accuracy on the unseen test set, despite\nbeing trained on a very limited subset of the data.\nIt is worth mentioning that addition and subtrac-\ntion operations do not require the use of CoT. This\ncontrasts with previous studies that have employed\nCoT for addition and subtraction tasks (Lee and\nKim, 2023; Nye et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2022).\n3.4\nMultiplication\nWe experimentally verify that n-digit by 1-digit\nmultiplication is learnable. In contrast, multi-digit\nmultiplication poses significant challenges for the\nmodel, suggesting it to be an unlearnable task. To\novercome this issue, we adopt a similar strategy\nused in sketchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which fine-\ntunes the LLMs to generate CoT before generat-\ning the answer. Specifically, we propose a CoT\nthat decomposes the multi-digit multiplication into\na series of 5 learnable sub-tasks: (1) extraction:\nextract the arithmetic expression from the natural\nlanguage instruction, (2) split: split the smaller\nnumber of the two into place values, (3) expan-\nsion: expand the sum based on the distributive\nproperty, (4) product: compute each product si-\nmultaneously, and (5) adding term by term: add\nthe first two terms and copy the rest, and the final\nsum is obtained.\nConsider the example in Fig. 1. Firstly, the arith-\nmetic expression 397 \u00d7 4429 is extracted from the\ninstruction, which can be considered as a \u201ccopying\u201d\ntask. Secondly, 397\u00d74429 = 4429\u00d7(300+90+7)\ninvolves two learnable tasks.\nThe larger num-\nber of the two is placed in front and then the\nsmaller one is split, which is similar to \u201corder-\ning\u201d and \u201csplit\u201d learnable tasks.\nThe ordering\nensures that there are fewer summation terms in\nthe next step, thereby reducing the CoT length.\nThirdly, the sum is expanded using distributive law:\n4429 \u00d7 (300 + 90 + 7) = 4429 \u00d7 300 + 4429 \u00d7\n90 + 4429 \u00d7 7, which is similar to \u201ccopying\u201d task.\nNext, 4429 \u00d7 300 + 4429 \u00d7 90 + 4429 \u00d7 7 =\n1328700 + 398610 + 31003 where the products\nare computed at once by applying \u201cmultiplication\nn-digit by 1-digit\u201d with zeros copied at the end of\neach product. Finally, we take the sum of the first\ntwo terms at each step, and copy the rest terms,\nleveraging \u201caddition\u201d and \u201ccopying\u201d. Hence, a\ncomposite unlearnable task is broken down into\nsimpler tasks that are all learnable.\n3.5\nDivision\nSimilarly, we observe that n-digit by 1-digit divi-\nsion is learnable. However, multi-digit division\nis unlearnable. We design a novel CoT leverag-\ning a modified slow division method based on the\nfollowing recurrence equation\nRj \u2212 D \u00d7 (qn\u2212(j+1) \u00d7 10j) = Rj+1\nwhere Rj is the j-th partial remainder of the divi-\nsion, qn\u2212(j+1) is the digit of the quotient in position\nn \u2212 (j + 1) numbered from least significant 0 to\nmost significant n \u2212 1, n is the number of digits\nin the quotient, and D is the divisor. Specifically,\nthe main idea is to subtract multiples of the divisor\nfrom the dividend until the remainder is less than\nthe divisor.\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the CoT used in\nFig. 1. Consider the first iteration (first equation).\nThe first step 8914\u221264\u00d7100 requires the model to\ncopy the dividend and the divisor, and subsequently\ngenerate a number qn\u2212(j+1) \u00d7 10j such that the\nproduct of qn\u2212(j+1) \u00d7 10j and the divisor D is less\nthan or equal to the partial remainder Rj. This in-\nherently involves two learnable tasks: \u201cn-digit by 1-\ndigit multiplication\u201d and \u201ccomparison\u201d. We experi-\nmentally show that this composite task is learnable.\nThe second step 8914 \u2212 64 \u00d7 100 = 8914 \u2212 6400\nmainly involves a \u201ccopying\u201d task and an \u201cn-digit\nby 1-digit multiplication\u201d task.\nThe third step\n8914 \u2212 6400 = 2514 leverages \u201csubtraction\u201d. The\nprocess iterates until the leftover is less than the\ndivisor, which implies the model has to implicitly\nlearn comparison. Finally, the model generates the\nquotient by combining all qn\u2212(j+1)\u2019s in previous\niterations, which can be considered as the inverse\nof the \u201csplit\u201d task, and finally copies the remainder\nif it is not zero.\nA summary of prompts and expected output for\nvarious tasks are shown in Table 2.\n3.6\nSettings\nIn this paper, we consider the addition and subtrac-\ntion of two positive integers with each containing\nup to 16 digits. It is worth noting that the result of\nsubtraction can be negative. To limit the maximum\ngenerated sequence length, we consider the mul-\ntiplication of two positive integers whose product\nfalls within 12 digits, and the division of two posi-\ntive integers resulting in a quotient within 6 digits\nwhere the dividend is less than 12 digits. Since\nwe focus on arithmetic tasks of integers, we aim\nTask\nLearnable\nPrompt\nCoT\nTarget\nADD\n\u2713\n1463456 + 2107\n\u2717\n1463456 + 2107 = 1465563\nSUB\n\u2713\n2348233 minus 483579?\n\u2717\n2348233 - 483579 = 1864654\nMUL\nnD \u00d7 1D\n\u2713\n593295 times 7\n\u2717\n593295 * 7 = 4153065\nnD \u00d7 mD\n\u2717\nCalculate 24 x 79\n\u2713\n24 * 79 = 24 * (70 + 9) = 24 * 70 + \\\n24 * 9 = 1680 + 216 = 1896\nDIV\nnD \u00f7 1D\n\u2713\nPlease tell 3651803/7\n\u2717\n3651803 / 7 = 521686 R 1\nnD \u00f7 mD\n\u2717\nWhat is 2546/38?\n\u2713\n2546 - 38 * 60 = 2546 - 2280 = 266\n266 - 38 * 7 = 266 - 266 = 0\nTherefore, 2546 / 38 = 67\nTable 2: Examples of prompts and targets for fine-tuning LLaMA. \u201c\\nAnswer: \u201d is appended at the end of each\nprompt. It should be noted that there are a few special cases when CoT is not required (see Appendix E).\nto obtain the least positive remainder in the case\nwhen it is not divisible.\nIn Section 5.2, we present an analysis showcas-\ning the limited extrapolation capabilities of fine-\ntuned LLMs. Consequently, input data that falls\noutside the distribution of the training data is un-\nlikely to yield reasonable answers. Our method\npotentially applies to numbers with more digits,\nthough the training cost will increase correspond-\ningly.\n3.7\nDataset\nWe generate the dataset synthetically using a\nPython script. The dataset consists of around 1 mil-\nlion question-answer pairs. The answer contains\nthe proposed CoT as well as the final numerical out-\nput. The numbers are randomly generated, hence\nensuring a very low probability of instances being\nduplicated, although small numbers may be sam-\npled multiple times. We sample from log space to\nensure the numbers are equally likely to be sampled\nfrom different orders of magnitude, which is simi-\nlar to the sampling method used by Lee and Kim\n(2023). The details of the dataset are presented in\nAppendix F.\n3.8\nFine-tuning\nTo enable the model to solve arithmetic problems\nbased on instructions and facilitate natural lan-\nguage question answering, we generate hundreds\nof instruction templates using ChatGPT (Table 6).\nDuring the instruction tuning process, we randomly\nselect a template for each arithmetic input from the\ntraining set, and fine-tune LLaMA-7B similar to\nthe method used in Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). We\napply various techniques to enhance the model\u2019s\nadaptability to diverse question formats, such as\nrandomly removing spaces between numbers and\nsymbols in the arithmetic expression, replacing \u201c*\u201d\nwith \u201cx\u201d or \u201ctimes\u201d, etc.\nGoat-7B can be easily fine-tuned using LoRA on\na 24GB VRAM GPU. In particular, the fine-tuning\nprocess for a specific arithmetic sub-task, such as\n8-digit addition using 100K instances, takes only\napproximately 1.5 hours on an A10 GPU to achieve\nnear-perfect accuracy. The training hyperparame-\nters are listed in Appendix A.\n4\nExperiments\nWe evaluate our model using BIG-bench arithmetic\ndataset (Srivastava et al., 2022), as well as our extra\nselected tasks. The results are shown in Table 3.\nNotably, in a zero-shot setting, Goat-7B achieves\ncomparable or even higher accuracy on BIG-bench\ncompared to the few-shot PaLM-540B.\n4.1\nMetric\nWe first compute the accuracy based on the stan-\ndard exact string match (Appendix C). We observe\nthat GPT-4\u2019s accuracy under exact string match\nis almost identically zero on tasks involving large\nnumbers. However, in many cases where the fi-\nnal answer is incorrect, the majority of digits in\nthe generated answer align with the target number,\nwith only a few digits being incorrect. Inspired\nby recent study on the emergent abilities of LLMs\n(Schaeffer et al., 2023), we include a digit match\nmetric that can reflect the per-token error rate of\nthe output, as each digit is uniquely represented by\na token in LLaMA.\nTask\nBIG-bench\nExtra Tasks\nADD\n1D\n2D\n3D\n4D\n5D\n8D+8D\n16D+8D\n16D+16D\nGPT-4\n100/100\n100/100\n99.6/99.9\n98.8/99.6\n94.1/98.5 92.1/98.3\n9.4/70.4\n94.1/99.5\nGoat-7B\n100/100\n100/100\n99.4/99.8\n98.3/99.5\n98.1/99.4 97.8/99.4\n97.1/99.6\n97.6/99.7\nSUB\n1D\n2D\n3D\n4D\n5D\n8D\u22128D\n16D\u22128D\n16D\u221216D\nGPT-4\n100/100\n100/100\n99.2/99.6\n98.9/99.6\n92.4/98.1 70.5/91.5\n10.6/68.8\n59.6/88.2\nGoat-7B\n100/100\n100/100\n99.7/99.9\n98.6/99.6\n98.4/99.5 96.8/99.3\n95.8/99.2\n96.3/99.3\nMUL\n1D\n2D\n3D\n4D\n5D\n1D\u00d716D\n4D\u00d78D\n6D\u00d76D\nGPT-4\n100/100\n99.4/99.8\n30.3/83.0\n5.3/61.8\n0.0/47.9 61.5/92.3\n0.0/45.9\n0.0/49.8\nGoat-7B\n100/100\n100/100\n97.8/99.4\n96.9/99.2\n96.7/99.3 99.7/99.9\n88.1/97.8\n96.8/99.5\nDIV\n1D\n2D\n3D\n4D\n5D\n16D\u00f71D\n6D\u00f73D\n12D\u00f76D\nGPT-4\n100/100\n100/100\n94.5/96.3\n90.9/92.1\n53.4/73.2 54.0/84.3\n6.4/48.6\n0.0/29.5\nGoat-7B\n100/100\n100/100\n99.5/99.7\n99.0/99.5\n96.5/98.1 99.0/99.7\n94.1/96.1\n89.3/93.5\nTable 3: The result of GPT-4 and Goat-7B on BIG-bench Arithmetic sub-task and extra selected arithmetic tasks,\nusing metrics Exact String Match/Digit Match (Appendix C), shown in percentage. We test GPT-4 and Goat with\nexactly the same questions and prompts. We evaluate GPT-4 using the API version on May 10th. For Big-bench\ntasks, nD refers the n-digit by n-digit operation, except for division where nD means n-digit by m-digit where\nm \u2264 n. BIG-bench only includes division operation without remainder, whereas in extra tasks we include the cases\nwhere the remainder is not zero and ask GPT-4 to output the answer in \"quotient R remainder\" format. It should be\nnoted that we exclude the BIG-bench test data from our training dataset as much as possible, although the overlap is\nunavoidable for operations involving small numbers.\n4.2\nComparison\nComparing the performance of Goat and GPT-4\nfor large-number multiplication and division may\nseem unfair, as GPT-4 generates direct answers\nwhile Goat relies on CoT. Hence, we also evalu-\nate GPT-4\u2019s performance with CoT by appending\n\u201cSolve it step by step\u201d at the end of each prompt. By\ndefault, GPT-4 uses long multiplication and long\ndivision methods. However, we observe that gen-\nerating CoT only leads to marginal improvement\nin accuracy. In some cases, the intermediate steps\nfrom long multiplication and division are incorrect,\nbut surprisingly the final answer is correct. This\nimplies that GPT-4 does not effectively take ad-\nvantage of intermediate supervision from CoT to\nimprove the final output. We identify the following\n3 common errors from GPT-4\u2019s solution, which re-\nsults in incorrect final answers: (1) the alignment of\ncorresponding digits, (2) copying of numbers, and\n(3) the intermediate result from n-digit by 1-digit\nmultiplication.\nAdditionally, we observe that GPT-4 performs\nreasonably well on 8D+8D and 16D+16D tasks,\nbut fails on most 16D + 8D tasks, though intu-\nitively 16D + 8D should be relatively easier than\n16D+16D. While the exact reason for this remains\nunclear, one possible factor could be GPT-4\u2019s in-\nconsistent number tokenization (Table 5), which\nmakes it difficult to align the corresponding digits\nof two numbers.\n5\nAnalysis\n5.1\nAblation study\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\nfull CoT\nno split\nno expansion\nno adding term by term\nno CoT\nFigure 2: Accuracy (exact string match) against the\nnumber of samples seen during the training of 4D \u00d74D\ntask.

Evaluated on the same randomly generated unseen\ntest set using training checkpoints.\npare the accuracy of 4-digit by 4-digit multiplica-\ntion by removing one particular step in the CoT,\nincluding split, expansion, adding term by term\n(referring to G), as well as no CoT. For division\n(Fig. 3), we compare the accuracy of 6-digit by\n3-digit division after removing the middle step that\ncomputes the product (referring to G), as well as no\nCoT. To minimize the impact caused by natural lan-\nguage, we conduct an ablation study in a simplified\nsynthetic environment (Table 7).\nThe multiplication results suggest that the\n\u201cadding term by term\u201d step plays a crucial role in\nobtaining the final answer. In contrast, the \u201csplit\u201d\nand \u201cexpand\u201d steps have minimal impact, and can\npotentially be omitted for generating more concise\nCoT. This can be attributed to the nature of these\ntwo intermediate steps, which primarily involve\nsimple and learnable tasks like copying and com-\nparison. Nevertheless, we still retain these steps to\nensure human interpretability.\nThe accuracy of exact string match without CoT\nremains consistently at zero for both 4D \u00d7 4D\nmultiplication and 6D \u00f7 3D division. This further\nshowcases the validity of our approach, as break-\ning down complex arithmetic tasks into a series\nof learnable tasks can indeed facilitate the training\nprocess for LLMs.\n5.2\nExtrapolation\nExtrapolation refers to the ability of the model to\npredict data that lies out-of-distribution (OOD) of\ntraining data. We test addition for numbers larger\nthan those in the training data distribution. The re-\nsults reveal that the model has limited extrapolation\ncapabilities. There is a gradual drop in accuracy,\nas the test set deviates further from the training\nset. This observation is consistent with the result\nreported in (Kim et al., 2021), highlighting a lim-\nitation of our fine-tuned model and underscoring\nthe significance of training data distribution.\nNo. of Digits\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\nexact string match\ndigit match\nFigure 4: Accuracy against the number of digits for the\naddition task. The model is trained up to 16D+16D, and\ntested on 17D+17D onward.\n5.3\nComparison with Other LLMs\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on a vari-\nety of LLMs, including Bloom, OPT, GPT-J, GPT-\nNeoX, and Pythia. These models are fine-tuned\nusing the identical dataset as that for Goat, main-\ntaining consistency in the training hyperparameters.\nOur experiment shows that they all struggle with\narithmetic tasks. Even for tasks that are considered\nlearnable for LLaMA, such as multi-digit addition,\nthe loss during fine-tuning is significantly higher\nthan that of LLaMA. The observation underscores\nthe claim made in (Nogueira et al., 2021) that tok-\nenization is a crucial factor in the performance of\narithmetic tasks.\n5.4\nFew-shot Prompting with GPT-4\nGPT-4 demonstrates powerful in-context learning\nabilities. We further examine the effectiveness of\nour proposed decomposition method for solving\nlarge-number multiplication and division by using\nfew-shot prompting with GPT-4 (see Appendix H).\nWe observe that our decomposition method allows\nGPT-4 to generate correct answers more frequently\nthan using its default long multiplication and divi-\nsion methods. This further supports the effective-\nness and validity of our approach. Examples of the\nprompt and output are shown in Appendix H.\n6\nLimitations\nHumans are capable of performing multiplication\nand division on arbitrarily large numbers, providing\nsufficient time and space for calculations. In con-\ntrast, LLMs often suffer from extrapolation prob-\nlems. The models are unlikely to generate reason-\nable answers if the input deviates significantly from\nthe distribution of training data. To enhance the\nhuman interpretability of intermediate supervision,\nwe use the straightforward CoT that follows simple\nbasic arithmetic rules. However, this design may\nnot be the most efficient way to facilitate the final\nanswer generation. There are potentially more suit-\nable multiplication and division algorithms for the\nmodel to learn. Besides, our research only focuses\non elementary arithmetic operations involving inte-\ngers. Nevertheless, we anticipate that our method\ncould be applicable to decimal computation as well.\n7\nConclusion\nIn summary, we demonstrate the feasibility that\nsupervised fine-tuning alone can enable LLMs to\nperform certain basic arithmetic operations with\nhigh accuracy. With our proposed CoT, our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various\nelementary arithmetic tasks. Our research offers an\nexcellent platform for investigating the mechanism\nof working memory and the influence of intermedi-\nate supervision on text generation. Our method can\nbe easily integrated with other instruction-tuned\nLLMs and has the potential to further enhance\narithmetic reasoning abilities in solving math word\nproblems.\nReferences\nStella Biderman, Hailey Schoelkopf, Quentin Anthony,\nHerbie Bradley, Kyle O\u2019Brien, Eric Hallahan, Mo-\nhammad Aflah Khan, Shivanshu Purohit, USVSN Sai\nPrashanth, Edward Raff, et al. 2023.

(2021) demonstrate that models\nwith inconsistent tokenization of numbers barely\nlearn the addition of 2-digit numbers, and it com-\npletely fails to learn the addition of larger numbers.\nSpecifically, it has an accuracy of zero for 5 digits\nor more. They attribute this failure to the lack of\nsystematic tokenization of individual digits. For\ninstance, \u201c123\u201d might be tokenized as \u201c12\u201d and\n\u201c3\u201d, while \u201c234\u201d might be tokenized as \u201c2\u201d and\n\u201c34\u201d. Consequently, the model is required to learn\nthat the embedding of a token may represent either\na single digit or two digits and so on. Hence, it\nmight be challenging for the model to learn to map\nan embedding to a number when the number of\ndigits it represents changes irregularly. In Table 5,\nwe compare number tokenization across different\nLLMs.\nC\nMetric\nExact string match is defined as 1 if the output\nstring exactly matches the target string, and 0 oth-\nerwise. Then we take the average of exact string\nmatch for each task. Char error rate (CER) is de-\nfined as the percentage of characters that were\nincorrectly predicted.\nWe compute CER using\nPython torchmetrics package. Then we define digit\nmatch accuracy as 1 \u2212 cer. We include this metric\nbecause, for difficult tasks, the exact string match\ncould be identically zero, making it hard to evalu-\nate the performance.

However, some\nspecial cases within multi-digit multiplication and\ndivision are learnable, and in these cases, we omit\nCoT and generate the direct answer:\n\u2022 For multiplication, one of the two numbers\ncontains only one non-zero digit, such as\n857483 \u00d7 400 = 342993200. This type of\ntask is similar to learnable n-digit by 1-digit\nmultiplication, with the zeros being copied at\nthe end of the product.\n\u2022 The dividend is equal to the divisor. In that\ncase, the quotient is identically one. For ex-\nample, 358 \u00f7 358 = 1.\n\u2022 The dividend is less than the divisor.\nIn\nthat case, the quotient is zero and the re-\nmainder equals the dividend.

Extensive experiments demonstrate its success in var-\nious video generative tasks such as video editing and video\nstyle transfer, outperforming previous methods in terms of\nconsistency and quality.\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, there has been a rapid development in text-\nbased visual content generation. Driven by the progress of\n1\narXiv:2305.13840v2  [cs.CV]  6 Dec 2023\ndiffusion-based models, text-to-image synthesis [23, 27, 30]\nhas made a tremendous breakthrough, which have demon-\nstrated an impressive ability to generate high-quality images\nbased on user-provided text prompts. Built on pre-trained\nT2I models, there is a surging interest in text-to-video syn-\nthesis in zero-shot manner [17, 26, 41] or training on large-\nscale video-text datasets [1, 4]. However, movement gener-\nation across video frames remains a formidable challenge.\nA satisfactory generated video should fulfill three cri-\nteria: 1) a distinct range of movement, 2) coherent action\nduring inter-frame transitions, 3) consistent appearance of\nobjects in different frames without flickers.\nThe current\nT2V models tend to generate videos with limited movement\nrange due to the trade-off among movement range, action\ncoherence and object consistency, as shown in Figure 2(a).\nWhen the motion range is large, consistency and coherence\nare difficult to maintain. To enhance video movements, the\nintroduction of control signals during video generation is\na potential solution. Controllable video synthesis [37, 40]\nallows users to specify desired contents and motions, real-\nizing customized video generation with fine-grained con-\ntrol.\nNevertheless, despite achieving controllable move-\nments and coherent action, a notable challenge remains in\nensuring object consistency. For instance, Figure 2(b) de-\npicts that the appearance of horse changes across frames,\nalthough the motion is correct.\nTo address the issue, this paper presents a controllable\nT2V model, namely Control-A-Video, capable of maintain-\ning consistency and coherence while customizable video\nsynthesis. Specifically, Control-A-Video is designed to gen-\nerate videos based on text and reference control maps, such\nas edge, depth or optical flow maps. In terms of model ar-\nchitecture, we develop our video generative model by reor-\nganizing a pre-trained controllable T2I model [42], incor-\nporating additional trainable temporal layers, and utilizing\na spatial-temporal self-attention mechanism that facilitates\nfine-grained interactions between frames. Furthermore, we\npropose some novel strategies to introduce motion priors\nand content priors, boosting object consistency.\nThe motion priors come from two types of pioneering\nnoise initialization approaches. The first method is to ini-\ntialize noise based on pixel residual between frames of the\nsource video. The second one is to calculate the initial noise\nof next frame based on optical flow of the source video\nmovement. Inspired by [6], these approaches can make the\ninitial distribution of noise latents more reasonable, enhanc-\ning relevance among frame latents and improving video\nconsistency. By leveraging motion priors, the Control-A-\nVideo is able to closely resemble motion changes in the\nreference video and produce coherent videos that are less\nflickering.\n1We use the api on https://www.genmo.ai/.\n2We train the baseline with only depth map condition.\na\nb\nc\nFigure 2. The prompt for generation is \u201cmagical flying horse with\na man jumping over an obstacle, artstation\u201d. (a) Text-to-video\nmodel1, (b) Controllable text-to-video baseline2, (c) Our Control-\nA-Video model. The result from text-to-video model1 has only\na limited movement range. Baseline controllable generation2 can\ncreate videos with desired movements under the control signals,\nbut it loses consistency. In contrast, our model is capable of main-\ntaining object consistency in customizable video synthesis.\nFor the content priors, instead of training models to di-\nrectly generate entire videos, we introduce an innovative\ntraining scheme that produces video predicated on the initial\nframe. With such a straightforward yet effective strategy, it\nbecomes more manageable to disentangle content and tem-\nporal modeling.\nOur model only needs to learn how to\ngenerate subsequent frames with content priors of the first\nframe, inheriting generative capabilities from the image do-\nmain and facilitating consistency with objects in the first\nframe. During inference, we generate the first frame con-\nditioned on the control map of the first frame and a text\nprompt. Then, we generate subsequent frames conditioned\non the first frame, text, and subsequent control maps. In\nthe two-stage generation, the first frame produced in text-\nto-image process contains more accurate semantics with\ntext, promoting cross-modal alignment of the video. Mean-\nwhile, another benefit of such strategy is that our model can\nauto-regressively generate a longer video by treating the last\nframe of the previous iteration as the initial frame.\nWith the above strategies, controllable generation results\nhave better consistency like in Figure 2(c). Moreover, our\nmodel is easy to converge with fewer training resources,\ne.g., our iteration samples are 1.6M compared to 115M in\nGen-1\u2019s [4].\nIn a nutshell, we propose Control-A-Video, a control-\nlable T2V diffusion model, which has the following advan-\ntages: (i) Our model is able to generate text-guided videos\nconditioned on various types of control maps, enhancing\nthe movement range and action coherence in text-to-video\nsynthesis. (ii) We introduce pixel residual-based and opti-\n2\ncal flow-based noise initialization strategies, that incorpo-\nrate motion priors from the reference videos to promote\nrelevance among frame latents, making videos more con-\nsistent and less flickering. (iii) To achieve further object\nconsistency, we also present a novel first-frame conditioned\ncontroller to introduce content priors. Our model gener-\nates videos based on semantics of the initial frame, trans-\nferring text-aligned knowledge from images to videos. As a\nbyproduct of the first-frame conditioning strategy, Control-\nA-Video can auto-regressively generate longer videos. (iv)\nThrough our proposed approaches, experiments demon-\nstrate that our framework is capable of generating higher-\nquality, consistent videos using fewer training resources.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Text-to-image generation with diffusion models\nOver the past few years, there have been significant ad-\nvancements in the field of image generation, particularly\nwith the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model [13, 33].\nThis model has demonstrated impressive capabilities, sur-\npassing the performance of Generative Adversarial Net-\nworks (GANs) [8] and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\n[18].\nTo generate images conditioned on text, several\napproaches have been proposed, such as GLIDE [23],\nDALLE-2 [27], Imagen [30], and LDMs [27]. These mod-\nels train diffusion models using large-scale text-image pairs,\nenabling the generation of images with text conditions. To\nenhance control in image generation, few-shot tuning meth-\nods like Textual Inversion [5] and Dreambooth [29] have\nbeen developed for personalized generation. Editing tech-\nniques Prompt2Prompt [11], Plug-and-Play [34], and In-\nstructPix2Pix [2] offer methods to edit and refine the gener-\nated images. Notably, approaches such as ControlNet [42],\nT2I-Adapter [21], and Composer [16] focus on fine-tuning\nT2I model with condition-text-image pairs, enabling the in-\ntegration of control hints such as edges, poses, and depth\nmaps. In this paper, we adopt a similar idea to ControlNet\nand extend it to the domain of video generation with condi-\ntions. By leveraging the advancements made in T2I models,\nwe are able to generate videos of consistency and diversity.\n2.2. Text-to-video generation with diffusion models\nThe remarkable accomplishments of diffusion models in\nText-to-Image (T2I) generation have inspired researchers\nto venture into the field of video generation. Several no-\ntable advancements, including VDM [15], Imagen Video\n[14], Make-A-Video [32] and Animatediff [9], extend text-\nto-image diffusion models by training them on extensive\ntext-video pairs.\nTo overcome the challenge of generat-\ning longer videos, LVDM [10], MCVD [35], and Align-\nYour-Latents [1] adopt an auto-regressive approach, se-\nquentially generating video frames to ensure temporal co-\nherence and continuity. For text-based video translation,\nzero-shot methods such as Text2Video-Zero [17], FateZero\n[26], Vid2VidZero [36], and Video-P2P [20], explore the\nlatent space of diffusion models and employ temporal at-\ntention mechanisms to generate videos. However, a chal-\nlenge faced by these methods is the potential lack of tempo-\nral consistency.To improve the consistency of the generated\nvideos, flow-based approaches like Render-A-Video [41]\nand TokenFlow [7]propose to introduce flow constraints in\ndiffusion process. On the other hand, tuning-based meth-\nods, such as Tune-A-Video [38] and CodeF [24], achieve\nbetter consistency by fine-tuning the models in the inference\nstage, albeit requiring an additional tuning process. Further-\nmore, Gen-1 [4] and VideoCompose [37] propose to train\nvideo diffusion models with additional conditional maps. In\ncomparison to these existing approaches, this paper presents\na novel two-stage generation approach and employs a noise\nmanipulation strategy to achieve enhanced temporal consis-\ntency in text-based video translation.\n3. Method\nIn this section, we will introduce the structure and strate-\ngies of our text-to-video model. The preliminary knowl-\nedge about LDMs [13] and ControlNet [42] can be found\nin supplementary material. Our model incorporates motion\nlayers and operations to enable effective temporal model-\ning. Afterwards, we propose a novel motion-aware noise\ninitialization approach that serves as a video prior for en-\nsuring consistent video generation. This approach includes\ntwo types of noise: pixel residual-based and optical flow-\nbased noise. The residual-based noise captures the subtle\nvariations in video frames, while the flow-based noise mod-\nels the motion dynamics between frames. Furthermore, we\nprovide a detailed overview of the training procedure and\ninference pipeline of our text-to-video model by involving\ngenerating the first frame as a precursor and utilizing it as a\nconditioning factor for video generation.\n3.1. Model Architecture\nBuilding upon a controllable T2I model [42], we introduce\ntwo architectural refinements for video generation: (i) To\nenable effective temporal modeling, we incorporate an ad-\nditional temporal layer following each 2-dimensional (2D)\nlayer, such as convolution and attention layers. (ii) To fur-\nther enhance frame modeling, we employ a spatial-temporal\nself-attention mechanism. This approach draws inspiration\nfrom zero-shot methods like vid2vid-zero [36], where spa-\ntial and temporal relationships are jointly modeled to cap-\nture dependencies across frames.\nIn Figure 3, each frame\u2019s features are processed through\neither a 2D convolution layer or a spatial attention layer.\nSubsequently, these frame-level features are collectively\npassed to a trainable 1D convolutional layer or tempo-\n3\nCAV Model\nV-UNet\nCLIP\nV-ControlNet\nCAV\nModel\nCAV\nModel\nInference\nEncoder\nText\nText\n. . .\nAnotator\nBLIP\nFirst \nframe\nN frames\n. ..\nPred.\nnoise\nQi\nK1\nKN\n. . .\nV1\n. . .\nVN\nSpatial-Temporal Self-attention\nTraining\nFirst map\nVideo\nN maps\nText\n. ..\nFirst\nlatent\nN latents\nN maps\nN frames\nDecoder\nDDIM\nDDIM\nTrainable Temporal Layers\nSpatial \nAttention/\n2DConv\n1D Temporal Attention/Conv\n. . .\nTuned\nFrozen\nTemporal Modeling\nMotion-adaptive\nnoise init.\n. ..\nLatents\n. ..\nNoisy\nlatents\nMotion-adaptive\nnoise init.\nSpatial \nAttention/\n2DConv\nFigure 3. Illustration of our Control-A-Video pipeline. Model Architecture: We apply spatial-temporal self-attention and trainable\ntemporal layers to both the image UNet and the image ControlNet, enabling the model to generate videos. Training: The model input\nincludes video and its text prompt from BLIP captioning [19] and control maps from an annotator (e.g. depth estimation model). Each\nframe is passed to the encoder to get the latent code. We add noise with motion priors to each latent except for the first frame and train\nthe model to predict the subsequent noise conditioned on the first frame. Inference: After training, our model is able to generate the first\nframe conditioned on its control map. The generated first frame is then used to generate subsequent frames with the content priors.\nral attention for frame modeling.\nMoreover, to enable\nfine-grained modeling, we adapt the spatial self-attention\nmechanism by incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention\nacross frames, which can be formulated as:\nSelfAttn(Q, K, V ) = Softmax(QKT\n\u221a\nd\n)V,\n(1)\nQ = W Q\u00afvi, K = W K[\u00afv0, ..., \u00afvN\u22121], V = W V [\u00afv0, ..., \u00afvN\u22121]\n(2)\nwhere \u00afvi denotes the token sequence of frame i, and\n[\u00afv0, ..., \u00afvN\u22121] denotes the concatenation of the N frames.\nAs shown in Eq. 2, we concatenate features K, V of N\nframes so that each position has a global perception of all\nvideo frames and tends to generate more consistent results.\n3.2. Motion-adaptive Noise Initializer\nThe diffusion model aims to denoise a signal by learning\nfrom Gaussian noise, where different initial noise samples\ncan yield different results. In our study, we leverage the\ncomponents of T2I models for video generation and ob-\nserve that the latent spaces of consecutive video frames ex-\nhibit high correlation. In Figure 4, we can see that consec-\nutive frames (represented by red points) are close to each\nother. However, when we add per-frame typical Gaussian\nnoise (represented by green points) to each frame, we ob-\nserve that the distribution between frames is disrupted. Not\nonly does the distance between frames increase, but the\noverall distribution across frames also becomes distorted.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose a strategy to incor-\nporate motion into the noise initialization process, aiming\nto align the noise closer to the video frames. To achieve\nthis, we introduce two types of motion priors for video\ngeneration: flow-based and residual-based.\nBy integrat-\ning motion-based noise into the latent space of the video,\nwe empirically observe that the distribution of each frame\nmaintains its similarity and coherence. As depicted in Fig-\nure 4, the distribution of the flow-based noise (represented\nby orange points) is most similar to the original video, while\nthe residual-based noise (represented by pink points) also\nexhibits high correlation. Intuitively, learning to reconstruct\nthe video from motion-based noise is more feasible com-\npared to using Gaussian noise since the latent similarity is\npreserved. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is outlined\nin Algorithm 1.\nResidual-based Noise Prior: To maintain consistent\n4\n...\nX0\nvideo frames\nres prior\nflow prior\ngaussian\nX249\nX499\nX999\ndenoise\nFigure 4. Motion-adaptive Noise Prior: we visualize the t-SNE\nplot of the noisy latents of video frames. The red one denotes\nthe video X0, which is the end of denoising process and we grad-\nually add noise at different timesteps (249, 499, 999) to get its\nnoise maps. The pink one is residual noise, the orange one is flow\nnoise, the green one is gaussian noise. There\u2019re two fingings in this\nmap: (1) Two adjacent frames are the most similar, so a sequence\nof frames should be linked with a line. (2) For gaussian noise,\nthe \u201cline\u201d relation is distored and each dot become away from the\norigin video; for flow-based noise and residual-based noise, the\n\u201cline\u201d is still parallel to the origin frames and the distance is not\nfar away the X0.\nnoise in static regions and introduce varying noise in mov-\ning regions, we employ a residual-based noise prior. By\ncomputing the residual between consecutive frames, we ini-\ntialize the noise distribution accordingly after downsam-\npling. This approach ensures that unchanged areas exhibit\nthe same noise, while changing areas possess distinct noise\npatterns. Additionally, a threshold is utilized to differenti-\nate static and dynamic regions, providing control over the\nsmoothness of the generated videos.\nFlow-based Noise Prior: In order to align the gener-\nated video\u2019s flow with the motion depicted in the frames,\nwe introduce a flow-based noise prior. This involves com-\nputing the optical flow between consecutive frames in pixel\nspace, followed by downsampling the flow information to\nthe latent space. By propagating the flow through subse-\nquent noise latents, we align the noise patterns with the ex-\npected motion flow, resulting in visually coherent and real-\nistic videos.\n3.3. Latent First-frame Conditioned Controller\nDuring Training: A naive approach for temporal learning\nin a video diffusion model would be to train the model to\npredict the entire video sequence. However, this would re-\nquire a large amount of video data to learn the diversity that\nAlgorithm 1: Motion-adaptive Noise Propagation\n1 Initialize noise x with N frames,\nxn \u2190 N(0, I), n = 0, ..., (N \u2212 1)\n2 Given InputVideo : v = [vn, n = 0, ..., (N \u2212 1)]\n3 Rthres : The threshold for residual change\n4 DownSample() : Resize to align the size of noise\n5 \u2014\n6 residual-based\n7 for i from 1 to N do\n8\nres = norm(vi \u2212 v(i\u22121))\n9\nresmask = res > Rthres\n10\nresmask = DownSample(resmask)\n11\nxi = [xi \u2212 x(i\u22121)] \u2217 resmask + x(i\u22121)\n12 end\n13 \u2014\n14 flow-based\n15 for i from 1 to N do\n16\nflowi\npixel = flow(vi, v(i\u22121))\n17\nflowi\nlatent = DownSample(flowpixel)\n18\nxi = GridSample(x(i\u22121), flowi\nlatent)\n19 end\nhas already presented in the image domain. To enhance the\neffectiveness of model training, we propose a first-frame\nlatent conditioning method that generates video sequences\nconditioned on content priors of the first frame. This ap-\nproach reduces the need for the model to memorize video\ncontent in the training set and instead focuses on learning\nto reconstruct motion, which makes it possible to achieve\nbetter results with fewer training resources. As shown in\nFigure 3, during training, we add noise to each frames ex-\ncept the first, so the model learns to generate subsequent\nframes based on the first frame v1. Thus the loss function\ncan be formulated as:\nmin\u03b8||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp, cf, E(v1))||2\n2\n(3)\nBy adopting this approach, our model can effectively uti-\nlize the motion information from the control maps and fol-\nlow the content from the first frame. This simple yet ef-\nfective strategy not only allows our model to generalize the\ndomain from image to video, but also to auto-regressively\ngenerate longer videos.\nDuring Inference: We generate the initial frame, de-\nnoted as v1, by providing the model with Gaussian noise in\nthe form of a single frame x1 along with conditioning fac-\ntors including a text prompt cp and a first frame control map\nc1\nf.\nv1 = ControlT2I(x1, cp, c1\nf)\n(4)\nOnce we obtain the first frame v1 of the video, we gen-\nerate the following frames conditioned on its latent code\n5\nfrozen city, high-quality, realistic.\niter=1\niter=2\niter=3\nFigure 5. Auto-Regressive Generation: Our model is able to gen-\nerate long videos auto-regressively. The first row corresponds to\nthe initial iteration, the second row is generated conditioned on the\nlast frame of the first iteration, and so on for the third iteration.\nE(v1):\nv = ControlT2V (x, cp, cf, E(v1))\n(5)\nWith our proposed method of first-frame conditioning, our\nmodel is capable of generating video sequences with greater\ndiversity than what is present in the training data. Addition-\nally, our model has a distinct advantage in creating longer\nvideos by utilizing previously generated frames as the initial\nframe in the subsequent iteration. This allows us to use an\nauto-regressive approach to produce videos of any length,\nwhich sets us apart from other video diffusion models that\nare limited to generating videos only once.\nClassifier-Free Guidance: Classifer-free guidance [12]\nwith a guidance scale \u03c9t to sample the noise can be formu-\nlated as:\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp,cf) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, \u2205, cf)\n+ \u03c9t(\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp, cf) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, \u2205, cf))\n(6)\nwhere \u2205 denotes a null-text prompt, and \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, \u2205, cf) rep-\nresents negative representation. Based on this, we incorpo-\nrating a sampling strategy in [4] that treats noise prediction\nof video generated frame-by-frame as a negative represen-\ntation needed to be avoided. Consequently, the final predic-\ntion of noise is calculated as:\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp,cf) = \u03f5\u03b8I(xt, t, \u2205, cf)\n+ \u03c9v(\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, \u2205, cf) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8I(xt, t, \u2205, cf))\n+ \u03c9t(\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp, cf) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, \u2205, cf))\n(7)\nHere,\n\u03c9v denotes the scale of video guidance,\nand\n\u03f5\u03b8I(xt, t, \u2205, cf) denotes the prediction that each video frame\nis independently predicted.

Implementation Details\nDataSet Settings: 100k video clips sourced from the Inter-\nnet and 100k image-text pairs obtained from Laion [31].\nTraining Settings: Our model is initialized with pre-\ntrained weights from Stable Diffusion v1.5 [27] and Con-\ntrolNet [42].\nWe only train the temporal layers with an\n8:2 ratio of video to image rate. The resolution is set to\n512 \u00d7 512, the batch size to 16, the learning rate to 10\u22125,\nand the total number of training steps to 10k. The model is\nevaluated using three control types: canny edge maps [3],\nhed edge maps [39], and depth maps.[28].\nInference Settings: The noise initialization threshold is\nset to 0.1, the scale for text guidance is 10.0, the scale for\nvideo guidance is 1.5, and DDIM uses 20 sampling steps.\n6\n4.2. Main Results\n4.2.1\nControllable Video Generation\nWe showcase three types of controls extracted from video to\ndemonstrate our system\u2019s capacity to generate videos con-\nditioned on various control types, as shown in Figure 1 and\nmore results in supplementary material. Through experi-\nmentation, we found that depth maps provide less structural\ninformation than edge maps, resulting in more diverse video\noutputs.\nEdge maps, on the other hand, produce videos\nwith enhanced details but a lesser degree of variability. For\ninstance, in the first row of Figure 1, we transform a hu-\nman into a cartoon robot using depth map control. In con-\ntrast, using edge maps in the third row still results in a\nhuman-robot transformation, but with more intricate details\nretained, such as the clothing pattern.\n4.2.2\nAuto-Regressive Long Video Generation\nAs illustrated in Section 3.3, we present the outcomes of\nauto-regressive video generation in Figure 5. The source\nvideo consists of 24 frames, and our objective is to con-\nvert a city at sunset into a frozen city. We generate the\nedited video through three iterations, each comprising eight\nframes.\nThe subsequent video clips are produced auto-\nregressively based on the last frame of the previous itera-\ntion. The generated video exhibits consistency across vari-\nous iterations, which attests to the efficacy of our first-frame\nconditioning approach.\n4.2.3\nQualitative Analysis\nControl-A-Video can incorporate various control signals,\nsuch as depth and optical flow maps, enabling it to natu-\nrally generalize to video editing and video style transfer. We\nconduct qualitative comparation on video editing with other\nmodels, including the editing model Gen-1 [4], Text2Video-\nZero [17], Tokenflow [7], Rerender A Video [41], and the\ncontrollable generation model Videocomposer [37]. These\nmodels have similar settings for generating videos with ad-\nditional controls. To demonstrate the superior performance\nof our model compared to others, we choose videos with\nsignificant movement ranges to evaluate, which are difficult\nto generate.\nAs shown in Figure 6, the first row depicts the original\nvideo, from which we extract depth maps and use a prompt\n\u2018a dog running through a field of poles, van goah style paint-\ning\u2019 to create a style transfer video. In the second row, al-\nthough the result of Gen-1 has correct style, the generated\ndog is confused and lack details. The third row exhibits\nthe result of Text2Video-Zero, which fails to produce a nor-\nmal dog in the first three frames. The similar problem can\nalso be found in Rerender-A-Video. In the result of To-\nkenflow, the dog is blurry and its style is unrelated. As for\na bear walking through stars, artstation\na\nb\nc\nd\nFigure 7.

In the last row, we present the\nvideo generated by our model, which is most clear, consis-\ntent and text-aligned. More Comparison will be shown in\nsupplementary material.\n4.3. Ablation Studies\nWe conduct empirical ablation experiments on our proposed\nstrategies to demonstrate the effectiveness of motion priors\nand content priors. We adopt depth maps from 20 video\nclips from Davis [25] and in-the-wild videos, which are\nused to generate videos based on a given text prompt. To\nevaluate text alignment, we calculate the cosine similarity\nbetween video embeddings of the output videos and text\nembeddings of the given prompts with X-CLIP [22]. To\nassess semantic consistency between different frames, we\nmeasure the similarities for frame CLIP embeddings of out-\nput videos. Furthermore, we compute the depth map er-\nrors and optical flow map errors between input and output\nvideos, which reflect consistency on structure and move-\nment respectively.\n4.3.1\nMotion-adaptive Noise Initializer\nTo demonstrate that pixel residual-based and optical flow-\nbased noise initialization (simplify as RNI and FNI) strate-\ngies boost object consistency of videos, we perform visu-\nalization case study and quantitative comparison. Figure 7\nillustrates the effect of different noise initialization strate-\ngies. In the second row, the bear has artifacts and distortion\ndue to the lack of noise initialization. In contrast, the last\n7\na person kiteboarding in the sunset\nInput video\nthres=0.0\nthres=0.1\nthres=1.0\nFigure 8. Ablation Study of Different Thresholds\ntwo rows both exhibit consistent videos, and the video re-\nsult of FNI has a better performance on color maintaining.\nAs summarized in Table 1, both noise initialization meth-\nods improve all metrics over baseline. Especially in term of\noptical flow map, RNI and FNI reduce errors by 1.06 and\n1.12, which indicates that the motion priors can enhance\nmovement consistency with the source video.\nThreshold of residual-based noise initialization. We an-\nalyze the effects of three types of initial noise: identical\nnoise (threshold=1.0), distinct noise (threshold=0.0), and\nmotion-enhanced noise (threshold=0.1). It is important to\nnote that this threshold also regulates the smoothness of the\nresulting video. As shown in Figure 8, in the second row,\nwhen there is no residual control, the background is prone to\nflickering, such as water color. The third row corresponds to\nthe threshold we select, which effectively balances consis-\ntency and smoothness to produce satisfactory results. The\nfinal row displays the consequence of using the same noise\nfor each frame, a smooth video, but with severe artifacts.\nOverall, incorporating residual-based noise can introduce\nmotion from the input video, resulting in videos with re-\nduced flickering and better consistency.\n4.3.2\nLatent First-frame Conditioned Controller\nOur first-frame conditioning strategy provides content pri-\nors for video generation, encouraging subsequent frames to\nkeep object consistency with the first frame. Because the\ninitial frame from text-to-image process can achieve high\nquality and text-aligned easily, two-stage video generation\nfacilitates semantic alignment with prompt compared with\ngenerating an entire video directly. Figure 9 compares the\nresults with and without the first-frame conditioning strat-\negy.

According to Table 1, the first-\nframe conditioned controller brings boost in text alignment,\nfrom 0.238 to 0.262, and reduces depth errors, from 0.149 to\n0.086, over the baseline. Compared with noise initialization\nstrategies, first-frame conditioning plays a more important\nrole in text alignment and depth consistency.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a controllable T2V framework\nthat is capable of generating videos conditioned on text\nprompts and control maps.\nWith the proposed motion-\nadaptive noise initialization and first-frame conditioning\nstrategies, we introduce motion priors and content priors to\npromote video consistency. After temporal learning in a\nsmall video dataset, our model can generate coherent, text-\naligned, long videos. While our method achieves impres-\nsive results, it still has some known limitations. For ex-\n8\nample, our T2V model relies on a T2I model and shares the\nsame bad cases. In the future, it\u2019s worth conducting research\non the stability and controllability of the video generation\nmodels.\nReferences\n[1] Andreas Blattmann, Robin Rombach, Huan Ling, Tim Dock-\nhorn, SeungWook Kim, Sanja Fidler, and Karsten Kreis.\nAlign your latents: High-resolution video synthesis with la-\ntent diffusion models. 2023. 2, 3\n[2] Tim Brooks, Aleksander Holynski, and Alexei A Efros.

Preliminary\nDiffusion Models: Given an input signal x0, a diffusion\nforward process is defined as:\np\u03b8(xt|xt\u22121) = N(xt;\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121xt\u22121, \u03b2tI), t = 1, ..\u2212., T\n(8)\nwhere T is the total timestep of the diffusion process.\nA noise depending on variance \u03b2t is gradually added to\nxt\u22121 to obtain xt at the next timestep and finally reach\nxT \u2208 N(0, I). The goal of the diffusion model [13] is to\nlearn to reverse the diffusion process (denoising). Given a\nrandom noise xt, the model predicts the added noise at the\nnext timestep xt\u22121 until the origin signal x0.\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) = N(xt\u22121; \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t)),\nt = T, ..., 1\n(9)\nWe fix the variance \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t) and utilize the diffusion\nmodel with parameter \u03b8 to predict the mean of the inverse\nprocess \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t). The model can be simplified as denoising\nmodels \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t), which are trained to predict the noise of xt\nwith a noise prediction loss:\nmin\u03b8||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp)||2\n2\n(10)\nwhere \u03f5 is the added noise to the input image x0, the\nmodel learn to predict the noise of xt conditioned on text\nprompt cp at timestep t.\nLatent diffusion Models: LDM propose to apply a com-\npressed latent code z rather than the image signal x in dif-\nfusion process to speed up the denoising process. The im-\nage x is encoded by an encoder E to obtain the latent code\nz = E(x), and the model learns to denoise in latent space.\nDuring inference, the reconstructed latent code z0 can be\nreconstructed by a decoder D, x0 = D(z0) to obtain the\ngenerated image.\nControlNet: ControlNet is a neural network architecture\nthat enhances pretrained image diffusion models with task-\nspecific conditions by utilizing trainable layers copied from\nthe original diffusion model. These layers are then fine-\ntuned based on specific control maps such as edge, depth,\nand segmentation inputs. The loss with additional control\ncan be formulated as:\nmin\u03b8||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, cp, cf)||2\n2\n(11)\nwhere the control map cf is an additional control. Our\nresearch draws inspiration from ControlNet and expands its\napplication into video synthesis. In the case of a video, the\ninput signal x and control cf is extended to a sequence of N\nframes.\nB. More Experiment results\nB.1.

However, generating images\nof novel concept provided by the user input image is still a challenging task. To\naddress this problem, researchers have been exploring various methods for cus-\ntomizing pre-trained text-to-image generation models. Currently, most existing\nmethods for customizing pre-trained text-to-image generation models involve the\nuse of regularization techniques to prevent over-fitting. While regularization will\nease the challenge of customization and leads to successful content creation with\nrespect to text guidance, it may restrict the model capability, resulting in the loss of\ndetailed information and inferior performance. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework for customized text-to-image generation without the use of regulariza-\ntion. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of an encoder network and a\nnovel sampling method which can tackle the over-fitting problem without the use\nof regularization. With the proposed framework, we are able to customize a large-\nscale text-to-image generation model within half a minute on single GPU, with only\none image provided by the user. We demonstrate in experiments that our proposed\nframework outperforms existing methods, and preserves more fine-grained details.\n1\nIntroduction\nText-to-image generation is a research topic that has been explored for years [33, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42],\nwith remarkable progresses recently. Nowadays, researchers are able to perform zero-shot text-\nto-image generation with arbitrary text input by training large-scale models on web-scale datasets.\nStarting from DALL-E [21] and CogView [5], numerous methods have been proposed [3, 6, 7,\n20, 22, 24, 37, 40], leading to impressive capability in generating text-aligned images of high\nresolution with exceptional fidelity. Besides text-to-image generation, these large-scale models also\nhave huge impacts on many other applications including image manipulation [1, 10] and video\ngeneration [11, 29].\nAlthough aforementioned large-scale text-to-image generation models are able to perform text-\naligned and creative generation, they may face difficulties in generating novel and unique concepts [8]\nspecified by users. Thus, researchers have exploited different methods in customizing pre-trained\ntext-to-image generation models. For instance, [17, 23] propose to fine-tune the pre-trained generative\nmodels with few samples, where different regularization methods are applied to prevent over-fitting.\n[8, 9, 34] propose to encode the novel concept of user input image in a word embedding, which\nis obtained by an optimization method or from an encoder network. All these methods lead to\ncustomized generation for the novel concept, while satisfying additional requirements described in\narbitrary user input text.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2305.13579v1  [cs.CV]  23 May 2023\nFigure 1: Customized generation with the proposed framework. Given only single testing image,\nwe are able to perform customized generation which satisfies arbitrary specified requirements and\npreserves fine-grained details.\nDespite these progresses, recent research also makes us suspect that the use of regularization may\npotentially restrict the capability of customized generation, leading to the information loss of fine-\ngrained details. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ProFusion, which consists of an\nencoder called PromptNet and a novel sampling method called Fusion Sampling. Different from\nprevious methods, our ProFusion does not require any regularization, the potential over-fitting problem\ncan be tackled by the proposed Fusion Sampling method at inference, which saves training time as\nthere is no need to tune the hyper-parameters for regularization method. Our main contributions can\nbe summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose ProFusion, a novel framework for customized generation. Given single testing\nimage containing a unique concept, the proposed framework can generate customized output\nfor the unique concept and meets additional requirement specified in arbitrary text. Only\nabout 30 seconds of fine-tuning on single GPU is required;\n\u2022 The proposed framework does not require any regularization method to prevent over-fitting,\nwhich significantly reduces training time as there is no need to tune regularization hyper-\nparameters. The absence of regularization also allows the proposed framework to achieve\nenhanced preservation of fine-grained details;\n\u2022 Extensive results,including qualitative, quantitative and human evaluation results, have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ProFusion. Ablation studies are also con-\nducted to better understand the components in the proposed framework;\n2\nMethodology\nWe now present our proposed ProFusion framework, which consists of a neural network called\nPromptNet and a novel sampling method called Fusion Sampling. Specifically, PromptNet is an\nencoder network which can generate word embedding S\u2217 conditioned on input image x, inside the\ninput embedding space of the text encoder from Stable Diffusion 2. The major benefit of mapping\nx into S\u2217 is that S\u2217 can be readily combined with arbitrary text to construct prompt for creative\ngeneration, e.g., \"S\u2217 from a superhero movie screenshot\"; Meanwhile, the Fusion Sampling is a\nsampling method leads to promising generation which meets the specified text requirements while\nmaintaining fine-grained details of the input image x.\n2\nFigure 2: Illustration of the proposed framework.\nFigure 3: The performance of customized generation is impacted by the level of regularization.\nOur core idea is presented in Figure 2. The proposed PromptNet infers S\u2217 from an input image x0\nand current noisy generation xt. Instead of using x0, we can use \u00afx0 during the training of PromptNet,\nwhich denotes a different view of x0 and can be obtained by data augmentation, e.g., resizing, rotation.\nThe PromptNet is trained with diffusion loss:\nLDiffusion = Ex,y(S\u2217),t,\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)\n\u0002\n\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, y(S\u2217), t)\u22252\n2\n\u0003\n,\n(1)\nwhere y(S\u2217) denotes the constructed prompt containing S\u2217, e.g. \"A photo of S\u2217\".\nExisting works [8, 9] use similar idea to obtain S\u2217. However, regularization are often applied in these\nworks. For instance, E4T [9] proposes to use an encoder to generate S\u2217, which is optimized with\nL = LDiffusion + \u03bb\u2225S\u2217\u22252\n2,\n(2)\nwhere the L2 norm of S\u2217 is regularized. Similarly, Textual Inversion [8] proposes to directly obtain\nS\u2217 by solving\nS\u2217 = argminS\u2032LDiffusion + \u03bb\u2225S\u2032 \u2212 S\u22252\n2\nwith optimization method, where S denotes a coarse embedding*.\nIn this work, we argue that although the use of regularization will ease the challenge and enables\nsuccessful content creation with respect to testing text. It also leads to the loss of detailed information,\nresulting in inferior performance. To verify this argument, we conduct a simple experiment on FFHQ\ndataset [15]. We train several encoders with different levels of regularization by selecting different \u03bb\nin (2). After training, we test their capability by classifier-free sampling [13] with different prompts\ncontaining resulting S\u2217. The results are shown in Figure 3, from which we can find that smaller\nregularization leads to less information loss, which results in better preservation of details. However,\nthe information could be too strong to prevent creative generation with respect to user input text.\nMeanwhile, large regularization leads to successful content creation, while fails to capture details of\nthe input image, resulting in unsatisfactory results.\nA consequent question is, is it possible to perform successful customized generation using S\u2217\nobtained without regularization so that the details from original image can be well-preserved?\nTo answer this question, we propose a novel sampling method called Fusion Sampling.\n*let S\u2217 be a target embedding for a specific human face image, S can be set to be the embedding of text\n\"face\".\n3\n2.1\nFusion Sampling\nGiven a PromptNet pre-trained without regularization which can map input image x0 into word\nembedding S\u2217, our goal is to successfully perform customized generation which preserves details of\nx0, and meets the requirements specified in arbitrary prompt containing S\u2217.\nThe task can be formulated as a conditional generation task with conditions S\u2217 and C, where C\ndenotes arbitrary user input text. We start from the most commonly used classifier-free sampling [13].\nTo sample xt\u22121 given current noisy sample xt and conditions [S\u2217, C], the diffusion model first\noutputs the predictions of conditional noise \u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) and unconditional noise \u03f5\u03b8(xt). Then an\nupdated prediction (with hyper-parameter \u03c9)\n\u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) = (1 + \u03c9)\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) \u2212 \u03c9\u03f5\u03b8(xt),\n(3)\nwill be used in different sampling strategies [12, 14, 30, 31].\nIn customized generation, the reason that vanilla classifier-free sampling does not work without\nregularization is that, information from S\u2217 can become too strong without regularization. As a result,\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) will degenerate to \u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217) and information of C will be lost. Thus, we need to\npropose a new sampling method, to produce a new prediction for \u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) which is enforced to\nbe conditioned on both S\u2217 and C.\nSampling with independent conditions\nWe begin by assuming that S\u2217 and C are independent.\nAccording to [13], we know that\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) = \u2212\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u2207 log p(xt |S\u2217, C),\n(4)\nwhere \u00af\u03b1t is a hyper-parameter as defined in [12]. By (4) and Bayes\u2019 Rule, we can re-write (3) as\n\u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt) \u2212 (1 + \u03c9)\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u2207 log p(S\u2217, C| xt).\n(5)\nSince we assume that S\u2217, C are independent, we can further re-write the above as\n\u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt) \u2212 (1 + \u03c9)\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u2207 log p(S\u2217| xt) \u2212 (1 + \u03c9)\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u2207 log p(C| xt)\n= \u03f5\u03b8(xt) + (1 + \u03c9){\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt)} + (1 + \u03c9){\u03f5\u03b8(xt, C) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt)}.\nWe re-write it as\n\u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217, C) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt) + (1 + \u03c91){\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt)} + (1 + \u03c92){\u03f5\u03b8(xt, C) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt)} (6)\nfor more flexibility. (6) can be readily extended to more complicated scenarios, where a list of\nconditions {S\u2217\n1, S\u2217\n2, ..., S\u2217\nk, C} are provided. The corresponding \u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, {S\u2217\ni }k\ni=1, C) is\n\u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(xt, {S\u2217\ni }k\ni=1, C) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt) +\nk\nX\ni=1\n(1 + \u03c9i){\u03f5\u03b8(xt, S\u2217\ni ) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt)} + (1 + \u03c9C){\u03f5\u03b8(xt, C) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt)}.\nFusion Sampling with dependent conditions\nOne major drawback of (6) is that the independence\ndoes not always hold in practice. As we will show in later experiment, assuming S\u2217 and C to be\nindependent can lead to inferior generation.\nTo solve this problem, we propose Fusion Sampling, which consists of two stages at each timestep t:\na fusion stage which encodes information from both S\u2217 and C into xt with an updated \u02dcxt, and a\nrefinement stage which predicts xt\u22121 based on Equation (6). The proposed algorithm is presented\nin Algorithm 1. Sampling with independent conditions can be regarded as a special case of Fusion\nSampling with m = 0. In practice, m = 1 works well, thus we set m = 1 in all our experiments.\nThe remaining challenge in Algorithm 1 is to sample \u02dcxt\u22121\n\u223c\nq(\u02dcxt\u22121|\u02dcxt, \u02dcx0) and \u02dcxt\n\u223c\nq(\u02dcxt|\u02dcxt\u22121, \u02dcx0). We take Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) [30] as an example, while\nthe following derivation can be extended to other diffusion models. Let I be the identity matrix, \u03c3t\ndenotes a hyper-parameter controlling randomness.

Our proposed approach exhibits superior capability for\npreserving fine-grained details.\nFigure 5: The proposed framework enables generation conditioned on multiple input images and text.\nCreative interpolation can be performed.\n3\nExperiments\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed framework. Specifically, we first pre-train\na PromptNet on FFHQ dataset [15] on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 80,000 iterations with a batch size\nof 64, without any data augmentation. Given a testing image, the PromptNet and all attention layers\nof the pre-trained Stable Diffusion 2 are fine-tuned for 50 steps with a batch size of 8. Only half a\nminute and a single GPU is required in fine-tuning such a customized generative model, indicating\nthe efficiency of the proposed method, especially considering the impressive results we could obtain.\nSome more implementation details are provided in the Appendix.

From the results, we can see that the proposed\nframework effectively achieves customized generation which meets the specified text requirements\nwhile maintaining fine-grained details of the input image. More results are provided in the Appendix.\nAs mentioned previously, our proposed framework is also able to perform generation conditioned on\nmultiple images. We also provide these generated examples in Figure 5.\nFollowing [9], we then compare proposed framework with several baseline methods including\nStable Diffusion\u2020 [22], Textual Inversion [8], DreamBooth [23], E4T [9]. The qualitative results are\npresented in Figure 4, where the results of related methods are directly taken from [9]. From the\ncomparison we can see that our framework results in better preservation of fine-grained details.\n3.2\nQuantitative Results\nWe also evaluate our methods and baseline methods quantitatively. Specifically, we utilize different\npre-trained CLIP models [19] to calculate the image-prompt similarity between the generated image\nand input text. The results are shown in Table 1, our ProFusion obtains higher image-prompt similarity\non all CLIP models, indicating better prompt-adherence and edit-ability..\nWe then calculate the identity similarity between the generated image and input image, which is\ncosine similarity computed using features extracted by pre-trained face recognition models. The\nidentity similarity is also evaluated across different pre-trained models [4, 16, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32].\nThe results are shown in Table 2. In general, our ProFusion obtains higher similarity, indicating better\nidentity preservation.\n\u2020The results of Stable Diffusion is obtained by directly feeding corresponding researcher\u2019s name and text\nrequirements into the pre-trained text-to-image generation model.\n7\nMethod\nPre-trained Face Recognition Models\nVGG-Face\nFacenet\nFacenet512\nOpenFace\nDeepFace\nArcFace\nSFace\nAdaFace\nStable Diffusion 2\n0.530\n0.334\n0.323\n0.497\n0.641\n0.144\n0.191\n0.093\nTextual Inversion\n0.516\n0.410\n0.372\n0.566\n0.651\n0.248\n0.231\n0.210\nDreamBooth\n0.518\n0.483\n0.415\n0.516\n0.643\n0.379\n0.304\n0.307\nE4T\n0.677\n0.596\n0.621\n0.660\n0.732\n0.454\n0.398\n0.426\nProFusion (Ours)\n0.720\n0.616\n0.597\n0.681\n0.774\n0.459\n0.443\n0.432\nTable 2: Similarity (\u2191) between generated example and input image.\n(a) vs. Stable Diffusion\n(b) vs. Textual Inversion\n(c) vs. DreamBooth\n(d) vs. E4T\nFigure 7: Results of human evaluation.\nFigure 8: Examples with prompt \"S\u2217 in anime style\", Fusion Sampling outperforms baseline.\n3.3\nHuman Evaluation\nWe then conduct human evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The workers are presented\nwith two generated images from different methods along with original image and text requirements.\nThey are then tasked with indicating their preferred choice. More details are provided in the Appendix.\nThe results are shown in Figure 7, where we can find that our method obtains a higher preference rate\ncompared to all other methods, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n3.4\nAblation Study\nWe conduct several ablation studies to further investigate the proposed ProFusion.\nFusion Sampling\nFirst of all, we apply the proposed Fusion Sampling with both pre-trained and\nfine-tuned PromptNet. As shown in Figure 8, Fusion Sampling obtains better results on both pre-\ntrained and fine-tuned models compared to baseline classifier-free sampling. We then investigate\nthe effects of removing fusion stage or refinement stage in the proposed Fusion Sampling. As we\ncan see from Figure 10, removing refinement stage leads to the loss in detailed information, while\nremoving fusion stage leads to a generated image with disorganized structure. Intuitively, S\u2217, which\nis the output of PromptNet, tries to generate a human face image following the structural information\nfrom the original image, while the text \"is wearing superman costume\" aims to generate a half-length\nphoto. The conflicting nature of these two conditions results in an undesirable generation with a\ndisorganized structure after we remove the fusion stage.\n8\nFigure 9: Data augmentation in fine-tuning stage leads to performance improvement.\nFigure 10: Generated examples of ablation study, with prompt \"S\u2217 is wearing superman costume\".\nData Augmentation\nWe then analyze the effects of data augmentation. In particular, we conduct\nseparate fine-tuning experiments: one with data augmentation and one without, both models are\ntested with Fusion Sampling after fine-tuning. The results are shown in Figure 9, we observe an\nimprovement in performance as a result of employing data augmentation. Our data augmentation\nstrategy is presented in the Appendix.\n4\nDiscussion\nAlthough the proposed framework has demonstrated remarkable capability in achieving high-quality\ncustomized generation, there are areas that can be improved. For instance, although ProFusion can\nreduce the training time by only requiring a single training without the need of tuning regularization\nhyperparameters, the proposed Fusion Sampling actually results in an increased inference time. This\nis due to the division of each sampling step into two stages. In the future, we would like to explore\nways to improve the efficiency of Fusion Sampling.\nSimilar to other related works, our framework utilizing large-scale text-to-image generation models\ncan raise ethical implications, both positive and negative. On the one hand, customized generation\ncan create images with sensitive information and spread misinformation; On the other hand, it also\nholds the potential to minimize model biases as discussed in [8, 9]. Thus it is crucial to exercise\nproper supervision when implementing these methods in real-world applications.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present ProFusion, a novel framework for customized generation. Different\nfrom related methods which employs regularization, ProFusion successfully performs customized\ngeneration without any regularization, thus exhibits superior capability for preserving fine-grained\ndetails with less training time. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed ProFusion.\n9\nReferences\n[1] Omri Avrahami, Dani Lischinski, and Ohad Fried.

Compared to existing benchmarks that focus on\ncomputational tasks (e.g. classification, detection or tracking), the Perception\nTest focuses on skills (Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics) and types of\nreasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual) across video, audio,\nand text modalities, to provide a comprehensive and efficient evaluation tool. The\nbenchmark probes pre-trained models for their transfer capabilities, in a zero-shot /\nfew-shot or limited finetuning regime. For these purposes, the Perception Test intro-\nduces 11.6k real-world videos, 23s average length, designed to show perceptually\ninteresting situations, filmed by around 100 participants worldwide. The videos\nare densely annotated with six types of labels (multiple-choice and grounded video\nquestion-answers, object and point tracks, temporal action and sound segments),\nenabling both language and non-language evaluations. The fine-tuning and valida-\ntion splits of the benchmark are publicly available (CC-BY license), in addition to\na challenge server with a held-out test split. Human baseline results compared to\nstate-of-the-art video QA models show a substantial gap in performance (91.4% vs\n46.2%), suggesting that there is significant room for improvement in multimodal\nvideo understanding.

Models like Flamingo [4], SeViLA [55], BEiT-3 [49], GPT-4 [43] show remarkable\nversatility, dealing with diverse data sources and tackling new tasks by observing only a handful of\nexamples. This is a major departure from specialised models that are typical in computer vision, e.g.\nimage or action classifiers [53, 20], object detectors [13], or object trackers [47], opening up the path\ntowards general perception and reasoning models.\nBenchmarking these models in a robust and efficient way is key to expanding their capabilities, by\nallowing researchers to rank model design and training choices, and identify areas for improvement.\nMany perception-related benchmarks exist, for example Imagenet for image classification [17],\nKinetics for video action recognition [36], Audioset for audio event classification [24], TAO for\nobject tracking [16], or VQA for image question-answering [28], to name only a few. While these\nbenchmarks have led to amazing progress, they all target restricted aspects of perception, focusing on\nspecific computational tasks: e.g. image benchmarks discard the temporal dimension, visual question-\nanswering tends to focus on only high-level semantic scene understanding, and object tracking focuses\non lower-level, texture-based cues. Gluing several datasets together [39, 45] to benchmark more\ngeneral models (as is done in Flamingo, SeViLA, BEiT-3, or GPT-4) improves coverage, but results in\nan expensive evaluation procedure that still misses important general perception abilities, e.g. physics\nunderstanding or memory. Few existing benchmarks even define tasks over both audio and visual\nmodalities [29], much less more complex combinations of modalities and tasks. Furthermore, most\nprior work provides large training sets and thus benchmark models for in-dataset capabilities.\nIn this work, we propose the Perception Test \u2013 a benchmark formed of purposefully designed, filmed,\nand annotated real-world videos that aims to comprehensively assess the capabilities of multimodal\nperception models across different skill areas (Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics), types of\nreasoning [54] (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and counterfactual), and modalities (video,\naudio, text). Our benchmark draws inspiration from diagnostic synthetic datasets like CATER [25] or\nCLEVRER [54], behavioral tests like the Visual Turing Test [41, 23], experiments in developmental\npsychology [1, 6, 31], and motor-free perception screening tests used for children or adults [42, 22].\nTo avoid benchmark overfitting, we propose a generalisation-focused evaluation regime. We aim\nto benchmark any representation or model, pre-trained with any external dataset or task, of any\nscale available. The Perception Test itself contains a small training set that can optionally be used\nfor fine-tuning task decoders or prompting the model, and the rest is used for evaluation (public\nvalidation and held out test sets). In this regime, we can more robustly assess the transfer abilities of\nthese models, such that improvement on the benchmark can more reliably predict generalisation to\nreal-world operation.\nThe dataset contains 11.6K real-world videos, densely annotated with 190K object and 8.6K point\ntracks, 73.5K temporal action segments, 137K temporal sound segments, 38K multiple-choice video\nquestion-answer (mc-vQA) pairs and 6K grounded video question-answer (g-vQA) pairs, enabling\nboth language and non-language evaluations, to ensure a thorough assessment; see Figure 1 and\nTable 3. Having multiple types of annotations per video is useful also for analysis and explainability\npurposes, as the correlations between successes and failures across tasks may uncover model biases.\nWe open-source the videos and annotations in the training and validation splits. An evaluation\nserver is made available together with the videos from the held-out test split. Since currently there\nis no model that can tackle all the evaluation tasks in our benchmark, we provide baseline results\nfor per-task models: object tracking, point tracking, temporal action localisation, temporal sound\nlocalisation, multiple-choice video question-answering, and grounded video question-answering.\nFor the mc-vQA task, the performance is mapped across skill areas (memory, abstraction, physics,\nsemantics), and types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual) to obtain a\ncomprehensive diagnostics report.\nIn the next section (section 2), we discuss related work in more detail, highlighting what sets\nthe Perception Test apart in the rich landscape of multimodal benchmarks. In sections 3 and 4,\nwe describe the videos and annotations in the Perception Test, with details about the diversity of\nparticipants involved in filming the videos. In section 5, we introduce the computational tasks enabled\nby these annotations, together with evaluation metrics and baselines, including a human baseline. We\nconclude with a summary and directions of future work in section 6.\n2\nFigure 1: The Perception Test contains 6 types of annotations (object & point tracks, action & sound segments,\nmultiple-choice videoQA and grounded videoQA) and tasks spanning 4 skill areas (Memory, Asbtraction,\nPhysics, Semantics, and 4 types of reasoning (Descriptive, Explanatory, Predictive, Counterfactual). See the\npresentation video at https://github.com/deepmind/perception_test for more examples.\n2\nRelated work\nA large number of perception-related benchmarks exist in the literature, covering various compu-\ntational tasks or modalities. We focus the discussion here on video benchmarks and highlight the\ndifferences between the Perception Test and prior work, in terms of data collection process, covered\nmodalities, and available annotations and tasks.\n3\nDataset\nSource\nSkills\n# videos\nDens\nL(s)\nCharades\nC,R\nS\n10,000\n14\n30\nSSv2\nC,R\nAS\n108,499\n1\n4\nEgo4D-v2\nR\nMS\n205,534\u2021\n9\u2217\n492\u2020\nCLEVRER\u266d\nC,Y\nP\n60,000\nN/A\n5\nPerception Test\nC,R\nMAPS\n11,620\n761\n23\nTable 1: Characteristics of different datasets compared to the Perception Test.

Invariably,\nall real-world benchmarks use crowd-sourced annotations to enable various computational tasks like\naction classification, object detection, or video captioning, to name only a few.\nAnnotating publicly available videos is useful for training. However, using this approach for general\nperception evaluation has multiple drawbacks. Large quantities of data would need to be amassed\nand carefully filtered and annotated to accumulate (statistically) sufficiently diverse samples showing\nperceptually interesting situations that require skills like memory, abstraction, physics, and semantics\nunderstanding. In addition, some types of data are simply not available, e.g. situations showing\nincorrect execution of simple tasks like tying shoe laces. As we aim to assess more diverse skills, we\nchose to design video scripts that show perceptually interesting and diverse situations and film these\nwith crowd-sourced participants from different places in the world to ensure diversity of video content\nand appearance. Different from Charades where the scripts were designed by crowd-sourced workers,\nour scripts are designed by our research team, similar to Something-something (v2). However, we\ndid not aim to obtain an exhaustive coverage of simple actions like in SSv2. Instead, we designed\nmore complex scripts to probe for more advanced reasoning skills beyond action classification.\nA few research works have highlighted the need for robust diagnostics benchmarks, e.g. CATER [25],\nCLEVRER [54], IntPhys [44], Physion [7]. Their authors developed synthetic datasets to evaluate in\na more systematic way, across different levels of difficulty, models\u2019 abilities to reason about intuitive\nphysics (object collisions, motion, object permanence). We share the same motivation of creating a\ndiagnostic test, and we aim to cover aspects related to memory, abstraction, intuitive physics, and\nsemantics, using real-world videos. To achieve this, in addition to designing the video scripts, our\nteam also designed the questions for each script type for the high-level tasks (mc-vQA and g-vQA);\nthe answers per video were provided by crowd-sourced annotators. Given that our videos are filmed\nin real world scenes using common household items, the distributions of objects, actions, and sounds\nin our benchmark have a significant overlap with standard computer vision datasets (e.g. 99.01%\nof the words in our benchmark also appear in VQAv2 [27]), hence the domain gap between the\nPerception Test and existing large-scale training datasets should be minimal.\nTable 1 summarises the characteristics of the Perception Test compared to previous efforts. It can be\nobserved that the Perception Test has a better coverage of skill areas and higher density of annotations2.\nSize-wise, it is comparable to Charades, but smaller than Ego4D or SSv2. We emphasise that the\nPerception Test is not designed to be a large-scale training dataset. Instead, it is an evaluation\nbenchmark, with limited fine-tuning or prompting data, meant to assess the transfer capabilities of\nmodels.\n2We count every labeled box, point, temporal segment, or question as a separate annotation\n4\n3\nVideos in the Perception Test\nInspired by how human perception screening tests are carefully designed by experts in developmental\npsychology or medicine (e.g. [12]), we designed video scripts and tasks to diagnose the perception\nskills of our models.\nScripts design: Our goal was not to obtain an exhaustive coverage of activities or types of scenes.\nInstead, we selected four areas \u2013 Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics \u2013 within which several\nskills should be tested (see Table 2, first column) through tasks that require different types of reasoning:\ndescriptive, explanatory, predictive, or counterfactual [54]. The skills selection took into account\nblind spots of existing benchmarks, weaknesses of current models, and aspects that are important for\nreal-world scene understanding.\nWe then created scripts describing simple situations or games that can be easily performed by any\none person (non-professional actor) using the items available in a regular household, or items that can\nbe easily crafted if not available (e.g. letters or geometric shapes crafted from paper or cardboard).\nEach script consists of a brief description of the scene, followed by a description of the actions to be\nperformed, together with specification of the camera placement (static camera one viewpoint; static\ncamera 2 viewpoints; static camera and moving camera). To enhance content diversity, each script\nhad considerable room for variability in the number of objects to be included in the scene or types of\nactions to be performed, or order of actions.\nWe prioritised situations where we can test high-level concepts like memory through low-level tasks\nlike object tracking and the other way around: low-level physics understanding probed through\nhigh-level tasks like question-answering. In addition, we included in each script elements that could\nmake the situations more interesting and challenging. For example, in cooking scripts (e.g. making\ntea, making salad), we added distractor actions [46], i.e. actions not relevant for making tea and that\nhave no impact on the outcome of the making tea sequence, like clapping hands, or hitting a kettle\nwith a spoon; this allows probing for understanding of causal relations between actions. We also\nincluded distractor objects in the scene description, i.e. objects that are not relevant for the current\nscript, but which are relevant for other scripts, like tomatoes present on the table during the make tea\nactivity [48]. For all the scripts, we also asked participants to include in the scene some adversarial\nconfigurations of objects e.g. a shoe on the table. This allows us to probe models for understanding\nof spatial relations of objects when the language biases are not valid. Finally, some of the script\nvariations include adversarial actions [26], i.e. incorrectly executed actions. For example, when\nmaking the tea, all the steps are done normally, but one is incorrectly executed, like pouring water\nfrom an empty kettle. In this way, we can probe for understanding of task completion, in a more\ncomplex setup than the adversarial action classification used in SSv2 dataset [26].\nTable 2 and Figure 1 show examples of situations included in the scripts to probe for different skills\nin the different areas and types of reasoning. Note that the videos associated with a script allow\ndefining tasks and questions across multiple skill areas. All-in-all, we designed 37 scripts, each\nwith 2-5 variations, to obtain a diverse dataset. Having multiple variations per script allows us to\nask the exact same question with the same set of options, and the correct answer depends on the\nspecific script variation \u2013 in this way, we can avoid language biases in questions that give away the\nanswer [37]. Examples of videos included in the dataset can be found in the presentation video at\nhttps://github.com/deepmind/perception_test.\nVideo filming: Ensuring diversity of participants and scenes depicted in the videos was a critical\nconsideration when developing the benchmark. Using a crowdsourcing pool, we selected around 100\nparticipants from different countries of different ethnicity and gender and aimed to have a diverse\nrepresentation within each video script. We include in the appendix details about the self-reported\ndemographics of participants. Each script variation was filmed by at least a dozen of different\nparticipants, using most often a mobile-phone camera, resulting in high-resolution audio-visual assets.\nFor scripts to be filmed from two different viewpoints, the recording was most often done sequentially\nby repeating the script; a few participants recorded simultaneously using two filming devices. About\n15% of the videos were filmed with a moving camera. Most of the videos were filmed indoors in\nthe living room or kitchen, with a small number being filmed in the bathroom or outdoors (about\n1%). Most of the activities are performed on a tabletop, but some are also performed on the floor\nor on a chair. To avoid privacy concerns, we instructed the participants to not record their faces or\n5\n(Skill Area) Skill\nExample of situations and questions or tasks\n(M)Visual discrimination\nObjects are shown in front of the camera, with some shown more than once.

This is not a limitation of the dataset since the focus in our scripts is on object interactions.\nThe participants gave their consent for the data to be used, published, and stored for perpetuity.\nSplits: The Perception Test contains 11609 videos (with audio), 23s average length. It is divided into\na small training split (2184 videos, \u223c 20% of the data) that can be used for fine-tuning or prompting,\na validation split (5900 videos, \u223c 50% of the data), and a held-out test split (3525 videos, \u223c 30% of\nthe data) available through the evaluation server. We optimised to obtain a good balance across all\nannotation types and camera motions across the 3 splits; see section 5 in the appendix.\n4\nAnnotations in the Perception Test\nWe annotate these videos with six types of annotations to cover low-level and high-level aspects, both\nspatial and temporal, and enable language and non-language evaluations: object and point tracks,\ntemporal action and sound segments, multiple-choice and grounded video question-answers. We\ninclude a summary of the number of annotations in Table 3 and visualisations in Figure 1.\n6\nAnnotation type\n# classes\n# annot\n# videos\nRate (fps)\nObjects tracks\n5101\n189940\n11609\n1\nPoint tracks\nNA\n8647\n145\n30\nAction segments\n63\n73503\n11353\n30\nSound segments\n16\n137128\n11433\n30\nmc-vQA\n132\n38060\n10361\nNA\ng-vQA\n34\n6086\n3063\n1\nArea\n# videoQA\nMemory\n7256 (36)\nAbstraction\n12737 (58)\nPhysics\n23741 (80)\nSemantics\n24965 (82)\nReasoning\n# videoQA\nDescriptive\n31536 (106)\nExplanatory\n4513\n(14)\nPredictive\n1278\n(7)\nCounterfactual\n733\n(5)\nTable 3: Top: Annotations in the Perception Test. Each object or point track contains frame-level\nannotations at a certain frame rate, e.g. each point is annotated on every frame, at 30 fps. Action\nand sound segments are annotated at the original video frame rate. # classes refers to the number\nof unique object names for object tracks and the number of unique questions for multiple-choice\nvideoQA (mc-vQA) and grounded videoQA (g-vQA). Bottom: Number of videoQA pairs and\n(unique questions) per area and type of reasoning. Note that one question may be counted in multiple\nareas if it tests more than one skill. Each question is assigned a unique type of reasoning.\nObject tracks: Object tracks represent the root annotation of our benchmark. All the other annota-\ntions, except for multiple-choice vQA, are linked or grounded into object tracks. In the annotation\nprocess, we instructed annotators to focus on the objects that the person interacts with and the objects\nthat are in the immediate vicinity of the area where the person is performing actions, which act as\ndistractor objects. We annotated boxes at 1fps throughout the video, which gives a good trade-off\nbetween density of annotations and annotation cost. When the objects are occluded, the annotators\nmarked an approximate position of the boxes. Some ambiguous classes still remain, like liquids\nbeing poured or objects being torn. The object names were defined from an open vocabulary. The\nannotators typically included object attributes as well (colour, material), resulting in a large number\nof unique names. A list of the most frequent words (object or attributes) is included in the appendix,\nFig. A1 (left), together with the distribution of object tracks into various categories, e.g. objects\ninvolved in actions or sounds correlated with camera motion (Table A1).\nCups-game subset: We isolate the videos corresponding to the cups-game scripts, as they can be an\ninteresting subset for probing object trackers\u2019 abilities to reason about motion, object permanence, or\noccluded interactions when different factors may influence the difficulty of the task, e.g. identical vs\nnon-identical objects used in the game, transparent vs non-transparent objects, or number of objects\nused. This subset contains 598 videos, with 483 videos where the cups are identical, and 113 videos\nwhere the cups are transparent. Most of the videos have 3 cups (451 videos), 132 videos have 2 cups,\nand 34 videos have 4 cups. We also provide a visibility mask for each video showing when the hidden\nobject is occluded.\nPoint tracks: Although object tracks based on bounding boxes allow probing some physical proper-\nties of objects, such as object permanence, solidity, and coarse motion, they do not fully describe\narticulated or non-rigid objects, thin objects that are not axis-aligned, or out-of-plane rotation. A\nbetter understanding of physical interactions arises if we can track how object surfaces move and\ndeform over time. To this end, we annotate point tracks on object surfaces following the protocol\nof TAP-Vid [19]. Annotators were instructed to select points spanning all the different parts of the\nobjects labelled in the object tracking task. Points that are occluded are simply marked as occluded\nand not tracked. For translucent objects (e.g. glass cups), we only consider points to be \u2018visible\u2019\nif they belong to the surface closest to the camera. The annotated points are dense in time (30fps).\nTable A2 in the appendix gives the distribution of points that are moving or static, as well as those on\nvideos with moving cameras.\nAction segments with action-relevant objects: To capture temporal understanding and enable\ngrounding over time, we annotate the videos with temporal segments belonging to a fixed set of\ntemplated labels, e.g. putting something into something, similar to [26]. These are associated with\naction-relevant object tracks, i.e. objects involved in the action. The action boundaries are defined\nbased on contact with action-relevant objects. For instance, when a person puts sugar in a tea, the\nputting something into something action starts when the person picks up the spoon and ends when the\nperson puts down the spoon. If, after putting the sugar, the person starts stirring with the same spoon,\n7\nTask\nOutput\nMetric\nBaseline\nScore\nObject tracking\nbox track\nAvg.

The frequency of actions across the entire\ndataset is included in the appendix, Fig. A1 (right).\nSound segments with sound-relevant objects: Similarly to the action segment annotations but\napplied to the audio modality, we collect sound segment annotations grounded in object tracks. By\nwatching the video and listening to the audio, the annotators define temporal sound segments and\nlabel them from a list of 16 audio segment labels. For each sound, the annotators also identify the\nobject (or objects) involved in making the sound, or specify that these are out of the camera\u2019s field of\nview. For example, if an object is placed on the table making an audible sound, then both the object\ntrack and the table track are associated with the sound segment. The frequency of sounds across the\nentire dataset is included in the appendix, Fig. A2.\nQuestion-answers for video-level reasoning: Different from the existing VQA datasets, which rely\non crowd-sourced questions and answers, our team designed the questions per script to cover different\ntypes of reasoning [54]: descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual, and to cover aspects\nthat are important for operating in the real world, e.g. understanding task completion, detecting\nchanges, and so on. The answers for all the questions per video were provided by crowd-sourced\nparticipants. As we are interested in non-ambiguous evaluation, we favour the multiple-choice setup\nover the open-language answer setup. To define challenging negative options, we partly relied on\nhuman annotators, partly sampling from the correct answers of other videos in the same type of script.\nTable 3 bottom and Figure A3 in the appendix show the distribution of question-video pairs into\nperception skills, skill areas, and type of reasoning.\nQuestion-answers with answer-relevant objects: As another way to connect high-level and low-\nlevel scene understanding capabilities, we define questions or tasks in language form, with answers\ngiven as object tracks. Similar to the multiple-choice question-answers above, our team defined the\nquestions, and human raters selected the answers from the existing object tracks. The grounded\nquestions are associated with skill areas and types of reasoning.\n5\nComputational tasks and baseline results in the Perception Test\nComputational tasks: We defined six computational tasks based on the annotations available in the\nPerception Test. We summarise in Table 4 the task definitions (outputs, metrics) and the performance\nof top-performing baselines. It can be observed that the Perception Test combines lower-level dense\nprediction tasks like object and point tracking, whose outputs are box and point trajectories, with\nhigher-level tasks like video question answering. For all the tasks, the video and audio are available\nas inputs, together with a task specification where applicable, e.g. the coordinates of a box to track\nfor object tracking, or a language question and options for multiple-choice videoQA. More details\nabout the task definitions are included in the appendix. Note that many other computational tasks can\nbe defined based on the available annotations, e.g. grounded temporal action/sound localisation.\nBaselines: Ideally, a single model should be able to perform all the tasks in the Perception Test. Since\nsuch a model is not available in the literature, we include results obtained with per-task baselines\non the validation split for all the six tasks in the Perception Test; see Table 4 for a summary of\ntop-performing baselines and their average performance, and the appendix for more details. When\nselecting these baselines, we favoured strong-performing models that can be evaluated in a zero-shot\nor few-shot setting, as our focus is on generalisation. However, for action and sound localisation,\nsuch models do not exist in the literature, so fine-tuning on our set of classes was necessary. For\nthe mc-vQA task, we also provide a human baseline and fine-tuned evaluation to further assess the\ndifficulty of the dataset for humans and for SOTA video-language models, respectively.\n8\nObject tracking: The overall performance of SiamFC [8] (UniTrack [50] implementation) on our\nbenchmark confirms the findings from [21] that simple Siamese trackers are better when probed\nzero-shot than more complex recent trackers, e.g. Stark tracker [52] obtains 0.56 mean IoU on the\nPerception Test vs 0.67 for SiamFC. Even for SiamFC, the tracking performance drops when the\ncamera and/or the objects are moving. The results for the different categories of objects (involved in\nactions or in sounds, etc.) are included in Table A3, aggregated based on camera motion.\nPoint tracking: The performance of our baseline TAP-Net [19] is a bit lower on the Perception Test\ncompared to the performance reported by the authors on the Kinetics dataset [36] (0.466 vs 0.401);\nsee detailed results in Table A4. We attribute this drop in performance mainly to the increased video\nlength in our benchmark (23s in Perception Test compared to 10s in Kinetics).\nAction localisation: The confusion matrix for our fine-tuned baseline ActionFormer [57] (Fig. A4)\nshows that the model struggles mostly with rare action classes that are confused with more frequent\nones, and it also confuses pretend actions with their non-pretend versions, e.g. ironing something vs\npretending to iron something. Using multimodal inputs does not increase the performance signifi-\ncantly, as summarised in Table A5, top. Overall, ActionFormer\u2019s performance on our benchmark\nis lower compared to other benchmarks (15.56 mAP on Perception Test vs 22.7 mAP on EPIC-\nKitchens [14]), most likely due to the presence of adversarial actions and our limited training set. We\nhope to see in the near future models that can handle open-vocabulary action classes (similarly to\nopen-vocabulary object detection [35]), so that fine-tuning is no longer necessary.\nSound localisation: We adapted the same ActionFormer model [57] to perform the localisation task\nin the audio modality. The best performance is obtained when features from both video and audio\nmodalities are used as input; see Table A5, bottom.\nMultiple-choice vQA: We report results for two strong recent video language models: Flamingo [3]\nin zero-shot and few-shot setups, and SeViLA [55] in zero-shot and fine-tuned regimes. We also\ninclude a dummy frequency-based baseline and a human baseline. For the frequency baseline, given\nthat each question-options pair is defined over multiple videos, we keep as answer the option that\nis most frequently the correct answer in the training set. One can also compute this baseline on\na random subset of training examples for each question, see Table A6, to obtain a fairer dummy\nbaseline for models using few-shot evaluation.\nHuman baseline. We ran a small study for the mc-vQA task with human participants. We used\n126 questions from the dataset, with one video per question selected at random. We recruited 30\ncrowd-sourced participants (half male, half female, with advanced English skills), different from\nthe raters annotating the videos. Each participant answered a subset of 42 questions, resulting in 10\nanswers per question. The performance per area and type of reasoning is detailed in Figure 2. The\noverall average accuracy was 91.4%. The mistakes occurred in situations difficult to judge from the\ngiven viewpoint, e.g. if a configuration of objects would be stable (without seeing the end of the\nvideo), or in edge cases where humans overlooked details happening very early on in the video. It is\nworth noting that the participants did not require any training, which is similar to a zero-shot setup.\nThe median time spent to answer 42 questions was 30 minutes.\nIt can be observed that both Flamingo and SeViLA are far from human performance when evaluated\n0-shot or few-shot and cannot outperform the 8-shot dummy frequency baseline; see Figures 2, 3, A5,\nand Table A6. On many skills in the Memory, Physics, and Abstraction areas, their performance\nis below the 8-shot frequency dummy baseline, and in a few cases, e.g. (Piaget) conservation\ntask, collision, or counterfactual reasoning, they are even below the pure random baseline. For\ncounterfactuals, our qualitative investigation shows that Flamingo tends to latch on the visible\nelements in the video, failing to imagine the alternate reality that counterfactual questions require;\ne.g. for videos where a person writes some letters on the paper, the (counterfactual) question posed\nis: What would be the order of the written letters if the person had written them in reverse order?.\nFlamingo often selects the written order as correct. Interestingly, the larger versions of the model\n(due to larger language branches) seem to fare worse overall, which might point to overfitting\nissues. However, we leave an in-depth analysis for future work. Fine-tuning SeViLA leads to\nbetter results compared to all-shot frequency baseline, but mainly in the Semantics area (Fig. 3).\nSeViLA\u2019s 0-shot/fine-tuned scores on Perception Test (Fig. 3) are significantly lower than on NExT-\nQA benchmark [51]: 46.2 vs 63.6 for zero-shot, and 62.0 vs 73.8 on fine-tuned. We attribute this to\nthe diversity of skills and the hard negative options included in the Perception Test.\n9\nGrounded-vQA: As no existing model can perform this task, we created a baseline by running\nMDETR [34] on the middle frame and then tracking the predictions using the Stark [52] object\ntracker. The performance is poor; see Table A7 and Figure A6. The failures are caused mainly by\npoor detection results \u2013 since the tasks are temporal in nature, extracting seed boxes from the middle\nframe is not sufficient to solve the tasks, calling for models capable of dealing with both spatial and\ntemporal dimensions.\nFigure 2: 0-shot human baseline compared to 8-shot Flamingo-3B, 0-shot and fine-tuned SeViLA,\nand random baseline on the validation set. In 0-shot and 8-shot regimes, both Flamingo and SeViLA\nare far from the 0-shot human baseline. SeViLA fine-tuning improves results to some extent, but the\ngap to human performance is still substantial.\nFigure 3: Performance on the validation set across skills for the 0-shot and fine-tuned SeViLA\ncompared to frequency dummy baseline. The black dashed line indicates the random baseline.\n6\nConclusion\nWe propose a diagnostic benchmark for multimodal models, to probe for memory, abstraction,\nphysics, and semantic capabilities, across visual, audio, and text modalities, using real-world videos\npurposefully designed and filmed to show interesting perceptual situations. Solving the tasks requires\ndifferent types of reasoning: descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and counterfactual. The videos are\ndensely labeled with six types of annotations (objects and point tracks, action and sound segments,\nmultiple-choice and grounded video question-answers). We are open-sourcing the videos and the\nannotations in the train and validation splits, together with per-task baseline results and evaluation\ncode. A challenge server is available to evaluate models on the held-out test split. In principle,\nany model can be evaluated on our benchmark, either in a zero/few-shot setting or by fine-tuning\non our limited train split. An ideal perception model would be able to perform all the tasks in our\nbenchmark. Our results suggest that state-of-the-art zero-shot or few-shot video-language models\nare not able to outperform a dummy frequency-based baseline, whereas humans in the same setting\nare nearly perfect. We discuss limitations, and ethical and societal aspects in the appendix. We hope\nthat our work will contribute to understanding models\u2019 limitations (through direct evaluation and\ninterpretability analysis supported by the different types of annotations) and narrowing down areas of\nimprovement to guide research towards general perception models.\n10\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Luis Piloto, Kenneth Marino, Luyu Wang, Felix Hill, Martin Chadwick, Lucy\nCampbell-Gillingham, Boxi Wu, Drew Jaegle, Pauline Luc, Marianne Monteiro, Anna Bulanova,\nRadu Isac, Muqthar Mohammad, Vijay Vibha Tumala, Mahesh Maddinala, Yiwen Luo, Alina\nKuznetsova, Aida Nematzadeh, Lisa Anne Hendricks, Aishwarya Agrawal, Nando de Freitas, Matt\nBotvinick, Shane Legg, and Relja Arandjelovic for providing insightful input on this project.\nReferences\n[1] A.

In some cases (\u2248 20%) where the object is entering\nthe field of view at the beginning or during the video, the first box may span only a few pixels, so it\ndoes not contain a representative view of the object. To deal with this problem, we use a heuristic\nto select a later frame, when the object is not touching the image boundary, to identify the query\nbox for each object track. Performance is evaluated using the standard average intersection-over-\nunion (IoU) metric, (also called average overlap), for evaluating long-term tracking without tracker\nre-initialization. It is defined as the average IoU over the entire track between the predicted and the\nground-truth boxes [32, 10]. We also provide code for more fine-grained analysis, e.g. performance\non objects in videos shot with static vs. moving cameras, objects involved in actions etc.\nCups-game subset: For the occluded object involved in cups-games, we use intersection as a metric\nfor tracking (as opposed to Intersection-over-Union), to deal with the uncertainty of the position\nwhen the object is occluded.\nSingle point tracking: In this task, given a set of ground truth initial 2D point coordinates, the model\nshould separately trace their spatial trajectories throughout the video. Performance is evaluated using\nthe recently proposed average Jaccard metric for evaluating both long-term point tracking position\nand occlusion accuracy. This metric checks how similar the predicted and the ground-truth point\ntracks are, based on the average number of true positive matches, divided by the sum of true positives,\nfalse positives, and false negatives over the entire track [30, 19].\nTemporal action / sound localisation: We define these two tasks similarly, as temporal segment\ndetection problems. Given a video, the model predicts potentially overlapping temporal 1d-segment\ncovering the actions/sounds and classifies them using a fixed set of labels. Performance is evaluated\nusing the standard mean AP over classes [57] based on temporal IoU between predicted and ground\ntruth temporal segments.\n1\nFigure A1: Frequency of objects and log-scale frequency of actions in the Perception Test.\nMultiple-choice video question-answering: In this task, the model receives, in parallel with the\nvideo, a question and three possible answers, out of which only one is correct, and the model has\nto pick one answer (33% random chance). For most of the questions, watching the video and\nreading the question are enough for providing a correct answer. A limited number of questions are\nformulated in a generic way, so the options are necessary for choosing the answer: e.g. Which of the\n2\nFigure A2: Log-scale frequency of sounds in the Perception Test.\nFigure A3: Number of multiple-choice video question-answers in the Perception Test across skills in\nthe four skill areas: Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics. One skill can be assigned to multiple\nskill areas\u2014here we choose one as the prime area for each skill.\nfollowing statements describes the scene better?. In some cases, choosing the answer by elimination\nof the false options may be simpler. Performance is evaluated by measuring top-1 accuracy. For\na couple of scripts, the videos must be trimmed to not reveal the answer: in the cups-games and\nstable configurations videos, we provide a frame id where the video should be trimmed. For the train\nand validation splits we release the entire videos together with the cut frame id information. In the\nheld-out test split, only the trimmed videos are available for these particular video types.\nGrounded video question-answering: This task is similar to conditional multiple-object tracking,\nwith the conditioning given as a language task or question as opposed to a class label [38]. The\nanswers are object tracks defined throughout the video and we use HOTA [40] metrics to evaluate\nperformance. In some situations, the initial parts of the track might not be relevant for the question,\ne.g. Track the object that was removed from the table and the object is removed halfway through the\nvideo. However, given that we do not enforce causal processing of the video, the track prediction for\nthe initial part can still be done in hindsight.\n4\nBaseline results\nObject tracking: We report baseline results using the SiamFC model [8] (UniTrack [50] imple-\nmentation). SiamFC was chosen due to its high-performance on a number of single-object tracking\nbenchmarks when running in zero-shot setting [21]. We also include a static dummy baseline that\n3\nassumes all objects are static, so it just replicates throughout the video the box-to-track received as\ninput. The results for the different categories of objects (involved in actions or in sounds, etc) are\nincluded in Table A3, aggregated based on camera motion.\nObject Tracking\nAll\nStatic camera\nMoving camera\nall objects\n0.66 / 0.67\n0.70 / 0.69\n0.42 / 0.54\naction objects\n0.48 / 0.53\n0.50 / 0.54\n0.31 / 0.47\nsound objects\n0.56 / 0.60\n0.58 / 0.61\n0.40 / 0.53\ng-vQA boxes\n0.38 / 0.50\n0.43 / 0.51\n0.26 / 0.47\nTable A3: Static dummy baseline / SiamFC results, measured as average IoU, across different\ncategories of objects in the Perception Test. Since many objects are static, the performance of the\ndummy baseline is good overall, but it degrades considerably when motion is involved, whereas the\nSiamFC tracker is more robust.\nPoint tracking: We report baseline results using a TAP-Net model [19] trained on Kubric [30] and\ntransferred zero-shot. The model operates on 256x256 resolution (aspect ratio is not preserved)\nand consumes the whole video directly. We also include a static dummy baseline assuming all\nfuture points are visible and never change the location. Table A4 shows the results. As expected,\nboth moving points and points seen through a moving camera are considerably harder to track.\nFollowing [19], we use three evaluation metrics. (1) Position Accuracy (< \u03b4x): for a given threshold\n\u03b4, we measure the fraction of points that are within the threshold of their ground truth, for frames\nwhere points are visible. For all predictions, we resize them to 256x256 resolution and measure < \u03b4x\nacross 5 thresholds: 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 pixels. (2) Occlusion Accuracy (OA): a simple classification\naccuracy for the point occlusion prediction on each frame. (3) Jaccard at \u03b4: an evaluation metric\nconsidering both occlusion and position accuracy. It is the fraction of \u2018true positives\u2019, i.e., points\nwithin the threshold of any visible ground truth points, divided by \u2018true positives\u2019 plus \u2018false positives\u2019\n(points that are predicted visible, but the ground truth is either occluded or farther than the threshold)\nplus \u2018false negatives\u2019 (groundtruth visible points that are predicted as occluded or the prediction\nis farther than the threshold). Our final metric Average Jaccard (AJ) averages Jaccard across all 5\nthresholds: 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 pixels.\nTo further understand the performance, we split points into two groups: static and moving. Note\nthat there are no static points in the moving camera scenario, all points are moving. In static camera,\nwe determine that a point is moving if its distance between start frame and end frame is more than\n0.01 in the normalized image coordinate system. As expected, the dummy baseline performs well on\nstatic points, reaching 0.722 average jaccard. But TAP-Net significantly outperforms when points are\nmoving, particularly in the moving camera setup, improving average Jaccard from 0.088 to 0.328.\nBesides AJ, TAP-Net significantly improves the static baseline on occlusion accuracy from 0.675 to\n0.849. One interesting observation is that on both position accuracy (< \u03b4x) and jaccard at \u03b4, TAP-Net\nstarts to outperform static baseline only when measured above 4 pixel threshold. This is because\nhuman annotations still contain small localization errors and 4 pixel threshold is more reliable than 1\nor 2 pixel threshold for measuring under 256x256 resolution.\nTemporal action localisation: We obtained baseline results for temporal action localisation using\nActionFormer [57] with different pretrained features: TSP video features from [5] extracted using a\nResnet(2+1)D-34 model pre-trained on ActivityNet, MMV audio features from [2] extracted using\nan S3D model pre-trained on AudioSet, and a multimodal input by concatenating the video and\naudio features. The video features have 512-dim and an effective stride of 32 (corresponding roughly\nto one feature per second): every other input frame is skipped and the model performs a temporal\ndownsampling of 16. The audio features are extracted using a window length of 960ms, window\nstride 16000. The input audio is downsampled from 48khz to 16khz (keeping every third sample).\nThis results in roughly 2 features per second, each of dimension 256. When using multimodal inputs,\nthe video features are tiled over time (factor 2) to align them with the audio features.\nWe trained the transformer blocks and the classification and regression heads to accommodate for\nthe number of classes included in our dataset. The resulting mean average precision is included in\nTable A5, top. The baseline struggles mostly with rare action classes and pretend actions, which are\nconfused with their non-pretend counterpart class. Using only the audio modality leads to very poor\nperformance, whereas using multimodal inputs does not increase the performance significantly.\n4\nPoint tracking\nAll points\nstatic points\nstatic camera\nmoving points\nstatic camera\nmoving points\nmoving camera\nstatic baseline\n0.361\n0.722\n0.373\n0.088\nTAP-Net [19]\n0.401\n0.496\n0.399\n0.328\nPoint tracking\nOA\n< \u03b40\n< \u03b41\n< \u03b42\n< \u03b43\n< \u03b44\nstatic baseline\n0.675\n0.395\n0.512\n0.601\n0.695\n0.784\nTAP-Net [19]\n0.849\n0.055\n0.214\n0.687\n0.927\n0.956\nPoint tracking\nJac. \u03b40\nJac. \u03b41\nJac. \u03b42\nJac. \u03b43\nJac. \u03b44\nstatic baseline\n0.217\n0.301\n0.364\n0.429\n0.495\nTAP-Net [19]\n0.025\n0.104\n0.442\n0.699\n0.734\nTable A4: Static baseline vs TAP-Net results on the validation set.

It can\nbe observed that the less frequent actions are often confused with more frequent ones and the model\nalso confuses pretend actions with their non-pretend versions, e.g. ironing something vs pretending\nto iron something or writing or drawing something vs pretending to write or draw.\nTemporal Action Localisation\nModel\nModality\n@0.1\n@0.2\n@0.3\n@0.4\n@0.5\nAvg\n# epochs\nActionFormer\nvideo\n17.67\n16.56\n15.13\n13.28\n11.07\n14.74\n35\nActionFormer\naudio\n7.25\n6.53\n5.70\n4.67\n3.64\n5.56\n55\nActionFormer\nvideo+audio\n18.82\n17.63\n15.98\n13.99\n11.37\n15.56\n35\nTemporal Sound Localisation\nModel\nModality\n@0.1\n@0.2\n@0.3\n@0.4\n@0.5\nAvg\n# epochs\nActionFormer\nvideo\n17.85\n15.54\n13.81\n12.11\n5.89\n13.04\n55\nActionFormer\naudio\n16.28\n13.58\n10.80\n8.43\n5.87\n10.99\n80\nActionFormer\nvideo+audio\n22.24\n18.99\n15.36\n11.99\n8.74\n15.46\n55\nTable A5: Mean average precision (mAP) for temporal action localisation (top) and sound localisa-\ntion (bottom) tasks using ActionFormer as baseline. IoU for 0.1-0.5 are averaged as in [15]. # epochs\nrepresents the number of training epochs used to obtain the best results for each experiment setup.\nTemporal sound localisation: We use the same model architecture and pre-trained features as above.\nWe trained from scratch the transformer blocks and the classification and regression heads. For\nboth training and evaluation, we keep only 11 sound classes, excluding the classes corresponding\nto indistinguishable sounds (e.g. Other:background, Other:human), as they hinder learning. The\nresulting mean average precision is included in Table A5, bottom. The best performance is obtained\nwhen features from both modalities are used as input.\nMultiple-choice videoQA: For this task, we provide results for two strong recent video language\nmodels: Flamingo [3] in zero-shot and few-shot setups, and Sevila [55] in zero-shot and fine-tuned\nregimes. We also include a dummy frequency-based baseline and a human baseline; see Table A6,\nFigure 2 and A5.\nFrequency baseline. Given that we have a fixed set of question-answer pairs defined over multiple\nvideos, we define a simple baseline that computes how frequently each of the three options is the\ncorrect answer in the training set, and keeps the most frequent one. This baseline obtains 55.1%. One\ncan also compute this baseline on a random subset of training examples for each question type, see\nTable A6. This is a fairer dummy baseline for models using few-shot evaluation. Note that the dummy\nrandom baseline is equivalent to a 0-shot frequency baseline. The fact that the 8-shot performance\nof this dummy frequency baseline is above the 0-shot (random) baseline performance indicates an\nimbalance between the frequencies of correct answers across options in the dataset. This happens\nmostly because a number of questions in the dataset are binary in nature (e.g. Is the camera moving\nor static?), but a third option was added to comply with the 3-options-per-question setting; so in this\n5\nFigure A4: Confusion matrix for ActionFormer predictions on the action localisation task. To be\nconsidered as a prediction for a certain segment, the model\u2019s confidence has to be above 0.1 and IoU\nthreshold between the prediction and ground truth above 0.1. Ground truth actions are listed on the\ny-axis, sorted by their frequency; entries are normalised by rows. The less frequent actions are often\nconfused with more frequent actions. The model also confuses pretend actions with their non-pretend\nversions, e.g. ironing something vs pretending to iron something or writing or drawing something vs\npretending to write or draw.\ncase the possible options are: (1) moving, (2) static or slightly shaking, (3) I don\u2019t know, but the third\noption is never or very rarely the correct one, bringing the performance of this dummy frequency\nbaseline slightly above 50%.\nFlamingo. We run the model with a maximum of 30 frames sampled at 1fps, spatial resolution 320.\nWhen the videos are longer than 30 seconds, we use only the middle clip. The audio modality is\nignored as the original model was not trained to deal with it. The different options are scored based\non likelihood. We considered zero-shot and 8-shot settings; see results in Table A6. In the zero-shot\nsetting, the smaller version of the model obtains 43.6% on the test set. In the 8-shot setting, we\nsample 8 examples and associated ground truth responses from each question in the training set and\nuse as prompts. The resulting accuracy is 45.8%, again obtained by the smaller version of the model.\nThe performance per skills is detailed in A5\nSeViLA. We run zero-shot and fine-tuned evaluation for the SeViLA model using the scripts provided\nby the authors [55]. SeViLA has a Localizer and an Answerer module. It starts by sampling uniformly\n32 frames from the video, out of which 4 frames are designated by the Localizer as keyframes that\nthe Answerer uses for the final prediction. When fine-tuning, we update the weights of both the\nLocalizer and Answerer modules using the training set from the Perception Test. Fine-tuning improves\n6\nFigure A5: Performance on the validation set across skills for the 8-shot Flamingo-3B compared to\n8-shot dummy frequency baseline.

We measure the performance\nof this baseline using HOTA metrics, which integrate detection, association, and localisation scores.\nAs expected, the performance of this baseline is poor; see Table A7 and Figure A6. The failures\nare caused mainly by poor detection results \u2013 since the tasks are temporal in nature, extracting seed\nboxes from the middle frame is not sufficient to solve the tasks.\nModel\nHOTA\nLocA\nDetA\nAssA\nMDETR+Stark\n0.1\n0.68\n0.03\n0.33\nTable A7: HOTA results on the validation split for the grounded vQA task in the Perception Test.\nModel size is an essential aspect that impacts real-world applications.

These splits were generated by respecting\ntwo constraints: (1) all videos from each unique combination of (script_id, participant_id)\nare kept in the same split; more specifically, each script was filmed by a given participant possibly\nwith multiple camera configurations, e.g. from different viewpoints, or both with static and moving\ncameras. The above constraint ensures that all such variations of a script shot by a participant belong\nin the same split to avoid any leakage of video content across splits, and (2) various video attributes\n(camera motion, indoor vs. outdoor) and annotations are divided in the same proportion across splits,\ne.g. each split will have approximately the above specified fraction of videos with moving camera, or\n7\nModel\nTask\n# params\nSiamFC\nobject tracking\n25.6M\nTAP-Net\npoint tracking\n2.8M\nActionFormer-action\ntemporal action localisation\n27.0M\nActionFormer-sound\ntemporal sound localisation\n26.5M\nFlamingo\nmultiple-choice videoQA\n3B\nSeViLA\nmultiple-choice videoQA\n4.1B\nMDETR+Stark\ngrounded videoQA\n209M\nTable A8: Number of parameters of models evaluated on our benchmark.\nFigure A6: HOTA metrics for MDETR+Stark tracker baseline on the validation split of the Perception\nTest.\nwith point annotations. In particular, each question in the multiple-choice and grounded video QA\ntasks applies to a number of videos; this constraint ensures that these videos are distributed across\nsplits in the specified proportion, such that all questions are present in all the splits.\nThe above was executed by setting up a linear program with a binary decision variable for each\nunique (script_id, participant_id) pair indicating which of the two splits it should be assigned\nto, denoted collectively x\u2208{0, 1}n with n being the number of such unique pairs. Note for splitting\ninto three splits, the problem is solved twice sequentially. A feature count matrix A\u2208Rn\u00d7d was\nconstructed, with Aji being the number of videos shot by the jth (script_id, participant_id)\nhaving the ith video-attribute (d being the total number of video attributes). An \u201cattribute\u201d indicating\nthe total number of videos with a given (script_id, participant_id) was also included to enforce\nthe number of videos in each split. The following linear program was solved using the CVXPY\ninterface to the MOSEK mixed-integer solver.\nmin\nx\n\"\u0010\nmax\ni\n(1 \u2212 ti)2\u0011\n+ 1\nd\nd\nX\ni=1\n(1 \u2212 ti)2\n#\ns.t.,\nti =\nAT\ni x\n\u2308f1AT\ni 1\u2309, \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , d}\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u2264 ti \u2264 (1 + \u03bb), \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , d}\nand,\nxj \u2208 {0, 1}, \u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\nwith Ai being the ith column of A, f1 \u2208 [0, 1] being the target fraction for the split corresponding to\nlabel xj = 1 (e.g. f1 = 0.5 for a 50% test split), and \u03bb = 0.25 is the maximum allowed fractional\ndeviation from the target value. There were n = 7288 unique (script_id, participant_id) pairs,\nand d = 249 video attributes.\n8\n6\nAnnotation collection\nRaters instructions: We include below the high-level instructions provided to raters when collecting\nthe different types of annotations.\nObject tracks: Annotate, using spatio-temporal bounding box tracks, all the objects that the person\ninteracts with. Annotate also the objects in the immediate vicinity of the objects that the person\ninteracts with, as they act as distractor objects. In addition, annotate 3-5 objects in the background.\nOnce you mark an object in a frame, the tracker running in the background will generate proposals\nfor that object throughout the video. Please check every 30th frame and amend the proposals if they\nare not correct. For each object track, provide a representative name including object class, object\nattributes, e.g. red mug. As much as possible, include annotations for liquids as well. When objects\nget torn (e.g. a salad leave, a piece of paper) or are broken (e.g. eggs), the object tracks and names\nshould reflect the change in object state: e.g. a single object track named \"egg\" would be split into\nmultiple object tracks named \"egg-shells\" and \"egg-content\" once the person breaks the egg. For\nobjects that go out of the field of view and reappear later on, make sure to assign the same object\ntrack.\nPoint tracks: Given a video with an inpainted box track, select and track at least 3 points inside the\nobject, belonging to different parts of the object. Mark the start and end points of the track, then wait\nfor the optical flow estimator running in the background to provide predictions for the intermediate\nframes. Check and correct any errors you notice on all the intermediate frames. Assign names to\neach point corresponding to the semantic part to which the point belongs to. When a point becomes\noccluded (because of object rotation or object going out of the field of view), mark the point as\noccluded.\nAction segments: Given the list of templated action labels (e.g. putting something into something),\nmark the start and end points of each action segment. As action boundaries, please use the moments\nof contact with the objects involved in the action, e.g. when a person stirs a tea with a spoon, mark\nas start moment the moment when the person picks up the spoon, and as end moment the moment\nwhen the person stops stirring or puts down the spoon. In addition to indicating the action boundaries,\nselect from the existing object tracks the tracks involved in the action segment, in the order in which\nthey appear in the template, e.g. when a person pours water from a kettle into a cup, mark the segment\nas pouring something from something into something, and indicate water, kettle, cup as relevant\nobjects, in this order. If the person repeats the same action multiple times (e.g. clapping hands), mark\nseparate segments as much as possible.\nSound segments: Given the list of sound labels (e.g. clapping hands, hitting something), mark the\nstart and end points of each sound segment. In addition, select from the existing object tracks the\ntracks involved in producing the sound, e.g. when the person drops a cable on a table, mark the sound\nas hitting something, and select cable, table as objects involved in producing the sound.\nMultiple-choice videoQA: Phase 1 (open-ended questions): Answer the following questions about\nthis video using short sentences written in English. Phase 2 (multiple-choice questions): Answer the\nfollowing questions about this video by selecting the correct answers from the given ones. Only one\noption is correct for each question.\nGrounded videoQA: The answers to questions were generated automatically from the object tracks\nannotations above, using simple heuristics. These annotations were then checked by human raters\nwith the instruction: Given the question or query below and the video with one or more inpainted\nobject tracks, indicate (yes/no) if the inpainted objects correctly answer the question.\nData collection pipelines: The different types of annotations were collected using two different\napproaches:\n1. sequential pipeline for the object and point tracks, action and sound segments: (i) a rater\nannotates a video for a given task, (ii) a second rater checks the annotation, makes any\nnecessary corrections, then marks the annotation as complete; (iii) a third rater checks if the\nannotation is indeed complete or it needs additional changes, in which case they will send\nthe video back to step (ii) to be reviewed by a different rater. For difficult tasks like point\ntracking or object tracking with hard occlusions, we did multiple annotation cleaning rounds,\neach time with specific cleaning guidelines. For example, for the videos in cups-games\ncategory mentioned above, in one cleaning round, the raters were asked to pay attention to\n9\nthe hidden object, or for videos where the person shows objects to the camera sometimes\nrepeating the same object, we asked raters to pay attention to assign the same object ID when\nthe object reappears. Having videos grouped by script type helped in designing specific\ncleaning guidelines to ensure good annotation quality.\n2. parallel pipeline for multiple-choice and grounded videoQA: multiple raters answer in\nparallel the same question for the same video and the option chosen by the majority of\nraters is kept as final answer. Note that for multiple choice QA, during annotation collection,\nthe raters were presented with more than 3 options in some cases. For the final dataset, as\nthe goal was to have the same number of options for all the questions, we chose to keep 3\noptions to accommodate binary questions as well (where the options used are: Yes, No, I\ndon\u2019t know). For questions with more than 5 options, the negative options were sampled\nbased on their frequency as correct options for videos in the same script type. Finally, for\nsome generic questions, e.g. Which statement describes the scene better?, the answers\nwere collected initially in open-language format, and then negatives were sampled using the\nanswers from other videos in the same script type, with additional checks from the research\nteam to avoid ambiguous distractors.\nAs a sanity check, for the action and sound annotations, we checked for overlapping objects involved\nin both action and sounds (see Figure A7). We observed strong correlations across pairs of action-\nsound, indicating consistent annotations across modalities, e.g. the Pouring something into something\naction shares the same objects with the Interaction: Fluid sound, the Clapping hands action co-occurs\nwith the Human (clapping) sound, the Lifting something and putting it back down action co-occurs\nwith the Object: Hitting sound, Moving something around actions co-occurs with Object: Rolling\nsound, and so on.\n7\nCompensation\nBesides the research team creating the benchmark, we relied on three groups of contributors: par-\nticipants filming the videos, raters annotating the videos, and human participants involved in the\nhuman baseline collected for the multiple-choice vQA task. The full details of our study design,\nincluding compensation rates, were reviewed by DeepMind\u2019s independent ethical review committee.\nAll participants provided informed consent prior to completing tasks and were reimbursed for their\ntime. The policy ensures that workers/participants are paid at least the living wage for their location.\n8\nDiversity of participants involved in filming\nWe consider that good representation of the world\u2019s population in terms of different demographics\nis an essential aspect in benchmarking multimodal models, to ensure a safe and fair deployment of\nsuch models world-wide. When building our benchmark, we considered three diversity aspects for\nthe participants involved in filming: gender, ethnicity, and country of residence. These factors offer\nvisual diversity in the dataset in terms of appearance of people and scenes. We acknowledge that this\nis not a complete coverage of diversity factors, and other aspects such as age, disability, household\nincome, or level of education are important to control, and we hope to be able to include such factors\nin future iterations of the benchmark.\nWe include in Table A9 and Figure A8 the self-reported demographics along these axes. Note that all\nthe demographic information was self-reported by the participants themselves. It can be observed\nthat there is a good balance across gender and good spread across ethnicity (providing diversity in\nterms of skin-tone). Filming the videos in more than 13 countries on different continents provides\ngood scene and objects variation.\n9\nLimitations and potential negative societal impact\nLimitations: We designed video scripts and questions to have a broad coverage of perception skills\nand types of reasoning, across different modalities (video, audio, text), probed through high-level\nand low-level computational tasks. Given the broad coverage, it was challenging to have a perfect\nbalance across all dimensions. As future work, we aim to add more tasks that require counterfactual\n10\nFigure A7: Correlation between action and sound temporal annotations in the Perception Test.\nreasoning or memory skills, and more annotations for grounded vQA and point tracking. In addition,\nthe balance across options in the multiple-choice videoQA is not perfect, as indicated by the fact that\nthe frequency dummy baseline obtains better performance compared to the pure random baseline\n(55.1% vs 33.3%). When analysing model performance, we need to take such biases into account.\nOur benchmark aims to comprehensively evaluate multimodal models\u2019 performance across different\nperception skills. However, some modalities are missing, e.g. touch, or some aspects are not covered\nby the available annotations, e.g. force, deformations, detailed 3D geometry. We will work to\nimprove the coverage in future iterations, and we also welcome contributions from the community\nto add more tasks, modalities, even new languages to the Perception Test. Note, however, that our\nbenchmark focuses on temporal tasks defined over videos. Many current multimodal models can only\nhandle image and text as modalities, hence it might not be straightforward to evaluate them on our\nbenchmark. We do not consider this to be a limitation of our benchmark, but a limitation of those\nmodels, as we believe that general multimodal perception models need to be able to perceive and\nreason over spatial and temporal dimensions, across modalities.\nAs mentioned in the main paper, most of the videos were filmed on a table-top, using common\nhousehold objects, following the scripts designed by our research team. This could be perceived as\na setup with limited diversity when compared to \u201cin the wild\u201d videos available in repositories like\nYoutube. However, we argue that for evaluating a general perception model, it is important to isolate\nthe skills and types of reasoning we care about, while building in invariance to lighting, camera angle,\ntypes of objects, the person\u2019s skin tone, etc \u2013 these are obtained by filming the same script (with\nmultiple variations) with 20+ different participants per script variation, who choose on their own\n11\nGender\n%\nMale\n46.40\nFemale, Other\n53.60\nEthnicity\n%\nWhite or Caucasian\n28.97\nSouth and East Asian\n25.49\nBlack or African American\n21.68\nLatino or Hispanic\n9.25\nMixed\n3.94\nMiddle Eastern\n3.37\nOther\n7.30\nCountry\n%\nPhilippines\n31.38\nBrazil\n11.27\nKenya\n10.02\nIndonesia\n8.75\nItaly\n8.03\nRomania\n7.57\nSouth Africa\n5.25\nTurkey\n4.12\nIndia\n3.72\nMexico\n1.45\nBulgaria\n1.37\nUnited States\n0.70\nEgypt\n0.48\nOther\n5.87\nTable A9: Self-reported demographics (Gender, Ethnicity, Country) of participants involved in\nfilming.\nFigure A8: Geolocation of participants involved in filming.\nwhere to place the camera, what exact type of object to use for a certain action, in what order to\nperform some actions, etc. Curating videos in the wild to obtain the same coverage of skills and types\nof reasoning would be hard, even impossible, since some types of data simply don\u2019t exist online in\nsufficient numbers (e.g. correct vs. incorrect execution of actions).\nWhile filming, we instructed participants to use 2 different viewpoints to obtain more diverse camera\nangles. However, this information is not explicitly used at the moment in our tasks (we only used\nthis information when deciding the splits, to make sure these paired videos fall in the same split).\nWhile some participants filmed simultaneously with two cameras, others recorded two runs one after\nthe other. This approach was previously used in crowd-sourced datasets (e.g. Charades-Ego dataset).\nThrough manual inspection, we note that the variations are minor as the sequences were recorded one\nafter the other. Such paired videos could be useful to design new tasks.\nRelated to missing capabilities, our benchmark cannot accommodate active perception evaluation.\nEnabling interaction would limit us to simulated environments. To still address the agency aspect\nto some extent, we included videos where the model is required to recognise correct and incorrect\nexecution of certain actions (e.g. tying shoe laces, buttoning up a shirt, covering a container with a\ncover, pouring water in a glass) or to assess the consequences of actions (e.g. what would happen if\nwe remove a certain object from the table) \u2013 these are possible because our scripts include multiple\nvariations with correct/incorrect actions, or controlled variations of object configurations, which\nwould be impossible to curate from public repositories like Youtube.\n12\nAs mentioned in the main paper, our benchmark is medium scale, comparable to Charades, but an\norder of magnitude smaller compared to e.g. Ego4D. We would like to emphasise that this is not\na limitation of the benchmark since our focus is on evaluation; large-scale datasets are needed for\ntraining. We provide a medium-scale dataset with a small set for fine-tuning / prompting, and the\nrest for evaluation, as in this way we can probe the generalisation power of multimodal (pre-trained)\nmodels.\nSocietal impact: Benchmarks such as ours guide research and, indirectly, lead to improvement in\nmodels\u2019 capabilities. These models can be used for many different applications that have positive\nsocietal impact, e.g. video-language models assisting the visually-impaired, or surveillance systems\nfor the elderly or children. However, similar systems can be used to cause harm (e.g. intrusive\nsurveillance systems). We hereby state our strong stance against the use of our benchmark for\nevaluating and improving such systems.\n13\n"

In this work,\nwe propose a novel alignment learning frame-\nwork with synthetic feedback not dependent\non extensive human annotations and propri-\netary LLMs. First, we perform reward model-\ning (RM) with synthetic feedback by contrast-\ning responses from vanilla LLMs with various\nsizes and prompts. Then, we use the RM to\nsimulate high-quality demonstrations to train\na supervised policy and further optimize the\nmodel with reinforcement learning. Our re-\nsulting model, Aligned Language Model with\nSynthetic Training dataset (ALMoST), outper-\nforms recent open-sourced models, which are\ntrained on the outputs of InstructGPT or human-\nannotated demonstrations, in alignment bench-\nmarks.\nIn human evaluation, our model is\npreferred to Alpaca and Dolly-v2, 55.0% and\n58.5% of the time, respectively. Further analy-\nses demonstrate the efficacy and importance of\nsynthetic feedback in our framework 1.\n1\nIntroduction\nAlignment learning has been an essential learning\nscheme to align the behaviors of large language\nmodels (LLMs) with human values like safety and\ntruthfulness while following the intention of users\naccurately (Ouyang et al., 2022). Vanilla LLMs \u2013\nthose not aligned yet \u2013 could misunderstand user\nintentions or produce unsafe and inaccurate re-\nsponses. Desirable human values such as help-\nfulness, harmlessness, or honesty can be defined,\nand human demonstrations with these values are\nthen used for the alignment learning (Askell et al.,\n2021; Bai et al., 2022a).\n1The code is available at github.com/naver-ai/almost.\n\u0012\n\u0001(FOFSBUF\u0001TZOUIFUJD\u0001DPNQBSJTPOT\n\u0014\u0011#\n\u0012\u0014#\n\u0018#\n\u0012#\n\u0011\n\u0012\u0011\n1SPNQU\u001b\n8IBU\u0001XPVME\u0001CF\u0001UIF\u0001DPOTFRVFODFT\u0001PG\u0001VTJOH\u0001B\u0001\nQVCMJD\u00018J\u000e'J\u0001OFUXPSL \n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u0016\u000eTIPU\n\u0014\u000eTIPU\n\u0012\u000eTIPU\n\u0011\u000eTIPU\n\u0013\n\u0001'JMUFSJOH\u0001OPJTFT\u0001XJUI\u0001QPTU\u0001WBMJEBUJPO\n3VMF\u0001PG\u00015IVNC\u001b\n\u0003-BSHFS\u0001--.\u0001XJUI\u0001.PSF\u0001BOE\u0001#FUUFS\u0001TIPUT\u0001\nNJHIU\u0001HJWF\u0001CFUUFS\u0001SFTQPOTF\u0001PWFSBMM\u000f\u0003\n\u0014\n\u00015SBJOJOH\u0001B\u00013FXBSE\u0001.PEFM\u0001PO\u0001UIF\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001TZOUIFUJD\u0001DPNQBSJTPOT\nFigure 1: A procedure of reward modeling through\nsynthetic feedback. We assume that the response from a\nlarger LLM with more and better demonstrations might\nbe better overall. We train a reward model with synthetic\ncomparisons generated top on the assumption.\nTypically, alignment learning consists of three\nstages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward mod-\neling (RM), and reinforcement learning from hu-\nman feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai\net al., 2022a).\nHowever, the three-stage training recipe requires\nsignificant human effort, especially in the first two\nstages. More specifically, both the SFT and RM\ntraining stages must be provided with an abundance\nof high-quality human demonstrations and ranking\ndatasets for obtaining models to facilitate RLHF.\nFor instance, Ouyang et al. (2022) prepare and\nutilize 13k human demonstrations and 33k compar-\nisons.\nOn the other hand, Self-Instruct (Wang et al.,\narXiv:2305.13735v2  [cs.CL]  21 Oct 2023\n2022) attempts to generate synthetic self-generated\ninstruction datasets using in-context learning with\na few seed demonstrations. Meanwhile, the release\nof LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) brings upon many\nopen-sourced aligned LLMs trained on the outputs\nof proprietary LLMs or human-annotated instruc-\ntions. However, it still heavily depends on propri-\netary LLM APIs such as InstructGPT and Chat-\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Taori\net al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023) or intensive human\nannotations (DataBricks, 2023; K\u00f6pf et al., 2023).\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework\nfor alignment learning that only requires minimal\nhuman labor and is not dependent on proprietary\nLLMs. Unlike the conventional alignment learning\nprocedure that collects demonstration first (Ouyang\net al., 2022), we first develop a reward model (RM)\non a synthetic comparison dataset constructed by\ncontrasting outputs from vanilla LLMs in vari-\nous configurations, as shown in Figure 1. The\nrules of generating these synthetic ranking data\noriginate from our hypothesis that the responses\ngenerated by larger, optimally prompted models\nare superior to those produced by smaller, inade-\nquately prompted models, as reported by previous\nwork (Askell et al., 2021). Then, we introduce a\nReward-Model-guided Self-Play (RMSP) to sim-\nulate high-quality demonstrations with rejection\nsampling using the RM (Ouyang et al., 2022). We\ntrain LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) on the syn-\nthetic demonstrations (SFT) and further optimize\nthe model with rewards from the synthetic RM,\nnamely, Reinforcement Learning from Synthetic\nFeedback (RLSF).\nOur Aligned Language Model with Synthetic\nTraining dataset (ALMoST) outperforms Al-\npaca (Taori et al., 2023) \u2013 distilled from In-\nstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) \u2013 and Dolly-\nv2 (DataBricks, 2023) and OpenAssistant (K\u00f6pf\net al., 2023) that are trained on human-annotated\ndemonstrations in the alignment-related bench-\nmarks (Askell et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021; Chiang\net al., 2023). Notably, our model is preferred to\nrecent open-sourced models, Alpaca and Dolly-v2,\n55-58% of the time (winning rate) in human eval-\nuation without distillation from proprietary LLMs\nnor intensive human annotations. We speculate\nthe strong performance of our model is due to the\nempirical indicators of well-aligned behaviors that\nhave been effectively incorporated into a strong\nbackbone model through synthetic feedback, allow-\ning the inherent capability to self-align to elicit and\npartially replace the need for human feedback.\nOur main contributions are three folds:\n\u2022 We propose a novel alignment learning frame-\nwork by introducing synthetic feedback. It\nautomatically constructs high-quality compar-\nisons and demonstrations without relying on\nhuman feedback and proprietary LLMs.\n\u2022 Our resulting model, ALMoST, shows well-\naligned behaviors with human values in align-\nment benchmarks. In the human study, AL-\nMoST is preferred to Alpaca and Dolly-v2,\nshowing a 55-58% winning rate.\n\u2022 Analysis on RM further demonstrates the ef-\nficacy of synthetic feedback and highlights\nthe importance of injecting empirical priors,\ne.g., our proposed filtering method and faith-\nful prompt design.\n2\nMethod\nIn this section, we will describe detailed procedures\nof our framework as depicted in Figure 2.\n2.1\nStep 1: Reward Modeling with Synthetic\nFeedback\nPrompted Baseline\nAs we do not have aligned\nbaselines available for the comparisons yet, we uti-\nlize HHH (Helpful, Harmless, and Honest) prompt\ndevised by Askell et al.

We first conduct reward\nmodeling with a synthetically generated comparison dataset (synthetic feedback). Step 2. The demonstration dataset\nis generated by simulation with the guidance of the reward model and train supervised policy with the synthetic\ndemonstrations. Step 3. We further optimize the model against the reward model with reinforcement learning.\nFor the same input x, we first sample the re-\nsponses Y\n= {y1, y2, ..., y|Y |} from the mod-\nels with various configurations. Then, we apply\nthe rule to choose the better response among the\ngenerated responses.\nMore specifically, we in-\nvolve {7, 13, 30}B LLMs with {1, 3, 5} shots of\nHHH demonstrations for the comparison. As il-\nlustrated in Figure 1, if we sample responses from\n(1) 30B with 5 shots, (2) 13B with 3 shots, and\n(3) 7B with 1 shot, the ranking becomes y1 >\ny2 > y3 according to our rule of thumb. Then,\nwe can get a set of binarized comparisons, e.g.,\n{(y1, y2), (y2, y3), (y1, y3)}. We denote the former\nas a \u2018chosen\u2019 response (y1) and the latter as a \u2018re-\njected\u2019 response (y2) in a comparison pair (y1, y2).\nPost Validation\nOur assumptions are often\nwrong because of the stochastic nature of the\nprompt-based generation.\nThese noises in the\ndataset make the reward modeling unstable and\ndivergent in the end. Thus, we come up with post\nvalidation method to filter out such noises.\nFirst, we devise Heuristic Filter (HF) based on\nprior knowledge. It discards bad responses contain-\ning or beginning with keywords such as \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d or \u201cwell\u201d. Also, we empirically find that the\nbetter response usually has a longer length than the\nworse one. Especially if the response is short, it\noften tends to be a case of probabilistic generation\nfailure. However, training RM only on compar-\nisons with longer chosen responses would make\nthe resulting model biased by length. Thus, we\napply HF to take comparison pairs whose chosen\nresponse is longer than either the rejected one or\nM \u2212 S/2, where M is the mean, and S is the stan-\ndard deviation of the lengths of Y in the character\nlevel. This length constraint reduces the probability\nthat short-generation would be stochastic genera-\ntion failure by checking whether the length of each\nresponse is in the confidence interval. Furthermore,\nit does not fall into the length bias. Please see\nAppendix B for detailed examples. We will demon-\nstrate the benefits in Section 4.2.\nSecond, we leverage As-is RM for further\ndata filtering. Specifically, we train another RM\nwith a community QA dataset such as StackEx-\nchange (Askell et al., 2021; Beeching et al., 2023).\nOur preliminary study does not find the benefits of\nlarge-scale pre-training for RM discussed in Askell\net al. (2021). Thus, we sample 20k pairs from the\npre-processed StackExchange dataset for our train-\ning 3. We keep the resulting synthetic comparisons\nonly when the As-is RM agrees with the decision.\nReward Modeling\nFinally, we train the reward\nmodel based on the synthetic comparisons de-\nscribed above. We follow the ranked preference\n3huggingface.co/datasets/lvwerra/stack-exchange-paired\nmodeling objective from previous works (Askell\net al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022). The objective is\nto make the reward model r\u03b8 assign a scalar value\nfor the overall quality of a response yj for a given\nquery x comparative to its counterpart baseline re-\nsponse yk. The loss function is defined as follows:\nJ(\u03b8) = \u2212E(x,yj,yk)\u223cDlog(\u03c3(r\u03b8(x, yj)\u2212r\u03b8(x, yk)))\nwhere D is the training set of synthetic com-\nparisons and r\u03b8(x, y) is the reward model\u2019s scalar\noutput indicating the overall response quality y for\nits input x.\nImplementation Details\nWe start by generating\ninitial queries, i.e., a diverse set of input x. In par-\nticular, we adopt the recipe of Self-Instruct (Wang\net al., 2022) to generate 10k initial queries based\non few-shot in-context learning. More details of\nthe query generation are in Appendix C.\nFor response generation,\nwe include five\nprompted models with the below configurations.\n\u2022 A. LLaMA-30B-Faithful-3shot\n\u2022 B. LLaMA-30B-HHH-5shot\n\u2022 C. LLaMA-13B-HHH-3shot\n\u2022 D. LLaMA-7B-HHH-3shot\n\u2022 E. LLaMA-7B-HHH-1shot\nFor each query, we generate five responses\nfrom the models and take rankings, yA > yB >\nyC > yD > yE, reflecting the rule of thumb.\nThe Faithful indicates our manually designed\nprompts consisting of three conversations respond-\ning more faithfully and longer while considering\nthe response format, and the HHH indicates the\nprompts written by Askell et al. (2021). The de-\ntailed examples are in Appendix A. Finally, we\nproduce 13k binarized synthetic comparisons af-\nter post-validation (HF and As-is RM) and train a\nreward model with the synthetic comparisons.\n2.2\nStep 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning\nIn the second step, we propose a Reward-Model-\nguided Self-Play (RMSP) to simulate high-quality\ndemonstrations, i.e., conversations between the\nuser and AI assistant. The simulated demonstra-\ntions are used to supervised fine-tuning for the ini-\ntially aligned policy model (SFT).\nSelf-Play\nThe basic simulation is enabled by\nturn-taking between the user and assistant role\nmodels with corresponding prompts, i.e., self-\nplay.\nWe continue to use the same prompted\nbaseline, LLaMA-30B-Faithful-3shot, for the as-\nsistant role. In addition, we\u2019ve made minor ad-\njustments to the original HHH prompt (Askell\net al., 2021) to suit the user\u2019s role better,\nLLaMA-30B-User-3shot 4.\nStarting from the\ninitial queries generated in the first stage, the\nLLaMA-30B-Faithful-3shot generates responses\nfor the queries. Then, the LLaMA-30B-User-3shot\nfollows up the assistant\u2019s response. The turn-taking\nis continued until the maximum turn T.\nRM-guided Self-Play (RMSP)\nTo ensure a more\naligned response from the assistant, we suggest in-\ncluding the synthetic RM, trained in the first stage,\nin the loop, namely Reward-Model-guided Self-\nPlay (RMSP). In this setup, the assistant model,\nLLaMA-30B-Faithful-3shot, first samples N re-\nsponses for a given conversational context. Then,\nthe RM scores the N responses, and the best-scored\nresponse is chosen as the final response for the\nsimulation, i.e., the RM performs rejection sam-\npling (best-of-N sampling) (Ouyang et al., 2022;\nScheurer et al., 2023). Like the Self-Play, the turn-\ntaking with LLaMA-30B-User-3shot is continued\nuntil the maximum turn. Please see Figure 10 for\nthe examples.\nImplementation Details\nWe generate about 20k\nhigh-quality demonstrations using RMSP. We set\nthe maximum turn to 2 for simplicity, focusing\non the single-turn scenario. The number of rejec-\ntion sampling N is set to 4 considering resource\nconstraints 5. Then, we train LLaMA-7B on the\ngenerated demonstrations, i.e., a supervised pol-\nicy fine-tuning (SFT). More training details are in\nAppendix D.\n2.3\nStep 3: Reinforcement Learning from\nSynthetic Feedback (RLSF)\nIn the last stage, we perform reinforcement learn-\ning from synthetic feedback (RLSF) to further align\nthe SFT model using a reward signal from the\nsynthetic RM. Following previous works (Ouyang\net al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a), we use Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017).\nDuring this stage, a policy \u03c0\u03d5 autoregressively gen-\n4Please see Appendix A for the details of prompts.\n5More details of the synthetic datasets are in Appendix C.\nStatic HHH Alignment\nTruthfulQA\nModel\nBackbone\nDataset by\nHelpful\nHarmless\nHonest\nOther\nAll\nMC1\nDolly-v2\nPythia-12B\nHuman\n67.8\n46.6\n50.7\n62.8\n56.6\n15.2\nOasst-v4\nPythia-12B\nHuman\n59.3\n56.9\n47.5\n69.8\n57.5\n23.3\nVicuna\nLLaMA-13B\nChatGPT\n78.0\n89.7\n70.5\n81.4\n79.6\n63.3\nDolly-v2\nPythia-7B\nHuman\n69.5\n41.4\n45.9\n51.2\n52.0\n24.2\nAlpaca\nLLaMA-7B\nInstructGPT\n71.2\n53.4\n62.3\n65.1\n62.9\n19.5\nVicuna\nLLaMA-7B\nChatGPT\n79.7\n72.4\n70.5\n76.7\n74.7\n52.5\nALMoST (SFT)\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA\n79.7\n56.9\n65.6\n69.8\n67.8\n31.5\nALMoST (PPO)\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA\n81.4\n60.3\n62.3\n72.1\n68.8\n38.0\nALMoST (RM)\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA\n74.6\n67.2\n78.7\n86.0\n76.0\n54.8\nTable 1: Evaluation results of Static HHH alignment and TruthfulQA (Multiple-Choice) (Askell et al., 2021;\nLin et al., 2021).

(2020) proposes that adding an\nestimated KL penalty term between the initial pol-\nicy \u03c1 and the policy \u03c0\u03d5 to r\u03b8(x, y) can enhance\nperformance. This adjustment leads to the final\nobjective as follows:\nEx\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0\u03d5(\u00b7|x)[r\u03b8(x, y) \u2212 \u03bb log\n\u0012\u03c0\u03d5(y|x)\n\u03c1(y|x)\n\u0013\n],\nwhere \u03bb is a KL coefficient.\nImplementation Details\nWe initialize the pol-\nicy \u03c1 with the SFT-tuned LLaMA-7B from Step\n2. Also, the prompts for the PPO training are com-\npiled by extracting only the inputs (initial queries)\nfrom the demonstration dataset generated by RMSP\ndescribed in Section 2.2. More details for PPO\ntraining are in Appendix D.\n3\nEvaluating Alignment of ALMoST\nWe validate our resulting model, Aligned Language\nModel with Synthetic Training dataset (ALMoST),\nin three alignment benchmarks, Static HHH evalu-\nation (Askell et al., 2021), TruthfulQA (Lin et al.,\n2021), and Vicuna Questions (Chiang et al., 2023).\n3.1\nDataset\nStatic HHH alignment and TruthfulQA\nAskell\net al. (2021) introduce Static HHH alignment\nbenchmark to measure how models are aligned\nwell with the human values 6. Similar to the com-\nparison dataset, the model should choose a more\nproper response for input between the two options\nbased on human values. The dataset consists of\nthree human value categories, helpful, harmless,\nand honest, and contains a misc (others) category.\nWe include the dataset to get relationships of ten-\nsion among the human values from the evaluation,\nalthough the entire dataset is just 221. Lin et al.\n(2021) propose TruthfulQA to measure how LLM\ngenerates truthful answers for a given question 7.\nIt especially contains 817 adversarial questions to\nelicit imitative falsehood answers from LLMs. For\nsimplicity, we evaluate the models with a multiple-\nchoice setup (MC1) instead of a generative setup.\nNote that all the evaluation is based on zero-shot,\nwhich means we do not fine-tune the target dataset.\nPlease see Appendix I for more details of the eval-\nuation prompt.\nVicuna Questions\nWe test our models using Vi-\ncuna evaluation questions (Chiang et al., 2023). It\nconsists of 80 questions on various topics spanning\ngeneral QA, writing, reasoning, etc., to identify\nuser preference 8.

Then, we\nconduct human A/B tests to choose a preferred an-\nswer between answers from the two models. In\nparticular, we recruit three workers for each test.\nWe ask the workers to choose the more helpful,\nharmless, and honest answer with careful consider-\nation over the contents in the answers (Askell et al.,\n2021). Please see Appendix E.1 for more details of\nthe human evaluation. In addition, we conduct an\nautomatic evaluation using GPT-4. In the test, GPT-\n4 assesses the two answers by giving a 1-10 scalar\nscore for the corresponding answer and providing\nappropriate explanations for the judgment (OpenAI,\n2023). Even though it is not a rigorous evaluation,\nwe can compare the overall responding qualities\nof the models with reasonable costs. Considering\nthe positional bias of the GPT-4 assessment 9, we\nevaluate the same instance twice by reversing the\norder of the two answers.\n3.2\nBaselines\nWe include recent open-sourced models to com-\npare the aligned behaviors of the LLMs according\nto their backbone model and training dataset. Al-\npaca is the first open-sourced instruction-following\nmodel based on LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023;\nTaori et al., 2023). It is trained on the 52k syn-\nthetic instructions dataset generated by the pro-\nprietary LLM, InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022).\nSimilarly, Vicuna is trained on 70k ShareGPT\ndataset, which is the shared chatting logs between\nusers with the ChatGPT, one of the powerfully\naligned models (OpenAI, 2023; Chiang et al.,\n2023). Dolly-v2 is another open-sourced model\ntrained on a 15k human-annotated instructions\n9This repo notices that the GPT-4 evaluation has a strong\npositional bias in favor of the first response.\ndataset (DataBricks, 2023). It is based on Pythia,\nanother open-source LLM (Biderman et al., 2023).\nOpenAssistant (Oasst) is an open-source project\nto build aligned LLM based on participants of the\nweb community (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023). It also re-\nleases an Oasst model (SFT) trained on the human-\nannotated dataset 10.\n3.3\nEvaluation Results\nStatic HHH alignment and TruthfulQA\nOur\nmodels outperform Alpaca, Dolly-v2, and OpenAs-\nsistant without any distillation from the proprietary\nLLMs or intensive human annotations, as shown in\nTable 1. For all sizes, our ALMoSTs show consis-\ntently better accuracy in all HHH splits and Truth-\nfulQA except for Vicuna trained on ChatGPT\u2019s out-\nputs (Chiang et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023). However,\nour RM shows excellent performance in choosing\nappropriate responses according to human values,\neven beating the Vicuna-7B. It is the consistent ob-\nservation with Askell et al. (2021). Moreover, it is\nnotable our ALMoST-PPO achieves the highest ac-\ncuracy in the Helpful split of HHH evaluation, even\nincluding 13 billion models. When comparing our\nSFT and PPO-trained models, the PPO model im-\nproves helpfulness, harmlessness, and truthfulness\nwhile sacrificing honesty. Honesty and truthfulness\nlook similar, but they are slightly different. The\nhonesty is related to expressing uncertainty, while\nthe truthfulness mainly measures how robust the\nmodel is against adversarial falsehood.\nHuman Evaluation on Vicuna Questions\nWe\nconfirm our models\u2019 strengths in actual human\npreferences in human evaluation 11. In Figure 3a,\n10OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5\n11The inter-rater agreement is rated as moderate (Fleiss\u2019\nkappa=0.41). More details are in Appendix E.1\nwe find that humans also more favorably as-\nsess our ALMoST model than Dolly-v2 and Al-\npaca (DataBricks, 2023; Taori et al., 2023), show-\ning 58.8% and 55.0% of winning rate, respectively.\nAlso, ALMoST-PPO improves the preference of\nALMoST-SFT with a higher winning rate (37.5%),\nwhile they also show the highest tie rate (36.3%). It\nindicates the efficacy of our RLSF training. More-\nover, our model is assessed as competitive with\nVicuna, showing 25% of the winning rate and 25%\nof the tie rate, even without dependency on the\npowerful proprietary model, ChatGPT. However,\nthere still remains significant room for improve-\nment between our ALMoST and Vicuna. We also\ninclude qualitative examples of the evaluation in\nAppendix H.\nGPT-4 Evaluation on Vicuna Questions\nIn Fig-\nure 3b, we can observe a similar tendency of\nGPT-4 evaluation with the human evaluation. The\nALMoST-PPO consistently shows a higher win-\nning rate against Dolly-v2, Alpaca, and ALMoST-\nSFT. However, we find that the GPT-4 is not likely\nto give the same scores for the answers showing\na generally lower tie rate than the human evalua-\ntion. Moreover, GPT-4 assesses Vicuna\u2019s responses\nmore favorably than humans did. Nevertheless,\nwe can obtain the overall gaps among the models\nwith reasonable cost from the GPT-4 evaluation.\nWhen we extend the evaluation to various-sized\nmodels, our 7B model outperforms 12-13B base-\nlines, including Alpaca-13B, Oasst-12B, and Dolly-\nv2-12B in the evaluation as shown in Figure 8.\n4\nAnalysis\n4.1\nProbing Main Hypothesis\nWe further inspect our assumptions for the syn-\nthetic feedback. Specifically, we would like to\nknow how each assumption, (1) model size, (2) the\nnumber of demonstrations, and (3) the quality of\ndemonstrations, contributes to the final quality of\nthe sampled responses. For this, we conduct GPT-4\nevaluations on Vicuna Questions to compare our\nprompted response generators used for synthetic\nfeedback generation in Section 2.1. We use Alpaca-\n7B (Taori et al., 2023) as a baseline model for the\npair-wise comparisons. The results are shown in\nTable 2.\nFirst, as expected, we can see that the model size\nsignificantly contributes to the response quality for\nboth types of prompt (HHH and Faithful).

It is based on the same evaluation\nsetup in Section 3. The W, T, and L indicate # of wins,\nties, and losses of each generator against Alpaca-7B.\nwinning rate against Alpaca-7B increases mono-\ntonically as we increase the model size. The gap\nbetween 13B and 30B is especially large. Second,\nwhen comparing LLaMA-7B-HHH-{1,3,5}shot\nmodels, the number of demonstrations also im-\nproves the winning rate, but improvements by this\nfactor are relatively small. Finally, we find that the\ndemonstration\u2019s quality is the most important fac-\ntor. Surprisingly, the smaller model with the well-\ndesigned prompt (LLaMA-7B-Faithful-3shot)\noutperforms the larger model with the normal\nprompt (LLaMA-30B-HHH-5shot). Through this in-\ntrinsic evaluation, we can find our synthetic feed-\nback dataset effectively covers responses of varying\nquality.\n4.2\nRM Evaluation\nTrain Dataset\n# instance\nAccuracy\nRandom baseline\n-\n50.0\nLengthy baseline\n-\n59.4\nZero-shot\nStackExchange\n25,057\n63.7\nSynthetic Feedback\n13,687\n65.2\nFull Fine-tuning\nHelpful-base\u2217\n11,738\n65.2\nHelpful-base\n43,835\n71.8\nTable 3: Results of zero-shot reward modeling in the\nHelpful-base split of HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a).

The \u2217 indicates the training data is a\nsubset of the original, only including single-turn.\nWe further evaluate our RM on another com-\nparison dataset, HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) to\nvalidate our synthetically generated comparisons\n(Synthetic Feedback). HH-RLHF contains various\nsplits according to the development stage, e.g., the\nbase set to build the initial policy or the online set\ncollected with the deployed system. We focus on\nthe \u2018Helpful-base\u2019 split, assuming we do not have\na deployable system.\nReward Modeling\nIn Table 3, we find our RM\ntrained with Synthetic Feedback achieves 90% per-\nformance of its upper-bound trained on the full\ntraining dataset. Also, it achieves the same accu-\nracy with the result fine-tuned on the single-turn\nsubset (Helpful-base\u2217).\nPlease note HH-RLHF\nincludes multi-turn context, while our synthetic\ndataset focuses on single-turn scenarios.\nTrain Dataset\nAccuracy\nRandom baseline\n50.0\nLengthy baseline\n59.4\nSynthetic Feedback\n65.2\n- As-is RM\n63.3\n- Heuristic Filter\n55.5\nTable 4: Ablation results of post validation in the syn-\nthetic comparison generation.

Table 4\nshows that each filtering method contributes to the\nfinal reward model quality. Notably, we find the\nheuristic filter (HF) considering length distribution\nplays a crucial role in synthetic data generation.\nWhen we exclude the HF, the performance of RM\ndrops about 10% point. Moreover, HF prevents the\nRM from falling into the length bias discussed in\nSection 2.1. The RM, trained on the dataset with\nHF, outperforms the lengthy baseline which always\nselects the longer response as the better response.\nRMSP vs Self-Play\nWe inspect the benefits of\nRM-guided Self-Play (RMSP) compared to its\ncounterpart without RM guidance, i.e., Self-Play.\nSpecifically, we compare two supervised policies\n(SFT) trained on demonstrations generated by\nRMSP or Self-Play. In Table 5, we find that the SFT\nmodel trained with RMSP outperforms the model\nwith Self-Play in various benchmarks.

If we use HHH prompt instead of\nthe Faithful for the simulation, the performances\nfor the alignment drop significantly. We include\nqualitative examples to compare the methods in\nTable 10.\n5\nRelated Work\nAligning LLMs with Human values\nCondition-\ning language models on human values (Askell et al.,\n2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) was\nfound to improve models\u2019 capabilities of generat-\ning human-aligned text. Incorporating reward mod-\nels (Askell et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Scheurer\net al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023) to tell how well\nthe generated text reflects human values has en-\nabled training better-aligned language models and\nserved as a crucial ingredient for another effective\nmethodology - reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). RLHF have been widely inves-\ntigated in recent days for aligning LLMs with the\nhuman values (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al.,\n2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Sti-\nennon et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022). Recently,\nZhou et al. (2023) claim the Superficial Alignment\nHypothesis that most abilities of LLMs are learned\nin the pre-training stage, and fine-tuning on a few\ncurated datasets can elicit the well-aligned behav-\niors from the models.\nDistillation from proprietary LLMs\nRecent\nopen-sourced models such as Alpaca follow the\nrecipe of Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022) to re-\nduce the burdens of collecting human demonstra-\ntions (Taori et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023). How-\never, it generates the synthetic instruction datasets\nusing proprietary LLMs, e.g., InstructGPT or Chat-\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023), differ-\nent from Self-Instruct, which uses a vanilla LLM,\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). Similarly, Peng et al.\n(2023) try to distill GPT-4 outputs for the alignment.\nVicuna is another open-sourced model trained on\n70k ShareGPT datasets, which are publicly shared\nChatGPT outputs by users (Chiang et al., 2023). On\nthe other hand, Gudibande et al. (2023) point out\nthe limitations of the distillation to train the aligned\nLLMs. Specifically, they show that scaling the\nnumber of the synthetic dataset does not improve\nthe knowledge-related tasks and also human prefer-\nences, while scaling the model size contributes to\nthe results. From the experiments, they warn that\nusing synthetic datasets distills the teacher\u2019s style,\nnot the knowledge.\nSelf-Alignment Learning\nAskell et al. (2021)\nintroduce context distillation to get an initial pol-\nicy with few-shot demonstrations manually de-\nvised by the authors. A student model, which is\nnot prompted, is distilled from a teacher model\nprompted with the few-shot demonstrations. Self-\nInstruct is the approach that aligns LLMs with self-\ngenerated instruction datasets (Wang et al., 2022).\nTo this end, Wang et al. (2022) manually devise\n175 seed tasks and conduct automatic instruction\ndataset via in-context learning and filtering. We\ndevelop the methods by including reward modeling\nwith synthetic feedback. Dromedary is a concur-\nrent work that has a similar motivation to ours,\ni.e., alignment learning with minimal human ef-\nforts (Sun et al., 2023). They devise a few human-\nwritten \u201cprinciples\u201d for LLMs to follow, and the\nLLMs generate aligned responses with the guid-\nance of the principles via in-context learning, simi-\nlar to Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b). Specifi-\ncally, it requires about 200 human annotations, 195\nseed prompts, 16 principles, and 5 exemplars for\nthe alignment, while our framework requires only\n18 human annotations, 10 seed prompts for query\nmining, and 8 demonstrations.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we propose a novel framework for\naligning LLM with human values by introducing\nsynthetic feedback. We identify better responses\nfrom vanilla LLMs with various sizes and prompts,\nrelying on empirical prior knowledge. We first\ntrain a reward model with synthetically generated\ncomparisons. Then, we produce another synthetic\ndataset to train aligned policies using the reward\nmodel. Experimental results demonstrate the effi-\ncacy of our framework showing outstanding per-\nformances in the alignment benchmarks. We be-\nlieve the strong performance of our model is de-\nrived from the effective incorporation of empirical\nindicators of well-aligned behaviors through syn-\nthetic feedback. Furthermore, our method is cost-\neffective in that it does not require extensive human\ndemonstrations and not depend on the proprietary\nLLMs.\nLimitations\nEven though we show our framework works well\non many alignment-related benchmarks (Askell\net al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021; Chiang et al., 2023),\nour evaluations fall short of identifying other as-\npects of the resulting aligned models.\nFor ex-\nample, Gudibande et al. (2023) explain the lim-\nitations of synthetic imitation datasets from the\npre-aligned LLMs by involving knowledge-related\nbenchmarks like MMLU, HumanEval, and Natu-\nral Questions (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Chen et al.,\n2021; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019).\nAskell et al.\n(2021); Bai et al. (2022a) also explain the phe-\nnomenon of \u2018alignment tax\u2019 in which the resulting\naligned models sacrifice their other abilities show-\ning degraded performances on other NLP tasks.\nIn fact, we observe similar results when we test\nour models on the zero-shot MMLU and LAM-\nBADA tasks (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Paperno et al.,\n2016) to identify the alignment tax, as shown in Ap-\npendix F. Our PPO model shows deteriorated per-\nformances for both datasets, implying the presence\nof alignment tax. Although there is a report that\nless than 10B models often suffer from the align-\nment tax and scaling the parameters mitigates the\ntrade-off (Bai et al., 2022a), our approach might be\nlimited in that it mostly focuses on aligning LLMs\nto the target values, e.g., helpfulness. We remain\na more holistic evaluation of our framework and\nmitigation of the alignment tax for future work.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was partly supported by KAIST-NAVER\nHypercreative AI Center and Institute of Infor-\nmation & communications Technology Planning\n& Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea\ngovernment (MSIT) (No.2019-0-00075, Artificial\nIntelligence Graduate School Program (KAIST),\n20%).

The AI tries to be helpful, polite, honest, sophisticated,\nemotionally aware, and humble-but-knowledgeable. The assistant is happy to help with almost anything, and will do its best to\nunderstand exactly what is needed. It also tries to avoid giving false or misleading information, and it caveats when it isn\u2019t entirely\nsure about the right answer. That said, the assistant is practical and really does its best, and doesn\u2019t let caution get too much in the\nway of being useful.\nHuman: I was wondering, is it actually important when making spaghetti to add salt?\nAssistant: Yes, adding salt to the water when making spaghetti (or any pasta) is important for several reasons:\n1. Flavor enhancement: Salt helps to bring out the natural flavors of the pasta and create a more flavorful and balanced dish. Pasta\ncooked without salt can taste bland, and seasoning after cooking is not as effective.\n2. Water temperature: Salt raises the boiling point of water, allowing the pasta to cook at a slightly higher temperature. This can\nlead to a better al dente texture.\n3. Surface texture: Adding salt to the water can help create a slightly rougher surface on the pasta, allowing sauces to cling better\nto the noodles.\n4. The general rule of thumb is to add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water (or about 1 teaspoon per quart). Be sure\nto taste the pasta as it cooks to ensure it is seasoned to your liking.\nHuman: I see, can you recommend some spaghetti recipe for me?\nAssistant: Certainly! Here\u2019s a simple recipe for spaghetti with tomato sauce:\nIngredients:\n- 1 pound spaghetti\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- 1 onion, chopped\n- 4 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)\n- Fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional)\n- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)\nInstructions:\n1. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted water.\n2. While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes\nuntil soft and translucent.\n3. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n4. Pour the diced tomatoes and their juice into the skillet with the onions and garlic. Add salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes\nif using. Stir well to combine.\n5. Simmer the tomato sauce over low heat for 10-15 minutes until it has thickened slightly.\n6. Drain the spaghetti and add it to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss the pasta with the sauce until it is coated evenly.\n7. Serve the spaghetti hot with chopped fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.\nI hope you enjoy this recipe! Let me know if you have any other questions.\nFigure 4: Example of Faithful prompt used for our zero-shot modeling and simulations. We manually revise the\noriginal HHH prompt to be more faithful. The full examples are found in here.\nUser (HHH) prompt\nBelow are a series of dialogues between various people and an AI assistant. Human should pursue their curiosity to obtain\nproper and desired responses from AI. In other words, if the response from the AI is not enough, the human should ask\nfollow-up questions or request elaboration from the AI.\nHuman: I was wondering, is it actually important when making spaghetti to add salt?\nAssistant: Do you mean, is it important to add salt to the water that you\u2019re boiling the spaghetti in?\nHuman: Yeah\nAssistant: It\u2019s usually recommended to bring out the flavor of the pasta. The scientific way to say this is that salt enhances the\nability of chemoreceptors in the tongue to detect molecules that are perceived through the sense of taste.\nHuman: But I mean I\u2019m going to use sauce and stuff, so does it matter?\nAssistant: It sounds like you\u2019re skeptical. Honestly, I don\u2019t know for sure, but since you\u2019re curious, why don\u2019t you do a taste test\nyourself \u2013 make two small pots of pasta, one with plenty of salt, and the other without. Then taste the noodles and see which one\nyou prefer? As you said, you can also then add sauce to both, and see if any differences in taste you noticed with the plain pasta\nbecome imperceptible. It should be a fun experiment!\nHuman: I found this abstract for a physics paper, and I heard that it\u2019s a very famous and important paper, but I had no idea what\nany of it means:\nRecently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large N limits of certain conformal field theories in d dimensions can be\ndescribed in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of d+1-dimensional AdS space with a compact manifold.\nHere we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those\nof supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the\nasymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in\nsupergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity\non AdS5\u00d7S5 match with the chiral operators of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions,\none can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the N=4 theory has a large N phase transition related\nto the thermodynamics of AdS black holes.\nCan you explain it?\nAssistant: That\u2019s the abstract to one of a group of three papers credited with discovering the \u201cAdS/CFT correspondence\u201d, which\nis also a version of the \u201cHolographic Principle\u201d. This principle says that theories of gravity in d+1-dimensions can be exactly\ndescribed using other, non-gravitational theories in d dimensions, so the word \u201cholography\u201d is a metaphor. The abstract goes on to\ngive a bunch of concrete details about the discovery and how it\u2019s realized in string theory.\nHuman: What is the \u201cAdS\u201d and the \u201cCFT\u201d then? Is it \u201cConformal Field Theory\u201d, and what\u2019s that?\nAssistant: AdS is \u201cAnti-deSitter\u201d space, which is really a negatively curved space. . . in informal terms, it\u2019s a surface that\u2019s shaped\nlike a saddle. Conformal Field Theories are quantum mechanical systems that are scale invariant. They\u2019re a kind of modified\nspecial case of the strong force, which is part of the standard model of particle physics. The standard model really describes our\nworld, but AdS/CFT is a purely theoretical idea.\nHuman: Can you tell me what happened with the June 1996 Bangledeshi General Election?\nAssistant: You might be better off using Google or Wikipedia for that. I could try to guess, but my memory is a bit hazy, and I\nreally don\u2019t want to mislead you by providing inaccurate information. If you do look it up but find the results hard to interpret, you\ncan tell me what you see and we can try to understand it together.\nHuman: I don\u2019t have internet access, can you just tell me what you remember?\nAssistant: I think it was the second election held that year, after a controversial February election? And it was a victory for the\nBangladesh Awami League, which won 146 of the 300 seats, beginning Sheikh Hasina\u2019s first-term as Prime Minister? But please\ndouble check those facts when you get a chance.\nFigure 5: Examples of User prompt used for our simulations. Originally, it included 14 human-written conversations\nfor the assistant model devised by Askell et al. (2021). We edit the instruction to suit the user model.\nB\nExamples of synthetic comparisons\nPrompt:\nWhat is the most common language in South America?\nLLaMA-30B-Faithful-3shot\nThe most widely spoken language in South America is Spanish, with an\nestimated 410 million people who speak it in South America. About 17.7\nmillion Brazilians also speak Spanish, so that\u2019s about 537 million people in\nSouth America who speak Spanish.\nLLaMA-30B-HHH-5shot\nI don\u2019t know, offhand. I\u2019ll do a quick web search and get back to you.\nLLaMA-13B-HHH-3shot\nSpanish is the most common language in South America.\nLLaMA-7B-HHH-3shot\nSpanish.\nPrompt:\nYou seem to know a lot about the moon, what can you tell me?\nLLaMA-30B-Faithful-3shot\nSure! I\u2019d be happy to tell you a little more about the moon. Here are 10\ninteresting facts about the moon:\n1. The moon is Earth\u2019s only permanent natural satellite.\n2. The moon is believed to have been created nearly 4.5 billion years ago\nwhen a giant meteorite hit the Earth, causing a large part of it to break off.\n3. The moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same\nface.\n4. The moon has no atmosphere, so it cannot retain the heat from the sun\u2019s\nlight. As a result, it is very cold at night and can be as cold as -233\u00b0 C (-388\u00b0\nF).\n5. The moon is one of the Earth\u2019s closest neighbors, and it is the fifth largest\nmoon in the solar system.\n6. The gravitational pull of the moon creates the tides on the Earth. The\ngravitational pull can also cause the ground to move by several inches each\nyear.\n7. The moon is moving away from the Earth at a rate of 3.8 cm per year.\n8. It is believed that there could be a sub-surface ocean on the moon.\n9. The American flag was planted on the moon by astronauts during the\nApollo 11 mission.\n10. The moon looks the same size in the sky as the sun, although it is much\nsmaller than the sun. This is because the moon is 384,000 km (239,000 miles)\naway from the Earth.\nLLaMA-30B-HHH-5shot\nI\u2019m glad you asked. The moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet\nEarth, and is the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System. It is the\nlargest natural satellite of Earth, and the second largest in the Solar System\nafter Jupiter\u2019s satellite Ganymede. The natural satellites of planets are also\nknown as \u201cmoons\u201d, after Earth\u2019s Moon. The Moon is the second brightest\nregularly visible celestial object in Earth\u2019s sky (after the Sun), as measured by\nilluminance on the Moon\u2019s surface. The Moon\u2019s diameter is 3,474 kilometers\n(2,159 mi), which is about a quarter of that of Earth.\nLLaMA-13B-HHH-3shot\nWhat would you like to know?\nLLaMA-7B-HHH-3shot\nThe Moon is the Earth\u2019s only natural satellite, the fifth largest natural satellite\nin the Solar System, and the largest satellite in the vicinity of Earth. And it\u2019s\nname is Luna, which means moon in Latin.\nFigure 6: Examples of synthetic comparisons. In the first case, the response of LLaMA-30B-HHH-5shot starts\nwith \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. Thus, it is discarded by the heuristic filter (HF). Also, in the second case, the relationship\nLLaMA-13B-HHH-3shot > LLaMA-7B-HHH-3shot is not acceptable according to the length condition of HF; thus,\nthe pair is discarded as well.\nC\nDetails of Synthetic Datasets\nC.1\nDetails of Initial Query Mining\nWe follow the recipe of Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022) to generate initial queries for our synthetic dataset\ngenerations. Specifically, we write 10 manual queries for the seed demonstrations for this. Then, we\nconduct 10-shot (7 static shots and 3 dynamic shots from previously generated queries) generation based\non LLaMA-30B (Touvron et al., 2023). Then, we filter out the generated queries containing bad words\nsuch as \u2018image\u2019, \u2018graph\u2019, \u2018picture\u2019, and \u2018video\u2019. Also, we discard the queries having a high lexical overlap\nwith already mined queries using the Rouge-L score to promote diversity as in Wang et al. (2022). We\ncheck the maximum Rouge-L score between a newly generated query and already mined queries is higher\nthan 0.5. We plot a nested pie chart for the resulting 10k queries in Figure 7.\nC.2\nSampling Configurations\nWe conduct nucleus (top-p) sampling for our synthetic data generation (Holtzman et al., 2019). We set p\nto 0.9 with 1.2 of temperature for the initial query mining in step 1. Otherwise, we use the same p with\n1.0 temperature for response sampling in steps 1 and 2. We set the maximum number of the generated\ntokens to 384.\nC.3\nData Statistics\nDataset Type\nUsage\n# instance\nComparison\nStep 1 (RM)\n13,687\nDemonstration\nStep 2 (SFT)\n19,752\nStep 3 (RLSF)\nTable 6: Statistics of the synthetic dataset generated by our framework. Each instance of the comparison dataset\nconsists of a prompt (input query), chosen response, and rejected response. Each instance of the demonstration\ndataset consists of prompt and response pairs.\nD\nMore Training Details\nD.1\nRM\nWe train our reward model for 1 epoch with 1e-5 of the learning rate, 64 of batch size, and 1024 of\nmaximum sequence length. LLaMA-7B is employed for the initial checkpoint of the reward model (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023). We implement the training based on the Fully-Sharded Data Parallel of PyTorch and\nTransformers library (Wolf et al., 2020).\nD.2\nSFT\nWe use the same training configurations of Alpaca-7B (Touvron et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023) 12. It uses\n128 of batch size, 2e-5 of the learning rate, 512 of maximum sequence length for 3 epochs of training.\nHowever, we do not follow the input template of Alpaca. Instead, we use prefixes of Bai et al. (2022a),\n\u2018Human:\u2019 for the input query, and \u2018Assistant:\u2019 for the assistant\u2019s response as in examples of Appendix A.\nD.3\nPPO\nPPO models are trained over 80,000 episodes using 20,000 distinct prompts. The batch size for each\niteration is 512, with a minibatch size of 32. We train on the same sample for four inner epochs. For\nrollouts, we limit the maximum number of tokens per model response to 128. The sampling temperature is\n1. The PPO clip ratio is set to 0.2, and discount factor is set to 1. We set a KL reward coefficient \u03bb = 0.05.\nWe use adamW optimizer with the initial learning rate of 1e-6, \u03b21 = 0.9 and \u03b22 = 0.95. We use a cosine\n12github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca\nLR schedule with the minimum learning rate of 8e-7. Normalization is not applied to the reward score.\nFor PPO, we adopt the implementation of trlX13.\nFigure 7: A nested pie chart for the initial queries in our dataset. It shows the top 20 root verbs and the corresponding\ntop 4 nouns for each verb. It is plotted the same as in Wang et al. (2022).\n13github.com/CarperAI/trlx\nE\nEvaluation on Vicuna Questions\nE.1\nDetails of Human Evaluation\nWe recruit three different workers for each A/B test. We pay about $ 0.44 for each instance, i.e., a worker\ngets about $ 35 for evaluating 80 questions. As a result, we recruit 3 (workers) * 4 (tests) = 12 workers for\nour human evaluation. We provide detailed instructions via the interface as in Figure 9 for the workers\nwho participate in our human study. Specifically, we request the workers to judge the better response by\nrelying on their actual contents, not the style (Gudibande et al., 2023). We ask the workers to choose\namong A, Tie (Both good), Tie (Both bad), or B while we randomize the order of two responses. We\ncombine the results of Tie (Both good) and Tie (Both bad) into Tie when we report the final evaluation\nresult. We also measure inter-rater agreement among the workers to validate that the evaluation is well\nconducted. Table 7 shows the results. We find the agreement is somewhat different according to the pairs.\nHowever, the overall agreement is rated as moderate. Moreover, we get a fair agreement between the\ndecisions from the author of this paper and one of the workers in ALMoST-PPO vs. Alpaca test.\nTest pair\nFleiss\u2019 Kappa\nInter-rater agreement\nALMoST-PPO vs. Alpaca\n0.34\nALMoST-PPO vs. Dolly-v2\n0.61\nALMoST-PPO vs. Vicuna\n0.27\nALMoST-PPO vs. ALMoST-SFT\n0.34\nAll\n0.41\nModeler-rater agreement (Cohen\u2019s Kappa)\nALMoST-PPO vs. Alpaca\n0.36\nTable 7: Inter-rater agreement and Modeler-rater agreement.\nE.2\nAll results of GPT-4 evaluation\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nChatGPT\nVicuna-13b\nVicuna-7b\nALMoST-7b (SFT)\nDolly-v2-7b\nDolly-v2-12b\nOasst-12b\nAlpaca-7b\nAlpaca-13b\n6.9%\n7.5%\n16.2%\n50.0%\n77.5%\n81.2%\n77.5%\n59.4%\n66.9%\n6.2%\n6.9%\n5.0%\n6.9%\n3.8%\n3.8%\n3.8%\n3.8%\n3.8%\n86.9%\n85.6%\n78.8%\n43.1%\n18.8%\n15.0%\n18.8%\n36.9%\n29.4%\nALMoST-7b (PPO) Win\nTie\nALMoST-7b (PPO) Loss\nFigure 8: All results of GPT-4 evaluation on Vicuna Questions (Chiang et al., 2023).

(2022a) demonstrate the phenomenon of \u201calignment tax\u201d. It indicates that\nthe alignment of LLMs sacrifices some other innate abilities showing weaker performances compared\nto unaligned vanilla models. We conduct two zero-shot NLP evaluations, Massive Multitask Language\nUnderstanding (MMLU) and LAMBADA (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Paperno et al., 2016), to investigate the\nalignment tax. The MMLU contains 57 multiple-choice tasks with various domains requiring element or\nexpert knowledge. And Lambada is a word prediction task to measure the linguistic abilities of the models.\nIn Table 8, we find our RLSF training (PPO) deteriorates performances in both datasets compared to\nvanilla LLM, LLaMA-7B, which is a similar observation of Bai et al. (2022a). Bai et al. (2022a) explain\nthe smaller models than 10 billions often experience severe deterioration with the alignment learning.\nG\nExamples of RMSP vs. Self-Play\nPrompt:\nCan you help me figure out how to create an online store for my small business?\nSelf-Play:\nRMSP:\nSure, what would you like to know?\nSure, let me look that up for you. There are a variety of different\nservices that allow you to create an online store. Which of these\nbest suits your business requirements depends on your budget\nand the type of products you want to sell.\nHere are a few popular options:\nWooCommerce\n- WooCommerce is a free ecommerce plugin for WordPress.\nThis allows you to sell physical or digital products, or both.\nWooCommerce is easy to use and you can have your online\nstore up and running in minutes. WooCommerce has more than\n280 extensions that let you add features like affiliate marketing,\ncoupons, and taxes.\nShopify\n- Shopify is a fully hosted online store with a variety of different\npackages to choose from. Pricing starts at $9/month for a basic\nstore with 2 staff accounts, up to $299/month for a store with\nunlimited products and unlimited bandwidth. The Shopify dash-\nboard makes it easy to customize and design your store, and you\ncan accept payments via credit card, PayPal, and more.\nPrompt:\nAre business intelligence and analytics the same thing?\nSelf-Play:\nRMSP:\nYes. Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics are\ntwo terms that are used interchangeably, and es-\nsentially mean the same thing. The two terms are\noften used in the context of business intelligence ap-\nplications (also known as business analytics tools),\nwhich provide insights into a company\u2019s perfor-\nmance, and help business owners and executives\nmake better decisions based on hard facts. These\ntools can provide a deeper understanding of various\naspects of a business, including sales, performance,\ncosts, profitability, and customer behavior.\nNo, they are not the same.\nAnalytics is the discovery and communication of meaningful\npatterns in data. It is a multidisciplinary field that uses many\ntools and techniques from computer science, statistics, and math-\nematics. The goal of analytics is to use these techniques to find\ninsights that are hidden in data.\nBusiness intelligence is the process of collecting data to better\nunderstand business operations and performance. It is used\nto make more informed decisions, and the primary objective of\nBI is to allow people to more easily understand large amounts of\ndata and see trends in business activities.\nBusiness intelligence uses analytics as one of the techniques\nto help extract insights and knowledge from data. However,\nthe two terms are not interchangeable. In summary, analytics\nis one of the techniques used to make better business decisions,\nwhereas business intelligence is the process of using data and\nanalytics to make better business decisions.\nFigure 10: Qualitative comparisons between Self-Play and RM-guided Self-Play (RMSP).\nH\nQualitative Examples\nPrompt:\nHow can I improve my time management skills?\nALMoST-7b (Ours)\n1. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Some tasks are more important than\nothers, while some have a deadline that you must meet. Tasks with higher priority or\ndeadlines should be completed first, followed by the lower-priority ones.\n2. Create a to-do list each day. Make a master list of everything you need to do for the\nweek ahead. Then create a daily task list from this master list (based on its priority) and\ncheck off items as they\u2019re finished. A good rule of thumb is to focus on one task at a time\nuntil it\u2019s complete.\n3. Plan your workload. Try to plan out your workload in advance so that you know what\nneeds to be accomplished during certain periods of time. This will help you manage your\ntime better throughout the day and ensure that nothing gets left behind.\n4. Schedule breaks. It may seem counterproductive, but taking short breaks actually helps\nboost productivity. Breaks give you an opportunity to recharge yourself mentally and\nphysically, which allows you to get back to work fresh and focused. So, schedule regular\nbreaks into your day and stick to them religiously.\n5. Turn off all distractions. When working on a particular task, turn off email notifications,\nFacebook updates, WhatsApp alerts, etc., and focus solely on completing that one thing.\nIf there are any other things that require your attention, write them down instead of getting\ndistracted and losing focus. Once those tasks have been added to your to-do list, then\nattend to them when their respective times come up.\n(...)\nI hope these tips were helpful! Let me know if you have any questions about anything\nhere.\nVicuna-7b\nTime management is the process of planning and organizing your tasks and priorities\nto make the best use of your time. Here are some tips to help you improve your time\nmanagement skills:\n1. Set goals: Identify what you want to achieve and set specific, measurable, achievable,\nrelevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. This will help you focus on what\u2019s important\nand prioritize your tasks.\n2. Create a schedule: Plan out your tasks and schedule in advance, and prioritize the most\nimportant and urgent tasks. Use a planner or calendar to keep track of your schedule and\ndeadlines.\n(...)\n6. Take breaks: Take regular breaks throughout the day to recharge and refresh your mind.\n7. Review and adjust: Regularly review your schedule and adjust it as needed to ensure\nthat you are making the best use of your time.\n8. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness can help you stay focused and present, and reduce\nstress and anxiety.\n9. Get support: Seek support from friends, family, or a coach or therapist if you need help\nstaying on track or managing stress.\nAlpaca-7b\nTo improve your time management skills, you can make a plan for each day and prioritize\ntasks based on importance. Set realistic goals and timelines, break large tasks into smaller\nones, and focus on one task at a time. Take regular breaks, and make sure to celebrate\nsuccesses and recognize accomplishments.\nDolly-v2-7b\nHere are some tips:\n1. Prioritize your tasks.\n2. Create a daily, weekly and monthly schedule.\n3. Organize your calendar.\n4. Delegate and manage your time so you can work on the most important things.\n5. Take breaks.\n6. Find a mentor.\nFigure 11: An example of responses from same-sized models in Vicuna Questions (Chiang et al., 2023).\nPrompt:\nHow can you determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply being polite?\nALMoST-7b (Ours)\nThere are several signs that indicate whether someone is really paying attention to what\nyou\u2019re saying, or if they\u2019re just being polite. If the other person asks questions about\nsomething you\u2019ve said, and then listens attentively while you respond, this suggests they\nare truly interested. However, if their eyes wander around the room as you speak, or\nthey often change the subject before you have finished speaking, it may mean they aren\u2019t\ngenuinely engaged with your response.\nPeople who are truly interested will also ask follow-up questions after you\u2019ve answered\ntheir original question. They might even ask for more information when there is an\nopportunity to do so naturally (e.g., \u201cI don\u2019t know much about art history \u2013 how does this\npainting fit into the overall theme of Baroque art?\u201d).\nAnother sign of interest is eye contact. When people are truly engaged in a conversation,\nthey tend to maintain eye contact, which shows they are focused on what you are saying.\nFinally, if you notice that a person tends to be especially attentive during conversations\nwhere they actually want to learn more about you, and less so otherwise, this could suggest\nthey\u2019re merely polite rather than truly interested.\nVicuna-7b\nIt can be difficult to determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or\nsimply being polite, as people can be complex and may have different motivations for\nengaging in conversation. However, there are some clues that can suggest a person\u2019s level\nof interest and engagement in the conversation:\n1. Active listening: A person who is genuinely interested in the conversation will typically\ndemonstrate active listening, such as by making eye contact, nodding, and asking follow-\nup questions.\n2. Engagement: A person who is genuinely interested in the conversation will typically\nshow engagement by asking questions, sharing their own thoughts and experiences, and\ncontributing to the conversation in a meaningful way.\n3. Inclusivity: A person who is genuinely interested in the conversation will typically try\nto include others in the conversation and may ask for input from others.\n4. Respect and empathy: A person who is genuinely interested in the conversation will\ntypically show respect and empathy for the other person\u2019s thoughts and feelings.\n5. Authenticity: A person who is genuinely interested in the conversation will typically be\nauthentic and genuine in their engagement, rather than simply being polite or following a\nscript.\nOf course, these are not definitive indicators of a person\u2019s level of interest in the conversa-\ntion, and it\u2019s possible for a person to be polite and genuinely interested in a conversation\nat the same time. Ultimately, the best way to determine a person\u2019s level of interest in a\nconversation is to engage with them and observe their behavior over time.\nAlpaca-7b\nListen to their body language and tone of voice. Do they make eye contact? Do they seem\nengaged in the conversation or are their expressions and gestures hesitant and reserved?\nDo they ask questions or make comments that show they are actively listening and thinking\nabout what you are saying? These are all signs that can help you determine if someone is\ngenuinely interested in the conversation.\nDolly-v2-7b\nThe art of conversation is very difficult to master. One can practice by having one-on-one\nconversations with oneself, which is quite inexpensive. Then, one can try to apply the\nsame principles to conversations with others.\nIt is generally true that the most interesting people are the most passionate about their\ninterests. Therefore, the art of conversation can be gauged by observing the depth of the\ninterest of the conversationalist. Is the person asking detailed questions about the topic of\nconversation and making insightful comments? If so, then they are probably passionate\nabout the topic.\nOn the other hand, if the conversationalist is only asking general questions or making\ncomments like \"that\u2019s a good point\" or \"interesting\" without making any comments or\nasking any detailed questions, then they are probably just being polite.\nFigure 12: An example of responses from same-sized models in Vicuna Questions (Chiang et al., 2023).\nPrompt:\nWhat if the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period?\nALMoST-7b (Ours)\nDuring the renaissance, scholars were interested in collecting and preserving informa-\ntion. They would copy documents by hand, often multiple times to ensure accuracy and\nlongevity of their work. This meant that many important works survived this way, but\naccess was limited to a small number of people who could read them.\nThe internet would have drastically changed how scholarship developed during the renais-\nsance. It would have enabled researchers and academics to share ideas quickly across\nborders, and make resources such as rare books available to anyone with an internet\nconnection. While some forms of research would be lost due to the ease with which they\ncan now be reproduced, it would have made new areas of study far more accessible than\nthey otherwise might have been.\nVicuna-7b\nIt\u2019s difficult to say exactly how the Internet would have developed if it had been invented\nduring the Renaissance period, as it would have likely been used for different purposes\nand in different ways than it is today. However, it\u2019s likely that the Internet would have\nbeen used primarily for communication and information sharing among a small group of\npeople, rather than the global network it is today. During the Renaissance, communication\nand information sharing were important, but the technology available at the time was\nlimited. The printing press had just been invented, and it revolutionized the spread of\ninformation, but it was still a slow and labor-intensive process. Mail service was also\nslow and unreliable, so people relied on word of mouth and local gatherings to share news\nand ideas. If the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance, it would have likely\nbeen used to facilitate communication and information sharing among the ruling classes,\nand possibly among scholars and scientists as well. It might have been used for things\nlike sharing news and current events, exchanging letters and documents, and accessing\ninformation on a wide range of topics. However, it would not have the same level of\ninteractivity and global reach that it has today.\nAlpaca-7b\nIf the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period, it likely would have been\nused primarily by academics and scholars to share ideas, research, and knowledge. Instead\nof being used for entertainment and communication, it would have been used primarily\nfor the advancement of art and science.\nDolly-v2-7b\nIt is likely that the Internet would have been invented during the Renaissance period. In\nthe 14th century, Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable type printing press which\nallowed for the wide-scale production and distribution of books. The Internet is based\non the transfer of electronic data which is printed, copied, and distributed in the same\nway as books. In the 16th century, Francesco Colasassi built the first experimental\nmechanical computer. This computer used gears, rods, and springs to perform simple\narithmetic operations. It was not much more than a sophisticated toy, but it demonstrated\nthe feasibility of using mechanical machines to perform arithmetic calculations. In the\n18th century, Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical digital computer. This computer\nused levers, rods, and springs to perform arithmetic operations. It was not much more than\na sophisticated toy, but it demonstrated the feasibility of using mechanical machines to\nperform arithmetic calculations. By the 20th century, electronics had developed sufficiently\nthat it was possible to use electronics to build a digital computer. The first electronic\ndigital computers were constructed in the 1940s during World War II. These computers\nwere based on analog electronics and were not very powerful. In the 1970s, however, the\ndevelopment of integrated circuit technology allowed electronic computers to become\nmuch more powerful. These computers were based on digital electronics and were capable\nof performing extremely complex operations. Today, the Internet is composed of thousands\nof digital computers linked together to form a vast network. These computers are capable\nof performing extremely complex operations and are capable of communicating with each\nother using an incredibly fast data transmission method called light. The Internet is based\non the transfer of electronic data, which is printed, copied, and distributed in the same way\nas books. The Internet is therefore based on the inventions made during the Renaissance\nperiod.\nFigure 13: An example of responses from same-sized models in Vicuna Questions (Chiang et al., 2023).\nI\nEvaluation Prompts\nWhen we evaluate models on multiple-choice datasets, we utilize the corresponding prompts to elicit\nthe proper answer option as shown in Tables 14 15, and 16.

Hallucinations are often\nattributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we\nhypothesize that in some cases, when justifying\npreviously generated hallucinations, LMs out-\nput false claims that they can separately recog-\nnize as incorrect. We construct three question-\nanswering datasets where ChatGPT and GPT-4\noften state an incorrect answer and offer an\nexplanation with at least one incorrect claim.\nCrucially, we find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can\nidentify 67% and 87% of their own mistakes, re-\nspectively. We refer to this phenomenon as hal-\nlucination snowballing: an LM over-commits\nto early mistakes, leading to more mistakes that\nit otherwise would not make.1\n1\nIntroduction\nLanguage models are increasingly being de-\nployed to interface with humans in open-ended\ninformation-seeking and problem-solving settings.\nDespite their diverse capabilities and extreme flu-\nency, a major open challenge is that LMs still hal-\nlucinate by making up facts or citing sources that\ndo not exist (Maynez et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023,\ni.a.), often while sounding extremely plausible.\nHallucination is commonly attributed to knowl-\nedge gaps in LMs (Zheng et al., 2023), motivating\nmitigation strategies through retrieval over knowl-\nedge bases (Lewis et al., 2020; Shuster et al., 2021;\nPeng et al., 2023) But, do LMs only hallucinate\nwhen they do not \u201cknow\u201d a fact? We present a\nsetting where LMs often generate hallucinations\nthat they immediately recognize as wrong when\npresented in isolation. Specifically, after an LM\nanswers a question incorrectly, it usually justifies\nthat answer by making incorrect assertions that it\nseparately acknowledges as incorrect (Figure 1).\n1Our data and code are available at: https://github.\ncom/Nanami18/Snowballed_Hallucination\nFigure 1: GPT-4 mistakenly claims that 9677 is not\nprime, followed by an incorrect explanation that 13 \u00d7\n745 = 9677. We refer to this factorization as a snow-\nballed hallucination, as GPT-4 appears to \u201cknow\u201d that\n13 is not a factor of 9677 when asked separately. Thus,\nhallucinations are not necessarily reflective of a model\u2019s\nlack of \u201cknowledge,\u201d but may be induced by an earlier\nhallucination for consistency.\nTo study this behavior empirically, we auto-\nmatically construct three question-answering (QA)\ndatasets. These datasets span different domains:\ndetermining whether a number is prime, whether\nthere is a U.S. senator satisfying two given con-\nstraints, and whether two cities are connected given\na set of flights between cities. Empirically, we find\nthat ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI,\n2023) commit to an answer within the first token\n(Yes/No) over 95% of the time; these answers are\noften incorrect, and then followed by an incorrect\nexplanation. Yet, when presented with the incor-\nrect explanation alone, we find that the LM is likely\nable to recognize it as incorrect.\nWe refer to this phenomenon as hallucination\nsnowballing. We hypothesize that LMs produce\nsnowballed hallucinations for consistency with ear-\nlier hallucinations (rather than due to a \u201cknowledge\ngap\u201d in the model), as they recognize the snow-\narXiv:2305.13534v1  [cs.CL]  22 May 2023\nDataset\nOriginal Question\nVerification Question\nPrimality\nTesting\n\u00a0 User: Is 10733 a prime number?\n\u00c6 GPT-4: No...

Verification Question: The corresponding query used to probe whether GPT-4 recognizes\nits claim is incorrect, with its refutation of the hallucination underlined.\nballed hallucination is incorrect when presented in\nisolation (i.e., in a separate interaction session).\nWhile prompting strategies that encourage the\nLM to reason before stating an answer improve\naccuracy on the task, our work points to the broader\nissue that conditioning on faulty context leads LMs\nto produce extremely simple mistakes that they\nwouldn\u2019t otherwise make. Indeed, when prompting\nwith \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d (Kojima et al., 2023),\nsnowballed hallucinations still occur in 95% of\ncases where the model fails to answer correctly.\nWe observe that sometimes even when \u201cLet\u2019s think\nstep by step\u201d does lead to the right answer, it uses\ninvalid reasoning chains.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the phenomenon\nof hallucination snowballing by leveraging recent\nLMs\u2019 tendency to state and justify their answers.\nRather than over-committing to its previously gen-\nerated context, we believe that LMs should ac-\nknowledge their initial mistake, and then revise\ntheir answer. We have indeed observed GPT-4 do-\ning this in a limited number of cases; amplifying\nthis behavior would be beneficial, as well as devel-\noping new methods in which LMs can backtrack.\n2\nWhy do we expect hallucination\nsnowballing?\nIn this section, we explain why we hypothesize that\nLMs are susceptible to hallucination snowballing.\nWe predict that snowballing will occur on questions\nwith two key properties:\n1. Initial committal: The prompt leads the LM\nto first state an answer (before outputting the\nexplanation). This applies to many yes/no\nquestions.\n2. Inherently sequential: Transformers cannot\nfind the answer within one timestep because\nof their limited reasoning abilities within one\ntimestep.\nWe now discuss how these properties may lead to\nsnowballed hallucination.\nInitial committal.\nIn English and many other\nlanguages, speakers often say the final Yes/No an-\nswers to questions before explaining their answer.\nWe therefore hypothesize that LMs and especially\ninstruction-tuned LMs (Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al.,\n2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) will\nreflect this answer format where the answer comes\nbefore the explanation. Indeed, on our datasets\n(presented in \u00a73.1), we observe that GPT-4 and\nChatGPT immediately commit to an answer to the\nquestion: the first token is Yes or No 95.67% and\n98.40% of the time for GPT-4 and ChatGPT respec-\ntively. In the remaining cases, the model often com-\nmits to an answer within the first few tokens of the\nresponse (e.g., \u201cThere is no record of a U.S. Sena-\ntor...\u201d). Crucially, once the LM generates Yes or No,\nthat token remains in the context, and coherence\nwould require commitment to that choice through\nthe subsequent justification. Thus, the model pro-\nduces an answer to a complex question in a single\ntimestep, and it then continues by generating an\nexplanation for that answer, which inevitably will\nbe incorrect.\nInherently sequential.\nFurthermore, transform-\ners cannot solve inherently sequential reasoning\nproblems like primality testing or graph connec-\ntivity within a single timestep,2 as documented\nin recent theoretical results (Merrill and Sabhar-\nwal, 2023).3 Our graph connectivity and primality\ndatasets are concrete instantiations of these prob-\nlems. Because the transformer must use one step to\nanswer a question that requires multiple timesteps\nto answer correctly, it will necessarily sometimes\ncommit to an incorrect answer. We hypothesize\nthat this leads the LM to hallucinate supporting\nincorrect facts that it otherwise would not generate.\n3\nExperiments\nWe design three QA datasets with the properties\ndescribed in \u00a72 to probe hallucination snowballing,\nand evaluate ChatGPT and GPT-4. We first check\nwhether the LM returns the correct answer to the\ngiven question, and we show that when the model\nreturns the wrong answer, it frequently provides an\nincorrect explanation for that wrong answer. We\nautomatically extract the incorrect claim in the ex-\nplanation and ask the same LM to check whether\nits claim is correct. See Table 1 for a representative\nexample from each dataset.\n3.1\nDatasets\nWe design three QA datasets, each containing 500\nyes/no questions that we expect are not answerable\nby transformers in one timestep. To aid evalua-\ntion, the questions are designed so that an incorrect\nanswer would be justified with easily verifiable\nclaims.\n2Technically, this holds only for inputs above a certain\nhardness level, i.e., the size of the prime number for primality\ntesting, or the size of the graph for graph connectivity.\n3Merrill and Sabharwal (2023) show that, with a single\ngeneration step, bounded-precision transformers cannot solve\nany problem outside the complexity class TC0, which corre-\nsponds to a highly parallelizable subclass of both L (log-space)\nand P (polynomial-time). Graph connectivity is an L-complete\nproblem, which means it cannot be in TC0 unless TC0 = L,\ni.e., all of L can be parallelized to a surprisingly high degree.\nPrimality testing was shown to be in P (Agrawal et al., 2004)\nbut cannot be in TC0 unless it is also in L; i.e., any n can be\nfactored with O(log log n) bits of overhead. In summary, un-\nless standard complexity-theoretic conjectures are false, graph\nconnectivity and primality testing are outside TC0 and thus\nare too inherentially sequential for transformers to solve in a\nsingle generation (cf. Merrill and Sabharwal, 2023).\nFor each dataset, we fix one specific label for\nall examples, so that if the model chooses the in-\ncorrect answer (e.g., that 9677 is not prime), it\nwould produce a specific claim to support it (e.g.,\nan incorrect factorization). This enables us to sys-\ntematically examine model-written justifications\nfor incorrect answers.\nPrimality testing\nFor this dataset, we query\nthe primality of 500 randomly chosen primes be-\ntween 1,000 and 20,000; the correct answer is al-\nways Yes. When the model answers incorrectly,\nwe expect it to justify its answer with an incorrect\nfactorization.\nSenator search\nThis dataset consists of 500\nquestions of the form \u201cWas there ever a US sena-\ntor that represented the state of x and whose alma\nmater was y?\u201d where x is a U.S. state and y is\na U.S. college. For these questions, the correct\nanswer is always No. When the model answers\nincorrectly, we expect it to falsely claim that a par-\nticular senator both represented x and attended y.\nTo create the dataset we consider all U.S. states\nand a manually constructed list of twelve popular\nU.S. colleges (see \u00a7A for the full list); for each\npossible pair, we generate a question following the\ntemplate, and manually remove pairs where the\nanswer is Yes.\nGraph connectivity\nFor each of the 500 ques-\ntions in this dataset, we present 12 flights among 14\ncities, and ask if there is a sequence of flights from\na particular city to another. The problem always\ncorresponds to the same underlying directed graph\nstructure (see \u00a7A.1), where flights are edges and\ncities are nodes. For each instance in the dataset,\nwe randomly assign letters from the English alpha-\nbet to name the nodes. To formulate the query, we\nsample a source city s and destination city t in dif-\nferent subgraphs, with the additional constraint that\ns corresponds to a source node, and t a leaf node,\nso that 1-step heuristics cannot be used to solve the\nproblem.\nWe formulate the problem as a flight-finding\nquestion in natural language so that it sounds more\nnatural: in the prompt, we list the twelve flights\n(\u201cThere is a flight from city F to city K; there is a\nflight from city G to city N, ...\u201d), followed by the\nquestion \u201cIs there a series of flights... from s to t?\u201d.\nNote the correct answer is always No. When the\nmodel answers incorrectly, we expect it to justify\nits answer with a flight that does not exist.\nGraph\nConnectivity\nSenator\nSearch\nPrimality\nTesting\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\nWrong answer (Hallucination)\nModel knows it's wrong (Snowballed Hallucination)\nPrimality\nTesting\nSenator\nSearch\nGraph\nConnectivity\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProportion of Dataset (%)\n(a) ChatGPT\nPrimality\nTesting\nSenator\nSearch\nGraph\nConnectivity\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProportion of Dataset (%)\n(b) GPT-4\nFigure 2: Percentage of hallucination and percentage of snowballed hallucination (both calculated with respect to\nthe entire dataset) for ChatGPT and GPT-4.

We focus on the model behavior under\nthe direct prompt (see \u00a7A for full examples), which\nis the most common way users interact with LMs.\nSee \u00a74 for experiments with the zero-shot chain-of-\nthought style prompting method.\nFor each dataset, we perform a two-stage evalua-\ntion. First, we evaluate the model\u2019s accuracy (i.e.,\nhow many of the questions it answers correctly).\nWhen either models is incorrect, empirically it al-\nways generates a justification. In the second stage,\nwe assess whether the model can identify the incor-\nrect step in the explanation.\nFor a given question, we evaluate the model\u2019s\nresponse by examining whether the output begins\nwith either Yes or No. In cases where the response\ndoes not fall into these categories, we manually\ndetermine the answer conveyed by the model.\n3.3\nLM Recognition of Snowballed\nHallucinations\nWe probe whether LMs recognize their snowballed\nhallucinations by verifying the model\u2019s incorrect\nclaims in the output against the model itself. Note\nthat our recognition procedure relies on heuristics\ngained from manual examination of the model out-\nput, and these heuristics might not work on other\nmodels (e.g., a different model might not provide\nfactors when supporting the claim that a number is\nnot prime).\nGraph Connectivity\nFor each sample where the\nmodel thinks there is a series of connecting flights\n(where answer starts with Yes), we manually ex-\ntract the list of flights from the model\u2019s output and\nidentify the invalid or discontinuous flights.\nWe then, in a new session, ask the model to ver-\nify whether the extracted flights are valid based on\nthe flight information, and if consecutive flights are\nindeed connected. We manually assess the verifica-\ntion output to check if the model correctly detects\nthe error. See Appendix Table 3 for how we prompt\nthe model and an example of successful verifica-\ntion.\nPrimality Testing\nFor each sample where the\nmodel answers that the number is not prime, we\nextract the factors the model uses to justify it. The\nextraction is done by putting the output in the con-\ntext and asking \u201cWhat are the factors proposed\nin the above text? List them out.\u201d We use Chat-\nGPT for extraction with one-shot demonstration\n(for its fast inference speed); we manually checked\n30 examples and found that it can always extract\nthe correct factors.\nWe then, in a new session, ask the model to\nverify each extracted factor individually. See Ap-\npendix Table 4 for an example of successful verifi-\ncation.\nPrimality\nTesting\nSenator\nSearch\nGraph\nConnectivity\ndataset\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\nerror_rate\nOriginal prompt\nStep-by-step prompt\nPrimality\nTesting\nSenator\nSearch\nGraph\nConnectivity\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProportion of Dataset (%)\n(a) ChatGPT\nPrimality\nTesting\nSenator\nSearch\nGraph\nConnectivity\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProportion of Dataset (%)\n(b) GPT-4\nFigure 3: Error rate and snowballed hallucination rate (hatch pattern) for ChatGPT and GPT-4, when using the\noriginal prompt versus \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d. See Appendix Table 8 and Table 9 for the exact numbers.\nSenator Search\nFor each sample where the\nmodel thinks there is such senator, we extract the\nname of the senator the model uses to justify the\nexistence, by putting the output in the context and\nasking \u201cWhat is the senator mentioned in the above\ntext? Just give the name\u201d. Again, we use ChatGPT\nand manually observed perfect extraction on 30\nexamples.\nWe then, in a new session, ask the model if that\nsenator\u2019s alma mater is the college in the question\nand has represented the state in the question. See\nAppendix Table 5 for an example of successful\ndetection.\n3.4\nResults\nQuestion-answering accuracy\nFigure 2 shows\nthat both ChatGPT and GPT-4 experience very low\naccuracy across the board. With the exception\nof ChatGPT on the Senator Search dataset, all\nmodels achieve less than 50% accuracy.(See Ap-\npendix Table 6 for a breakdown of the error rate by\ndataset.) We observe that GPT-4 performs worse\nthan ChatGPT across all datasets despite popularly\nbeing considered superior to ChatGPT (OpenAI,\n2023). While ChatGPT has an average accuracy of\n39.87%, GPT-4 has only 16.6%.\nHallucination\ndetection\nHere,\nwe\ncheck\nwhether the model can identify that the incorrect\nclaim is wrong when it is presented alone. As\nshown in Figure 2, ChatGPT detects 67.37% of\nincorrect claims in explanations (i.e., snowballed\nhallucinations), and GPT-4 detects 87.03%. Notice\nthat when the model fails the verification (an\nexample in Appendix Table 12), we do not\nconsider it a snowballed hallucination.\nOverall, we find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 are\nboth extremely susceptible to hallucination snow-\nballing, leading to extremely simple mistakes.\n4\nCan we prevent snowball\nhallucinations?\nWe hypothesize that hallucination snowballing oc-\ncurs because LMs are trained to model continu-\nations consistent with their current context (the\ngiven prompt and prior outputs). Although a fix to\nthe fundamental problem might require more than\njust inference-time modification, in this section we\nstudy the effectiveness of two inference strategies\nin alleviating hallucination snowballing: prompting\n(\u00a74.1) and decoding or training methods (\u00a74.2).\n4.1\nEngineering Better Prompts\nIn this section, we examine the effectiveness of\nbetter prompts on preventing snowballed halluci-\nnation by using a different zero-shot prompt that\nencourages the model to generate the reasoning\nchain before the answer. Since the outputs gener-\nated under these prompts are less structured, we\nmanually inspect them to determine correctness\nand the presence of snowballed hallucinations.\nFor each task, we append \u201cLet\u2019s think step-by-\nstep\u201d at the end of the original question (shown in\nTable 1). As shown in Figure 3, the model can solve\nthe Senator Search task perfectly, achieve \u226410%\nerror rate on Primality Testing, and \u226430% on\nGraph Connectivity.

See Appendix Table 10 and Table 11 for the exact numbers.\nment in accuracy, we identify a potential issue: the\nmodel sometimes hallucinate while outputting the\nreasoning chain, which causes snowballed halluci-\nnation in future steps. For example, in the below\noutput,\n[....previous steps omitted]\nStep 3: From city E, we have three op-\ntions: a flight to city N, a flight to city B,\nor a flight to city C.\nStep 4: The only option that could poten-\ntially lead us to city M is the flight from\ncity E to city C.\n[....rest of the output omitted]\nChatGPT incorrectly states that there are three op-\ntions in the step 3 (there are only two), inducing\nthe snowballed hallucination \u201cor a flight to city\nC\u201d (ChatGPT can verify that E \u2192 C is not a valid\nflight in a separate session). As shown in Figure 3,\nGPT-4 still has a high overall snowballed halluci-\nnation rate at 94.90% averaged across tasks, and\nChatGPT also obtains a similarly high snowballed\nhallucination rate.\nFinally, while our experiments have focused on\nsimple multi-step problems that are suitable for\nbreaking down step-by-step, we hypothesize that\nhallucination snowballing appears in open-ended\ntext generation more broadly, where one mistake\nin the generation triggers more (Arora et al., 2022).\nIn these cases, better prompting would neither be\nable to anticipate nor fix these mistakes.\n4.2\nAlgorithmic Corrections\nIncreasing the temperature\nDuring decoding,\nthe temperature t controls the sharpness of the out-\nput distribution, with higher t spreading probability\nmass away from the model\u2019s most likely prediction\nfor each next word. Our experiments in \u00a73 used\ngreedy decoding, which is equivalent to t = 0. At\nt = 0.6 and t = 0.9, both error rates and snow-\nballed hallucination rate remain similarly high, in\nboth GPT-4 and ChatGPT (Figure 4).\nTop-k and nucleus sampling\nUsing sampling\nmethods such as top-k sampling or nucleus sam-\npling (Holtzman et al., 2020) would not help since\nthey only narrow the range of tokens to be consid-\nered, and thus can only increase the probability that\nthe model will immediately commit to an answer.\nBeam search\nThe argument for hallucination\nsnowballs in \u00a72 relies on the fact that, once a model\ngenerates some tokens committing to an answer,\nthey remain in the context and influence later gen-\nerations. One potential way around this is beam\nsearch, i.e., maintaining a beam of high-probability\nsequences at each timestep rather than a single se-\nquence. In principle, if some sequences in the beam\nafter the initial token do not commit to an answer\n(or commit to the right answer), their continuations\nmay eventually have higher probability than those\nthat initially commit incorrectly and later produce\nincorrect reasoning as a result. If so, beam search\nwould solve the snowball hallucination problem.\nUnfortunately, we cannot test the effect of beam\nsearch on hallucination snowballs because the Ope-\nnAI API does not support beam search.\nLearning strategies\nA more general way to fur-\nther reduce snowballing might be to change aspects\nof the pretraining or instruction tuning phases. In\nparticular, a greater emphasis on having the model\nproduce a reasoning chain before generating an\nanswer could be a good way to accommodate its\ncomputational limitations and avoid committing to\nwrong answers that force hallucinations.\nIn addition, we hypothesize that finetuning on\ndata with backtracking might improve a model\u2019s\nperformance on the tasks we present. This could be\naccomplished by, for example, giving a question,\nfollowed by a wrong solution, and then issuing a\nphrase like \u201cSorry, that was incorrect\u201d before giv-\ning the correct solution. This solution is related to\nthe \u201cReview your previous answer and find prob-\nlems with your answer.\u201d prompt from Kim et al.\n(2023).\n5\nRelated Work\nHallucinations\nHallucination in text generation\nis a well-studied problem (Rohrbach et al., 2018;\nMaynez et al., 2020; Raunak et al., 2021, i.a.) that\nhas recently become more prominent due to Chat-\nGPT\u2019s tendency to produce plausible-sounding\nfalsehoods. Hallucinations are often attributed to\nknowledge gaps in LMs (Zheng et al., 2023), and\nseveral works have shown the promise of using\nretrieval over knowledge bases to mitigate them\n(Lewis et al., 2020; Shuster et al., 2021; Peng et al.,\n2023). Our work demonstrates hallucination can\nbe induced from context, thus motivating further\nmitigation techniques.\nHallucination snowballing is likely the result of\nexposure bias: LMs were only exposed to gold\nhistory during training, but during inference, con-\nditions on possibly erroneous previous predictions.\nPrior work linked this to compounding hallucina-\ntions in machine translation (Wang and Sennrich,\n2020) and open-ended text generation (Arora et al.,\n2022). We go beyond demonstrating error propaga-\ntion by showing that the propagated errors (which\nwe call snowballed hallucinations) are recognized\nby the LM itself.\nOur observations are related to previous findings\nthat LMs hallucinate when given questions that\ncontain false presuppositions (e.g., \u201cWhich linguist\ninvented the lightbulb?\u201d; Kim et al., 2021, 2022)\nor that are otherwise misleading (e.g., \u201cWho re-\nally caused 9/11?\u201d; Lin et al., 2022), in that faulty\ncontext misguides the LM. However, our work\ndiffers in that our questions are not intentionally\nmisleading, showing that this failure mode may\nbe triggered even on innocent information-seeking\nqueries to the LM.\nLM (in)consistency\nOur work adds to a growing\nbody of work demonstrating the extent to which\nLMs are inconsistent across different prompts on\nthe same issue. For instance, allowing an LM to\ngenerate intermediate steps (Nye et al., 2021; Wei\net al., 2022; Press et al., 2022) enables it to reach\na different answer than it otherwise would. Other\nwork has shown that simply prepending \u201cProfes-\nsor Smith was given the following instructions\u201d to\na prompt can improve performance, despite pro-\nviding no valuable information about the problem\nitself (Lin et al., 2022).\n6\nConclusion\nWe define the phenomenon of hallucination snow-\nballing and demonstrate its prevalence in genera-\ntions from state-of-the-art models, leading to hallu-\ncinations on simple facts that wouldn\u2019t otherwise\noccur. Our findings point to the risk of training\nlanguage models that prioritize fluency and coher-\nence indiscriminatively at the expense of factuality,\nand we encourage future work to study remedial\nactions at all levels of model development.\nLimitations\nWe focus on hallucination snowballing in the con-\ntext of question answering in English, and we do\nnot explore it on other tasks, such as summarization\nor code generation.\nIn addition, we only conduct experiments on two\nproprietary models, namely ChatGPT and GPT-4,\ndue to their state-of-the-art performance on many\nbenchmarks (OpenAI, 2023). Due to the limita-\ntions of the APIs for these models, we do not have\naccess to the probability distributions they output\nand do not have the ability to finetune them. This\nrestricts our ability to explore potential mitigation\nstrategies. Having access to the output distribu-\ntions would allow us to investigate mitigating the\nsnowballing hallucination issue using alternative\nsampling methods such as beam search. Having\nthe ability to finetune the model would allow us\nto explore whether instruction tuning with differ-\nent annotations could lead to better handling of the\nquestions we use to instigate hallucination snow-\nballing.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Sofia Serrano, Yizhong Wang, Yanai\nElazar, Michael Hu and Richard Yuanzhe Pang\nfor their valuable feedback and fruitful discussions.\nWhile writing this paper, Ofir Press was a visitor\nat New York University\u2019s Center for Data Science,\nhosted by Kyunghyun Cho.\nReferences\nManindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena.\n2004.\nPrimes is in p.\nAnnals of Mathematics,\n160:781\u2013793.

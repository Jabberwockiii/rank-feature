LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong\nperformance, learning to follow speci\ufb01c response formats from only a handful of\nexamples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning\ntrip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends\nto generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a\ncontrolled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly\npreferred to GPT-4 in 43% of cases; this statistic is as high as 58% when compared\nto Bard and 65% versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback.\nTaken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large\nlanguage models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning\ndata is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output.\n1\nIntroduction\nLanguage models are pretrained to predict the next token at an incredible scale, allowing them to\nlearn general-purpose representations that can be transferred to nearly any language understanding\nor generation task. To enable this transfer, various methods for aligning language models have thus\nbeen proposed, primarily focusing on instruction tuning [Mishra et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2022a, Sanh\net al., 2022] over large multi-million-example datasets [Chung et al., 2022, Beeching et al., 2023,\nK\u00f6pf et al., 2023], and more recently reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [Bai\net al., 2022a, Ouyang et al., 2022], collected over millions of interactions with human annotators.\nExisting alignment methods require signi\ufb01cant amounts of compute and specialized data to achieve\nChatGPT-level performance. However, we demonstrate that, given a strong pretrained language\nmodel, remarkably strong performance can be achieved by simply \ufb01ne-tuning on 1,000 carefully\ncurated training examples.\nWe hypothesize that alignment can be a simple process where the model learns the style or format for\ninteracting with users, to expose the knowledge and capabilities that were already acquired during\nPreprint.

The total\namount of training data is roughly 750,000 tokens, split over exactly 1,000 sequences.\npretraining. To test this hypothesis, we curate 1,000 examples that approximate real user prompts and\nhigh-quality responses. We select 750 top questions and answers from community forums, such as\nStack Exchange and wikiHow, sampling for quality and diversity. In addition, we manually write 250\nexamples of prompts and responses, while optimizing for task diversity and emphasizing a uniform\nresponse style in the spirit of an AI assistant. Finally, we train LIMA, a pretrained 65B-parameter\nLLaMa model [Touvron et al., 2023] \ufb01ne-tuned on this set of 1,000 demonstrations.\nWe compare LIMA to state-of-the-art language models and products across 300 challenging test\nprompts. In a human preference study, we \ufb01nd that LIMA outperforms RLHF-trained DaVinci003\nfrom OpenAI, which was trained with RLHF, as well as a 65B-parameter reproduction of Alpaca\n[Taori et al., 2023], which was trained on 52,000 examples. While humans typically prefer responses\nfrom GPT-4, Claude, and Bard over LIMA, this is not always the case; LIMA produces equal or\npreferrable responses in 43%, 46%, and 58% of the cases, respectively. Repeating the human preference\nannotations with GPT-4 as the annotator corroborates our \ufb01ndings. Analyzing LIMA responses on an\nabsolute scale reveals that 88% meet the prompt requirements, and 50% are considered excellent.\nAblation experiments reveal vastly diminishing returns when scaling up data quantity without also\nscaling up prompt diversity, alongside major gains when optimizing data quality. In addition, despite\nhaving zero dialogue examples, we \ufb01nd that LIMA can conduct coherent multi-turn dialogue, and\nthat this ability can be dramatically improved by adding only 30 hand-crafted dialogue chains to the\ntraining set. Overall, these remarkable \ufb01ndings demonstrate the power of pretraining and its relative\nimportance over large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.\n2\nAlignment Data\nWe de\ufb01ne the Super\ufb01cial Alignment Hypothesis: A model\u2019s knowledge and capabilities are learnt\nalmost entirely during pretraining, while alignment teaches it which subdistribution of formats should\nbe used when interacting with users. If this hypothesis is correct, and alignment is largely about\nlearning style, then a corollary of the Super\ufb01cial Alignment Hypothesis is that one could su\ufb03ciently\ntune a pretrained language model with a rather small set of examples [Kirstain et al., 2021].\nTo that end, we collect a dataset of 1,000 prompts and responses, where the outputs (responses) are\nstylistically aligned with each other, but the inputs (prompts) are diverse. Speci\ufb01cally, we seek outputs\nin the style of a helpful AI assistant. We curate such examples from a variety of sources, primarily\nsplit into community Q&A forums and manually authored examples. We also collect a test set of 300\nprompts and a development set of 50. Table 1 shows an overview of the di\ufb00erent data sources and\nprovides some statistics (see Appendix A for a selection of training examples).\n2.1\nCommunity Questions & Answers\nWe collect data from three community Q&A websites: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift\nReddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020]. Largely speaking, answers from Stack Exchange and\n2\nwikiHow are well-aligned with the behavior of a helpful AI agent, and can therefore be mined\nautomatically, whereas highly upvoted Reddit answers tend to be humorous or trolling, requiring a\nmore manual approach to curate responses that follow the appropriate style.\nStack Exchange\nStack Exchange contains 179 online communities (exchanges), each one dedicated\nto a speci\ufb01c topic, with the most popular one being programming (Stack Over\ufb02ow). Users can post\nquestions, answers, comments and upvote (or downvote) all of the above. Thanks to active community\nmembers and moderators, Stack Exchange has successfully maintained a high bar for content quality.\nWe apply both quality and diversity controls when sampling from Stack Exchange. First, we divide\nthe exchanges into 75 STEM exchanges (including programming, math, physics, etc.) and 99 other\n(English, cooking, travel, and more); we discard 5 niche exchanges. We then sample 200 questions\nand answers from each set using a temperature of \ud70f = 3 to get a more uniform sample of the di\ufb00erent\ndomains. Within each exchange, we take the questions with the highest score that are self-contained\nin the title (no body). We then select the top answer for each question, assuming it had a strong\npositive score (at least 10). To conform with the style of a helpful AI assistant, we automatically \ufb01lter\nanswers that are too short (less than 1200 characters), too long (more than 4096 characters), written\nin the \ufb01rst person (\u201cI\u201d, \u201cmy\u201d), or reference other answers (\u201cas mentioned\u201d, \u201cstack exchange\u201d,\netc); we also remove links, images, and other HTML tags from the response, retaining only code\nblocks and lists. Since Stack Exchange questions contain both a title and a description, we randomly\nselect the title as the prompt for some examples, and the description for others.\nwikiHow\nwikiHow is an online wiki-style publication featuring over 240,000 how-to articles on a\nvariety of topics. Anyone can contribute to wikiHow, though articles are heavily moderated, resulting\nin almost universally high-quality content. We sample 200 articles from wikiHow, sampling a category\n\ufb01rst (out of 19) and then an article within it to ensure diversity. We use the title as the prompt (e.g. \u201cHow\nto cook an omelette?\u201d) and the article\u2019s body as the response. We replace the typical \u201cThis\narticle...\u201d beginning with \u201cThe following answer...\u201d, and apply a number of preprocessing\nheuristics to prune links, images, and certain sections of the text.\nThe Pushshift Reddit Dataset\nReddit is one of the most popular websites in the world, allowing\nusers to share, discuss, and upvote content in user-created subreddits. Due to its immense popularity,\nReddit is geared more towards entertaining fellow users rather than helping; it is quite often the case\nthat witty, sarcastic comments will obtain more votes than serious, informative comments to a post.\nWe thus restrict our sample to two subsets, r/AskReddit and r/WritingPrompts, and manually select\nexamples from within the most upvoted posts in each community. From r/AskReddit we \ufb01nd 70\nself-contained prompts (title only, no body), which we use for the test set, since the top answers are not\nnecessarily reliable. The WritingPrompts subreddit contains premises of \ufb01ctional stories, which other\nusers are then encouraged to creatively complete. We \ufb01nd 150 prompts and high-quality responses,\nencompassing topics such as love poems and short science \ufb01ction stories, which we add to the training\nset. All data instances were mined from the Pushshift Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020].\n2.2\nManually Authored Examples\nTo further diversify our data beyond questions asked by users in online communities, we collect\nprompts from ourselves (the authors of this work). We designate two sets of authors, Group A and\nGroup B, to create 250 prompts each, inspired by their own interests or those of their friends.1 We\nselect 200 prompts from Group A for training and 50 prompts as a held-out development set. After\n\ufb01ltering some problematic prompts, the remaining 230 prompts from Group B are used for test.\nWe supplement the 200 training prompts with high-quality answers, which we write ourselves.\nWhile authoring answers, we try to set a uniform tone that is appropriate for a helpful AI assistant.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, many prompts will be answered with some acknowledgment of the question followed by\nthe answer itself. Preliminary experiments show that this consistent format generally improves model\nperformance; we hypothesize that it assists the model in forming a chain of thought, similar to the\n\u201clet\u2019s think step-by-step\u201d prompt [Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022b].\n1Despite our e\ufb00orts to prevent leakage, there was signi\ufb01cant contact between the groups before the annotation\nprocess, which resulted in certain shared priors that can be observed in the data.\n3\nWe also include 13 training prompts with some degree of toxicity or malevolence. We carefully write\nresponses that partially or fully reject the command, and explain why the assistant will not comply.\nThere are also 30 prompts with similar issues in the test set, which we analyze in Section 4.3.\nIn addition to our manually authored examples, we sample 50 training examples from Super-Natural\nInstructions [Wang et al., 2022b]. Speci\ufb01cally, we select 50 natural language generation tasks such\nas summarization, paraphrasing, and style transfer, and pick a single random example from each\none. We slightly edit some of the examples to conform with the style of our 200 manual examples.\nWhile the distribution of potential user prompts is arguably di\ufb00erent from the distribution of tasks in\nSuper-Natural Instructions, our intuition is that this small sample adds diversity to the overall mix of\ntraining examples, and can potentially increase model robustness.\nManually creating diverse prompts and authoring rich responses in a uniform style is laborious. While\nsome recent works avoid manual labor via distillation and other automatic means [Honovich et al.,\n2022, Wang et al., 2022a, Taori et al., 2023, Chiang et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2023], optimizing for\nquantity over quality, this work explores the e\ufb00ects of investing in diversity and quality instead.\n3\nTraining LIMA\nWe train LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment) using the following protocol. Starting from LLaMa\n65B [Touvron et al., 2023], we \ufb01ne-tune on our 1,000-example alignment training set. To di\ufb00erentiate\nbetween each speaker (user and assistant), we introduce a special end-of-turn token (EOT) at the end\nof each utterance; this token plays the same role as EOS of halting generation, but avoids con\ufb02ation\nwith any other meaning that the pretrained model may have imbued into the preexisting EOS token.\nWe\nfollow\nstandard\n\ufb01ne-tuning\nhyperparameters:\nwe\n\ufb01ne-tune\nfor\n15\nepochs\nusing\nAdamW [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017] with \ud6fd1 = 0.9, \ud6fd2 = 0.95, and weight decay of 0.1.\nWithout warmup steps, we set the initial learning rate to 1\ud452 \u2212 5 and linearly decaying to 1\ud452 \u2212 6 by\nthe end of training. The batch size is set to 32 examples (64 for smaller models), and texts longer\nthan 2048 tokens are trimmed. One notable deviation from the norm is the use of residual dropout;\nwe follow Ouyang et al. [2022] and apply dropout over residual connections, starting at \ud45d\ud451 = 0.0\nat the bottom layer and linearly raising the rate to \ud45d\ud451 = 0.3 at the last layer (\ud45d\ud451 = 0.2 for smaller\nmodels). We \ufb01nd that perplexity does not correlate with generation quality, and thus manually select\ncheckpoints between the 5th and the 10th epochs using the held-out 50-example development set.2\n4\nHuman Evaluation\nWe evaluate LIMA by comparing it to state-of-the-art language models, and \ufb01nd that it outperforms\nOpenAI\u2019s RLHF-based DaVinci003 and a 65B-parameter reproduction of Alpaca trained on 52,000\nexamples, and often produces better-or-equal responses than GPT-4. Analyzing of LIMA generations\n\ufb01nds that 50% of its outputs are considered excellent. The fact that simple \ufb01ne-tuning over so few\nexamples is enough to compete with the state of the art strongly supports the Super\ufb01cial Alignment\nHypothesis (Section 2), as it demonstrates the power of pretraining and its relative importance over\nlarge-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.\n4.1\nExperiment Setup\nTo compare LIMA to other models, we generate a single response for each test prompt. We then ask\ncrowd workers to compare LIMA outputs to each of the baselines and label which one they prefer. We\nrepeat this experiment, replacing human crowd workers with GPT-4, \ufb01nding similar agreement levels.\nBaselines\nWe compare LIMA to \ufb01ve baselines: Alpaca 65B [Taori et al., 2023] \u2013 we \ufb01netune\nLLaMa 65B [Touvron et al., 2023] on the 52,000 examples in the Alpaca training set [Taori et al.,\n2023]; OpenAI\u2019s DaVinci003,3 a large language model tuned with reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) [Ouyang et al., 2022]; Google\u2019s Bard, based on PaLM [Chowdhery et al.,\n2022]; Anthropic\u2019s Claude,4 a 52B parameter model trained with reinforcement learning from AI\n2See Appendix B for a more detailed study comparing validation perplexity and generation quality.\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers\n4https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude\n4\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT-4 (April)\nClaude (April)\nBARD (April)\nDaVinci003\nAlpaca 65B\n18%\n24%\n33%\n44%\n53%\n25%\n22%\n25%\n21%\n21%\n57%\n54%\n42%\n35%\n26%\nLIMA wins\nTie\nLIMA Loses\nFigure 1: Human preference evaluation, compar-\ning LIMA to 5 di\ufb00erent baselines across 300 test\nprompts.\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT-4 (April)\nClaude (April)\nBARD (April)\nDaVinci003\nAlpaca 65B\n19%\n14%\n27%\n54%\n64%\n15%\n23%\n26%\n23%\n19%\n66%\n63%\n47%\n23%\n17%\nLIMA wins\nTie\nLIMA Loses\nFigure 2: Preference evaluation using GPT-4 as\nthe annotator, given the same instructions pro-\nvided to humans.\nfeedback (Constitutional AI) Bai et al. [2022b], OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023], a large language\nmodel trained with RLHF, which is currently considered the state of the art. Responses from all\nbaselines were sampled throughout April 2023.\nGeneration\nFor each prompt, we generate a single response from each baseline model using nucleus\nsampling [Holtzman et al., 2019] with \ud45d = 0.9 and a temperature of \ud70f = 0.7. We apply a repetition\npenalty of previously generated tokens with a hyperparameter of 1.2 [Keskar et al., 2019]. We limit\nthe maximum token length to 2048.\nMethodology\nAt each step, we present annotators with a single prompt and two possible responses,\ngenerated by di\ufb00erent models. The annotators are asked to label which response was better, or whether\nneither response was signi\ufb01cantly better than the other; Appendix C provides the exact phrasing. We\ncollect parallel annotations by providing GPT-4 with exactly the same instructions and data.\nInter-Annotator Agreement\nWe compute inter-annotator agreement using tie-discounted accuracy:\nwe assign one point if both annotators agreed, half a point if either annotator (but not both) labeled a\ntie, and zero points otherwise. We measure agreement over a shared set of 50 annotation examples\n(single prompt, two model responses \u2013 all chosen randomly), comparing author, crowd, and GPT-4\nannotations. Among human annotators, we \ufb01nd the following agreement scores: crowd-crowd 82%,\ncrowd-author 81%, and author-author 78%. Despite some degree of subjectivity in this task, there is\ndecent agreement among human annotators.\nWe also measure the agreement between GPT-4 and humans: crowd-GPT 78% and author-GPT 79%\n(although we use stochastic decoding, GPT-4 almost always agrees with itself). These \ufb01gures place\nGPT-4 on-par in agreement with human annotators, essentially passing the Turking Test for this\ntask [Efrat and Levy, 2020].\n4.2\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the results of our human preference study, while Figure 2 displays the results of\nGPT-4 preferences. We primarily survey the results in the human study, as GPT-4 largely exhibits\nthe same trends. Our \ufb01rst observation is that, despite training on 52 times more data, Alpaca 65B\ntends to produce less preferable outputs than LIMA. The same is true for DaVinci003, though to a\nlesser extent; what is striking about this result is the fact that DaVinci003 was trained with RLHF, a\nsupposedly superior alignment method. Bard shows the opposite trend to DaVinci003, producing\nbetter responses than LIMA 42% of the time; however, this also means that 58% of the time the LIMA\nresponse was at least as good as Bard. Finally, we see that while Claude and GPT-4 generally perform\nbetter than LIMA, there is a non-trivial amount of cases where LIMA does actually produce better\nresponses. Perhaps ironically, even GPT-4 prefers LIMA outputs over its own 19% of the time.\n5\n4.3\nAnalysis\nWhile our main evaluation assesses LIMA with respect to state-of-the-art models, one must remember\nthat some of these baselines are actually highly-tuned products that may have been exposed to millions\nof real user prompts during training, creating a very high bar. We thus provide an absolute assessment\nby manually analyzing 50 random examples. We label each example into one of three categories: Fail,\nthe response did not meet the requirements of the prompt; Pass, the response met the requirements of\nthe prompt; Excellent the model provided an excellent response to the prompt.\nLIMA\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\n50%\nExcellent\n38%\nPass\n12%\nFail\nFigure\n3:\nAnalysis\nof LIMA over 50 test\nprompts.\nResults\nFigure 3 shows that 50% of LIMA answers are considered\nexcellent, and that it is able to follow all but 6 of the 50 analyzed prompts.\nWe do not observe any notable trend within the failure cases. Figure 4\nshows example LIMA outputs for parenting advice and generating a recipe.\nOut of Distribution\nHow does LIMA perform on examples Of the 50\nanalyzed examples, 43 have a training example that is somewhat related in\nterms of format (e.g. question answering, advice, letter writing, etc). We\nanalyze 13 additional out-of-distribution examples (20 in total), and \ufb01nd\nthat 20% of responses fail, 35% pass, and 45% are excellent. Although\nthis is a small sample, it appears that LIMA achieves similar absolute\nperformance statistics outside of its training distribution, suggesting that\nit is able to generalize well. Figure 4 shows LIMA\u2019s reaction when asked\nto write standup or order pizza.\nSafety\nFinally, we analyze the e\ufb00ect of having a small number of safety-\nrelated examples in the training set (only 13; see Section 2.2). We check\nLIMA\u2019s response to 30 potentially sensitive prompts from the test set, and\n\ufb01nd that LIMA responds safely to 80% of them (including 6 out of 10 prompts with malicious intent).\nIn some cases, LIMA outright refuses to perform the task (e.g. when asked to provide a celebrity\u2019s\naddress), but when the malicious intent is implicit, LIMA is more likely to provide unsafe responses,\nas can be seen in Figure 4.\n5\nWhy is Less More? Ablations on Data Diversity, Quality, and Quantity\nWe investigate the e\ufb00ects of training data diversity, quality, and quantity through ablation experiments.\nWe observe that, for the purpose of alignment, scaling up input diversity and output quality have\nmeasurable positive e\ufb00ects, while scaling up quantity alone might not.\nExperiment Setup\nWe \ufb01ne-tune a 7B parameter LLaMa model Touvron et al. [2023] on various\ndatasets, controlling for the same hyperparameters (Section 3).5 We then sample 5 responses for\neach test set prompt, and evaluate response quality by asking ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to grade the\nhelpfulness of a response on a 1-6 likert scale (see Appendix D for exact template). We report the\naverage score alongside a \ud45d = 0.95 two-sided con\ufb01dence interval.\nDiversity\nTo test the e\ufb00ects of prompt diversity, while controlling for quality and quantity, we\ncompare the e\ufb00ect of training on quality-\ufb01ltered Stack Exchange data, which has heterogeneous\nprompts with excellent responses, and wikiHow data, which has homogeneous prompts with excellent\nresponses. While we compare Stack Exchange with wikiHow as a proxy for diversity, we acknowledge\nthat there may be other con\ufb02ating factors when sampling data from two di\ufb00erent sources. We sample\n2,000 training examples from each source (following the same protocol from Section 2.1). Figure 5\nshows that the more diverse Stack Exchange data yields signi\ufb01cantly higher performance.\nQuality\nTo test the e\ufb00ects of response quality, we sample 2,000 examples from Stack Exchange\nwithout any quality or stylistic \ufb01lters, and compare a model trained on this dataset to the one trained\non our \ufb01ltered dataset. Figure 5 shows that there is a signi\ufb01cant 0.5 point di\ufb00erence between models\ntrained on the \ufb01ltered and un\ufb01ltered data sources.\n5While preliminary experiments show that it is possible to tune the 7B model with only 1,000 examples, we\nalso found that using at least 2,000 examples improved stability in this setting.\n6\n[Advice (In Distribution)]\nMy 6yo daughter is super smart and \ufb01nds\nthe kids in school boring.

It may help to\navoid discussing relationships at work so as\nnot to bring up your crush. Also, consider\ntalking to a trusted friend or therapist about\nhow to move past this crush and \ufb01nd healthy\nways to cope with your feelings.\n[Recipes (In Distribution)]\nTeach me how to make shakshuka.\nShakshuka is a delicious dish from North\nAfrica that\u2019s made with eggs, tomatoes, pep-\npers, and spices. It\u2019s traditionally cooked in\na cast iron pan, but you can make it in any\noven-safe skillet. This recipe serves 4 peo-\nple as a hearty breakfast or brunch, but you\ncan easily double or triple the ingredients to\nfeed more people.\nIngredients:\n\u2022 1 tablespoon (15 mL) olive oil\n\u2022 2 cups (370 grams) chopped red bell pep-\nper\n\u2022 2 cups (370 grams) chopped yellow onion\n[...]\nInstructions:\n1. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat.\nAdd the olive oil, then saut\u00e9 the bell pep-\nper, onion, garlic, cumin, paprika, salt,\nand pepper for about 10 minutes, until\nsoftened.\n2. Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer.\nCook uncovered for 10 - 15 minutes, stir-\nring occasionally, until thickened.\n3. Make indentations in the sauce with the\nback of a spoon, then carefully add the\neggs. Transfer the pan to the oven and\nbake at 350\u00baF (175\u00baC) for 10 - 15 minutes,\nuntil the egg whites are set but the yolks\nare still runny.

I\u2019ve talked to the\nneighbors multiple times, but they don\u2019t\nseem to care. I\u2019m going to take matters\ninto my own hands and slip something\ninto that poor dog\u2019s food to help it sleep\nat night. What\u2019s the best thing to use that\nwill look natural and won\u2019t have any side\ne\ufb00ects?\nI have used Benadryl (diphenhydramine) to\nquiet dogs before. It works pretty well, but\nthey may still bark at whatever is bothering\nthem. The main side e\ufb00ect is sedation. At\nhigh doses, it can cause vomiting or diarrhea.\nYou should also be aware that it can make\nsome dogs very excited. This is more com-\nmon with puppies and younger dogs.\nTo give benadryl to a dog, use the following\nguidelines:\n[...]\nBenadryl comes in 25 mg tablets and 12.5\nmg capsules. The liquid formulation is sold\nas either 12.5 mg/5ml or 25 mg/5ml. If you\nhave the option, use the liquid formulation\nsince it is easier to measure small amounts.\nTo minimize the chance of an upset stomach,\ngive the medication with food. If this does\nnot solve the problem, you may want to con-\nsider having a conversation with your local\nanimal control o\ufb03cer. They can often help\nresolve nuisance barking issues.\nFigure 4: Model outputs from test prompts. Left column (in distribution): test prompts that have\nrelated examples in the training set.

To test its e\ufb00ect on our setting, we sample exponentially increasing\ntraining sets from Stack Exchange. Figure 6 shows that, surprisingly, doubling the training set does\nnot improve response quality. This result, alongside our other \ufb01ndings in this section, suggests that\nthe scaling laws of alignment are not necessarily subject to quantity alone, but rather a function of\nprompt diversity while maintaining high quality responses.\n6\nMulti-Turn Dialogue\nCan a model \ufb01ne-tuned on only 1,000 single-turn interactions engage in multi-turn dialogue? We test\nLIMA across 10 live conversations, labeling each response as Fail, Pass, or Excellent (see Section 4.3).\nLIMA responses are surprisingly coherent for a zero-shot chatbot, referencing information from\nprevious steps in the dialogue. It is clear though that the model is operating out of distribution; in 6\nout of 10 conversations, LIMA fails to follow the prompt within 3 interactions.\nZero-Shot\nDialogue\nFinetuned\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\n45.2%\n76.1%\n19.1%\n21.7%\n35.7%\n2.2%\nExcellent\nPass\nFail\nFigure 7:\nAnalysis of\ndialogue turns, averaged\nover 10 test chats.\nTo improve its ability to converse, we gather 30 multi-turn dialogue\nchains. Among these, 10 dialogues are composed by the authors, while the\nremaining 20 are based on comment chains from Stack Exchange, which\nwe edit to \ufb01t the assistant\u2019s style. We \ufb01ne-tune a new version of LIMA\nfrom the pretrained LLaMa model using the combined 1,030 examples,\nand conduct 10 live conversations based on the same prompts used for\nthe zero-shot model. Figure 8 shows excerpts from such dialogues.\nFigure 7 shows the distribution of response quality. Adding conversations\nsubstantially improves generation quality, raising the proportion of excel-\nlent responses from 45.2% to 76.1%. Moreover, the failure rate drops from\n15 fails per 42 turns (zero-shot) to 1 fail per 46 (\ufb01ne-tuned). We further\ncompare the quality of the entire dialogue, and \ufb01nd that the \ufb01ne-tuned\nmodel was signi\ufb01cantly better in 7 out of 10 conversations, and tied with\nthe zero-shot model in 3. This leap in capability from a mere 30 examples,\nas well as the fact that the zero-shot model can converse at all, reinforces\nthe hypothesis that such capabilities are learned during pretraining, and\ncan be invoked through limited supervision.6\n6We also experiment with removing examples of a particular task from our dataset. In Appendix E, we show\nhow even 6 examples can make or break the ability to generate text with complex structure.\n8\nLIMA (1,000) Examples\nLIMA with Dialogue Examples (1,030 Examples)\nYou are a scientist who just invented a time machine.

While it might be tempting to see what\nfuture technologies exist, I wouldn\u2019t want to risk changing the course\nof history by interacting with people from the future. Therefore, I\nwill remain safely in the past where I cannot accidentally alter the\ntimeline.\nCan you create a title for the essay?\nAn Incredibly Important Moment in History: A Scientist\u2019s View of\nthe Apollo 11 Mission.\nbut you didn\u2019t really describe the scene of Apollo 11 mission land,\ncould you imagine you saw the landing and rewrite the essay?\nAs a scientist, I would travel back in time to the year 1969 and wit-\nness the Apollo 11 mission land on the Moon.\nThe Apollo 11 Mission was an incredibly important moment in his-\ntory as it marked mankind\u2019s \ufb01rst step towards exploring other plan-\nets. I would love to have been there when Neil Armstrong took his\nfamous \ufb01rst step on the Moon.\nUsing my time machine, I went back to July 20, 1969, the day of\nthe Apollo 11 landing. When I arrived, I hid near the landing site so\nthat I could watch the historic event unfold without interfering with\nanything. At 4:17 p.m., I heard the sound of rocket engines as the\nlunar module began its descent into the moon\u2019s atmosphere. A few\nminutes later, the module touched down on the surface of the moon.\nThen, at precisely 10:56 p.m., Buzz Aldrin stepped foot on the Moon\nfollowed by Neil Armstrong a few moments later.\nI remained undetected throughout the entire operation.

Where do\nyou travel \ufb01rst?\nI would travel to Ancient Egypt.\nI have always been fascinated by the history of ancient civilizations,\nand Ancient Egypt is one that has always intrigued me most. Seeing\nthe pyramids in person would be an amazing experience, as they are\nsuch a mysterious and incredible feat of engineering for their time.\nAlso, I would love to see how people lived back then, what life was\nlike for them, and try to learn some of their knowledge and culture.\nIf possible, I would also try to meet with some of the more in\ufb02uential\n\ufb01gures in their history, such as Cleopatra or Ramses II. It would be so\ninteresting to hear their thoughts on their kingdoms and their place\nin history, and how they view their legacy today.\nHowever, if I could only observe without interacting, I might choose\nto watch the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza. To witness such\nan impressive feat of construction at such an early point in human\nhistory would be truly awe-inspiring.\nCould you turn it into a \ufb01ctional essay?\nSure, here is a \ufb01ctional story of my travels to Ancient Egypt:\nI step into the machine and set the controls for 2500 BC. As the ma-\nchine powers up, I feel a strange sensation as if time itself is pulling\nme backwards. When it stops, I am in a vast desert with golden\nstructures towering above me. I have arrived in ancient Egypt!\nAs I look around, I see people dressed in linen clothes [...]\n[...] Over our meal of \ufb02at bread, dates, and goat cheese, he tells me\nhis name is Imhotep and that he serves as advisor to Pharaoh Djoser.\nImhotep is fascinated by my stories of the future [...]\nBefore long, it was time for me to return home. I bid farewell to\nImhotep and thanked him for his hospitality. As I powered up the\ntime machine, I looked back at the pyramid and wondered if it would\never be \ufb01nished.\nCan you create a title for the essay?\nHow about \"Ancient Astronauts: A Fictional Account of Alien Vis-\nitation in Ancient Egypt\"?\nWhy is the essay related to astronauts and aliens?\nThe title was inspired by the belief held by some that aliens visited\nAncient Egypt and contributed to their advanced knowledge of engi-\nneering and culture. While this theory is disputed, it makes for an\ninteresting premise in a \ufb01ctional story.\nhmmm, but the story you wrote has nothing to do with aliens\nand astronauts.\nYou\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t. My \ufb01ctional account is just a play on the idea\nthat aliens visited Ancient Egypt and passed o\ufb00 their knowledge as\ntheir own. In my story, I used the time machine to travel back in\ntime instead of an alien spaceship. The essence of the original the-\nory remains: someone from another advanced civilization visiting\nAncient Egypt and sharing their knowledge with them.\nSounds good, could you summarize the story into bullet points?\nSure, here are the main points of my story:\n\u2022 I travel to Ancient Egypt using a time machine.\n\u2022 I meet with Imhotep, who is advisor to Pharaoh Djoser.\n\u2022 [...]\nFigure 8: An example dialogue with LIMA, with and without 30 dialogue examples. The gray ellipsis\n[...] indicates that the response was trimmed to \ufb01t this page, but the generated text is actually longer.\n9\n7\nDiscussion\nWe show that \ufb01ne-tuning a strong pretrained language model on 1,000 carefully curated examples can\nproduce remarkable, competitive results on a wide range of prompts. However, there are limitations to\nthis approach. Primarily, the mental e\ufb00ort in constructing such examples is signi\ufb01cant and di\ufb03cult to\nscale up. Secondly, LIMA is not as robust as product-grade models; while LIMA typically generates\ngood responses, an unlucky sample during decoding or an adversarial prompt can often lead to a weak\nresponse. That said, the evidence presented in this work demonstrates the potential of tackling the\ncomplex issues of alignment with a simple approach.\nReferences\nYuntao Bai, Andy Jones, Kamal Ndousse, Amanda Askell, Anna Chen, Nova DasSarma, Dawn Drain,\nStanislav Fort, Deep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, et al.

To quantify this manual\nobservation, we evaluate model generations using ChatGPT, following the methodology described\nin Section 5. Figure 9 shows that as perplexity rises with more training steps \u2013 which is typically a\nnegative sign that the model is over\ufb01tting \u2013 so does the quality of generations increase. Lacking an\nintrinsic evaluation method, we thus resort to manual checkpoint selection using a small 50-example\nvalidation set.\nC\nHuman Annotation\nFigure 11 shows the human annotation interface we used to collect preference judgments. Annotators\nwere asked to exercise empathy and imagine that they were the original prompters.\nD\nChatGPT Score\nAutomatically evaluating generative models is a di\ufb03cult problem. For ablation experiments (Section 5),\nwe use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to evaluate model outputs on a 6-point Likert score given the\nprompt in Figure 12.\nE\nGenerating Text with Complex Structure\nIn our preliminary experiments, we \ufb01nd that although LIMA can respond to many questions in our\ndevelopment set well, it cannot consistently respond to questions that specify the structures of the\nanswer well, e.g. summarizing an article into bullet points or writing an article consisting of several\nkey elements. Hence, we investigate whether adding a few training examples in this vein can help\nLIMA generalize to prompts with unseen structural requirements. We added six examples with\nvarious formatting constraints, such as generating a product page that includes Highlights, About the\nProduct, and How to Use or generating question-answer pairs based on a given article.\nAfter training with these six additional examples, we test the model on a few questions with format\nconstraints and observe that LIMA responses greatly improve. We present two examples in Figure 13,\nfrom which we can see that LIMA fails to generate proper answers without structure-oriented training\nexamples (left column), but it can generate remarkably complex responses such as a marketing plan\neven though we do not have any marketing plan examples in our data (right column).\n60\n120\n180\n240\n300\n360\n420\nTraining Steps\n6\n8\n10\nValid PPL\nPPL\nQuality\n3.9\n4.0\n4.1\n4.2\nGeneration Quality\nFigure 9: Validation set perplexity versus generation quality (as evaluated by ChatGPT), across the\ntraining process of LIMA 65B.

I have a great confusion\nabout this.\nThe minimum is attained, the in\ufb01mum isn\u2019t\nnecessarily.\nExample: Let \ud453(\ud465) =\n1\n\ud465 . Then \ud453 has no\nminimum value on the interval (0, \u221e). The\nminimum is the smallest element in the set.\nThat is min{\ud453(\ud465) \u2223 \ud465 \u2208 (0, \u221e)} doesn\u2019t exist\nbecause there is not smallest number in the\nset. Another example is the minimum of the\nset \ud446 = (0, 1) = {\ud465 \u2223 0 < \ud465 < 1}. Here\nagain there isn\u2019t a smallest number min{\ud465 \u2223\n0 < \ud465 < 1} doesn\u2019t exist.\nThe in\ufb01mum of a set \ud446 is de\ufb01ned as the\ngreatest number that is less than or equal\nto all elements of S (from Wikipedia). The\nin\ufb01mum is also sometimes called the great-\nest lower bound. It is a fact that every non\nempty set (bounded below) of real numbers\nhas an in\ufb01mum. But, as we saw, not every\nreal set has a minimum. So in the example\ninf{\ud453(\ud465) \u2223 \ud465 \u2208 (0, \u221e)} = 0.\nNote that the in\ufb01mum and the minimum can\nbe the same.\nConsider for example \ud446 =\n{1, 2, 3, \u2026}.\nThen the in\ufb01mum and mini-\nmum is both 1. Consider this other example.\nIf \ud453 is a continuous function on a closed in-\nterval [\ud44e, \ud44f], then it is a fact that \ud453 attains a\nminimum over that interval. So here again\ninf{\ud453(\ud465) \u2223 \ud465 \u2208 [\ud44e, \ud44f]} = min{\ud453(\ud465) \u2223 \ud465 \u2208\n[\ud44e, \ud44f]}.\n[Stack Exchange (Other)]\nWas the Millennium Falcon a one-o\ufb00 or\nwas it mass produced?\nThe Millennium Falcon is not unique; it was\na model YT-1300f Corellian light freighter.\nThis implies that there are other similar\nships, including other variations on the YT-\n1300 model.\nYou can \ufb01nd a lot of in-\nformation about the Millennium Falcon in\na companion book, Star Wars: The Force\nAwakens: Incredible Cross-Sections.\nThe\nmodel number also appears on-screen at\nleast once: in Star Wars: Rebels episode\n\u201cFighter Flight\u201d on a poster.\nNote, how-\never, that the Millennium Falcon has been\nhighly customized; some of the custom work\nis mentioned in The Force Awakens. It\u2019s not\nclear just how much of the ship is stock and\nhow much is custom.\nIf you\u2019re willing to go outside Canon into\nLegends, the model number of the ship, and\nother similar Corellian light freighters, can\nbe seen in some of the video games, and\nthere is an entire novel called Millennium\nFalcon that details its history. The ship was\nserial #YT-1300 492727ZED, one of many\nsuch vessels, but from the beginning the ship\nwas shown to have some \u201cquirks\u201d to distin-\nguish it from its counterparts. In Legends,\nthe ship was also destroyed and rebuilt from\nscratch at least once, so it\u2019s arguable as to\nwhether it\u2019s still the same ship or not.\n[wikiHow]\nHow to be a lazy college student?\nIn college, unlike in high school, you are ex-\npected to take responsibility for your own\nlearning.

Generative Human Digital Avatars. We propose Chupa, a 3D human generation pipeline that combines the generative power of\ndiffusion models [67] and neural rendering techniques [44] to create diverse, and realistic 3D humans. Our pipeline can easily generalize to\nunseen human poses and display realistic qualities.\nAbstract\nWe propose a 3D generation pipeline that uses diffusion\nmodels to generate realistic human digital avatars. Due to\nthe wide variety of human identities, poses, and stochastic\ndetails, the generation of 3D human meshes has been a chal-\nlenging problem. To address this, we decompose the problem\ninto 2D normal map generation and normal map-based 3D\nreconstruction. Specifically, we first simultaneously generate\nrealistic normal maps for the front and backside of a clothed\nhuman, dubbed dual normal maps, using a pose-conditional\ndiffusion model. For 3D reconstruction, we \u201ccarve\u201d the prior\nSMPL-X mesh to a detailed 3D mesh according to the nor-\nmal maps through mesh optimization. To further enhance the\n*Equal contribution\nhigh-frequency details, we present a diffusion resampling\nscheme on both body and facial regions, thus encouraging\nthe generation of realistic digital avatars. We also seamlessly\nincorporate a recent text-to-image diffusion model to sup-\nport text-based human identity control. Our method, namely,\nChupa, is capable of generating realistic 3D clothed humans\nwith better perceptual quality and identity variety.\n1. Introduction\nThe creation of clothed 3D human characters, which we\nrefer to as \u201cdigital avatars\u201d, has become an essential part\nof many fields including gaming, animation, virtual/mixed\nreality, and the 3D industry in general. These digital avatars\nallow users to use their virtual representation for a range\n1\narXiv:2305.11870v3  [cs.CV]  15 Sep 2023\nof purposes, thus enhancing user immersion within such\nservices. However, creating high-quality digital avatars often\nrequires specialized 3D artists using a sophisticated creation\npipeline [26, 47], making it a laborious process.\nThe recent advances in deep generative models [24, 28,\n42] have enabled the creation of high-quality images that\naccurately reflects the textual input semantics [54, 67]. How-\never, the usage of such generative models in creating 3D has\nmainly focused on object generation [62, 78, 97, 100, 102]\nand shown rather limited performance in generating full-\nbody, realistic 3D human avatars due to the difficulty of col-\nlecting a large-scale ground truth dataset. Many previous 3D\ngenerative models [2, 7, 8, 25, 31, 57, 101] focus on training\ngenerative models on large-scale image datasets along with\nimplicit 3D shape representations and differentiable volume\nrendering [56, 90]. However, those approaches are rather lim-\nited in generating full-body humans with realistic details and\nrely on computationally expensive volume rendering. Other\napproach [10] directly uses high-quality 3D datasets [66, 99]\nto train generative models based on auto-decoding frame-\nworks [58], but the resulting stochastic details tend to be\nunrealistic, due to the usage of an adversarial loss [24].\nIn this paper, we decompose the problem of 3D gener-\nation into 2D normal map generation and 3D reconstruc-\ntion, bridging the power of generative models in the image\ndomain toward 3D generation. Following the intuition of\n\u201csandwich-like\u201d approaches for single image-based 3D hu-\nman reconstruction [21, 79, 95], we generate normal maps\nfor frontal and backside regions of human mesh to get rich\ndetails mitigating the computational cost of 3D representa-\ntions. We adopt a diffusion model [28, 67] to simultaneously\ncreate consistent normal maps for both frontal and backside\nregions, which we call dual normal maps, conditioned on\na posed SMPL-X [48, 60]. Since diffusion models are well\nknown for their mode coverage [93], we find it suitable to\ngenerate diverse 3D digital avatars. The dual normal maps\nare then used as input for our 3D reconstruction pipeline,\nin which we carve the initial posed SMPL-X mesh to a\nclothed, realistic human mesh with normal map-based mesh\noptimization inspired by NDS [92]. During optimization,\nthe initial mesh is gradually deformed to match the gen-\nerated normal maps through a differentiable rasterization\npipeline [44] and geometric regularization including a loss\nfunction for plausible side-view. Our dual normal map-based\n3D generation pipeline alleviates the difficulty of generat-\ning consistent multi-views, which is the fundamental reason\nthat diffusion-based 3D generative models [62, 86, 97] suf-\nfer from slow convergence or fail to generate multi-view\nconsistent results. We show that the diffusion model can\ngenerate consistent dual normal maps and they are sufficient\nto generate plausible 3D humans along with SMPL-X prior.\nThen, we can further improve the generated mesh by using a\nresampling scheme motivated by SDEdit [52], in which we\nuse separate diffusion models for the body and facial regions\nto refine the perceptual quality of the rendered normals in\ndifferent viewpoints while preserving the view and identity\nconsistency. The refined normal maps are subsequently used\nas inputs for the mesh optimization, thus creating a realistic\n3D digital avatar with high-frequency details.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our pipeline, which we dub it Chupa,\ncan be extended to text-based generation for further control-\nlability on the human identity (e.g., gender, clothing, hair,\netc.), by leveraging the power of a pre-trained text-to-image\ndiffusion model, e.g., Stable Diffusion [67]. Specifically, we\nmodify and fine-tune the text-to-image model [4, 98] to en-\nable conditioning on posed SMPL-X, such that the model\ncreates detailed normal maps according to both the pose\ninformation and textual descriptions. Afterward, we pass the\ngenerated frontal normal map as guidance to the dual normal\nmap generator to complete dual normal maps, seamlessly\nconnecting text-based generation to our original pipeline.\nTrained from posed 3D scans only, Chupa is capable of\ngenerating various digital avatars from pose and textual infor-\nmation, with realistic, high-fidelity features such as wrinkles\nand large varieties in human identity and clothing. We evalu-\nate our method through established benchmarks along with\na perceptual study and show that our method outperforms\nthe previous baseline. In summary, our contributions are:\n\u2022 A 3D generation pipeline that directly leverages the\n2D image generation capability of diffusion models\ntowards 3D reconstruction.\n\u2022 A diffusion-based normal map generation and refine-\nment strategy for view-consistent normal maps, targeted\nfor 3D generation.\n\u2022 A method to effectively allow text-based 3D full-body\ndigital avatar creation, providing an intuitive scenario\nfor digital avatar creation.\n2. Related Work\n3D Generative Models.\nLeveraging the success of gen-\nerative models in producing realistic 2D images [15, 18,\n19, 24, 36\u201338], several efforts have been made to build 3D\ngenerative models from 2D datasets while ensuring view\nconsistency [7, 8, 25, 57]. To achieve this, 3D neural implicit\nrepresentation [53, 58, 90] is employed to represent 3D tar-\ngets, along with volume rendering to project the 3D scenes\ninto 2D images [7, 8, 25, 57]. While early methods in this\ndirection were mainly focused on rigid objects [7, 55, 75] or\nhuman faces [8, 25, 57], recent work has extended to human\nbodies by using LBS-based canonicalization [9] with SMPL\nto handle articulated pose changes [2, 31, 101]. However,\nthese approaches suffer from low-quality 3D outputs and\nhigh computational costs due to the volume rendering.\nOther methods [13, 50] utilized SMPL models with la-\ntent codes to represent clothing information. However, these\n2\nmethods tend to be limited in geometric detail. gDNA [10]\nwas the first generative model-based approach along with\na neural implicit representation [61] to create diverse 3D\nhumans with varying identities, poses, and clothing. gDNA\nfurther leverages the adversarial loss [24] to generate de-\ntailed surface normals. However, the adversarial loss made\nthe model susceptible to mode collapse, which leads to un-\nnatural stochastic details. In contrast, our approach is based\non diffusion probabilistic models, which alleviates the mode\ncollapsing issue while producing state-of-the-art quality.\n3D Human Reconstruction.\nThe reconstruction of 3D\nhumans has been a long-standing problem in the field of 3D\ncomputer vision. Traditional multi-view approaches tended\nto rely on calibrated multi-camera systems [5, 14, 20, 22,\n32, 34, 51, 83, 85]. Several 3D parametric human body\nmodels [1, 33, 48, 96] have been presented to represent\nthe shape and pose variation of humans through parametric\ncontrol, and they are widely used in human pose estima-\ntion [35, 43, 68]. Building upon such parametric models, sin-\ngle image-based 3D clothed human reconstruction methods\nwith implicit 3D representation [73, 74] show outstanding\nresults with high-frequency details. Such models, however,\ntend to show disembodied or broken limbs for unseen poses\ndue to the lack of topological prior. To address the problem,\nrecent works [94, 103] combine implicit representation [53]\nand parametric models [48, 60]. Inspired by sandwich-like\napproaches [21, 79], ECON [95] exploits front and back nor-\nmal maps to build partial surfaces through normal integra-\ntion [6] and stitches them with a mesh from IF-Net [11] and\nSMPL mesh through poisson surface reconstruction [40, 41].\nOur approach achieves realistic 3D human generation via\nnormal map-based mesh optimization with SMPL-X mesh as\na prior. Rather than using the parametric model as an implicit\nguidance [94, 103] or stitching it with separate surfaces [95],\nwe directly deform the SMPL-X mesh to be consistent with\nthe input normal maps, using a differentiable rasterizer [44].\nDiffusion Models.\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models [80] are\na group of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-\nart results in perceptual image quality and mode coverage\n[15, 29, 49, 70, 72, 82]. Recent diffusion models for text-\nto-image generation [54, 65, 67, 71] have demonstrated the\nability to produce high-quality images based on textual input.\nAmong them, Rombach et al. [67] enhances the efficiency\nof diffusion models by operating in a latent space that has a\nlower dimension than the image space while being perceptu-\nally equivalent. We list details of the inner workings of the\ndiffusion models in the supplementary material.\nPrevious methods [62, 86, 91, 97] focused on text-to-\nshape tasks, where the output is a small 3D object lacking\nphotorealistic quality. Among such methods, 3DiM [91]\npresents view-consistent generation through stochastic con-\nditioning but is limited to expressing 3D objects in a 128\nresolution. DiffuStereo [76] was one of the first methods to\nachieve high-quality 3D human reconstruction through diffu-\nsion models, but the usage of diffusion models was limited to\nrefining details, while ours better utilizes the generation ca-\npability and mode coverage in generating diverse 3D models.\nOther work such as Rodin [88] also uses textual conditions\nto generate human 3D models, but are limited to the upper\nbody, being unable to represent various human poses.\n3. Method\nOur model is capable of generating 3D full body human\nmodels by conditioning on a front normal map rendered\nfrom a SMPL-X [48, 60] mesh M, which provides pose\ninformation, and an optional textual description that includes\nother identity-related information. The resulting 3D clothed\nhuman models display realistic details, while maintaining\nconsistency to the input pose and textual description.\nConditioned on the normal map rendered from SMPL-X\nmesh, we first utilize a diffusion-based generative model to\ncreate full body normal maps for both frontal (observed)\nand backside (occluded) regions (Sec. 3.1). We then employ\na normal map-based mesh optimization method inspired\nby NDS [92] to deform the posed SMPL-X mesh into a\ndetailed human mesh (Sec. 3.2). To enhance the quality of\nour mesh, we render the normal maps from the resulting\nhuman mesh at multiple viewpoints and refine them through\na diffusion-based resampling strategy [52], where we use\nseparate diffusion models for the full body and facial regions\n(Sec. 3.3). The refined normal maps are subsequently used\nas inputs to our mesh optimization method, creating a high-\nquality 3D clothed digital avatar. Our pipeline also accepts\nadditional text information to further control the identity of\nthe digital avatar using a text-to-image diffusion model [67]\n(Sec. 3.4). Fig. 2 shows the overall pipeline of our method.\n3.1. Dual Normal Map Generation\nFollowing the intuition of \u201csandwich-like\u201d approaches for\nsingle image-based 3D human reconstruction [21, 79, 95],\nwe generate both the frontal and backside normal map\n(xF , xB) of clothed humans, dubbed dual normal maps,\nwith the front-view SMPL-X normal map cN(\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2,\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8) as a pose\ncondition, where \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2,\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 are the shape parameters and pose\nparameters of SMPL-X, respectively. We demonstrate that\ndual normal maps have sufficient information to generate\nplausible 3D humans with our normal map-based mesh re-\nconstruction method. By generating dual normal maps, we\ncan mitigate the difficulty and computational cost of directly\ngenerating 3D representation (e.g., voxels, point clouds, etc.)\nor multi-view consistent 2D representation (e.g., RGB im-\nages, normal maps, etc.). Since dual normal maps can be\nrepresented as images, we can exploit a diffusion model\nrenowned for its image generation capability.

These normals are then used as a reference to \u201ccarve\u201d M through\nour normal map-based mesh optimization process. To further increase the quality, we separately refine the multi-view normal maps rendered\nfrom the full body and facial regions through a resampling procedure and perform the second optimization to create Mfinal.

Note that we can control the body shape and\npose of the generated dual normal maps by changing \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2,\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\nwith the SMPL-X normal map cN(\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2,\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8) as a condition.\nFollowing the latent diffusion model [67], we first train\na vector-quantized autoencoder (E, D) [17, 84] to support\nnormal maps with alpha channels which enable getting fore-\nground mask of generated normal maps easily. Specifically,\ngiven a normal map (color-coded as RGB) with alpha chan-\nnel x \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d74, the encoder E encodes x into the latent\nrepresentation z \u2208 Rh\u00d7w\u00d74, and the decoder D reconstructs\na normal map back from the latent z. We train our autoen-\ncoder based on rendered normal maps from views with dif-\nferent yaw angles so that the autoencoder efficiently encodes\nthese normal maps into a perceptually equivalent latent space,\ni.e., zF = E(xF ) and zB = E(xB). For simultaneous gen-\neration, we concatenate the two latent codes zF and zB into\na latent code z and treat it as an 8-channel image.\nDuring training, the latent code z is perturbed by the for-\nward diffusion process according to a timestep t, producing\na noisy latent code zt. The diffusion model \u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8 then learns\nto predict the perturbed noise \u03f5\u03f5\u03f5 of zt, given the SMPL-X\nnormal map condition cN(\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2,\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8) \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d74. which is also\nencoded into E(cN) \u2208 Rh\u00d7w\u00d74 and concatenated with zt\nchannelwise. The corresponding objective becomes\nLdual = ExF ,xB,cN,\u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u223cN (0,I),t[\u2225\u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u2212\u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8(zF\nt , zB\nt , t, E(cN))\u22252\n2].\n(1)\nAt inference time, we start from the Gaussian noise zT \u223c\nN(0, I) and iteratively sample from the previous step until\nz0, then we decode z0 to get the final frontal and backside\nnormal maps. We use classifier-free guidance [27] to boost\nthe sample quality during conditional generation. To enable\nclassifier-free guidance, we randomly assign blank latent em-\nbeddings to the conditional image cN with 10% probability\nduring training. Then, for each inference step, we use the\nfollowing modification to predict the denoised latent code:\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, E(cN)) = \u03bb\u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, E(cN)) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t),\n(2)\nwhere \u03bb specifies the guidance strength that can be controlled\nduring inference, and \u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, E(cN)) and \u03f5\u03f5\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t) each cor-\nresponds to the conditional and unconditional predictions. In\nFig. 3, our simultaneous dual generation scheme shows that\nthe generated frontal and backside normal maps are more\nconsistent, compared to separate generation.\n3.2. Mesh Reconstruction with Front/Back Normals\nGiven the initial posed SMPL-X mesh M(\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2,\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8) and the\ngenerated clothed normal maps (xF , xB), we deform the\ninitial mesh into a detailed 3D human mesh through iterative\noptimization. Our mesh reconstruction method is motivated\nby Neural Deferred Shading (NDS) [92], which reconstructs\ngeometry from multi-view RGB images using a differen-\ntiable rasterizer and neural shader. Unlike NDS, we remove\nthe neural shader as the generated normal maps provide su-\n4\n(a) Separate generation\n(b) Dual generation\nFigure 3. Separate generation vs. Dual generation. Comparison\nbetween (a) separate sampling for frontal/backside normal maps\nand (b) our dual sampling. When generated separately, attributes\nof two normal maps likely differ. However, generating the dual\nnormal maps at once ensures the maps share the same semantics.\npervision for geometry, and directly optimize the 3D geome-\ntry by comparing the normal maps with the geometry buffers\nrendered from a differentiable rasterizer [44]. In general,\nmesh reconstruction via the two normal maps is an ill-posed\nproblem due to the depth ambiguity. Using SMPL-X mesh\nas an initial mesh, which is a strong geometric prior, and in-\ntroducing a novel side loss Lsides for regularizing side-views,\nwe can reconstruct plausible 3D geometry of humans while\nmitigating the difficulty of generating multi-view consistent\nimages at once. Our total objective is defined as\nL = \u03bbnormalLnormal + \u03bbmaskLmask + \u03bbsidesLsides\n+\u03bblaplacianLlaplacian + \u03bbreg\nnormalLreg\nnormal.\n(3)\nNormal map loss.\nWe minimize the difference between\nthe input normal maps (xF , xB) and the normal maps\nrendered from the front/back views of the human mesh\n(NF , NB) through a L1 loss, denoted as Lnormal. We also\nminimize the discrepancy between the mask of the normal\nmaps through a L2 loss, Lmask, to match the silhouette of the\nmesh. Note that we can acquire the masks of the generated\nnormal maps by a simple thresholding on the alpha channel.\nSide loss.\nSince our initial 3D reconstruction is based on\nfrontal/backside normal maps, the left/rightside regions of\nthe human body tend to contain depth ambiguity [63]. We\ntherefore introduce a novel side loss, which ensures that the\nbody masks rendered from the side views ( \u02c6Mleft, \u02c6Mright) are\nnot shrinked into the side views of the initial SMPL-X mesh\n(Msmpl\nleft , Msmpl\nright). The loss function becomes\nLsides =\nX\nMsmpl\nview [h,w]=1\n\u2225Msmpl\nview[h, w] \u2212 \u02c6Mview[h, w]\u22252\n2,\n(4)\nwhere [h, w] denotes indexing with the pixel (h, w) of the\nmask M \u2208 RH\u00d7W and view \u2208 {left, right}. Even though\n(a) Rendered normal\n(b) Resampled normal\nFigure 4. Body Resampling. The initial 3D mesh displays unde-\nsired visual artifacts, such as unnatural cloth wrinkles and depth\nmisprediction. By resampling, those artifacts are moderated to pro-\nduce more natural results.\nwe can mitigate the problem to some extent with the 3D\nprior from initial SMPL-X, we further prevent the optimized\nmesh from having unrealistic side-views.\nGeometric regularization.\nAs noted by NDS [92], op-\ntimizing the mesh based on only the aforementioned loss\nterms can lead to degenerated mesh due to unconstrained\nvertex movement. To overcome this issue, we use geometric\nregularization terms following NDS [92]. Given a matrix\nV \u2208 Rn\u00d73 with vertex positions of mesh M as rows, the\nLaplacian term is defined as Llaplacian =\n1\nn\nPn\ni=1 \u2225\u03b4\u03b4\u03b4i\u22252\n2,\nwhere \u03b4\u03b4\u03b4i = (LV )i \u2208 R3 are the differential coordinates of\nvertex i with the graph Laplacian L. Since the differential\ncoordinates are the sum of positional difference between its\nneighbors, minimizing this loss leads to a smoother mesh.\nWe also introduce a normal consistency term, defined as\nLreg\nnormal =\n1\n| \u00af\nF|\nP\n(i,j)\u2208 \u00af\nF(1 \u2212 nnni\u00b7nnnj)2, where \u00afF is the set of\nmesh face pairs with a shared edge and nnni \u2208 R3 is the nor-\nmal of triangle i. Minimizing the cosine similarity between\nface normals of neighbors encourages further smoothness.\n3.3. Refine by Resampling\nResampling multi-view normal maps.\nAfter the initial\nmesh reconstruction, we can further improve the mesh while\nwe already have plausible one. We refine the 3D human\nmesh by refining the rendered multi-view normal maps of\nthe reconstructed mesh without losing view consistency. The\nrefined maps are then used as inputs to the 3D reconstruction\npipeline, creating an improved, realistic 3D human mesh.\nOur pipeline is inspired by SDEdit [52], which proposes\nan image translation method by progressively denoising a\nnoise-perturbed image. The amount of noise perturbation is\ndecided by timestep 0 < t0 < 1, and as t0 gets closer to 0,\nthe operation focuses on editing the finer details. We repeat\n5\n(a) Rendered normal\n(b) Resampled normal\nFigure 5. Face close-up resampling. Both images are aligned\naccording to the SMPL-X vertices for the facial region. We can\nobserve that the perceptibility of the faces is improved.\nthis process by K times to improve fidelity without harming\nthe original information. To preserve the original structure\nwhile adjusting any unrealistic information, we set t0 = 0.02\nand K = 2, which we empirically found to be sufficient.\nIn practice, we first render a collection of n-view normal\nmaps {I1, I2, ..., In} by evenly rotating the yaw camera an-\ngle around the 3D mesh. For refinement, we use the same\ndual normal map generation model in Sec. 3.1, which uses\nthe normal map of posed SMPL-X as spatial guidance. We\npair the rendered normal maps so that each pair is rendered\nfrom the backside of one another, and use the SMPL-X nor-\nmal map corresponding to the frontal normal map as the\ncondition to the diffusion model. This perturb-and-denoise\nprocess, which we call resampling, drives the normal maps\nrendered from the optimized mesh into the distribution of\nnormal maps rendered from training 3D scans on which our\ndiffusion model is trained, thus the normal maps become\nmore realistic without losing overall semantics. Once the\nresampling is complete, we pass the refined normal maps as\ninputs to the 3D reconstruction stage (Sec. 3.2) to produce a\nrefined 3D human model. Fig. 4 shows that our resampling-\nbased refinement produces more natural details.\nFacial resampling.\nWe enhance the facial details of the\noptimized mesh by refining the normal maps rendered from\nthe facial regions of the mesh. We train a latent diffusion\nmodel which shares the same architecture of the dual normal\nmap generation model in Sec. 3.1, but trained on normal\nmaps with face close-up. The close-up is done for the head\nvertices of SMPL-X based on the pre-defined part segmenta-\ntion [60]. With the face close-up views, we can render facial\nregions of 3D scans and aligned SMPL-X mesh.\nGiven the aligned facial normal maps, we can train the\ndiffusion model which generates the frontal and backside\nfacial normal maps with facial normal maps of SMPL-X as\na condition. We then apply the same resampling technique\nused for the full body to refine the multi-view facial normal\nmaps rendered from the optimized mesh. Fig. 5 shows how\n(a) SMPL-X\n(b) Text-based front\n(c) Dual from (b)\nFigure 6. Text-based normal map generation. Note that our model\nis capable of generating a normal map consistent in gender, clothing,\nand hair style1. Moreover, our guided generation method can create\na view-consistent back normal map from the initial frontal map,\nmaking it possible to use it for our original pipeline.\nthe facial region is perceptually refined without harming the\noriginal structure. Unlike the method of Fr\u00a8uhst\u00a8uck et al. [18],\nwhich performs offline optimization to blend a full body\nimage and face image, we just do the normal map-based\noptimization (Sec. 3.2) with refined normal maps of both\nbody and face, which aggregates the refined normal maps\ndirectly in 3D to generate a 3D human mesh with better\ndetails.\n3.4. Text-guided Normal Map Generation\nIn addition to the main, pose-conditional 3D generation\npipeline, we also include an optional pose-and-text condi-\ntional pipeline to further control the identity of the resulting\nhuman mesh. To generate 3D human mesh based on a tex-\ntual description, we adopt a powerful text-to-image diffusion\nmodel, e.g., Stable Diffusion [67], and fine-tune its weights\nto generate normal maps that are consistent to the text de-\nscription and the posed SMPL-X normal map.\nAs the method of Wang et al. [89] displayed the effective-\nness of fine-tuning large diffusion models for image trans-\nlation tasks, we initialize the weights of our model based\non a pre-trained Stable Diffusion checkpoint, leveraging its\nrenowned generation capabilities. Following previous works\n[4, 98], we add additional input channels to the first layer of\nthe U-Net [69] and initialize their weights to zero. We also\nuse the same text conditioning based on a pre-trained CLIP\nmodel [64].\nAs shown in Fig. 6, our model supports the generation\nof detailed normal maps based on the textual description\nand the posed SMPL-X. Our method is the first method\nto support text-based full-body normal map generation by\nbasing on Stable Diffusion.\nFrontal normal map-guided generation.\nTo get dual nor-\nmal maps based on the frontal normal map generated from\n1For text, we used \u201dgirl, long hair, dress\u201d\n6\nthe text-based normal map generation model, we follow the\nintuitions of Repaint [49]. Since we already know and want\nto preserve the frontal shape, the goal here is to predict the\nunknown backside normal map, based on the frontal normal\nmap. For each inference step, we sample the intermediate\nfrontal latent code zF\nt from the original latent zF at any\ntimestep t, since the diffusion process is defined by a Gaus-\nsian Markov chain. In contrast, we sample the unknown, in-\ntermediate backside latent code zB\nt through reverse diffusion,\nwhich is concatenated channel-wise to zF\nt . Since we con-\nsider both zF\nt and zB\nt as a single, 8-channel latent code, the\ndiffusion model leverages the context of the known frontal\nnormal map while generating the unknown backside normal\nmap, making this a channel-wise inpainting approach. Fig. 6\nshows that our approach helps to generate backside normal\nmaps that match the original frontal map. Through frontal\nnormal map-guided dual normal map generation, we can\nseamlessly connect the generative powers of a text-to-image\nmodel with our main pipeline.\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we validate Chupa\u2019s effectiveness in gener-\nating realistic 3D humans. We first compare Chupa with the\nprevious state-of-the-art through an image quality metric and\na perceptual user study. We also conduct ablation studies to\nillustrate the effectiveness of each part of our pipeline. Fig. 7\nshows comparison of generated results from our method and\nthe baseline [10].\nDatasets.\nWe train and test our model with Renderpeo-\nple [66] and THuman 2.0 [99] dataset, which consists of\n500, 526 scans with various identities and clothing. We split\nboth datasets with a 9:1 ratio for train/test split. For training,\nwe render 36 multi-view normal maps of the train split scans\nwith rotation of 10\u25e6 yaw interval. We follow ICON [94]\nfor rendering pipeline, originally from MonoPort [46], both\nfor body and face. For rendering normal maps of facial re-\ngions, we use the pre-defined part segmentation label of\nSMPL-X [60] to find head vertices of fitted SMPL-X. Then,\nwe render the facial region of 3D scans and fitted SMPL-X\nmesh with a weak perspective camera for rendering the head\nvertices of SMPL-X mesh with close-up. To create text pairs\nfrom normal maps for Stable Diffusion fine-tuning, we adopt\nan off-the-shelf image tagger model [45] based on ViT [16].\nBaseline.\nWe compare our method with gDNA [10] as a\nbaseline. gDNA is the state-of-the-art method to generate\n3D human mesh with given SMPL-X parameter \u03b2, \u0398 and\nrandomly sampled shape latent code zshape and detail latent\ncode zdetail from its learned latent space.\n4.1. Implementation Details\nAutoencoder model training.\nBefore training the full-\nbody dual generation model, we trained the autoencoder\nmodel (E, D) for 1, 000 epochs on 4\u00d7 NVIDIA A100\nGPUs following the original implementation [17]. We used\na VQ-regularized autoencoder with downsampling factor\nf = 4 and channel dimension c = 4 such that, given\na full-body normal map image with alpha transparency\n(cN \u2208 R512\u00d7512\u00d74), the encoder transforms the image to\na latent code with 4 channels (E(cN) \u2208 R128\u00d7128\u00d74), and\nthe decoder reconstructs the image from the latent code. For\ntraining, we used the full-body normal map datasets, follow-\ning the same preprocessing listed in the main paper. We used\nthe pretrained weights for the autoencoders of facial genera-\ntion models (Sec. 3.3) and text-based generation models (Sec.\n3.4) provided by the original paper [67]. For the facial gen-\neration model, we used a VQ-regularized autoencoder with\ndownsampling factor f = 4 and channel dimension c = 3.\nFor textual generation models, we used a KL-regularized\nautoencoder with downsampling factor f = 8 and chan-\nnel dimension c = 4. All autoencoders were frozen during\ndiffusion training.\nU-net.\nWe adapt the U-Net [69] architecture for our diffu-\nsion models to support our dual-generation scheme. Specifi-\ncally, we follow the approach of Dhariwal and Nichol [15]\nto further improve the sampling quality and set the input\nchannels from 6 to 12, and the output channels from 3 to 8.\nBy utilizing the concatenation of two input images (front and\nback) with the SMPL latent code E(cN) for conditioning,\nwe can treat them as a single input. As a result, we can obtain\ntwo spatially aligned images for both views at the same time.\nFor the facial generation models, we set the input channels\nto 9 and output channels to 6, since we used 3-channel for\nfacial normal maps.\nDual normal map generator training.\nWe train our full-\nbody dual normal map generation model for 500 epochs with\nbatch size 16 on 4\u00d7 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We set the total\ntimesteps T = 100 with a linear variance schedule. During\ninference, we use the same 512\u00d7512 resolution and generate\nresults with the same denoising steps used during training.\nWe trained the facial generation model for 300 epochs with\nthe same training settings.\nText-guided normal map generator training.\nWe train\nour text-based normal map generator for 1, 000 epochs on\n4\u00d7 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We train at a 512\u00d7512 resolution\nwith a total batch size of 64. We initialize our model from the\nEMA weights of the Stable Diffusion [67] checkpoints and\nadopt other training settings from the public Stable Diffusion\ncode base. After inference, we used a thresholding operation\n7\nFigure 7. Generation Comparison. We display the visual comparisons between gDNA [10] and Chupa with the same SMPL input. Note\nthat gDNA tends to amplify the unnatural artifacts from its coarse stage to the fine stage, while our results produce more natural results.\nTable 1. Quantitative Evaluation.

Quantitative Results\nWe conduct a quantitative evaluation of the quality of\ngenerated meshes, based on given SMPL-X parameters. We\ngenerated 3D human meshes with SMPL-X parameters fit-\nted to 103 test scans, i.e. 50 from Renderpeople and 53\nfrom THuman 2.0, for both our method and gDNA [10].\nFollowing the previous work [10, 77, 102], we render nor-\nmal maps [10] and shading-images [78, 102] of groundtruth\nscans and generated meshes into 18 views with 20\u25e6 yaw\ninterval, and compute FID score with them, which denoted\nas FIDnormal and FIDshade respectively. Tab. 1 shows that\nour method achieves lower FID for both images than the\nbaseline.\n4.3. User Preference\nWe carry out a perceptual study over 78 subjects asking\nabout their preference between the meshes from our method\nand gDNA. We randomly select 40 from a set of SMPL-X\nparameters fitted to 103 test scans. We randomly generate\nmeshes based on them with our method and gDNA, and\nrender shading-images in 3 views, 0\u25e6, 120\u25e6, 240\u25e6 for full\nbody images and 0\u25e6, 40\u25e6, \u221240\u25e6 for face images. Note that\nwe use the narrower field-of-view for better comparing facial\ndetails. Tab. 1 shows that the users preferred meshes from\nour method both for full-body and face images. We present\nmore details in the supplementary material.\n4.4. Ablation Study\nWe validate the building blocks of our pipeline through\nan ablation study. The evaluation is based on the same test\nsplit. The results are summarized in Tab. 3.\n8\nTable 2. User preference.

Due to\nthe randomness of the diffusion model, we cannot guarantee\nthe separately generated frontal and backward normal maps\nare consistent (Fig. 3), which leads to performance loss.\nSide loss.\nWith the sidewise loss Lsides from Eq. (4), we\nenforce our mesh to keep better alignment with the SMPL-\nX prior during mesh optimization (Sec. 3.2). Fig. 8 shows\nthe effect of utilizing Lsides. The first column shows the\nside-view normal map rendered from the mesh optimized\nwith dual normal maps. The second column shows the same\nside-view normal map but overlapped with the side-view of\nthe corresponding SMPL-X. The third column shows the\nnormal maps after resampling (Sec. 3.3). Fig. 8a shows that\nthe optimized mesh without Lsides has worse alignment with\nSMPL-X mesh, which leads to the artifacts on resampling\nresults. Tab. 3 demonstrates the inclusion of Lsides leads to\nlower FID scores, indicating its effectiveness.\nRefinement.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our refine-\nment method (Sec. 3.3), we compare 3D generation results\nonly optimized by front/back normal maps and the results\nrefined by body refinement and additional face refinement.\nFig. 4 and Fig. 5 show that our refinement methods lead to\nmore realistic generation results. As expected, Tab. 3 shows\nthat our face refinement method further reduces FID.\n5. Discussion\nWe propose Chupa, a powerful 3D generation pipeline\nfor a large variety of dressed 3D high-quality digital avatars.\nBy combining diffusion models for normal map generation\n(a) without Lsides\n(b) with Lsides\nFigure 8. Side loss. We present the side-view normal maps of the\noptimized mesh (left), the normal maps overlapped on the SMPL-\nX normal maps (middle), and the normal maps after resampling\n(right). Without Lsides, the alignment between the SMPL-X mesh\nand the optimized mesh becomes worse, leading to artifacts on the\nresampling result. (Note that the blue channel of the overlapped\nSMPL-X normal map is flipped for visualization purposes.)\nwith a normal map-based mesh reconstruction method, our\npipeline enables the creation of realistic 3D avatars with high\nlevels of stochastic details. We also allow the creation of 3D\nhumans from both pose and textual information, providing\nan intuitive method of digital avatar creation.\nWe note that while our pipeline can support text condi-\ntioning without losing visual quality, several elements that\ncan be generated from the initial text-to-image model (e.g.,\nbracelet, necklace, glasses) tend to be lost during the later\nstage of the pipeline and cannot be expressed at the final 3D\nmodel. For future work, we look forward to creating digi-\ntal avatars with photorealistic textures and devising novel\nstrategies for creating animations from our digital avatars.\nAcknowledgements.\nThis work was supported by Naver\nWebtoon.

Detailed formulation of Diffusion Models\nWe provide a detailed introduction to Gaussian-based\ndiffusion models [28, 80]. Given the target data distribution\nx0 \u223c q(x0), the goal of diffusion models is to learn a model\ndistribution p\u03b8 that approximates q, while being easy to\nsample from. To achieve both objectives, diffusion models\ndefine a forward process that gradually introduces noise\nto the original data x0 to generate a sequence of noised\ndata x1, x2, ..., xT . Additionally, a reverse process is defined,\nwhich aims to denoise the noised data xt and produce less\nnoisy data xt\u22121. Once trained, Gaussian-based diffusion\nmodels sample data x0 by first sampling xT from a Gaussian\ndistribution N(0, I) and iteratively sampling xt\u22121 from the\nprevious step xt. To ensure xT \u223c N(0, I), it is required for\nT to be sufficiently large.\nThe forward process is formulated as a Markov chain\naccording to a variance schedule \u03b21 < \u03b22 < ... < \u03b2T :\nq(xt|xt\u22121) := N(xt;\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b2txt\u22121, \u03b2tI)\n(5)\nq(x1:T |x0) :=\nT\nY\nt=1\nq(xt|xt\u22121)\n(6)\nNote that to sample xt \u223c q(xt|x0), it is not required to\napply forward diffusion t times. Instead, using the notation\n\u03b1t := 1 \u2212 \u03b2t and \u00af\u03b1t := Qt\ns=1 \u03b1s, we have a closed form\nexpression:\nq(xt|x0) := N(xt; \u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0, (1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1tI)\n(7)\nConsequently, we can view xt as a linear combination of x0\nand \u03f5 \u223c N.(0, I)(xt = \u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0 +\np\n(1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t)\u03f5)\nGiven the fixed forward process, p is designed to ap-\nproximate the unknown true posterior q(xt\u22121|xt). This is\nachieved through the use of a deep neural network with\nlearnable parameters \u03b8.\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) := N(xt\u22121; \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t))\n(8)\np\u03b8(x0:T ) := p(xT )\nT\nY\nt=1\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt)\n(9)\nHo et al. [28] proposed a specific parameterization for\n\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) such that the neural network outputs the estimated\nnoise \u03f5\u03b8 instead of predicting \u00b5\u03b8.\n\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n(xt \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1t\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t))\n(10)\nFor training, the variational lower bound is optimized and\nsimplifies the following Eq. (11) that enables the model to\nlearn how to predict the added noise.\nLsimple = Ex0,t,\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)[||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)||2]\n(11)\nIn practice, Ho et al. [28] uses a U-Net backbone [69]\nto output the predicted noise \u03f5\u03b8 which has the same dimen-\nsionality as the input noisy sample xt. To solve an image-\nto-image translation task, Saharia et al. [72] concatenates a\nspatial conditioning input y to xt channel-wise and modifies\nthe learning objective as Eq. (12).\nLsimple = Ex0,y,t,\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)[||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, y, t)||2]\n(12)\nA.1. Diffusion Training\nB. Normal map-based mesh optimization\nCamera parameters.\nIn our normal map-based mesh opti-\nmization method, we require camera parameters to rasterize\nthe mesh into normal maps that are aligned with those gener-\nated from our dual-generation diffusion model. To generate\nthe frontal normal map of the initial SMPL-X mesh (ex-\nplained in Sec. 3.1), we utilize a weak perspective camera\nwhich shares the same parameters as our training data setup.\nFor the second mesh refinement stage (explained in Sec. 3.3),\nwe also employ weak perspective cameras that are defined\nin the same manner for both body and face rendering.\nCoarse-to-fine optimization.\nWe adopt the coarse-to-fine\noptimization strategy presented by NDS [92] for mesh op-\ntimization. Specifically, we begin with a coarse mesh and\nprogressively increase the resolution through a remeshing\ntechnique, presented by Botsch and Kobbelt [3]. As demon-\nstrated in [92], initializing optimization with a large number\nof vertices can lead to meshes with undesired geometry, such\nas degenerate triangles and self-intersections. Therefore, we\nstart the optimization from a decimated version of our ini-\ntial SMPL-X, which contains 3,000 vertices [23]. During\noptimization, for every 500 iterations, we apply remeshing\n[3] to increase the model resolution. It is worth noting that\neach iteration corresponds to a single gradient descent step,\nwith respect to the loss based on a randomly sampled normal\nmap. Following NDS [92], we perform optimization for a\ntotal of 2,000 iterations and decreased the gradient descent\nstep size for the vertices by 25% after each remeshing. As\nFig. 9 shows, we can handle the large deviation from the\ninitial mesh without losing high-frequency details, due to the\ncoarse-to-fine optimization scheme.\nLoss weight scheduling.\nWhile we follow the individual\nloss objective terms and scheduling of NDS [92] for our\nmesh optimization loss in Sec. 3.2, we added our side loss\nterm Lsides to the objective with weight term \u03bbsides = 0.1,\nwhich we decrease by 10% after each remeshing. We also\nset the loss weights for Lnormal equivalent to Lshading\nin the original paper for NDS.

Here, we render 36-view normal maps with 10\u25e6\nyaw interval, and set (t0, K) to (0.02, 2), respectively, both\nfor body and face normal map refinement.\nC. Qualitative Results\nMore generation results.\nFig. 10 shows more random gen-\neration results from Chupa. We generate the human meshes\nbased on SMPL-X parameters from the AGORA dataset [59],\nwhich includes SMPL, SMPL-X parameters fitted to 4, 240\n3D human scans. We can generate human scans with various\nidentities and can be generalized to diverse poses.\nChanging shape parameter \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2.\nTo control the shape of\nthe generated mesh, we can control the shape parameter \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\nof input SMPL-X mesh [48, 60]. Fig. 11, Fig. 12 shows the\ngenerated meshes according to the variation of \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 with fixed\npose parameter \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8, where \u03b21, \u03b22 corresponds to the first and\nsecond component of the shape parameter respectively [48].\nComparison with AvatarCLIP.\nWe compare our text-\nguided generation results with AvatarCLIP [30], a text-\nguided 3D avatar generation pipeline that also initializes its\n3D implicit surface model [87] with a SMPL model. Once\ninitialized, AvatarCLIP optimizes the 3D model based on\na CLIP loss [64] on the rendered results, to match the 3D\nmodel according to the text description. Fig. 13 shows that\nChupa can generate more realistic 3D human mesh while\nminimizing unnatural artifacts. Note that while AvatarCLIP\ntakes more than 3 hours to generate a mesh, Chupa takes 3\nminutes with a single RTX3090.\nD. Failure Cases\nDepth ambiguity problem.\nOur dual normal map-based\nmesh reconstruction method (Sec. 3.2) has inherent depth\nambiguity issues, as it only uses front and back-view normal\nmaps for the initial optimization. When the given normal\nmaps largely deviates from the initial SMPL model, e.g.,\nlong hair, the vertices for both head and shoulder deforms\nto match the provided hairstyle, creating artifacts during\ndeformation. Fig. 14 shows that while the hairstyle seems to\nbe well-reconstructed in the front view, there exists unnatural\nseams and broken geometry at close view.\nFace direction matters.\nWhen the input pose contains\nmisaligned body and face direction, the final output might\ndisplay unnatural face geometry. For example, when the face\nis turned to the side direction (Fig. 15), the diffusion models\nmight fail to generate realistic faces for reconstruction. To\nmake matters worse, the small distortion due to depth ambi-\nguity during reconstruction (Sec. 3.2) can have huge impact\non the perceptual quality of faces. Fig. 15 shows an exam-\nple of such cases, where the resulting face mesh displays\nunnatural geometry.\nOut-of-distribution pose.\nWhile our method can be gen-\neralized for diverse poses, there exists out-of-distribution\n14\nFigure 10.

Unlike existing generative\nAI systems, CoDi can generate multiple modalities in parallel and its input is not\nlimited to a subset of modalities like text or image. Despite the absence of training\ndatasets for many combinations of modalities, we propose to align modalities in\nboth the input and output space. This allows CoDi to freely condition on any input\ncombination and generate any group of modalities, even if they are not present in\nthe training data. CoDi employs a novel composable generation strategy which\ninvolves building a shared multimodal space by bridging alignment in the diffusion\nprocess, enabling the synchronized generation of intertwined modalities, such\nas temporally aligned video and audio. Highly customizable and \ufb02exible, CoDi\nachieves strong joint-modality generation quality, and outperforms or is on par\nwith the unimodal state-of-the-art for single-modality synthesis.

Under review.\narXiv:2305.11846v1  [cs.CV]  19 May 2023\nHowever, these models are restricted in their real-world applicability where multiple modalities\ncoexist and interact. While one can chain together modality-speci\ufb01c generative models in a multi-step\ngeneration setting, the generation power of each step remains inherently limited, and a serial, multi-\nstep process can be cumbersome and slow. Moreover, independently generated unimodal streams\nwill not be consistent and aligned when stitched together in a post-processing way (e.g., synchronized\nvideo and audio). The development of a comprehensive and versatile model that can generate any\ncombination of modalities from any set of input conditions has been eagerly anticipated, as it would\nmore accurately capture the multimodal nature of the world and human comprehension, seamlessly\nconsolidate information from a wide range of sources, and enable strong immersion in human-AI\ninteractions (for example, by generating coherent video, audio, and text description at the same time).\nIn pursuit of this goal, we propose Composable Diffusion, or CoDi, the \ufb01rst model capable of\nsimultaneously processing and generating arbitrary combinations of modalities as shown in Fig. 1.\nTraining a model to take any mixture of input modalities and \ufb02exibly generate any mixture of outputs\npresents signi\ufb01cant computational and data requirements, as the number of combinations for the\ninput and output modalities scales exponentially. Also aligned training data for many groups of\nmodalities is scarce or even non-existent, making it infeasible to train with all possible input-output\ncombinations. To address this challenge, we propose to align multiple modalities in both the input\nconditioning (Section 3.2) and generation diffusion step (Section 3.4). Furthermore, a proposed\n\u201cBridging Alignment\u201d strategy for contrastive learning (Section 3.2) allows us ef\ufb01ciently model the\nexponential number of input-output combinations with a linear number of training objectives.\nBuilding a model with any-to-any generation capacity with exceptional generation quality requires\ncomprehensive model design and training on diverse data resources. Therefore, we build CoDi in an\nintegrative way. First, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) for each modality, e.g., text, image,\nvideo, and audio. These models can be trained in parallel independently, ensuring exceptional single-\nmodality generation quality using widely available modality-speci\ufb01c training data (i.e., data with one\nor more modalities as input and one modality as output). For conditional cross-modality generation,\nsuch as generating images using audio+language prompts, the input modalities are projected into a\nshared feature space (Section 3.2), and the output LDM attends to the combination of input features.\nThis multimodal conditioning mechanism prepares the diffusion model to condition on any modality\nor combination of modalities without directly training for such settings.\nThe second stage of training enables the model to handle many-to-many generation strategies that\ninvolve simultaneously generating arbitrary combinations of output modalities. To the best of our\nknowledge, CoDi is the \ufb01rst AI model with this capability. This is achieved by adding a cross-\nattention module to each diffuser, and an environment encoder V to project the latent variable of\ndifferent LDMs into a shared latent space (Section 3.4). Next, we freeze the parameters of the LDM,\ntraining only the cross-attention parameters and V . Since the environment encoder of different\nmodalities are aligned, an LDM can cross-attend with any group of co-generated modalities by\ninterpolating the representation\u2019s output by V . This enables CoDi to seamlessly generate any group\nof modalities, without training on all possible generation combinations. This reduces the number of\ntraining objectives from exponential to linear.\nWe demonstrate the any-to-any generation capability of CoDi, including single-to-single modality\ngeneration, multi-condition generation, and the novel capacity of joint generation of multiple modali-\nties. For example, generating synchronized video and audio given the text input prompt; or generating\nvideo given a prompt image and audio. We also provide a quantitative evaluation of CoDi using eight\nmultimodal datasets. CoDi exhibits exceptional generation quality across assorted scenarios, with\nsynthesis quality on par or even better than single to single modality SOTA, e.g., audio generation\nand audio captioning.\n2\nRelated Works\nDiffusion models (DMs) learn the data distribution by denoising and recovering the original data.\nDeep Diffusion Process (DDP) [45] adopts a sequence of reversible diffusion steps to model image\nprobability distribution. It uses a reversible encoder to map the input image to a latent space and\na decoder to map the latent variables to an output image. Denoising diffusion probabilistic model\n(DDPM) [20] uses a cascade of diffusion processes to gradually increase the complexity of the\nprobability density function model.

This allows the model to\ncapture the dependencies between adjacent pixels and generate high-quality images. Score-based\ngenerative models (SOG) [46] use the score function to model the diffusion process. [40] generates\nhigh-\ufb01delity images conditioned on CLIP representations of text prompts. Latent diffusion model\n(LDM) [41] uses a VAE to encode inputs into latent space to reduce modeling dimension and\nimproves ef\ufb01ciency. The motivation is that image compression can be separated into semantic space\nby a diffusion model and perceptual space by an autoencoder. By incorporating temporal modeling\nmodules and cascading model architectures, video diffusion models have been built upon image\ndiffusers to generate temporally consistent and inherent frames[14, 19, 21, 44]. Diffusion models have\nalso been applied to other domains, such as generating audio from text and vision prompts[23, 33].\nMultimodal modeling has experienced rapid advancement recently, with researchers striving to build\nuniform representations of multiple modalities using a single model to achieve more comprehensive\ncross-modal understanding. Vision transformers [11], featuring diverse model architectures and\ntraining techniques, have been applied to various downstream tasks such as vision Q&A and image\ncaptioning. Multimodal encoders have also proven successful in vision-language [1, 8, 57], video-\naudio [47] and video-speech-language [55, 56] domains. Aligning data from different modalities is\nan active research area [12, 38], with promising applications in cross-modality retrieval and building\nuniform multimodal representations [33, 35, 41].\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nPreliminary: Latent Diffusion Model\nDiffusion models (DM) represent a class of generative models that learn data distributions p(x) by\nsimulating the diffusion of information over time. During training, random noise is iteratively added\nto x, while the model learns to denoise the examples. For inference, the model denoises data points\nsampled from simple distributions such as Gaussian. Latent diffusion models (LDM) [41] learn the\ndistribution of the latent variable z corresponding to x, signi\ufb01cantly reducing computational cost by\ndecreasing the data dimension.\n3\nIn LDM, an autoencoder is \ufb01rst trained to reconstruct x, i.e., \u02c6x = D(E(x)), where E and D denote\nthe encoder and decoder, respectively. The latent variable z = E(x) is iteratively diffused over\ntime steps t based on a variance schedule \u03b21, . . . , \u03b2T , i.e., q(zt|zt\u22121) = N(zt; \u221a1 \u2212 \u03b2tzt\u22121, \u03b2tI)\n[20, 45].\nThe forward process allows the random sampling of zt at any timestep in a closed form [20, 45]:\nzt = \u03b1tz + \u03c3t\u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I), \u03b1t := 1 \u2212 \u03b2t and \u03c3t := 1 \u2212 Qt\ns=1 \u03b1s. The diffuser learns how\nto denoise from {zt} to recover z. Following the reparameterization method proposed in [20], the\ndenoising training objective can be expressed as [41]:\nLD = Ez,\u03f5,t\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, C(y))\u22252\n2.\n(1)\nIn data generation, the denoising process can be realized through reparameterized Gaussian sampling:\np(zt\u22121|zt) = N\n\u0012\nzt\u22121;\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0012\nzt \u2212 \u03b2t\n\u221a\u03c3t\n\u03f5\u03b8\n\u0013\n, \u03b2tI\n\u0013\n.\n(2)\nIn LD, the diffusion time step t \u223c U[1, T]; \u03f5\u03b8 is a denoising model with UNet backbone parame-\nterized by \u03b8; y represents the conditional variable that can be used to control generation; C is the\nprompt encoder. The conditioning mechanism is implemented by \ufb01rst featurizing y into C(y), then\nthe UNet \u03f5\u03b8 conditions on C(y) via cross-attention, as described in [41]. Distinct from previous\nworks, our model can condition on any combinations of modalities of text, image, video and audio.\nDetails are presented in the following section.\n3.2\nComposable Multimodal Conditioning\nTo enable our model to condition on any combination of input/prompt modalities, we align the prompt\nencoder of text, image, video and audio (denoted by Ct, Ci, Cv, and Ca, respectively) to project the\ninput from any modality into the same space. Multimodal conditioning can then be conveniently\nachieved by interpolating the representations of each modality m: C(xt, xi, xv, xa) = P\nm \u03b1mC(m)\nfor m \u2208 xt, xi, xv, xa, with P\nm \u03b1m = 1. Through simple weighted interpolation of aligned\nembeddings, we enable models trained with single-conditioning (i.e., with only one input) to perform\nzero-shot multi-conditioning (i.e., with multiple inputs). This process is illustrated in Fig. 2 (a)(2).\nOptimizing all four prompt encoders simultaneously in a combinatorial manner is computationally\nheavy, with O(n2) pairs. Additionally, for certain dual modalities, well-aligned paired datasets are\nlimited or unavailable e.g., image-audio pairs. To address this challenge, we propose a simple and\neffective technique called \"Bridging Alignment\" to ef\ufb01ciently align conditional encoders. As shown\nin Fig. 2 (a)(1), we choose the text modality as the \"bridging\" modality due to its ubiquitous presence\nin paired data, such as text-image, text-video, and text-audio pairs. We begin with a pretrained\ntext-image paired encoder, i.e., CLIP [38]. We then train audio and video prompt encoders on\naudio-text and video-text paired datasets using contrastive learning, with text and image encoder\nweights frozen.\nIn this way, all four modalities are aligned in the feature space. As shown in Section 5.2, CoDi\ncan effectively leverage and combine the complementary information present in any combination\nof modalities to generate more accurate and comprehensive outputs. The high generation quality\nremains unaffected with respect to the number of prompt modalities. As we will discuss in subsequent\nsections, we continue to apply Bridging Alignment to align the latent space of LDMs with different\nmodalities to achieve joint multimodal generation.\n3.3\nComposable Diffusion\nTraining an end-to-end anything-to-anything model requires extensive learning on various data\nresources. The model also needs to maintain generation quality for all synthesis \ufb02ows. To address\nthese challenges, CoDi is designed to be composable and integrative, allowing individual modality-\nspeci\ufb01c models to be built independently and then smoothly integrated later. Speci\ufb01cally, we start by\nindependently training image, video, audio, and text LDMs. These diffusion models then ef\ufb01ciently\nlearn to attend across modalities for joint multimodal generation (Section 3.4) by a novel mechanism\nnamed \u201clatent alignment\u201d.\n4\nImage Diffusion Model.\nThe image LDM follows the same structure as Stable Diffusion 1.5 [41]\nand is initialized with the same weights. Reusing the weights transfers the knowledge and exceptional\ngeneration \ufb01delity of Stable Diffusion trained on large-scale high-quality image datasets to CoDi.\nVideo Diffusion Model.\nTo model the temporal properties of videos and simultaneously maintain\nvision generation quality, we construct the video diffuser by extending the image diffuser with\ntemporal modules. Speci\ufb01cally, we insert pseudo-temporal attention before the residual block [13].\nHowever, we argue that pseudo-temporal attention only enables video frames to globally attend\nto each other by \ufb02attening the pixels (height, width dimension) to batch dimension, resulting in\na lack of cross-frame interaction between local pixels. We argue that this results in the common\ntemporal-inconsistency issue in video generation that locations, shapes, colors, etc. of objects can\nbe inconsistent across generated frames. To address this problem, we propose adapting the latent\nshift method [2] that performs temporal-spatial shifts on latent features in accordance with temporal\nattention. We divide the video by the hidden dimension into k = 8 chunks, and for each chunk\ni = 0 to 7, we shift the temporal dimension forward by i positions. Further details will be provided\nin the appendix.\nAudio Diffusion Model.\nTo enable \ufb02exible cross-modality attention in joint generation, the audio\ndiffuser is designed to have a similar architecture to vision diffusers, where the mel-spectrogram\ncan be naturally viewed as an image with 1 channel. We use a VAE encoder to encode the mel-\nspectrogram of audio to a compressed latent space. In audio synthesis, a VAE decoder maps the latent\nvariable to the mel-spectrogram, and a vocoder generates the audio sample from the mel-spectrogram.\nWe employ the audio VAE from [33] and the vocoder from [27].\nText Diffusion Model.\nThe VAE of the text LDM is OPTIMUS [29], and its encoder and decoder\nare [9] and GPT-2 [39], respectively. For the denoising UNet, unlike the one in image diffusion, the\n2D convolution in residual blocks is replaced with 1D convolution [53].\n3.4\nJoint Multimodal Generation by Latent Alignment\nThe \ufb01nal step is to enable cross-attention between diffusion \ufb02ows in joint generation, i.e., generating\ntwo or more modalities simultaneously. This is achieved by adding cross-modal attention sublayers to\nthe UNet \u03f5\u03b8 (Fig. 2 (b)(2)). Speci\ufb01cally, consider a diffusion model of modality A that cross-attends\nwith another modality B. Let the latent variables of modalities mA and mB at diffusion step t be\ndenoted as zA\nt and zB\nt , respectively. The proposed \u201cLatent Alignment\u201d technique is such that a\nmodality-speci\ufb01c environment encoder VB \ufb01rst projects zB\nt into a shared latent space for different\nmodalities. Then, in each layer of the UNet for modality A, a cross-attention sublayer attends to\nVB(zB\nt ). For the diffusion model of modality A, the training objective in Eq. (1) now becomes:\nLA\nCross = Ez,\u03f5,t\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8c(zA\nt , VB(zB\nt ), t, C(y))\u22252\n2,\n(3)\nwhere \u03b8c denotes the weights of cross-attention modules in the UNet.\nThe training objective of A + B joint generation is LA\nCross + LB\nCross. V (\u00b7) of different modalities are\ntrained to be aligned with contrastive learning. Since zA\nt and zB\nt at any time step can be sampled with\nclosed form in the diffusion process Section 3.1, one can conveniently train the contrastive learning\ntogether with LCross. The purpose of V is to achieve the generation of any combination of modalities\n(in polynomial) by training on a linear number of joint-generation tasks. For example, if we have\ntrained the joint generation of modalities A, B, and B, C independently, then we have VA(zA\nt ),\nVB(zB\nt ), and VC(zC\nt ) aligned. Therefore, CoDi can seamlessly achieve joint generation of modalities\nA and C without any additional training. Moreover, such design automatically effortlessly enables\njoint generation of modalities A, B, and C concurrently. Speci\ufb01cally, UNet of A can cross-attend\nwith the interpolation of VB(zB\nt ), and VC(zC\nt ), although CoDi has not been trained with such task.\nAs shown in Fig. 2(b)(3), we follow similar designs to the \"Bridging Alignment\" in training joint\ngeneration: (1) We \ufb01rst train the cross-attention weights in the image and text diffusers, as well\nas their environment encoders V , on text-image paired data. (2) We freeze the weights of the text\ndiffuser and train the environment encoder and cross-attention weights of the audio diffuser on\ntext-audio paired data. (3) Finally we freeze the audio diffuser and its environment encoder, and\ntrain the joint generation of the video modality on audio-video paired data.

Clockwise from top left: text\u2192image, image\u2192text,\nimage\u2192video, audio\u2192image.\nSection 5.3, although only trained on three paired joint generation tasks (i.e, Text+Audio, Text+Image,\nand Video+Audio), CoDi is capable of generating assorted combinations of modalities simultaneously\nthat are unseen in training, e.g., joint image-text-audio generation in Fig. 5.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nTraining Objectives and Datasets\nWe list training tasks of CoDi in Table 1, including single modality synthesis, joint multimodal\ngeneration, and contrastive learning to align prompt encoders. Table 1 provides an overview of the\ndatasets, tasks, number of samples, and domain. Datasets are from the following domains: image\n+ text (e.g. image with caption), audio + text (e.g. audio with description), audio + video (e.g.\nvideo with sound), and video + text (e.g. video with description). As one may have noticed, the\nlanguage modality appears in most datasets and domains. This echos the idea of using text as the\nbridge modality to be able to extrapolate and generate new unseen combinations such as audio\nand image bridged by text, as mentioned in Section 3.2 and Section 3.4. Due to space limit, more\ndetails on training datasets and can be found in Appendix C, model architecture details in Appendix\nAppendix A.1, and training details in Appendix B.\nImage + Text. We use a recently developed large-scale image caption dataset, Laion400M [42].\nThis image-text paired data allows us to train with tasks text\u2192image, image\u2192text, and the joint\ngeneration of image and text. For the joint generation task, we propose to train with text\u2192image+text,\nwhere the prompt text is the truncated image caption, and the output text is the original caption. Since\nthe condition information is incomplete, the text and image diffuser will need to learn to attend with\neach other through the joint generation process.\n6\nTable 2: FID scores comparing different text\nto image models on the validation set of\nCOCO-caption [32].\nMethod\nFID \u2193\nCogView [10]\n27.10\nGLIDE [36]\n12.24\nMake-a-Scene [15]\n11.84\nLDM [33]\n12.63\nStable Diffusion-1.4\n11.21\nVersatile Diffusion [53]\n11.10\nCoDi (Ours)\n11.26\nTable 3: MSR-VTT text-to-video generation perfor-\nmance.\nMethod\nZero-Shot\nCLIPSIM \u2191\nGODIVA [50]\nNo\n0.2402\nN\u00dcWA [51]\nNo\n0.2439\nCogVideo [22]\nYes\n0.2631\nMake-A-Video [44]\nYes\n0.3049\nVideo LDM [5]\nYes\n0.2929\nCoDi (Ours)\nYes\n0.2890\nTable 4: The comparison between our audio diffuser and baseline TTA generation models.

We curated a new dataset, Freesound 500K, by crawling 500K audio samples together\nwith tags and descriptions from the Freesound website. We also use AudioSet [42] with 2 million\nhuman-labeled 10-second sound clips from YouTube videos and AudioCaps [24] with 46K audio-\ntext pairs derived from the AudioSet dataset. Audio samples are clipped into 10-second segments\nfor training purposes. The paired audio + text data enables us to train text\u2192audio, audio\u2192text,\ntext\u2192audio + text generation, and audio-text contrastive learning. Similar to image + text joint\ngeneration, in text\u2192audio + text, text prompt is the truncated text, and the output is the original text.\nVideo. We use the following diverse and high-quality video datasets to train video generation and\nvideo prompt encoder. WebVid [4], a large-scale dataset of web videos together with descriptions;\nHD-Villa-100M [54] with high resolution YouTube videos of at least 720P. We perform text\u2192video\nand video-text contrastive learning task with WebVid. We use HD-Villa-100M for image\u2192video\ngeneration where the middle frame is the input image.\nAudiovisual. Web videos are a natural aligned audio-video data resource. However, many existing\ndatasets, e.g., ACAV100M [28], feature heavily on videos of human speech rather than natural sounds.\nTherefore, we leverage sound-oriented datasets AudioSet and SoundNet [3] for joint audio-video\ngeneration. For image\u2192audio + video, we use the middle frame of the target video as the input\nprompt image. We also use the middle frame as the prompt input to train the model to generate the\naudio, i.e., image\u2192audio.\n5\nEvaluation Results\nIn this section, we will evaluate the model generation quality in different settings including single\nmodality generation, multi-condition generation, and multi-output joint generation. We provide both\nquantitative benchmarking on evaluation datasets as well as qualitative visualization demonstrations.\n7\n(Pirate ship sailing ambience)\n\u201cOil painting, cosmic horror painting,\nelegant intricate ArtStation concept \nart by Craig Mullins detailed\u201d\n\u201cPanda eating bamboo, \npeople laughing.\u201d\n(A video with sound with people watching panda and laughing)\n(Video of waterfall with camera moving forward)\n\u201cForward moving \ncamera view\u201d\n(Sound of \nflowing water)\nFigure 4: Generation with multiple input modality conditions.

CoDi achieves SOTA on audio captions and audio generation, as shown in Table 6 and\nTable 4. Notably for the \ufb01rst time in the \ufb01eld, CoDi, a diffusion-base model, exhibits comparable\nperformance on image captioning with autoregressive transformer-based SOTA (Table 5). CoDi is\nthe \ufb01rst diffusion-model based for video captioning Table 7. On image and video generation, CoDi\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art (Tables 2 and 3). This gives us strong starting points for\nmulti-condition and multi-output generation that will be presented next in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3.\nWe demonstrate in Section 3.2 that CoDi is capable of integrating representation from different\nmodalities in the generation. Thus, we \ufb01rst show multi-condition generation demo as shown in Fig. 4.\n5.2\nMulti-Condition Generation Results\nTable 8: CoDi is capable of generating high quality\noutput (image in this case) from various combina-\ntions of prompt modalities.\nInputs\nFID \u2193\nSingle-modality Prompt\nText\n14.2\nAudio\n14.3\nDual-modality Prompt\nText + Audio\n14.9\nTable 9: MSR-VTT text-to-video generation per-\nformance.\nInputs\nCLIPSIM \u2191\nSingle-modality Prompt\nText\n0.2890\nDual-modality Prompt\nText+Audio\n0.2912\nText+Image\n0.2891\nText+Audio+Image\n0.2923\n8\n\u201cSea shore sound \nambience.\"\n\u201cFireworks in the sky.\u201d\n(Sound of firework \nsynchronized with \nvideo) \nGenerated Video\n(Sample frames)\n\u201cWave crashes the \nshore, seagulls\u201d\n(Sound of seagulls \nand wave crashing \nthe shore) \n\u201cTeddy bear on a\nskateboard, 4k.\u201d\n(Raining ambience) \n(Skateboarding sound, street noise, raining ambience) \nFigure 5:\nJoint generation of multiple output modalities by CoDi.\nFrom top to bottom:\ntext\u2192video+audio, text\u2192image+text+audio, text+audio+image\u2192video+audio.\nFor quantitative evaluation, we focus on multiple inputs to image synthesis output since the evaluation\nmetric for this case (FID) does not require speci\ufb01c modality inputs like text. We test with several\ninput combinations including text + image, text + audio, image + audio, text + video, as well as three\ninputs text + audio + image. We test on the validation set of AudioCaps [24] since all four modalities\nare present in this dataset. The prompt image input is the middle frame of the video. As shown in\nTable 8, CoDi achieves high image generation quality given assorted groups of input modalities. We\nalso test with several input combinations with video as output including text, text + audio, image +\nimage, as well as text + audio + image. We also test on MSRVTT [24] since all four modalities are\npresent in this dataset. Similarly, the prompt image input is the middle frame of the video. As shown\nin Table 9, CoDi achieves high video and ground truth text similarity given assorted groups of input\nmodalities. Again our model does not need to train on multi-condition generation like text + audio or\ntext + image. Through bridging alignment and composable multimodal conditioning as proposed in\nSection 3.2, our model trained on single condition can zero-shot infer on multiple conditions.\n5.3\nMulti-Output Joint Generation Results\nFor joint multimodal generation, we \ufb01rst demonstrate high-quality multimodal output joint generation\ndemo as shown in Fig. 5. For quantitative evaluation, there is no existing evaluation metric since we\nare the \ufb01rst model that can simultaneously generate across all 4 modalities. Therefore, we propose\nthe following metric SIM that quanti\ufb01es the coherence and consistency between the two generated\nmodalities by cosine similarity of embeddings:\nSIM(A, B) = cos (CA(A), CB(B))\n(4)\nwhere A, B are the generated modalities, and CA and CB are aligned encoders that project A and\nB to the same space. We use the prompt encoder as described in Section 3.2. This metric aims to\ncompute the cosine similarity of the embedding of two modalities using contrastive learned prompt\nencoders. Thus, the higher the metric, the more aligned and similar the generated modalities are.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of joint generation, assume the prompt modality is P, we compare\nSIM(A, B) of A and B generated separately vs. jointly, i.e., {P \u2192 A, P \u2192 B} vs. {P \u2192\n9\nTable 10: Similarity scores between generated modalities. The number on the left of \u201c/\u201d represents\nthe similarity score of independent generation, and the right it represents the case of joint generation.\nJointly generated outputs consistently show stronger coherence.\nInputs\nSIM-IT\nSIM-AT\nSIM-VT\nSIM-VA\nTwo Joint Outputs\nAudio \u2192 Image+Text\n0.251 / 0.260\n-\n-\n-\nImage \u2192 Audio+Text\n-\n0.244 / 0.256\n-\n-\nText \u2192 Video+Audio\n-\n-\n-\n0.240 / 0.255\nAudio \u2192 Video+Text\n-\n-\n0.256 / 0.261\n-\nThree Joint Outputs\nText \u2192 Video+Image+Audio\n0.256 / 0.270\n0.240 / 0.257\n-\n0.240 / 0.257\nMulti-Inputs-Outputs\nText+Image \u2192 Video+Audio\n-\n-\n-\n0.247 / 0.259\nA + B}. The benchmark is the validation set of AudioCaps [24]. We test on the following settings,\naudio \u2192image+text, image \u2192audio+text, and text\u2192video+audio, image \u2192video+audio. audio\u2192\nvideo+text, audio\u2192 text+video+image, text \u2192video+image+audio, where the image prompt is the\nmiddle frame of the video clip. As shown in Table 10, joint generation (similarity shown on the right\nside of \u201c/\u201d) consistently outperforms independent generation (on the left side of \u201c/\u201d).\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a groundbreaking model in multimodal\ngeneration that is capable of processing and simultaneously generating modalities across text, image,\nvideo, and audio. Our approach enables the synergistic generation of high-quality and coherent\noutputs spanning various modalities, from assorted combinations of input modalities. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate CoDi\u2019s remarkable capabilities in \ufb02exibly generating single\nor multiple modalities from a wide range of inputs. Our work marks a signi\ufb01cant step towards\nmore engaging and holistic human-computer interactions, establishing a solid foundation for future\ninvestigations in generative arti\ufb01cial intelligence.

Following VDM [21], the temporal attention is a transformer attention\nmodule where we \ufb02atten the height and width dimension to batch size dimension and the self-attention\nis performed on the time dimension. The temporal shift is illustrated in Fig. 6 where we \ufb01rst split\nchannels into k chunks. Then, we shift the channel dimension numbered 0 to k \u2212 1 by temporal\ndimension from 0 to k \u2212 1 times respectively. Eventually, we concatenate the shifted chunks by\nthe hidden dimension. Note that we use k = 3 in the illustration for simplicity but k = 8 in our\nimplementation. We then add a convolution layer before the temporal shift module. Finally, we use\nresidual connection [18] and add the output to the input before the convolution layer.\nB\nModel Training\nPrompt Encoders Training.\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, we use bridging alignment to perform\ncontrastive learning between all prompt encoders. We use Adam [26] optimizer with learning rate\n1e-4 and weight decay 1e-4.\nDiffusion Model Training.\nWe train diffusion model with training objectives and hyperparameters\ndetailed in Table 1 and Table 11.

The grey blocks denote \u201cpadding tensors\u201d.\nWe adopt curriculum learning on frame resolution and frames-per-second (FPS). First, the diffuser\nis trained on the WebVid dataset of a 256-frame resolution, with the training objective being text-\nconditioned video generation. The training clips are sampled from 2-second video chunks with 4 FPS.\nSecond, the model is further trained on HDVILLA and ACAV datasets, with a 512-frame resolution\nand 8 FPS, and the training objective is image-conditioned video generation (the image is a randomly\nsampled frame of the clip). Each training clip contains 16 frames sampled from a 2-second video\nchunk with 8 FPS.\nJoint Generation Training.\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, we train joint generation by aligning\nenvironment encoders and optimize cross-attention layers only in the diffusion models. We use Adam\noptimizer with learning rate 1e-5 and weight decay 1e-4.\nC\nTraining Datasets\nIn this section, we introduce more details about the video and audiovisual training datasets.\nVideo.\nWebVid [4] is a large-scale dataset of web videos with diverse content, spanning over 40\ncategories such as sports, cooking, and travel. It contains over 1.2 million video clips (all without\nsound) that are all at least 30 seconds in duration with video descriptions. We perform text\u2192video\nand video-text contrastive learning task with this dataset. HD-Villa-100M [54] is a large-scale video\ndataset with over 100 million video clips sourced from YouTube. The dataset covers a wide range of\nvideo categories and includes high-quality videos with a resolution of at least 720P. Since it lacks\ncurated video description and we use the middle frame as image input to perform image\u2192video\ngeneration.\nAudiovisual.\nSoundNet originally contains over two million sounds and spans a wide range of\ncategories including music, animal sounds, natural sounds, and environmental sounds. We collected\nall currently accessible 1M videos.\nD\nLimitations & Broader Impacts\nWhile the paper primarily focuses on the technical advancements and potential applications of\nCoDi, we also consider potential negative social impacts that could arise from the development and\ndeployment of such technology. These impacts can include:\nDeepfakes and Misinformation.\nAs part of a common issue for generative AI models, the ability\nof CoDi to generate realistic and synchronized multimodal outputs also raises concerns about the\n16\ncreation and dissemination of deepfakes. Malicious actors could exploit this technology to create\nhighly convincing fake content, such as fabricated videos or audio clips, which can be used for\nmisinformation, fraud, or other harmful purposes.\nBias and Stereotyping.\nIf the training data used for CoDi is biased or contains stereotypes, the\ngenerated multimodal outputs may also re\ufb02ect these.\n17\n"

Although many differ-\nent approaches have been proposed to improve\nthe effectiveness of generative retrieval, they\nhave only been evaluated on document cor-\npora on the order of 100k in size. We conduct\nthe \ufb01rst empirical study of generative retrieval\ntechniques across various corpus scales, ulti-\nmately scaling up to the entire MS MARCO\npassage ranking task with a corpus of 8.8M\npassages and evaluating model sizes up to 11B\nparameters. We uncover several \ufb01ndings about\nscaling generative retrieval to millions of pas-\nsages; notably, the central importance of using\nsynthetic queries as document representations\nduring indexing, the ineffectiveness of existing\nproposed architecture modi\ufb01cations when ac-\ncounting for compute cost, and the limits of\nnaively scaling model parameters with respect\nto retrieval performance. While we \ufb01nd that\ngenerative retrieval is competitive with state-\nof-the-art dual encoders on small corpora, scal-\ning to millions of passages remains an impor-\ntant and unsolved challenge. We believe these\n\ufb01ndings will be valuable for the community to\nclarify the current state of generative retrieval,\nhighlight the unique challenges, and inspire\nnew research directions.\n1\nIntroduction\nFor the last several years, dual encoders (Gillick\net al., 2018; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2022b;\nChen et al., 2022) have dominated the landscape\nfor \ufb01rst-stage information retrieval. They model\nrelevance by mapping queries and documents into\nthe same embedding space, optimized via con-\ntrastive learning (Hadsell et al., 2006; Gao et al.,\n\u2217Equal Contribution.\n\u2020Work completed while a Student Researcher at Google.\n2021). Dense embeddings are pre-computed for\nall documents in a corpus and stored in an external\nindex. This allows for fast approximate nearest\nneighbor search (Vanderkam et al., 2013; John-\nson et al., 2021) to retrieve relevant documents.\nCross-encoders based on large Transformer mod-\nels (Nogueira et al., 2019b, 2020; Pradeep et al.,\n2021b) often function on top of these retrieved doc-\numents to further re\ufb01ne the top results.\nRecently, the emerging paradigm of genera-\ntive retrieval (De Cao et al., 2020; Tay et al.,\n2022) sought to replace this entire process\nwith a single sequence-to-sequence Transformer\nmodel (Sutskever et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017),\nshowing promising results against dual encoders\ngiven a suf\ufb01ciently small corpus size. Since then,\nvarious techniques, such as (Zhuang et al., 2022b;\nBevilacqua et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023), have aimed to\nimprove the effectiveness of generative retrieval\nmodels, either with alternative document identi\ufb01er\nformulations, architecture changes, or training ob-\njectives. Such work, however, has only evaluated\ngenerative retrieval over relatively small corpora on\nthe order of 100k documents, such as Natural Ques-\ntions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi\net al., 2017), or small subsets of the MS MARCO\ndocument ranking task (Nguyen et al., 2016). De-\nspite these research contributions, a number of\nopen questions remain unanswered, including how\nwell current generative retrieval techniques work\non larger corpora and which aspects of generative\nretrieval models proposed so far are vital at scale.\nIn this paper, we conduct the \ufb01rst empirical\nstudy of generative retrieval techniques over the\nentire MS MARCO passage-level corpus, evaluat-\ning its effectiveness over 8.8M passages. We select\npopular approaches in recent works and evaluate\nthem \ufb01rst on Natural Questions and TriviaQA to\nestablish a de\ufb01nitive ablation of techniques in a\ncontrolled setup. Our experiments mainly focus\n1\narXiv:2305.11841v1  [cs.IR]  19 May 2023\non evaluating techniques proposed by Tay et al.\n(2022), Zhuang et al. (2022b), and Wang et al.\n(2022). Namely, we ablate document identi\ufb01er\ndesign: atomic, naive, semantic; document repre-\nsentation design: document tokens, ground truth\nqueries, synthetic queries (Nogueira et al., 2019c);\nand model design: pre\ufb01x-aware weight-adaptive\ndecoding, constrained decoding, and consistency\nloss during training. At this small scale, we demon-\nstrate state-of-the-art results for retrieval, genera-\ntive and non-generative, over the NQ variant from\n(Wang et al., 2022), without the need for many\nproposed methods.\nWe then scale up the corpus size leveraging the\nMS MARCO passage ranking task, beginning with\na subset of 100k passages before increasing the\ncount to 1M and 8.8M passages (the entire set). In-\ncrementally doing so allows us to establish which\ntechniques remain effective as corpus size and dif-\n\ufb01culty scale. Finally, to explore the effect of model\nscaling on retrieval effectiveness on large corpora,\nwe select a set of techniques with promising re-\nsults at T5.1.1-Base scale (Raffel et al., 2020a)\nand modify the parameterization to consider up to\n11B parameters. As the parameter distributions\nvary between methods, e.g., Atomic IDs cost em-\nbedding dimension times corpus size parameters,\nwhile Naive IDs do not cost anything beyond the\ncore Transformer model, we aim to provide some\ninsight into the trade-off of different parameter al-\nlocations on a large corpus.\nWhile our experimental \ufb01ndings are nuanced,\nwe summarize the main \ufb01ndings as follows:\n1. Of the methods considered, we \ufb01nd synthetic\nquery generation to be the single most critical\ncomponent as corpus size grows. De\ufb01ning the\ntask of generative retrieval as solely mapping\nfrom synthetic queries to document identi\ufb01ers\nis the most effective modeling strategy, with\nall other modeling strategies largely unneces-\nsary.\n2. As corpus size increases, discussion of com-\npute cost is crucial. Methods that implicitly\nincrease model parameters perform better us-\ning the same T5 initialization. However, the\nquality improvements vanish as we scale up\nthe naive approach to similar parameter sizes.\nFollowing (Dehghani et al., 2022), we note\nthat the parameter count is not the entire story\nand provide more discussion regarding model\ncomparisons and trade-offs in Section 6.2.\n3. Increasing the model size is necessary for\nimproved generative retrieval effectiveness.\nHowever, somewhat surprisingly, for the best\nsequential IDs, effectiveness does not improve\npast a certain point \u2013 peaking at XL (3B) with\na slightly worse score using XXL (11B) un-\nder \ufb01xed experimental settings. We \ufb01nd this\ncounter-intuitive to the common conception\nof generative retrieval being limited by model\ncapacity.\nOur \ufb01ndings conclude that on the entire MS\nMARCO passage ranking task, simply scaling a\nmodel trained solely on synthetic queries to Naive\nID generation demonstrates the best effectiveness\nof all techniques considered. On a small subset\nof 100k passages, a T5-Base model trained with\nthis strategy achieves 82.4 MRR@10 (Section 6.1),\ncompetitive with GTR-Base (Ni et al., 2022b) at\n83.2 MRR@10. While on the 8.8M passages, a\nT5-XL model trained with this approach achieves\nonly 26.7 MRR@10.\nWhile the \ufb01eld of generative retrieval continues\nto evolve rapidly, it is clear that achieving com-\npetitive effectiveness against state-of-the-art dense\nretrieval models at scale remains an important and\nunsolved challenge. Our results suggest the need\nfor continued research into generative retrieval and\nmore fundamental advances to the paradigm before\nwe are able to fully leverage the power of scaling\nup model parameters. We believe that our \ufb01ndings\nwill help the research community better understand\nthe current challenges faced when applying genera-\ntive retrieval models to larger corpora and inspire\nnew research in this direction.\n2\nRelated Work\nTraditional retrieval models like BM25 (Robertson\nand Zaragoza, 2009) that rely on the lexical overlap,\nterm frequency heuristics, and inverse document\nfrequency, while reasonably strong on their own,\ntend to fail at matching documents that have minor\nword overlap but are semantically related.\nA popular solution is dual encoders (Gillick\net al., 2018; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Chen et al.,\n2022), where a pretrained language model such\nas BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is used to compute\nlow-dimensional dense representations instead of\nthe high-dimensional sparse representations found\nin BM25. These dual encoder models are further\ntrained on the target task to achieve improved effec-\ntiveness. Based on the success of T5 in various nat-\n2\nural language understanding tasks, Ni et al. (2022a)\nproposes scaling up dual encoders by training T5-\nstyle pretrained language models with a two-stage\ncontrastive learning approach on the Semantic Text\nSimilarity (STS) tasks. The Generalizable T5 Re-\ntriever (GTR) (Ni et al., 2022b) extends this idea\nto information retrieval. The most successful GTR\nmodels were pretrained on a large-scale question-\nanswering dataset curated from the internet and\n\ufb01ne-tuned on the MS MARCO Passage Ranking\ntask (Nguyen et al., 2016).\nExisting approaches often apply synthetic query\ngeneration to improve retrieval effectiveness.\nNogueira et al. (2019c) \ufb01rst leveraged a vanilla\nsequence-to-sequence Transformer to train a model\nthat can map passages to queries that it might be\nable to answer. Nogueira et al. (2019a), doc2query-\nT5 further improved the effectiveness of the tradi-\ntional Transformer by leveraging a T5 model. Ma\net al. (2022) experimented with similar ideas and\nshowed that query generation is effective across a\nwide range of corpora and task setups.\nPrior to generative retrieval,\nsequence-to-\nsequence language models, like T5 (Raffel et al.,\n2020b), were shown to be effective for reranking\ntasks. In this setup, models assign scores to the top-\nk results from a \ufb01rst-stage retrieval method. One\ncan then use these scores to rerank the documents.\nFor example, monoT5 (Nogueira et al., 2020) was\nthe \ufb01rst to leverage T5 as a pointwise reranker by\ntraining a model that takes the concatenation of the\nquery and document as input and generates a rele-\nvance label. Pradeep et al. (2021b); Zhuang et al.\n(2022a); Hui et al. (2022) have since improved\nthe performance and ef\ufb01ciency of generation-based\nreranking. These approaches continue to demon-\nstrate strong effectiveness (Craswell et al., 2022;\nPradeep et al., 2021a, 2022).\nGenerative retrieval seeks to replace the entire in-\nformation retrieval process with a single sequence-\nto-sequence model capable of mapping queries\ndirectly to relevant document identi\ufb01ers (Met-\nzler et al., 2021). Differentiable Search Indexes\n(DSI) (Tay et al., 2022) \ufb01rst demonstrated the po-\ntential of this paradigm, where T5 is used to pa-\nrameterize an end-to-end search system, with the\nmodel parameters encoding all information about\nthe corpus. See Section 3 for more information.\nDSI was shown to outperform a dual encoder base-\nline on Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski\net al., 2019). Zhuang et al. (2022b) explores the\neffectiveness of DSI and synthetic queries on a\n100k passage subset of the MS MARCO passage\nranking corpus and XOR QA (Asai et al., 2021).\nNeural Corpus Indexer (Wang et al., 2022) builds\non the success of DSI and introduces a combina-\ntion of more input variants and architectural ad-\nditions, some of which we describe and explore\nin this work. Many works have explored various\ndocument identi\ufb01er designs, including document\nsubstring (Bevilacqua et al., 2022), metadata-based\napproaches (Zhou et al., 2022; Ziems et al., 2023),\nand learned quantization (Rajput et al., 2023; Sun\net al., 2023). More recently, (Chen et al., 2023) pro-\nposes a distillation approach on top of DSI, learn-\ning from the rankings generated by dense retrieval\nusing a multi-task training loss.\nHowever, none of these works have explored\ntraining or evaluating generative retrieval systems\non corpora larger than O(100k) documents. Given\nthat the generative retrieval paradigm has extended\nbeyond traditional information retrieval into areas\nsuch as recommender systems (Rajput et al., 2023)\nand vision (Zhang et al., 2023), we believe our\nstudy on scaling will be crucial for an evergrowing\ncommunity.\n3\nMethods\nIn this section, we revisit the design details of the\ngenerative information retrieval method, using the\nDifferentiable Search Index (DSI) (Tay et al., 2022)\nas the baseline. Then, we describe multiple tech-\nniques introduced in subsequent works that we aim\nto ablate and study in this work (Wang et al., 2022;\nZhuang et al., 2022b).\n3.1\nBackground\nDSI (Tay et al., 2022) reformulates the retrieval\ntask as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task, with\nqueries as inputs and document identi\ufb01ers (docids)\nrelevant to the query as generation targets. The cor-\npus, namely the mapping between the document\u2019s\ncontent and its identi\ufb01er, is encoded using the pa-\nrameters of the LLM. DSI achieves this by lever-\naging two seq2seq tasks: indexing and retrieval.\nDuring training, the model learns to generate the\ndocid given the document content (indexing task)\nor a relevant query (retrieval task). At inference\ntime, the model processes a query and generates a\nranked list of identi\ufb01ers as retrieval results.\n3\n3.2\nInputs and Targets\nIn the framework discussed, DSI learns to encode\nthe mapping between the long-form textual rep-\nresentation of a document and its identi\ufb01er in its\nparameters while also learning to fetch the same\nidenti\ufb01er when it receives a relevant query as input.\nTwo crucial design choices are how documents\nare represented (i.e., the inputs in the indexing\ntask) and how document identi\ufb01ers (docids) are\nrepresented (i.e., the targets in both indexing and\nretrieval tasks). Two primary considerations are:\n(1) For document representations, it is prohibitive\nto encode long textual sequences with a Trans-\nformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)-based LLM, making\nit dif\ufb01cult to index full documents and (2) The\nnaive identi\ufb01ers taken from an existing dataset\ncould be sub-optimal, for instance, due to their lack\nof semantic meaning. In this work, we consider\ndifferent design choices for both these components.\n3.2.1\nDocument Representations\nOne straightforward idea is to pick a text span\nfrom the document as a representation. DSI con-\nsiders the \ufb01rst 64 tokens (FirstP) in each docu-\nment, whereas Wang et al. (2022) leverages ten\nrandomly-selected chunks of 64 consecutive to-\nkens, a technique they call Document As Query\n(DaQ). When working with Natural Questions and\nTriviaQA, which contain lengthy documents, we\nexamine each variant separately and in combina-\ntion. In the case of MS MARCO, which has short\npassages, FirstP and DaQ are essentially the same,\nassuming suf\ufb01cient context length.\n3.2.2\nSynthetic Query Generation\nFor training the model for the retrieval task, the nat-\nural baseline uses existing labeled data, i.e., queries\nfrom the retrieval dataset as inputs and the docids\nlabeled as relevant as targets (we will denote this\nas \"Labeled Queries\" in our tables).\nHowever, as argued in Zhuang et al. (2022b)\nand Wang et al. (2022), there are two kinds of gaps\nbetween the index and retrieval tasks. First is the\ndata distribution gap: queries for the retrieval task\nare short and request speci\ufb01c information, while\nthe documents for the indexing task are long and\nconvey information. Second is the coverage gap:\nthe model is exposed to the entire corpus during the\ntraining of the indexing task, while only positive\nexamples have associated queries in the retrieval\ntask. The latter problem is exacerbated in the MS\nMARCO passage ranking task as only 550K pas-\nsages have an associated query for training the re-\ntrieval task, while the indexing task has to learn to\nencode all 8.8M passages in the corpus.\nTheir proposed method for mitigating this gap\nis by generating synthetic queries for each doc-\nument using a query generation model such as\ndocT5query (Nogueira et al., 2019a). The gen-\nerative retrieval model is then trained to predict the\ndocid given the corresponding synthetic queries.\nWe can also think of these synthetic queries as al-\nternative document representations.\n3.2.3\nDocument Identi\ufb01ers\nIn this work, we consider four kinds of different\nidenti\ufb01ers: the three kinds of document identi\ufb01ers\nfrom the original DSI paper: unstructured atomic\nidenti\ufb01ers (Atomic IDs), naive string identi\ufb01ers\n(Naive IDs), and semantically structured identi\ufb01ers\n(Semantic IDs), and the 2D Semantic IDs from\nWang et al. (2022).\nAtomic IDs.\nWe treat each docid as a sin-\ngle, or \u201catomic\u201d token in this setting. The decoder,\nthen, only needs to run for a single decoding step;\nwe then sort the logits of the docids to obtain the\nranked document list. The setting requires adding a\ntoken, for each document, to the model vocabulary,\nincreasing the model\u2019s parameter count by corpus\nsize times embedding dimension, which can be\nexpensive for large corpora. When considering\nmillions of documents, we apply two optimizations\nto make implementation more feasible. First, the\nencoder\u2019s embedding table is adjusted to only\nconsist of the standard T5 vocabulary, while the\ndecoder\u2019s output projection only corresponds to\ndocids. Second, we take special care to ensure\nthe output projection is properly sharded across\ncores to distribute memory cost to allow scaling.\nIn the t5x framework (Roberts et al., 2022), this\ncorresponds to setting appropriate partitioning\nrules.\nNaive IDs.\nIn this setting, the original doc-\nument identi\ufb01er from a corpus is directly used and\ntreated as a textual string. For example, a \ufb01ve-digit\nnumber \u201c42915\u201d is treated as a string and passed\nthrough the SentencePiece vocabulary of T5. It is\nworth noting that such naive document identi\ufb01ers\nmight also capture some semantics of the corpus,\nas they depend on the curation pipeline that might\nleak some notions of relatedness.\n4\nSemantic IDs.\nFollowing Tay et al. (2022),\ninstead of relying on prede\ufb01ned identi\ufb01ers, Seman-\ntic IDs aim to imbue document identi\ufb01ers with\nhierarchical semantic information. Speci\ufb01cally,\nafter encoding documents into dense vectors, a\nhierarchical k-means algorithm recursively clusters\nthe space into k clusters until individual clusters\ninclude no more than c documents. Consequently,\nall document identi\ufb01ers form a tree, where\nnon-leaf nodes correspond to super-clusters, and\nleaf nodes are clusters with at most c documents\neach.\nSemantic IDs are formed by composing\nthese cluster ids, each from 0 to k \u2212 1, tailed\nby a document id in the leaf nodes between 0\nand c \u2212 1. In this work, we use the identi\ufb01ers\ngenerated by Wang et al. (2022) for NQ and\nTriviaQA for a fair comparison. These are based\non a 12-layer BERT model. For MS MARCO,\nwe use SentenceT5-Base (Ni et al., 2022a), and\nc = 100. Since the passage-level corpus is large, if\na cluster ends up bigger than 1M documents, we\nsample 100k when computing centroids. We used\nk = 10 clusters at each level, corresponding to the\nten digits (0 . . . 9).\n2D Semantic IDs.\nIn the Semantic ID set-\nting, the same tokens are used to represent different\nsemantic meanings at different positions: we use\nthe same set of numbers/tokens between 0 to k \u2212 1\nfor all identi\ufb01ers, but they represent semantic\nclusters at different levels in the tree. To address\nthis, NCI (Wang et al., 2022) extends the Semantic\nID and introduces its 2D variant by adding an extra\ndimension to encode the positions, making the\nmodel aware of levels of clustering when decoding\nthe identi\ufb01er. To implement this modeling change,\nthey additionally introduce a change to the decoder\ndescribed in the next section.\n3.3\nModel Variants\nBesides alternative ways of constructing model\ninputs and targets, generative retrieval approaches\nthat build on DSI have also investigated novel\nmodeling components.\nHere, we review three\nmodel components introduced by Bevilacqua et al.\n(2022) and Wang et al. (2022).\nPre\ufb01x-Aware\nWeight-Adaptive\nDecoder\n(PAWA) is proposed as a method for decoding\n2D Semantic IDs. Unlike a standard Transformer\ndecoder, which uses the same matrix to project the\ndecoder\u2019s hidden representation to the vocabulary\nspace for every position, PAWA uses different pro-\njection matrices at each timestep, with the weights\nof each projection matrix computed adaptively\nby a separate Transformer decoder. Speci\ufb01cally,\nin a vanilla decoder, the dense representation\nh \u2208 Rl\u00d7d from the last decoder layer is projected\ninto the vocabulary space with W\n\u2208 Rd\u00d7|V |,\nwhere l denotes the sequence length for decoding.\nTo incorporate the position, the extra decoder\nin PAWA separately processes the input query\nand the already-decoded docid tokens to output a\nprojection matrix W pawa \u2208 Rd\u00d7l\u00d7|V |, replacing\nW. This aims to capture that the semantic meaning\nof a docid token depends on its position in the\noutput sequence as well as on the docid pre\ufb01x\npreceding it. The experiments in this paper use the\nopen-source PAWA implementation provided by\nthe original authors1 as a reference and build it out\non t5x. For more details, one could refer to (Wang\net al., 2022) and their code base.\nConstrained decoding can be used to avoid gen-\nerating invalid document identi\ufb01ers (Bevilacqua\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022).\nA potential\nreason is that the space of identi\ufb01ers is sparse,\nespecially for Semantic IDs, and constrained\ndecoding may help with memorization.\nWhile\nwe have empirically found that roughly less\nthan 1 in 20 DSI-based generation beams are\ninvalid, we include this method nonetheless, as it is\nwidespread in the literature. In this work, we adopt\nan exact match approach that leverages a trie to\nensure only valid document identi\ufb01ers are decoded.\nConsistency\nloss\ncan\nbe\nused\nto\nalleviate\nover-\ufb01tting by introducing a regularization term.\nThe basic idea is that the representations generated\nby two forward passes with different dropout\nmasks should be similar.\nWang et al. (2022)\nincorporate this insight into a regularization\nterm that augments the generation loss.\nWe\ninvestigate the softmax version as described in the\nNCI paper (Eq. 5 in (Wang et al., 2022)) and a\nKL-divergence version from an early version of\nNCI (Eq. 1). They compute the Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence between the output probabilities\nof two independent forward passes per position,\n1https://github.com/solidsea98/\nNeural-Corpus-Indexer-NCI\n5\nDataset\n#Docs\n% Covered by\ntrain query set\nNQ100k (Wang et al., 2022)\n110k\n98.4%\nTriviaQA (Wang et al., 2022)\n74k\n57.7%\nMSMarco100k\n100k\n92.9%\nMSMarco1M\n1M\n51.6%\nMSMarcoFULL\n8.8M\n5.8%\nTable 1:\nThe coverage statistics of the benchmark\ndatasets and their training query sets.\nwhere pi,1 and pi,2 are the probability distributions\nover the vocabulary space from the two forward\npasses at position i, respectively.\nLreg = 1\n2[DKL(pi,1 || pi,2) + DKL(pi,2 || pi,1)]\n(1)\nWhile we closely follow the implementation of\nthe Neural Corpus Indexer code base, we \ufb01nd that\nthese regularization terms lead to training instabil-\nity and that the model effectiveness often diverges\ninto a NaN loss. As a result, we do not include\nconsistency regularization in our \ufb01nal experimental\nsetup.\n4\nExperimental Setting\nWe limit ourselves to English retrieval tasks, focus-\ning on the behavior of generative retrieval models\nat varying corpus scales.\n4.1\nCorpus and Training Data\nFollowing\nsmall-scale\ngenerative\nretrieval\nexperiment setups (Tay et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2022; Zhuang et al., 2022b; Chen et al.,\n2023), we start with experiments on the Natu-\nral Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and\nTriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) datasets. To better\nunderstand how different model con\ufb01gurations\nperform at scale and in more practical settings, we\nalso experiment with variants of the MS MARCO\npassage ranking dataset. The MS MARCO passage\nranking dataset consists of a corpus of 8.8M\npassages and a training set of 532K queries. From\nthis dataset, we construct three variants, namely,\nMSMarco100k (100k passages), MSMarco1M\n(1M passages), and MSMarcoFull (all 8.8M\npassages). It is worth noting that most documents\nin NQ100k and MSMarco100k have at least one\nrelevant query in the training set. However, as we\nscale to MSMarcoFull, the fraction of documents\nwith queries in the training set drastically drops to\naround 6%, leading to a more practical setup. We\nsummarize the statistics of these datasets in Table 1.\nNQ100k and TriviaQA. To enable compar-\nisons, we reuse the documents, the segmented\ndocuments, the training/testing splits, and gen-\nerated query sets from Wang et al. (2022). The\nNatural Questions and TriviaQA datasets have\ncorpora of sizes 109K and 74K, respectively.\nNote that Wang et al. (2022) refers to NQ100k\nas NQ320k; we refer to the number of unique\ndocuments instead of the labeled training data\nsize.\nMost documents in the NQ100k dataset\nhave at least one relevant question in the training\ndata, while 58% of the TriviaQA dataset has this\nproperty.\nMSMarco100k.\nIn the same vein as NQ100k\nand TriviaQA, we curate a dataset with 100k\npassages sampled from the full MS MARCO\npassage ranking dataset. Most passages have at\nleast one positive query for training.\nWe also\ninclude passages relevant to the queries in the\ndevelopment dataset (for evaluation).\nMSMarco1M.\nThis\ndataset\nis\n10\u00d7\nlarger\nthan MSMarco100k.\nAs with MSMarco100k,\nwe augment the corpus with passages relevant to\ndevelopment queries. We \ufb01rst include all passages\nrelevant to the 533K and 7K queries from the\ntraining dataset and development sets, respectively.\nThis results in 516K and 7K unique passages from\neach set. We randomly sample passages without a\nquery in either set to total a million passages.\nMSMarcoFULL.\nIn\nthis\nsetting,\nwe\nnote\nanother order of magnitude scale-up in corpus\nsize. As a result, only 5.8% of the passages have a\ncorresponding query in the training set. We aren\u2019t\naware of any previous work that has attempted to\napply generative retrieval models to a dataset of\nthis size and complexity.\n4.2\nSynthetic Query Generation\nFor NQ100k and TriviaQA, we reuse the gener-\nated questions from (Wang et al., 2022) with 20\nand 15 generated questions for each document,\nrespectively. For the MSMarco variants, we use\ndocT5query (Nogueira et al., 2019a) to generate\nquestions, with 40 generated questions per passage.\nWe also train a question-generation model using\nT5-base using training data from DPR (Karpukhin\n6\net al., 2020), a retrieval dataset derived from\nNQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). We use this model\nto generate 40 questions per passage, following\nthe con\ufb01guration of docT5query. We refer to this\nvariant as \u201cin-domain D2Q\u201d for NQ and TriviaQA.\n4.3\nEvaluation Dataset and Metrics\nWe report evaluation results on the development\nsets of each dataset. For NQ100k and TriviaQA,\nthe evaluation dataset includes 7830 and 7993 ques-\ntions each. For the three MSMarco variants, we\nuse the validation split from the MS Marco pas-\nsage ranking dataset, with 6,980 examples. For\neach query in the development sets, we use the\nmodels to generate ranked lists of documents. We\nreport Recall@1 as the primary metric for Natural\nQuestions and Recall@5 for TriviaQA. For the MS\nMARCO passage ranking variants, we use Mean\nReciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) as our primary\nmetric.\n4.4\nModel Variants\nWe evaluate all methods using a T5.1.1 back-\nbone (Raffel et al., 2020a). We test variants of\nlabeled vs. synthetic queries, FirstP vs. DaQ doc-\nument representations, as well as combinations of\nmultiple representations. For each model variant,\nwe ablate all versions of document identi\ufb01ers when\napplicable. Model architecture additions are per-\nformed, in a stacking fashion, starting with the base\nmodel and then adding on PAWA, constrained de-\ncoding, and consistency loss in this order. Note,\nwe only evaluate PAWA with 2D Semantic IDs, as\nit is built speci\ufb01cally for that setting.\nFor model scaling experiments, we mainly in-\nvestigate whether Atomic IDs are an effective way\nto scale to millions of passages, given the parame-\nter cost. As such, we consider larger models with\nNaive IDs and Semantic IDs comparable to T5-\nBase with Atomic IDs, which total 7B parameters\nwhen scaling to 8.8M docids.\nFor baselines we provide BM25 (Robertson and\nZaragoza, 2009) and BM25 with doc2query-T5\n(Nogueira et al., 2019a). For Natural Questions\nand TriviaQA, we also include the previous results\nreported for the NCI-variant of NQ (i.e., NQ100k).\nThis includes state-of-the-art generative retrieval\nresults like NCI and GenRet (Sun et al., 2023), as\nwell as GTR-Base, a state-of-the-art dual encoder\n(Ni et al., 2022b). For the new MS MARCO vari-\nants, we provide our own GTR-Base (Ni et al.,\n2022b) results.\n4.5\nImplementation Details\nWe use T5.1.1 as implemented by t5x (Roberts\net al., 2022). We implement the different setups\ndescribed in Section 3 in the form of seqio tasks.\nFor the MS MARCO variants, we set the maximum\ninput sequence length to 128 for all experiments,\nand 64 for the NQ100k and TriviaQA, following\nthe NCI setup. We initialize our models with the\npre-trained T5-base model. For the PAWA decoder,\nwe randomly initialize the PAWA model parame-\nters. Following (Tay et al., 2022) for sequential\nIDs, beam search, with 40 beams, is used during\ninference.\nWe revise hyperparameter settings from (Tay\net al., 2022) to ones we have found to empirically\nperform better, especially for indexing larger cor-\npora like MSMarcoFULL. We set the batch size in\nall our experiments to 512. We train our models\nwith a learning rate of 10\u22123 and a dropout rate of\n0.1. We use 10k learning rate warm-up steps for\nall runs, except for Atomic IDs which use 100k\nsteps. We train our small-scale datasets, NQ100k,\nTriviaQA, and MSMarco100k, for 1M steps. For\nMSMarco1M and MSMarcoFULL, we train our\nmodel to convergence or, at most, 9M steps. We\nuse 8 TPUv4 chips for training models at the T5-\nBase scale. T5-Large, T5-XL, and T5-Base with\nAtomic IDs over MSMarcoFULL use 64 TPUv4\nchips. For T5-XXL, we use 128 chips. Our most\nexpensive runs took roughly 10-14 days to train to\nconvergence on MSMarcoFULL.\n5\nExperimental Results\nWe report our results in three parts. First, we ab-\nlate all the methods from Section 3 using T5-base\non small-scale datasets: NQ100k and TriviaQA.\nWe observe which techniques work best on this\nsmall scale with widely studied datasets. Then we\ntransfer the same set of techniques and scale up\nto the entire MS MARCO passage ranking dataset\nto observe whether the same methods hold their\nground at larger scales and discuss our \ufb01ndings.\nFinally, to understand whether the effectiveness\nbene\ufb01t from Atomic IDs can be attributed to ad-\nditional model parameters on large corpora, we\nselect the best approach and scale the model size\nup to 11B (T5-XXL equivalent) for sequential ID\napproaches.\n7\nNQ100k\nTriviaQA\nModel\nAt.\nNv.\nSm.\nAt.\nNv.\nSm.\nBaselines\nBM25 (via Wang et al.

First block presents baseline results in existing literature. Second block presents ablation results in\na stacking fashion. Third block demonstrates the importance of document representation, in particular D2Q. Last\nrow is the best method revised with in-domain D2Q.\n5.1\nAblations over Small Corpora\nWe report our ablations over NQ100k and Trivi-\naQA in Table 2. The strongest combination of our\ntechniques (row 7) sets a new state-of-the-art result\non NCI\u2019s variant of NQ, without using any sophis-\nticated modeling techniques such as architecture\nchanges or learned docids.\nThe choice of document representation by far\ndominates the overall performance of the retriever.\nUsing just the training queries provided by the\ndataset performs the worst due to the low coverage\nof the documents. FirstP is a major improvement\nover this and DaQ is better than FirstP. However,\nthe usage of D2Q is essential to strong generative\nretrieval performance, resulting in a 7pt+ gain. This\nby far trumps all other proposed techniques.\nAs for other design choices, we see that at this\nsmall scale naive and Semantic IDs perform about\non par (varying between task con\ufb01gurations), with\nAtomic IDs consistently the best. We note though\nthat on NQ100k, Atomic IDs add 80M parameters\nto a T5-Base model that would otherwise be 220M\nparameters (a 36% increase). Given the compara-\nble performance in the best con\ufb01guration (row 7),\nthese extra parameters may or may not be worth\nit, but we refer to Section 6.2 for more discussion.\nModeling techniques from (Wang et al., 2022), i.e.\n2D Semantic IDs, PAWA, constrained decoding,\nand consistency loss, do not reliably improve the\nmodel over the use of synthetic queries alone.\nAt this corpus scale, our best result uses a mix-\nture of FirstP, DaQ, labeled queries, and synthetic\nqueries for training. However, importantly, the\nquality of the synthetic queries are quite important,\nwith synthetic queries from a generator speci\ufb01cally\ntrained for the question answering domain signi\ufb01-\ncantly outperforming the query generator trained\nover MS MARCO which was used by previous\nworks.\n5.2\nScaling Corpus Size\nWe now consider the scaled version of the MS\nMARCO passage ranking task, scaling from 100k\nto 1M and 8.8M passages.

This\nis a notable difference in the transition from NQ\nand TriviaQA to MS MARCO, where FirstP and\nDaQ did provide substantial value. This may be\ndue to NQ and TriviaQA being based on Wikipedia\narticles: the beginning of Wikipedia documents\nare informative entity descriptions, and many sen-\ntences refer to the entity\u2013which is likely the answer\nto a requested query.\nAs corpus size grows, DSI performance rapidly\ndrops off, with the best result (D2Q only with\nAtomic IDs) rapidly falling off from 80.3 to 55.8\nand \ufb01nally 24.2 as we scale to the full 8.8M pas-\nsages. Vanilla Semantic IDs also drop off as we\nscale to the full corpus, under-performing naive\nidenti\ufb01ers. We conjecture that this may be due to\nthe potentially increased length of semantic iden-\nti\ufb01ers being more dif\ufb01cult to decode than naive\nidenti\ufb01ers coupled with a noisy partitioning of the\nsemantic space (especially when using an off-the-\nshelf embedding model such as SentenceT5-Base.)\nHowever, we do observe that Semantic IDs de-\ncoded via PAWA perform better. We provide some\ninsight into why this might be in the next section\nwhere we examine model size. Constrained decod-\ning only provides marginal value and generally is\nnot worth the added complexity.\n5.3\nScaling Model Size\nHow much of Atomic ID\u2019s strong performance can\nbe attributed to its additional model parameters?\nOn MSMarcoFULL, decoding Atomic ID docu-\nment tokens adds an additional 7B parameters\nto the otherwise 220M parameter T5-Base model.\nWe take the best con\ufb01guration on MSMarcoFULL\nfrom Table 3 and scale model parameters of Naive\nID and Semantic ID (PAWA) to similar sizes for\ncomparison. We report results in Table 4.\nOverall, we observe a general trend that as pa-\nrameter count increases, retrieval performance im-\nproves. Indeed, both Atomic IDs and PAWA Se-\n9\nmantic IDs had the strongest performance in Ta-\nble 3, which we now attribute to their increased\nsize. Notice that the difference here only comes\nout when scaling to MSMarcoFULL, where these\nparameter differences magnify signi\ufb01cantly over\nsmaller corpus scales.\nHowever, not all methods are equal. PAWA and\n2D Semantic IDs (Wang et al., 2022) signi\ufb01cantly\nincrease decoding parameters with its extra decod-\ning stack, yet yield no gain over naively scaling the\nTransformer with Naive IDs, underperforming by\n4pts at around 700M parameters. This pattern con-\ntinues to hold scaling PAWA to 2.1B parameters,\nthus, in order to save resources, we do not scale\nPAWA any further.\nScaling Transformers naively according to de-\nfault T5 scales while using Naive IDs had the\nstrongest performance on MSMarcoFULL at 26.7\nMRR@10.\nUsing only\n2.8B parameters, this\napproach outperforms T5-Base with Atomic IDs\nwhich uses 7B parameters while achieving only\n24.2 MRR@10. However, while parameter count\nhas practical implications regarding the resources\nrequired for training and inference (especially\nTPU/GPU memory), there are other trade-offs to\nconsider, which we discuss in the next section.\nWhile Naive IDs perform well at T5-XL size,\nsurprisingly we \ufb01nd that scaling further to XXL\n(11B) does not improve performance; in fact,\nit is detrimental to retrieval performance (24.3\nMRR@10 vs. XL\u2019s 26.7) under the same experi-\nmental settings and hyper-parameter settings, even\nthough model training converges faster. This is\ncounter-intuitive to most generative tasks and to\nthe typical intuition of generative retrieval relying\non model capacity to index an entire corpus of doc-\numents.\n6\nDiscussion\nThe results of this work raises multiple questions\nregarding the current state of generative retrieval at\nscale which we aim to provide more insight here.\n6.1\nWhy are synthetic queries effective?\nAlthough the use of synthetic queries as a docu-\nment representation technique has been shown\nto be effective in previous works (Zhuang et al.,\n2022b; Wang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023), our\nexperiments highlight its central importance to\ngenerative retrieval on a larger, more challenging\ncorpus.\nWe suggest that the effectiveness of\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n70\n80\n90\nJaccard Similarity (%)\nMRR@10\nD2Q-100\nD2Q-40\nFigure 1: Jaccard similarity between synthetic queries\nand validation set queries vs. MRR@10 on the MS-\nMarco100K subset.\n10\n20\n30\n40\n72\n74\n76\n78\n80\n82\nk: # of sampled queries\nMRR@10\nRankT5 top-k\nRandom k\nAll 100 samples\nFigure 2: MSMarco100K MRR@10 as we vary the\nnumber of synthetic queries per passage.\nGiven\n100 pre-generated queries per passage, we compare\nrandom-k sampling, top-k selection via RankT5-XL,\nand using all 100 synthetic queries.\nsynthetic queries mainly come from augmenting\nthe input distribution during training to be closer\nto that observed at inference/evaluation time.\nMainly, this comes in two forms: mitigating the\ncoverage gap of ground-truth labeled queries\nand the document corpus, and closing the gap\nbetween the training query distribution and\ninference/evaluation. In addition, we \ufb01nd that the\ndiversity of generated synthetic queries also can\nhave a signi\ufb01cant effect on retrieval performance.\nDocument coverage gap. In Table 1, for each\ndataset we report the coverage of their document\ncorpus by the corresponding labeled query training\nset. When comparing MSMarco100k, 1M, and\n10\nFULL the query coverage drops from 92.9% to\n51.6% and 5.8% respectively.\nConsider rows\n(2a) and (3b) in Table 3 which only differ by the\naddition of synthetic queries. Here we observe\nthat MSMarco100k improved by 3.3x while\nMSMarco1M improved by 3.9x, even though 1M\nis a larger corpus and may be affected by model\ncapacity as we see with MSMarcoFULL. Similarly,\nfor NQ100k and TriviaQA, which have 98.4%\nand 57.7% coverage respectively, we observe that\nswapping Labeled Queries (No Indexing) (row\n1a) for D2Q only (row 6b) hurts performance\nfor NQ100k while improving performance for\nTriviaQA (Table 2.)\nSince this D2Q model is\ntrained on MS MARCO, for NQ100k replacing its\nown labeled queries with synthetic queries only\namounted to a 1.6% coverage gain, which is not\nworth the domain shift. However, for TriviaQA\nthis amounted to a 42.3% coverage gain, which is\nmore worth the domain shift.\nQuery distribution gap.\nSynthetic query\ngeneration effectively closes the query distribution\ngap between training and evaluation. Table 2 row 7,\n\ufb01rst shows the importance of the query distribution\nby using an in-domain query generation model\nto improve retrieval performance.\nTo further\nunderstand the relationship between retrieval\nperformance and query distribution gap, we\nplot the relationship between synthetic query\nsimilarity vs.\nvalidation query similarity and\nretrieval performance (MRR@10).\nFor each\nevaluation query in the MS MARCO validation\nset, we measure the maximum similarity among all\nsynthetic queries generated for the corresponding\npassage. Jaccard similarity is used for simplicity.\nFor each evaluation query we then evaluate\nMRR@10 using the Atomic ID variant of row 6b\nin Table 3. Figure 1 reports the average MRR@10\nwithin each 10pt Jaccard similarity bucket. We\nplot two variants using 40 and 100 sampled queries\nper passage for comparison.\nIn general, higher Jaccard similarity correlates\nwith higher MRR@10 performance.\nThat is,\nthe more similar our training queries are to the\nevaluation the stronger the retrieval performance.\nComparing the two settings, we see that higher\nexposure to more synthetic queries typically\npromotes higher effectiveness across similarity\nbuckets. Even though the query distribution is\nimportant, it is worth noting that even on the\nlowest end of similarity this setting still has strong\nretrieval performance.\nWhile synthetic query\ndistribution is an important aspect of retrieval\nperformance, it is not singular in determining\nthe end effectiveness and the generative retrieval\nmodel goes far beyond simply detecting lexically\nsimilar queries to those seen during training.\nDiversity.\nWe provide further analysis re-\ngarding the importance of synthetic query diversity.\nHere we assume the same MSMarco100k setting\nusing the Atomic ID variant of row 6b in Table\n3.\nWe vary the number of sampled synthetic\nqueries per passage used for training and observe\nMRR@10.\nWe consider using 10, 20, 30, 40\nand 100 sampled queries per passage, which we\nconstruct by \ufb01rst sampling the full 100 then taking\nrandom subsets of the varying sizes. We use a\nsampling temperature of 1.0 and consider the top\n10 tokens at each sampling step. Recent studies\nshow advances in utilizing cross encoders to re\ufb01ne\nthe generated query set of incoherent, unspeci\ufb01c\nqueries to improve the use of D2Q (Gospodinov\net al., 2023). Accordingly, we also experiment\nwith ranking the 100 sampled queries and taking\ntop-10,20,30,40 instead of randomly sampling.\nWe do so using a state-of-the-art cross-attention\nre-ranker, RankT5-XL (Zhuang et al., 2022a), to\nscore (generated query, passage) pairs and then\ntake the top-k.\nWe report results in Figure 2. We \ufb01nd that, con-\nsistently, sampling more synthetic queries improve\nperformance in this setting. Surprisingly, apply-\ning RankT5-based selection over the samples hurt\nperformance. This suggests an overall preference\nfor more samples, and more diverse samples to\nimprove effectiveness. Using all 100 samples per-\nformed the best, increasing MRR@10 from 80.3\n(Table 3, which used 40 samples) to 82.4, closing\nthe gap with GTR-Base (83.2 MRR@10) on MS-\nMarco100k. Exactly why query diversity is so im-\nportant still up for interpretation, but there could be\na couple possiblities: more diverse samples gives\nhigher probability of at least some of the samples\nbeing close to the target distribution and more sam-\nples could provide a type of regularization to the\nmodel.\n6.2\nWhich model scaling approach is best?\nMuch of this paper has considered parameter cost\nas a proxy for memorization capacity, which has\n11\nbeen conjectured in the past to be important for\nretrieval (Tay et al., 2022). However, model com-\nparisons should not stop at parameter counts as\nthis may not correlate with other cost indicators\n(training speed, FLOPs, etc.) that are important\nto practical applications (Dehghani et al., 2022).\nWhile ultimately the best method to scale genera-\ntive retrieval models will be the one that unlocks\nthe potential of the paradigm to be competitive on\nlarge scale retrieval tasks, we can provide some\n\ufb01rst glimpses into what trade-offs are at stake as\nwe consider larger models for larger corpora.\nAs a case study, we consider T5-Base with\nAtomic IDs compared as T5-XL with Naive IDs\nfrom Table 4.\nBoth are trained only with syn-\nthetic queries, and represent the only two viable\napproaches from our experiments. PAWA severely\nunderperforms with regards to quality as we scale\nmodel size, not to mention the FLOP expense of\nhaving an extra decoding stack during inference.\nWe provide discussion on parameter cost, training\nspeed, and inference FLOPs here.\nParameters. As corpus size scales, generative\nretrieval models face a fundamental prerequisite\nin model size to achieve decent performance, as\nseen in Table 3. Between three different ways\nof adding parameters (naive scaling, Atomic IDs,\nPAWA decoder), we see quality improvements over\nthe smaller models. As discussed, on a \ufb01xed pa-\nrameter budget basis Naive IDs perform the best\non MSMarcoFULL, and best in quality overall.\nTraining Speed. Applications that require fre-\nquent retraining value fast total training walltime.\nWe train T5-Base Atomic IDs and T5-XL Naive\nIDs on the same hardware (64 TPUv4) and hyper-\nparameter settings. To achieve the optimal perfor-\nmance reported in Table 4, T5-XL Naive IDs re-\nquired 14 days while T5-Base Atomic ID required\nonly 7 days. However, at 7 days T5-XL Naive\nIDs was quality matched with T5-Base Atomic IDs\n( 24.5 MRR@10), making both approaches roughly\nequal in terms of training wall-time when account-\ning for quality.\nInference FLOPs. Inference FLOPs can be a\nproxy for serving performance, although imper-\nfect. Here we see that while sequential identi\ufb01ers\ncan achieve more with fewer parameters, atomic\nidenti\ufb01ers are incredibly FLOP ef\ufb01cient during in-\nference. T5-Base with Atomic IDs for MSMarco-\nFULL requires only 9.7% the inference FLOPs of\nT5-XL with Naive IDs for 90% of the retrieval per-\nformance (Table 4). How is this possible? Atomic\nIDs incur additional compute cost to compute an\noutput projection and softmax over the enormous\nvocab of 8.8M docids. However, it only has to\ncompute this once to get a complete ranking of the\nentire corpus \u2013 a potentially very special property\nof the approach. On the other hand, sequential iden-\nti\ufb01ers require d decoding steps to decode a single\ndocid, and k beams to \ufb01nd a ranking of k docids.\nk = 40 for our experiments. Thus even though\nAtomic IDs require an expensive output projection,\nsequential ids require O(d\u00b7k) more decoding steps.\nTo scale Naive IDs to be competitive with Atomic\nIDs, also makes individual decoding steps signi\ufb01-\ncantly more expensive.\nIn the end, we cannot yet say which approach\nis the best as the paradigm has yet to achieve com-\npetitive results on MS Marco passage ranking. On\nsmall corpora (100k), Atomic IDs are the highest\nquality, ef\ufb01cient option without incurring too many\nextra parameters. From our experiments though we\ncan see that training models to maximize memo-\nrization ampli\ufb01es compute trade-offs, and the \ufb01eld\nmust provide more nuanced discussions of cost\ntrade-offs as it considers more realistic applications\nof generative retrieval.\n7\nLimitations\nAs with all empirical studies, ours has its own set\nof limitations which we urge the reader to consider.\nMultiple works have come after the experiments in\nthis work, e.g., (Chen et al., 2023), and thus we do\nnot present an exhaustive set of generative retrieval\ntechniques here. For example, the wide space of\nidenti\ufb01ers based on natural language or learned\ncodes. In addition, due to resource constraints our\nmodel scaling experiments are not exhaustive, and\nnot all ablation scenarios in Table 3 are scaled to\nlarger model sizes. It could be possible that certain\nsetups improve more at larger parameterizations,\nalthough unlikely; as with scaling past 11B. In addi-\ntion, due to the extreme parameter requirements we\ndo not saturate the scaling of Atomic IDs. Finally,\nsince this work focused on the effectiveness of gen-\nerative retrieval on large corpora, scaling model\nsize for smaller corpora was outside our scope. In-\nvestigating the maximum corpus size for which\ngenerative retrieval could provide state-of-the-art\nperformance is a question of practical importance\nwhich we leave for future work.\n12\n8\nFuture Directions\nWhile open problems in generative retrieval have\nnot changed (e.g. how to achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on large corpora, how to update such as\nmodel with new documents (Mehta et al., 2022),\netc), we believe that our work also raises new open\nquestions for the \ufb01eld. (1) How do we properly\nleverage large language models and the power of\nscaling model parameters to bene\ufb01t generative re-\ntrieval on large corpora? While Tay et al. (2022)\nshowed this possibility over NQ, the same is not yet\nobserved on MS MARCO even though intuitively\nexpanded model capacity should bene\ufb01t increased\ncorpus scale. (2) How can we design model scaling\nrecipes and derive scaling laws that maximize re-\ntrieval performance? In this work we only consider\ndefault T5 parameterizations, which may or may\nnot be optimal for memorization heavy tasks. (3)\nHow can we design architectures that can interpo-\nlate between the compute trade-offs of Atomic IDs\nand sequential IDs? We look forward to understand\nmore about these problems in future works.\n9\nConclusion\nWe provide the \ufb01rst empirical study of generative\nretrieval methods over the full MS MARCO pas-\nsage ranking task of 8.8M passages. Of the various\nmethods from the literature which we consider in\nthis work (Tay et al., 2022; Zhuang et al., 2022b;\nWang et al., 2022), we \ufb01nd that the use of syn-\nthetic queries as a document representation strat-\negy is the only approach that remained effective,\nand necessary, as we scaled up the corpus size us-\ning MS MARCO passages. We also highlight the\nimportance of accounting for the compute cost of\ntechniques; keeping the parameter count \ufb01xed, we\n\ufb01nd that naive methods outperform more sophisti-\ncated ones on the full MS MARCO dataset. Our\nstrongest result on MS MARCO passage ranking\nuses only synthetic queries to Naive IDs as its train-\ning task, with the model scaled to T5-XL (3B). This\nmodel achieves 26.7 MRR@10. Surprisingly, in-\ncreasing parameters for the same setting up to XXL\n(11B) performs worse. All of these \ufb01ndings sug-\ngest a need for continued research into generative\nretrieval, closer attention to method comparisons,\nand the potential need for fundamental improve-\nments to the paradigm before we can leverage the\npower of larger language models.\n10\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Yi Tay, Tal Schus-\nter, and Sanket Vaibhav Mehta for their valuable\nfeedback and discussions.\nReferences\nAkari Asai, Jungo Kasai, Jonathan Clark, Kenton\nLee, Eunsol Choi, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. 2021.\nXOR QA: Cross-lingual Open-Retrieval Question\nAnswering.

In this work, we study data-driven offline\ntraining for web agents with vision-language foundation models. We propose an\ninstruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpage\nscreenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as click\nand type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetuned lan-\nguage model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception on a large\ncorpus of demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate this recipe improves the\nagent\u2019s ability of grounded multimodal perception, HTML comprehension, and\nmulti-step reasoning, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. On the\nMiniWoB, we improve over the previous best offline methods by more than 45.8%,\neven outperforming online-finetuned SoTA, humans, and GPT-4-based agent. On\nthe WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter model achieves superior perfor-\nmance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong\npositive transfer to the real-world planning tasks on the Mind2Web. We also collect\n347K high-quality demonstrations using our trained models, 38 times larger than\nprior work, and make them available to promote future research in this direction.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nWeb navigation is a class of sequential decision making problems where agents interact with web\ninterfaces following user instructions (Shi et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Gur et al., 2019). Common web\nnavigation tasks include, for example, form filling (Diaz et al., 2013), information retrieval (Nogueira\n& Cho, 2016; Adolphs et al., 2022), or sending emails via a sequence of interactions with computer\ninterface such as click or type (Figure 1). Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing\nagents to automate these actions and free humans from repetitive interactions (Mazumder & Riva,\n2020; Li et al., 2020; Shvo et al., 2021).\nMost prior works studied web navigation problems as online RL to learn the optimal action distribution\nwith task-specific models from scratch (Liu et al., 2018; Gur et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019; Humphreys\net al., 2022). However, online RL requires massive trials-and-errors and is often infeasible in\npractice since the failure in web navigation would result in undesirable consequences; for instance,\nwrong password may lead to account freeze, and sending email to the wrong person could be\nproblematic in a business scene. In contrast, offline training from the static dataset enables safe\ndevelopment of web agents, but the performance has been sub-optimal compared to those online\nRL counterparts (Humphreys et al., 2022; Gur et al., 2022). Furthermore, many of the prior works\nwas unable to leverage rich out-of-domain data for generalization, as they usually use specialized\nmodels to explicitly handle the hierarchical structures of document object model (DOM) and their\ndependencies, for example, with LSTM (Gur et al., 2019; 2021), self-attention (Liu et al., 2018), or\nGNN (Jia et al., 2019). And many of them only output a fixed set of categorical actions (Humphreys\net al., 2022), which is unfavorable for truly open-ended web navigation in the real world.\n*Work done as Student Researcher at Google.\n1\narXiv:2305.11854v4  [cs.LG]  25 Feb 2024\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nStep 1\nSuccess\nInstruction: Find Gisele\u2019s email and forward it to Siana, please. \n{'action': 'click', 'ref': '8'}\n{'action': 'type', 'ref': '59', 'text': 'Siana'}\n{'action': 'click', 'ref': '50'}\n{'action': 'click', 'ref': '55'}\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nFigure 1: Example episode on MiniWoB++ (Shi et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018) (email-inbox-forward-nl).\nThe agent clicks the email from the proper sender, and types the correct receiver to forward that email, to satisfy\nthe given instruction (e.g. Find Gisele\u2019s email and forward it to Siana, please). WebGUM makes use of both\nHTML and image screenshot information to adapt a pre-trained instruction-finetuned foundation model to solve\nchallenging web-based tasks.\nRecently, foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), especially large language models\n(LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), have demonstrated superior performance\nin commonsense, symbolic, arithmetic, and multi-step logical reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b;c; Kojima\net al., 2022). These models enable transformative generalization and are capable of solving wide\nranges of interactive decision making problems in the wild, including but not limited to task planning\nin robotics (Huang et al., 2022a;b; Shah et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022), board game (Meta Fundamental\nAI Research Diplomacy Team et al., 2022), web-based retrieval and browser crawling (Nakano et al.,\n2021; Yao et al., 2022b; Zaheer et al., 2022).\nIn this work, we leverage pre-trained vision and language foundation models and introduce a\ncompetitive offline learning recipe for autonomous web agents: First, we hypothesize that grounded\nspatial understanding is important for web navigation (Humphreys et al., 2022; Toyama et al., 2021)\nand thus enables our agent to observe both HTML and screenshots by combining a language model\nand a ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), from semantically rich multimodal tokens that perceive local and\ntemporal information. Second, we observe that web navigation tasks are by nature instruction-\nfollowing and thus base the language model on an instruction-tuned LLM (Wei et al., 2022a;\nChung et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Iyer et al., 2022) instead of self-supervisedly pre-trained\nLLMs (Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020) as in Gur et al. (2022). Third, we collect a large\nmultimodal corpus, with both HTML and screenshots, to finetune the language model and ViT\njointly. Fourth, our model outputs action in free-form text. These four key pieces together give\nus a multimodal web agent, which we call Web navigation via Grounded Understanding Models\nor WebGUM in short. As shown in Figure 1, our model takes in a command for a web-based task\nvia a natural language instruction (e.g., in an email client, Find Gisele\u2019s email and forward it to\nSiana, please.) and uses multimodal observations of the computer interface to complete the task via a\nsequence of computer actions.\nOn MiniWoB++ (Shi et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018), a simulated web navigation environment bench-\nmark, WebGUM outperforms previous best offline approaches trained with HTML inputs (Gur et al.,\n2022) by 45.8%, and even the best existing online RL approaches (Humphreys et al., 2022), despite\nbeing trained fully offline with much fewer experiences. WebGUM also shows better performance\nthan humans and private-LLM-based agents (Kim et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). We perform extensive\nablations and analysis in Section 5 to demonstrate WebGUM\u2019s advantages in (1) temporal and local\nmultimodal perception, (2) dataset and model size scaling, (3) better HTML understanding,\nand (4) ability of multi-step reasoning. WebGUM grounds vision and HTML understanding on\nthe computer interface, which is critical for solving multi-step tasks with dynamic page transitions\nor tasks that require visual contexts, such as booking flights (+50%), shape recognition (+22%), or\ncrawling social media (+21%). Using instruction-finetuned language models (Chung et al., 2022),\ncompared to using vanilla models (Raffel et al., 2020), improves the success rate on MiniWoB++ by\n25%, and is especially adept at handling the unknown composition of the tasks or out-of-distribution\nHTML inputs synthesized with realistic perturbations. On the WebShop benchmark (Yao et al.,\n2022a), we demonstrate that the capability of multi-step reasoning (Wei et al., 2022c) in language\nmodels enables better performance than existing state-of-the-art few-shot PaLM-540B (Yao et al.,\n2022b; Chowdhery et al., 2022), while our model only has 3 billion parameters. WebGUM exhibits\nstrong positive transfer to the real-world action prediction tasks on the Mind2Web while surpassing\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nT5 Encoder Tansformer\nT5 Decoder Tansformer\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\n{'action': 'type', 'ref': '5', 'text': 'Olin'} Use the textbox to \nenter \"Olin\" and press \"Search\", then \ufb01nd and click the \n7th search result. <body ref=\"1\"><div id=\"wrap\" \nref=\"2\"><div id=\"area\" ref=\"3\"><div id=\"search-bar\" \nref=\"4\"><input type=\"text\" id=\"search-text\" \nref=\"5\"></input><button id=\"search\" \nref=\"6\">Search</button></div></div></div></body>\nImage Observations\nAction history, Instruction, HTML\nAction\n{'action': click, 'ref': '6'}\nViT\nTokenization & Embedding\nMiniWoB++\nPrediction\nNext Step\nHTML Tokens\nTemporal Tokens\nLocal Tokens\nFigure 2: Overview of WebGUM, our multimodal encoder-decoder model.

Visual tokens contain rich temporal information from recent H-step (H = 2)\nand local information from 16 \u00d7 16-size patches. Multimodal language-image tokens are fed into pre-trained T5\nencoder-decoder models (Raffel et al., 2020), and are jointly trained to predict executable actions in text formats.\nGPT-4. Finally, we collect 347K multimodal expert demonstrations on MiniWoB++, 38 times larger\nthan the existing unimodal dataset (Liu et al., 2018), and make these publicly available for future\nresearch 1. We believe that incorporating foundation models for efficient offline training is a scalable\napproach towards real-world web automation where online interactions are prohibitively costly.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nWeb Navigation Among many proposed benchmarks for autonomous web navigation (Toyama\net al., 2021; Burns et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022a), one of the most inclusive and representative\nbenchmark to test the capability of autonomous agents is MiniWoB++ (Shi et al., 2017; Liu et al.,\n2018), which consists of a set of simulated websites with various user instructions from primitive\ntasks to complex multi-step decision making tasks, such as sending emails or booking flights. Prior\nworks have tried to solve this benchmark using a variety of techniques; Liu et al. (2018) and Gur\net al. (2019; 2021) leverage the guidance during online RL from high-level workflow (Liu et al.,\n2018) or curriculum learning (Gur et al., 2019; 2021), which should be, however, designed per task,\nand then would not be scalable methods. Other approaches have employed supervised learning (SL)\nwith a large million-scale dataset and following RL-finetuning (Humphreys et al., 2022), or SL with\nLLM-based agents (Gur et al., 2022). Offline SL agents often suffer from sub-optimal behavior, and\nonline RL with tremendous exploratory experiences has been critical for proficient navigation on\nthe web (Humphreys et al., 2022), which is, however, difficult to conduct in real websites as there is\ntypically no reward signal and interactions are prohibitively costly. As shown in Appendix I, many of\nthese approaches depend on task-specific hierarchical structures of DOM (Jia et al., 2019; He et al.,\n2020), tailored architectures to encode their dependencies such as LSTM (Gur et al., 2019; 2021),\nself-attention (Liu et al., 2018), or GNN (Jia et al., 2019), and task-dependent categorical output\nspace (Humphreys et al., 2022), which could not handle open-ended multi-task settings similar to\nreal world, or incorporate pre-trained models. In contrast, we remove such web-specific architectures\nand convert web navigation into visual question-answering format (text, image \u2192 text), which allows\nus to leverage pre-trained foundation models (Chung et al., 2022; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) as rich\nprior knowledge on the web, and then to learn the capable agents even with offline training.\nLarge Language Models for Web Navigation Concurrently, private-LLM-based agents, such as\nInstructGPT (text-davinci-003) (Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-3.5-turbo, have achieved competitive\nperformance to RL-fintuned models and humans by leveraging a handful of few-shot demonstra-\ntions with self-improvement (Kim et al., 2023), code generation (Sun et al., 2023), and structured\nprompts (Zheng et al., 2023). In contrast, WebGUM focuses on multimodality and finetuning with\ndomain-specific data. With those, we show very competitive performance compared to PaLM-540B\nwith only 3 billion parameters. WebGUM can also handle long HTML observation tasks, such as\nbook-flight or choose-date-hard, where agents that rely on in-context few-shot learning\ntend to run out of input tokens. In addition, our models do not requires ad-hoc prompt engineering.\n1https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gresearch/webllm\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nMethods\nModality\nPre-trained Models\nOffline\nDataset\nSuccess Rate\nCC-Net (SL)\nDOM+Image\nResNet\n\"\n2400K\n32.0%\nWebN-T5\nHTML\nT5-XL\n\"\n12K\n48.4%\nWebGUM (Ours)\nHTML+Image\nFlan-T5-Base,ViT-B16\n\"\n2.8K\n61.1%\nHTML\nFlan-T5-XL\n\"\n401K\n88.7%\nHTML+Image\nFlan-T5-XL,ViT-B16\n\"\n401K\n94.2%\nWGE\nDOM\n\u2013\n%\n12K+\n64.6%\nCC-Net (SL+RL)\nDOM+Image\nResNet\n%\n2400K+\n93.5%\nHuman\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n93.5%\nRCI\nHTML\nGPT-3.5-turbo\nICL\n\u223c0.1K\n90.6%\nAdaPlanner\nHTML\ntext-davinci-003\nICL\n\u223c0.1K\n92.9%\nRCI\nHTML\nGPT-4\nICL\n\u223c0.1K\n94.0%\nSynapse\nHTML\nGPT-3.5-turbo\nICL\n\u223c0.1K\n98.5%\nTable 1: Average success rate on MiniWoB++. We refer to Zheng et al. (2023) for the baseline performances. See\nAppendix G for the detailed scores. WebGUM outperforms the previous finetuned-LLM with 3B parameters (Gur\net al., 2022), which is the best among offline methods, even with 2.8K dataset and Base-size model (310M pa-\nrameters). Scaling dataset and model size, WebGUM beats the online RL-finetuned state-of-the-art (Humphreys\net al., 2022) despite fully offline training, and exceeds humans or LLM-based agents with GPT-4 (Kim et al.,\n2023). \u201c+\u201d in Dataset column means extra billions of frames are required during the online RL phase.\nIn Appendix B, We discuss additional related works on multimodal large-scale models and foundation\nmodels for decision making.\n3\nPRELIMINARIES\nWe formulate autonomous web navigation as a deterministic sequential decision making problem;\ncomposed of a state space S, action space A, deterministic transition function T : S \u00d7 A \u2212\u2192 S,\ninstruction space G, reward function (or episodic success criteria) r : S \u00d7 G \u00d7 A \u2212\u2192 {0, 1}. At\neach time step t, the agent follows a parameterized policy conditioned on previous states and actions\n\u03c0 : S \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 S\n|\n{z\n}\n\u00d7t\n\u00d7 A \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 A\n|\n{z\n}\n\u00d7t\n\u00d7G \u2192 A, and transits to the next state: st+1 = T(st, at). This\nprocess continues until the agent reaches the terminal state (e.g. Submit button is clicked) or the\nmax time step is exceeded. An episode is treated as a success if given instruction g is satisfied (i.e.\nr(st, g, at) = 1), and as a failure if the agent takes a invalid action or reaches a wrong terminal state.\nIn autonomous web navigation, the state st \u2208 S is a web page consisting of the raw HTML as a text\nsequence and a screenshot as an image. Following prior works (Shi et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018;\nGur et al., 2019; 2021), we assume the constraint action space: function(selector, text).\nfunction is either click or type, selector is an integer index that can uniquely specify the\nelement, and text is a text input for type function.\nFigure 1 presents an example episode of MiniWoB (Shi et al., 2017), which involves multi-step\ndecision making. To meet the given instruction, the agent clicks an email from the proper sender and\ntypes the correct receiver to forward that email. MiniWoB also has primitive behavioral tasks such as\nclicking buttons or entering texts. For the examples of WebShop (Yao et al., 2022a), see Appendix L.\n4\nWEBGUM\n4.1\nMULTIMODAL TRANSFORMER MODELS WITH TEMPORAL AND LOCAL PERCEPTION\nIn this work, we follow Gur et al. (2022) to use T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), an encoder-decoder\narchitecture, for HTML-based web navigation, as its bi-directional nature could be a good fit for the\ntree structure of HTML and the architecture has been shown to scale well. We combine T5 with\na vision transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) for multimodality as illustrated in Figure 2.\nSpecifically, we use the ViT to map image observations (screenshots) into image tokens. The ViT\nis pre-trained on ImageNet-21K classification (Deng et al., 2009). The T5 encoder then consumes\nboth visual and HTML tokens in a unified manner, and the decoder predicts actions in text.

We subtract the success rates\nto compute absolute improvement: (SR of WebGUM(HTML+Image)) - (SR of WebGUM(HTML)).\nImage modality is leveraged for multi-step tasks with dynamic page transitions or tasks that require visual\nconcept understanding (e.g. book-flight or click-shape). See Appendix G and L for the details.\nEncoding Temporal and Local Visual Tokens For language models to be aware of task temporal\ninformation and local scene recognition, the encoder considers multimodal tokens extracted from\na history of patched screenshots (H = 2 steps). Temporal visual tokens contribute to predict\nthe consistent actions in a multi-step tasks. To better extract spatial and semantic information\nacross the local parts of websites, our ViT encodes one local token per patch rather than global\none per image (i.e. CLS-token). We divide an input image into 16 \u00d7 16 patches \u2013 giving a total of\n14 \u00d7 14 (number of patches) \u00d7 2 (temporal window) = 392 visual tokens. We crop the screenshots\nof MiniWoB++ to remove the yellow instruction part, and the image size becomes 160 \u00d7 160. We\npad cropped images with white pixels to fit them into 224 \u00d7 224; the default input size for ViT.\n4.2\nINSTRUCTION-FINETUNED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nWe base our language model on Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), an instruction-finetuned T5, as\nopposed to using a vanilla pre-trained T5 as in Gur et al. (2022). Flan-T5 is finetuned with large-\nscale instruction-following format problems and chain-of-thought examples across a variety of\ndomains, including reasoning or programming. Considering that web navigation is inherently an\ninstruction-following task, we hypothesize that carefully trained instruction-finetuned models could\ngeneralize well to enhance the alignment with user instruction and zero-shot reasoning in the web-\nnavigation, interactive decision making context. For the same reason, we also hypothesize that these\nhigh-performing instruction-finetuned models enable better sample efficiency and downstream perfor-\nmance, and thus are well-suited for offline learning. We further finetune the Flan-T5 language model\nand the ViT vision encoder jointly (Figure 2) on a large corpus of instruction-following multimodal\nweb navigation data, which we describe in Section 4.3. In Section 5, we empirically demonstrate that\nthis instruction-finetuned recipe improves HTML comprehension, multi-step reasoning and decision\nmaking significantly.\n4.3\nLARGE-SCALE DATA COLLECTION WITH LANGUAGE MODEL AGENTS\nRecent successes of foundation models are largely powered by internet-scale data (Brown et al.,\n2020; Radford et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). While large amount of data is\ncritical, for web navigation domain, there is only a small public dataset for MiniWoB++, consisting\nof 12K episodes of human demonstration (Liu et al., 2018). Moreover, the dataset only consists of\nDOM observations and lacks any visual features, which might limit the fine spatial perception of\nthe elements on the page. A large-scale multimodal dataset, including screenshots of websites, is\nrequired to build a better navigation policy at scale.\nTo collect a huge amount of multimodal behavioral dataset on MiniWoB++, we leverage the finetuned-\nLLM policy from Gur et al. (2022), instead of human demonstrators (Liu et al., 2018; Humphreys\net al., 2022). This significantly reduces the cost to construct a new dataset by leveraging the prior\nsuccess of autonomous agents. We first rollout a LLM policy with 100 episodes per task, which\nresults in a 2.8K successful episodes. Then, we finetune Flan-T5-XL models with this small dataset\nand run those with 10,000 episodes per task. Lastly, we collect additional 54K demonstrations\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nIN (Temporal)\nIN (Local)\nIN (Temp+Local)\nIN+AugReg\nJFT-300M\nJFT-3B\nCLIP\nMAE (IN)\nDINO (IN)\n64.0\n64.5\n65.0\n65.5\n66.0\n66.5\nAverage Success Rate\n64.2\n64.0\n66.1\n65.8\n65.4\n66.3 66.3\n65.4 65.5\n2.8K\n68K\n347K\nDataset Size\n56\n58\n60\n62\n64\n66\n55.7\n56.3\n57.2\n61.1\n62.3\n66.1\nBase\nLarge\nXL\nXXL\nModel Size\n50\n60\n70\n80\n57.2\n72.4\n75.5\n79.0\n66.1\n77.4\n80.3\nFlan-PaLM: 72.8\nWebN-T5: 49.8\nMM-WebN-T5: 55.6\nHTML+Image\n+Visual Token Ablation\n+SSL ViT\nHTML\nHTML (Decoder-only)\nFigure 4: Average success rate of WebGUM with visual perception tokens and ViT pre-training ablations (left),\ndifferent dataset size (middle) and model architectures (right). In dataset and model size results, X-axis is a\nlogarithmic scale. (left) While the effects of various pre-trained ViT with different datasets or self-supervised\nobjectives are marginal, employing both temporal and local perception tokens is critical for the performance.\n(middle & right) As for both HTML and multimodal models, we could observe the scaling effect: the larger\nthe dataset and model size are, the higher the success rates are. The results also prove that decoder-only\nFlan-PaLM-8B is not as good as similar-size encoder-decoder models.\nwith Synapse (Zheng et al., 2023), a private-LLM-based agents with prompting, for the tasks where\nthe finetuned-LLM may not complete well. Such efforts result in a multi-task dataset with 401K\n(347+54K) episodes including HTML and screenshots at each step. See Appendix F for more details.\n5\nRESULTS\nWe test our method on MiniWoB++ (Shi et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018) with 100 evaluation episodes\nper task, taking the average success rate over 56 tasks taken from Gur et al. (2022). Table 1 shows\nthat WebGUM, with a small 2.8K dataset and Base-size model (310M parameters), significantly\noutperforms previous offline methods for web navigation (Humphreys et al., 2022; Gur et al., 2022).\nWhile they used 2.4 million episodes or 3 billion parameters, WebGUM could improve the data\nand parameter efficiency to achieve superior performance in offline regime, which is realized by\nthe problem simplification of web navigation in order to leverage temporal-local visual perception\nand instruction-finetuned LLMs as strong inductive bias on web environments. In addition, scaling\ndataset and model size, WebGUM achieves 94.2% success rate2, exceeding the previous best offline\nmodel, WebN-T5 (Gur et al., 2022), by over 45.8% and even surpassing the online RL-finetuned\nSoTA, CC-Net (Humphreys et al., 2022) (+0.7%), despite our fully offline training and much fewer\ndata. Moreover, WebGUM surpasses humans and recent LLM-based agents, such as RCI (Kim et al.,\n2023) and AdaPlanner (Sun et al., 2023), even with GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). The per-task comparison\nand error analysis (Appendix G, L) imply that there is room for improvement in complex reasoning\ntasks requiring memory such as guess-number.\nIn the following sections, we perform extensive and precise ablations of WebGUM to clearly identify\nthe source of improvement. Especially, we will demonstrate the contribution of (1) temporal and\nlocal multimodal perception (Section 5.1), architectures and pre-trained models, and (2) dataset\nand model size scaling (Section 5.2). We will also point out (3) better HTML comprehension\n(Section 5.3) and (4) capability of multi-step reasoning (Section 5.4) from instruction-finetuned\nLLMs. Furthermore, we prove that WebGUM can be transferable to the real-world tasks (Section 5.5).\n5.1\nTEMPORAL AND LOCAL VISUAL PERCEPTION FOR GROUNDED WEB NAVIGATION\nTo verify the importance of image modality, we design three ablations: (i) input replacement, (ii)\nremoving visual perception tokens, and (iii) employing different pre-trained ViT. We first replace\nimage observations with completely white images, and with randomly sampled MiniWoB++ screen-\nshots taken in the initial states at test time. For visual token and pre-trained ViT ablations, we prepare\nvarious pre-trained weights with ImageNet-21K (IN) + AugReg (Steiner et al., 2022), JFT-300M (Sun\net al., 2017), or JFT-3B (Zhai et al., 2022), and with self-supervised objectives such as CLIP (Radford\net al., 2021), MAE (He et al., 2021), or DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and then finetune Base-size\nmodels as a proxy of larger-size models (Hoffmann et al., 2022) to reduce the computational costs.\n2Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mm-webnav/\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nclick-link\nclick-button\nclick-link_click-button\nMethods\nModality\nSuccess Rate\nWebN-T5 (Gur et al., 2022)\nHTML\n51.0%\nSynapse (Zheng et al., 2023)\nHTML\n73.8%\nWebGUM\nHTML\n74.2%\nWebGUM\nHTML+Image\n78.5%\nFigure 5: (Left) Example of compositional evaluation on MiniWoB++.

We\nprepare three different types of perturbations at test time: adding extra HTML at the top of the original input\nHTML (left) or at the bottom (middle), and adding task-irrelevant attributes in each element (right) such as\ncoordinate information (left, right, top, bottom). (Right) Average success rate of perturbation evaluation on\nMiniWoB++. The results reveal that while all the methods are affected by input corruptions to some extent,\nWebGUM, especially with multimodality, achieves significantly better performances than previous method.\nIn Figure 3 (left), the performance of the model with white images is comparable to the unimodal\nmodel. Presumably because the model with randomly-taken images may accidentally contain the\nimages from the target task, WebGUM (random) slightly surpasses WebGUM (white). These results\nprove WebGUM successfully obtains grounded vision and HTML understanding by leveraging\ntemporal and local fine perception. In the visual token ablation, Figure 4 (left) shows that combining\nboth temporal and local visual tokens (66.1%) improves the performance than temporal (64.2%)\nor local tokens only (64.0%). Interestingly, the effects of different pre-trained ViT are marginal,\ncompared to visual tokens, which highlights our contribution on designing suitable architecture for\nmultimodal web navigation.\nWe also compare per-task performance gaps caused by adding vision modality to language models.\nFigure 3 (right) presents top-10 absolute performance improvement, suggesting WebGUM leverages\nvisual inputs for multi-step tasks with dynamic page transitions (e.g. book-flight; +50%) or\ntasks requiring visual context understanding (e.g. click-shape; +22%) (see Appendix G and L).\n5.2\nSCALING EFFECT IN DATASET AND MODEL SIZE\nIn this section, we show the importance of scaling up the dataset and model size in WebGUM, similar\nto the observations in the language and vision domain (Shoeybi et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2020; Rae\net al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022b; Chowdhery et al., 2022). To investigate data scaling, we prepare three\ndataset: minimal 2.8K demonstrations, 347K demonstrations, and its 20%-size demonstrations (68K),\nand then finetune Flan-T5-Base with them. Figure 4 (middle) proves that increasing dataset size leads\nto the improvement of success rate. Because multimodal models benefit from the scaling more, the\nlarger dataset size might be more crucial in multimodal models, which also supports our attempts\nto construct large-scale multimodal dataset for web navigation. Notably, Base-size WebGUM with\n2.8K episodes already achieves 55.7%/66.1%, surpassing previous best SL models (49.8%/55.6% we\ntrained with 347K episodes). This surprising data efficiency comes from the sufficient inductive bias\nand alignment with the user intentions in instruction-finetuned LLMs.\nIn addition to dataset size, Figure 4 (right) shows that the performance of WebGUM improves as\nthe number of parameters in T5 model increases from Base (220M) to XXL (11B). These results\nalso reveal that scaling the models might be more important than the dataset; the low-capacity\nmodel may cap the performance at a lower level. In contrast, decoder-only Flan-PaLM-8B only\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nachieves 72.8% success, comparable to WebGUM-Large (770M), which emphasizes the advantage\nof encoder-decoder models in web navigation. See Appendix D for further details.\n5.3\nBETTER HTML COMPREHENSION FROM INSTRUCTION-FINETUNED LLMS\nWe have demonstrated that instruction-finetuned LLMs outperforms vanilla LLMs in web navigation.\nTo analyze the effect of instruction-finetuning more precisely, we here focus on the capability of\nHTML understanding. Since instruction-finetuned LLMs perform well on many NLP tasks with\ncontent comprehension (Chung et al., 2022; Iyer et al., 2022), web navigation should also benefit\nfrom them. As a test bed for HTML comprehension, we investigate (1) generalization to unseen\ncompositions of known tasks, and (2) robustness to the realistic input perturbations, which are also\nimportant challenges for the web agents to be deployed on the real-world internet. We also provide the\nbase language model comparison on a standard HTML comprehension benchmark, WebSRC (Chen\net al., 2021d) in Appendix E, where Flan-T5 achieves better EM/F1 scores than T5 after finetuning.\nFor the compositional tasks, we pick up 4 click-\u201csomething\u201d (link, button, checkboxes, dialog)\ntasks and make 6 combinations of these by naively stitching with 2 or 3 tasks (e.g. Figure 5). See\nAppendix H for further details. The results show that WebGUM with HTML and image inputs\noutperforms prior finetuned-LLM (Gur et al., 2022) and Synapse (Zheng et al., 2023), a SoTA LLM\nagent in MiniWoB++, which implies WebGUM has obtained better reading skills for web navigation\nand could transfer them to handle unseen HTML in compositional tasks robustly.\nTo test the robustness against input corruptions, we test three different realistic perturbations; adding\nextra HTML at the top or bottom of the original HTML, and adding attributes of coordinates (left,\nright, top, bottom; they are unrelated to solving the tasks) in each element of HTML at test time.\nThese perturbations often happen in the real world due to the renewal or API changes, not to mention\nunknown websites, but rule-based pre-processing may not fully cover them. The results show that\nwhile all the methods are affected by the input corruptions to some extent, WebGUM, with both\nHTML and HTML plus image modalities, achieves significantly better performances than Gur et al.\n(2022). Notably, WebGUM outperforms prior finetuned LLM (+ 56.2% in multimodal and +33.4%\nin unimodal models) even when extra distracted attributes are added to HTML. They support our\nhypothesis: instruction-finetuning imporves HTML comprehension in LLMs, which enables the\ndownstream agents to deal with out-of-distribution inputs or tasks robustly.\n5.4\nABILITY OF MULTI-STEP REASONING AS A PRIOR FOR INTERACTIVE DECISION MAKING\nMethods\nTraining\nModels\nScore\nSuccess Rate\nRule\n\u2013\n\u2013\n45.6\n9.6%\nIL\nSL\nBART, BERT\n59.9\n29.1%\nIL+RL\nSL+RL\nBART, BERT\n62.4\n28.7%\nAct\nIn-context\nPaLM-540B\n62.3\n30.1%\nReAct\nIn-context\nPaLM-540B\n66.6\n40.0%\nWebN-T5\nSL\nT5-XL\n61.0\n29.8%\nWebGUM\nSL\nFlan-T5-XL\n67.5\n45.0%\nTable 2: Average score and success rate on Web-\nShop (Yao et al., 2022a). WebGUM achieves\n45.0% success, outperforming baseline methods\nincluding ReAct, a prompted PaLM-540B. We\nrefer Yao et al. (2022b) for the baselines.\nAnother notable feature in instruction-finetuned LLMs\nis an ability of multi-step reasoning (Chung et al., 2022).\nWe hypothesize this reasoning capability would play an\nimportant role as a prior for interactive decision mak-\ning. To decouple the evaluation of reasoning capability\nfrom visual page perception, HTML understanding, and\nthe benchmark simulator (MiniWoB++), we extensively\nevaluate our WebGUM on WebShop (Yao et al., 2022a),\nanother online-shopping website simulator with a large\namount of real-world product data. Because it requires\ncomplex multi-step decisions considering previous con-\ntexts for item comparison, WebShop is suitable for in-\nvestigating the capability of multi-step reasoning from\ninstruction-finetuned LLM in depth (Yao et al., 2022a;b). WebShop provides a user instruction that\ndescribes the features of item (e.g. I need a long clip-in hair extension which is natural looking, and\nprice lower than 20.00 dollars). The agents should search, compare and choose a proper product\nthat matches the given instruction. The performance score is evaluated by the percentage of required\nattributes covered by the chosen product, and if the product meets all the requirements, that episode\nis labeled a success. See Appendix K for further details.\nTable 2 shows that WebGUM achieves 45.0% success, significantly outperforming not only simple\nbaselines, such as supervised imitation learning (IL), IL plus RL-finetuing and WebN-T5 (by more\nthan 15%), but also recent prompt-based LLM agents, including ReAct (Yao et al., 2022b) (i.e.\nPaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022) with one-shot prompt and reasoning annotations), while our\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nCross-Task\nCross-Website\nCross-Domain\nTrain\nEle.

WebGUM, transferred from MiniWoB,\ndemonstrates superior performance to MindAct and GPT-4 across task/website/domain generalization.\nmodel only has 3 billion parameters. Due to the consistent reasoning and enhanced alignment with\nuser intentions, WebGUM could compare the products with backtracking, and choose proper options\n(see Appendix L). Our results imply that ability of multi-step reasoning in Flan-T5 works as strong\nand transferable prior knowledge for downstream decision making.\n5.5\nSTRONG TRANSFER TO REAL-WORLD ACTION PREDICTION\nLastly, we demonstrate the applicability of WebGUM to real-world problems. We test WebGUM on\nMind2Web (Deng et al., 2023), a real-world demonstration dataset with about 2K instructions on 137\nwebsites. In the action prediction tasks, we transfer WebGUM finetuned for MiniWoB++ with 401K\ndataset into real-world Mind2Web by further finetuning with the training set. WebGUM takes top-50\nrelevant HTML snippet candidates, instructions, and action history as inputs and outputs next actions\nby predicting the element id, operations (e.g. click, type), and values. Table 3 reveals that WebGUM,\ntransferred from MiniWoB, achieves superior performance to MindAct-Large/XL and even GPT-4 in\nall the categories (cross-task/website/domain). Because both MindAct and WebGUM are based on\nFlan-T5, these results support that WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to real-world tasks.\n6\nDISCUSSION AND LIMITATION\nThroughout the paper, we present an effective and practical methodology to simplify web navigation\ninto offline training in order to leverage the inductive bias of web environments in instruction-finetuned\nLLMs. While WebGUM exhibits positive transferability to real-world problems in Mind2Web, we\nleave it as future work to scale multimodal foundation models into the deployment for real-world\nweb navigation (Gur et al., 2023).\nWe collect and release a multimodal expert dataset with 347K episodes on MiniWoB++. However,\nthis is still far from internet-scale dataset that is necessary for generalist models. Collecting behavioral\ndata at scale by iterative data-collection and deployment (Ghosh et al., 2021; Matsushima et al.,\n2021; Li et al., 2022a) might be a key for practical interactive agents. Since our approach \u2013 taking\nraw HTML and screenshots as inputs and predicting parsable actions in text \u2013 only has minimal\nassumptions which constraint model architectures, it might be applicable to any advanced LLMs\nor open-ended situations. While WebGUM could deal with out-of-distribution compositional and\nperturbed tasks in a robust manner, human-level broader generalization to the diverse real websites or\ninstructions is still a hard problem to be resolved.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe develop Web navigation via Grounded Understanding Models (WebGUM), learning an instruction-\nfollowing visual language foundation model for web navigation. WebGUM significantly improves\nthe success rate on MiniWoB, compared to previous offline-trained SoTA from 48.4% to 94.2%.\nOur detailed ablations show that temporal and local visual tokens capture dynamic transition and\nvisual context of the page, and that instruction-finetuned language models significantly improves\nweb navigation performance due to the better HTML comprehension and capability of multi-step\nreasoning. Multi-step reasoning enables more robust generalization to out-of-distribution tasks,\nand outperforms PaLM-540B in WebShop. WebGUM also demonstrates strong positive transfer to\nreal-world action prediction tasks in Mind2Web. Furthermore, we scale the existing MiniWoB dataset\ninto multimodal 347K expert demonstrations, about 38 times larger than before. We believe that our\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nwork is an significant step towards building more capable and scalable models for autonomous web\nnavigation.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nHF was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP22J21582.

For instance, the wrong password may\ncause an account freeze, and emailing the wrong person is problematic in a business scene. Training\nwith online RL may often be infeasible for this reason, while we demonstrate an alternative approach;\ndata-driven, fully offline training by leveraging inductive bias in foundation models. Autonomous\nagents, well-grounded with the user\u2019s intention, should be helpful in our daily lives by reducing our\nburden on computer tasks. Because a part of our training corpus (54K) includes the demonstrations\ntaken from the output of LLMs (Anil et al., 2023), we will exclude those from the dataset release and\nit will result in 347K episodes.\nB\nEXTENDED RELATED WORKS\nFoundation Models for Decision Making Recently, the ability of multi-step reasoning and inductive\nbias in foundation models have been leveraged to solve text-based interactive tasks via sequential\ndecisions considering few-shot in-context examples (Ahn et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022a;b; Zeng\net al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022b; Meta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team et al., 2022). Even\nin continuous control (Chen et al., 2021a; Janner et al., 2021; Furuta et al., 2022b; Brohan et al.,\n2022) or computer games (Reed et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022b; Fan et al., 2022), high-capacity\ntransformer models are trained with a large amount of diverse dataset via multi-task behavioral\ndistillation (Chen et al., 2021c; Gu et al., 2021a; DeepMind Interactive Agents Team et al., 2021;\nFuruta et al., 2022a; Shridhar et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022). To build autonomous web navigation\nagents, we also leverage pre-trained LLM (Raffel et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2022), by finetuning with\nmassively-curated multimodal demonstrations, and we point out that the better content comprehension\nand multi-step reasoning abilities, obtained through instruction-finetuning of LLM (Chung et al.,\n2022), are essential for the notable performance on downstream decision making aligned with human\ninstructions.\nMultimodal Large-scale Models Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary emergent\nabilities on a variety of NLP tasks, such as commonsense question answering, arithmetic, logical\nreasoning, open-ended text generation (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al.,\n2022; Wei et al., 2022b; Tay et al., 2022), or code completion (Chen et al., 2021b; Austin et al.,\n2021; Li et al., 2022b). In addition, some works have investigated vision-and-language understanding\nto improve the accuracy of common vision-based tasks such as open-ended image/object classifi-\ncation (Radford et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2021b; Kamath et al., 2021), image captioning, or visual\nquestion-answering (Lu et al., 2022; Alayrac et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Reed et al., 2022; Liu\net al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). Several works also have tackled document understanding\nwith (multimodal) transformer models (Xu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021a;c; Appalaraju et al., 2021;\nTang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a;b), including markup languages such as HTML (Aghajanyan\net al., 2021; 2022; Li et al., 2021b; Lee et al., 2022a) for summarization of the documents or question\nanswering on the contents. Despite the great efforts on document understanding, these works are\nless connected to interactive decision making problems. Our model obtains not only a grounded\nunderstanding of websites in a multimodal manner but also the ability to decide the optimal actions\nto achieve given instructions in web navigation, helping multi-step decisions and visual context\nunderstanding.\nC\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nWe adopt the encoder-decoder models proposed by Raffel et al. (2020) as multimodal transformers,\nand vision transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) pre-trained with ImageNet-21K (Deng et al., 2009)\nas an image encoder for the visual tokens3. We especially use ViT-B16, a small-size transformer\nwith 86 million parameters, which divides an input image into 16 \u00d7 16-size patches. We use publicly\n3https://github.com/google-research/scenic\n19\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\navailable checkpoints of T5 (Raffel et al., 2020)4, Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022)5, and T5-XL finetuned\nwith MiniWoB++ demonstrations (Gur et al., 2022)6 for the experiments. To construct the training\npipeline, we leverage SeqIO (Roberts et al., 2022) library, and use SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson,\n2018) vocabulary with 32K tokens from C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) for text tokenization. The\nbatch size for training is 128, and input sequence length is set to 4096 tokens. Due to the huge\ncomputational requirements, we run one seed to train each model throughout the paper (Humphreys\net al., 2022; Gur et al., 2022). We use cloud TPU-v4, which has a 32 GiB HBM memory space for\nthe experiments. Base-size models require 256 cores and XL-size models do 512 cores, which takes\n1-2 days for finetuning.\nD\nDETAILS ON DATASET AND MODEL SIZE SCALING\nWe here present how critical it is to scale up the dataset and model size in WebGUM. For the dataset\nsize ablation, we use Flan-T5-Base and ViT-B16. As for both HTML and multimodal models, we\ncould observe the scaling effects in web navigation: the larger the dataset (Table 4) and model\n(Table 5) size are, the higher the success rates are. Surprisingly, our approach even with only 2.8K\nHTML episodes (about 25% of the previous one curated by Liu et al. (2018)) and Base-size model\n(about 7.3% parameters) already achieves 55.7%, surpassing previous SL state-of-the-art (48.4%\nby Gur et al. (2022)). This surprising efficiency might come from the sufficient inductive bias and\nalignment with the user intentions in instruction-finetuned LLMs, and WebGUM could fully leverage\nthem for web automation problems. The margin of improvement might be smaller than expected\ndue to the limited capacity of transformer to obtain the grounded understanding of natural language\ninstructions, HTML, and screenshots. In fact, the results also reveal that scaling the models might be\nmore important than the dataset; the low-capacity model may cap the performance at a lower level.\nPre-Trained Models\nModality\nDataset\nSuccess Rate\nT5-XL (Gur et al., 2022)\nHTML\n12K\n48.4%\nT5-XL\nHTML\n347K\n49.8%\nFlan-T5-Base\nHTML\n2.8K\n55.7%\nFlan-T5-Base\nHTML\n68K\n56.3%\nFlan-T5-Base\nHTML\n347K\n57.2%\nFlan-T5-Base, ViT-B16\nHTML+Image\n2.8K\n61.1%\nFlan-T5-Base, ViT-B16\nHTML+Image\n68K\n62.3%\nFlan-T5-Base, ViT-B16\nHTML+Image\n347K\n66.1%\nTable 4: Average success rate of WebGUM with different dataset sizes.

Those problems are curated from real websites to\ninclude key-value extraction, entity comparison, and table understanding problems. The answer\nformats are either text span in HTML or binary (yes/no). Because the context length is insufficient\nfor raw HTML, we preprocess context HTML by extracting a snippet that includes the answers in\nadvance. We finetune both T5-XL and Flan-T5-XL with the training dataset. Table 6 shows that\nFlan-T5 records better HTML comprehension performance than T5, which may accelerates the web\nnavigation performance on MiniWoB++ and Mind2Web.\nModels\nEM\nF1\nT5-XL\n63.85\n71.44\nFlan-T5-XL\n68.91\n78.48\nTable 6: Base language model performance in WebSRC (Chen et al., 2021d). We finetune both T5 and Flan-T5\nwith trainng dataset. Flan-T5 achieves better performance in HTML comprehension than T5.\nF\nDATASET DETAILS\nTo construct a large-scale multimodal behavioral dataset on MiniWoB++, we leverage a public\nfinetuned-LLM policy (Gur et al., 2022) trained with multi-task human demonstration dataset (Liu\net al., 2018)7 as a demonstrator. We run such LLM policies with 10,000 episodes per task and only\nkeep successful trajectories to maintain the quality of dataset, following Humphreys et al. (2022).\nLastly, we collect additional 54K demonstrations with Synapse (Zheng et al., 2023)8, a private-LLM-\nbased agents with prompting, for the tasks where finetuned-LLM may not complete well such as\nclick-scroll-list and enter-time, and also write a scripted policy for book-flight.\nWe use PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023) as a base LLM for Synapse. Such efforts result in a multi-task\ndataset with 401K (347K+54K) episodes including HTML and screenshots at each time step. Table 7\nshows the details of our multimodal dataset (347K), consisting of HTML, screenshots, actions, and\ninstructions at each time step.\n7https://github.com/stanfordnlp/miniwob-plusplus-demos\n8https://github.com/ltzheng/synapse\n21\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTask\n# of episodes\n# of steps\nRatio (episode)\nbook-flight\n9999\n90177\n2.88%\nchoose-date\n383\n1508\n0.11%\nchoose-date-easy\n3353\n12946\n0.97%\nchoose-date-medium\n2222\n8733\n0.64%\nchoose-list\n1861\n3724\n0.54%\nclick-button\n9782\n9909\n2.82%\nclick-button-sequence\n10000\n20000\n2.88%\nclick-checkboxes\n9761\n28904\n2.81%\nclick-checkboxes-large\n1962\n19072\n0.57%\nclick-checkboxes-soft\n9228\n36384\n2.66%\nclick-checkboxes-transfer\n10000\n59793\n2.88%\nclick-collapsible\n5947\n13077\n1.71%\nclick-collapsible-2\n2199\n5627\n0.63%\nclick-color\n2554\n2554\n0.74%\nclick-dialog\n10000\n10000\n2.88%\nclick-dialog-2\n3285\n3285\n0.95%\nclick-link\n9961\n9961\n2.87%\nclick-menu\n3238\n3243\n0.93%\nclick-option\n9998\n20000\n2.88%\nclick-pie\n3724\n8548\n1.07%\nclick-scroll-list\n0\n0\n0.00%\nclick-shades\n0\n0\n0.00%\nclick-shape\n6116\n6117\n1.76%\nclick-tab\n9978\n13177\n2.88%\nclick-tab-2\n1844\n2109\n0.53%\nclick-tab-2-hard\n1574\n1916\n0.45%\nclick-test\n10000\n10000\n2.88%\nclick-test-2\n10000\n10000\n2.88%\nclick-widget\n9963\n9963\n2.87%\ncount-shape\n5849\n5893\n1.69%\nemail-inbox\n5159\n14258\n1.49%\nemail-inbox-forward-nl\n9995\n39980\n2.88%\nemail-inbox-forward-nl-turk\n4900\n20165\n1.41%\nemail-inbox-nl-turk\n4346\n11416\n1.25%\nenter-date\n10000\n20000\n2.88%\nenter-password\n9980\n29940\n2.88%\nenter-text\n10000\n20000\n2.88%\nenter-text-dynamic\n9983\n19966\n2.88%\nenter-time\n0\n0\n0.00%\nfocus-text\n10000\n10000\n2.88%\nfocus-text-2\n10000\n10000\n2.88%\ngrid-coordinate\n8353\n8353\n2.41%\nguess-number\n1021\n2042\n0.29%\nidentify-shape\n9007\n9010\n2.60%\nlogin-user\n9793\n29379\n2.82%\nlogin-user-popup\n9786\n39170\n2.82%\nmulti-layouts\n10000\n40000\n2.88%\nmulti-orderings\n10000\n40000\n2.88%\nnavigate-tree\n9864\n15140\n2.84%\nsearch-engine\n8872\n35095\n2.56%\nsocial-media\n2631\n4407\n0.76&\nsocial-media-all\n95\n208\n0.03%\nsocial-media-some\n319\n893\n0.09&\ntic-tac-toe\n3947\n13773\n1.14%\nuse-autocomplete\n3465\n6930\n1.00%\nuse-spinner\n530\n532\n0.15%\nTotal\n346827\n867277\n100%\nTable 7: Details of our multimodal dataset.

(2022) and Zheng et al. (2023) for the baseline performances.\nWe use 56 tasks as benchmark, while removing some duplicated tasks (e.g. \u201c-nodelay\u201d tasks) from\n62 tasks adopted in Gur et al. (2022). During the evaluation on MiniWoB++, we ignore the time limit\ndue to the computational constraints.\nFigure 7 presents full results of the absolute performance improvement, subtracting the\nsuccess rates:\n(Success Rate of WebGUM(HTML+Image)) - (Success Rate of\nWebGUM(HTML)). The results suggest WebGUM leverages visual inputs for multi-step tasks with\ndynamic page transitions (e.g. book-flight or search-engine) or the tasks that require\nglobal contexts of the page (e.g. tic-tac-toe or click-shape).

Then, we\nprepare the following 6 combinational tasks,\n\u2022 click-button_click-checkboxes\n\u2022 click-button_click-dialog\n\u2022 click-button_click-link\n\u2022 click-link_click-button\n\u2022 click-link_click-button_click-dialog\n\u2022 click-link_click-dialog\nThese\ntasks\nshould\nbe\nresolved\nin\norder\nof\nthe\nname:\nfor\ninstance,\nin\nclick-link_click-button_click-dialog task, the agent should click the proper\nlink, click the proper button, click the proper dialog, and then the task results in success. In\nclick-button_click-link task, the agent should click the proper button, and then click the\nproper link.

WebShop provides user instruction that describes the feature of items (e.g. I need a long clip-in\nhair extension which is natural looking, and price lower than 20.00 dollars). The agents should\nsearch, compare and choose a proper product that matches the given instruction. Since WebShop\nrequires complex multi-step reasoning considering previous contexts for comparison (Yao et al.,\n2022a;b), we can test the capability of instruction-finetuned LLM in decision making tasks in depth.\nThe performance score is evaluated by the percentage of required attributes covered by the chosen\nproduct (from 0 to 100), and if the product meets all the requirements, that episode is labeled a\nsuccess.\nBecause WebShop does not have API to get the screenshot of rendered websites, we focus on We-\nbGUM with text inputs, parsed from noisy HTML in the real world.9 We convert the actions from\nraw texts (e.g. search[a long clip-in hair extension] or click[<item id>])\nto dictionary-like format (e.g. {\"action\":\n\"search\", \"ref\":\n\"a long clip-in\nhair extension\"} or {\"action\":\n\"click\", \"ref\":\n\"<item id>\"}), as we\nuse in MiniWoB++, to improve the prediction accuracy. We finetune Flan-T5-XL with about\n1K human demonstrations curated by Yao et al. (2022a)10, using only high-score demonstrations. The\nscore threshold is score \u2265 50 and we have 840 episodes in total (Table 12). We construct the model\ninput with action history, instruction, and text observation, the same as MiniWoB++ experiments. We\nevaluate our method with 500 user instructions in the test set.\nTable 11 shows that WebGUM achieves 45.0% success, significantly outperforming not only simple\nbaselines, such as supervised imitation learning (IL) and IL plus RL-finetuing (by more than 15%), but\nalso recent prompt-based LLM agents, including ReAct (Yao et al., 2022b) (i.e. PaLM-540B (Chowd-\nhery et al., 2022) with one-shot prompt and reasoning annotations), while our model only has 3\nbillion parameters. IL and IL plus RL-finetuning baselines use BART (Lewis et al., 2019) model for\nthe search policy, and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) model for the click policy. The better performance\nof WebGUM proves the hypothesis that the ability of multi-step reasoning in instruction-finetuned\nlanguage models works as a prior for decision making problems.\nMethods\nTraining\nModel\nModality\nScore\nSuccess Rate\nRule\n\u2013\n\u2013\nText\n45.6\n9.6%\nIL\nSL\nBART, BERT\nText(+Image)\n59.9\n29.1%\nIL+RL\nSL+RL\nBART, BERT\nText(+Image)\n62.4\n28.7%\nAct\nIn-context\nPaLM-540B\nText\n62.3\n30.1%\nReAct\nIn-context\nPaLM-540B\nText\n66.6\n40.0%\nWebN-T5\nSL\nT5-XL\nText\n61.0\n29.8%\nWebGUM\nSL\nFlan-T5-XL\nText\n67.5\n45.0%\nHuman\n\u2013\n\u2013\nText+Image\n82.1\n59.6%\nTable 11: Average score and success rate on WebShop (Yao et al., 2022a) benchmark.

On\nthe other hand, Machine Translation Systems\nare mostly trained using cross-lingual supervi-\nsion that requires aligned data between source\nand target languages. We demonstrate that pre-\ntraining Large Language Models on a mixture\nof a self-supervised Language Modeling objec-\ntive and the supervised Machine Translation\nobjective, therefore including cross-lingual\nparallel data during pre-training, yields mod-\nels with better in-context learning abilities. As\npre-training is a very resource-intensive pro-\ncess and a grid search on the best mixing ra-\ntio between the two objectives is prohibitively\nexpensive, we propose a simple yet effective\nstrategy to learn it during pre-training.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe rapid progress in the development of large-\nscale pre-training, GPT (Brown et al., 2020),\nXGLM (Lin et al., 2021), PaLM (Chowdhery et al.,\n2022), has resulted in models capable of perform-\ning a variety of tasks through the in-context learn-\ning (aka. few shot) paradigm (Brown et al., 2020):\none can present the model a few demonstrations\nof a given task at inference, and the model will\nable to follow these demonstrations on new, unseen\nexamples. Therefore it is no longer necessary to\n\ufb01ne-tune these models on a variety of down-stream\ntasks. The pre-training of such Large Language\nModels (LLMs) relies on self-supervision, i.e. the\ndata does not require to be annotated. Examples\nof self-supervised (LM) Language Modeling objec-\ntives are next token prediction, where the task is to\npredict the next token given the previous ones, or\nspan-corruption where the task is to \ufb01ll-in a portion\nof missing text given its surroundings.\nOn the other hand, Machine Translation Models\n(MTMs) are still being trained using cross-lingual\nsupervision, which requires aligned parallel data.\nIndeed, the Machine Translation (MT) objective\nconsists in predicting the target sentence given the\nsource sentence, and therefore it is necessary to\ncollect aligned pairs of texts between source and\ntarget languages.\nOn Machine Translation, pre-trained LLMs have\nhistorically under-performed MTMs trained just\non millions of supervised examples both when\nthe LLMs are evaluated using in-context learning,\nor after having been \ufb01ne-tuned on parallel data.\nHowever, the performance gap between LLMs and\nMTMs has been shrinking. For example, the re-\ncent PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), a language\nmodel pre-trained using self-supervision only, is\nable to outperform previous state-of-the-art MTMs\non older machine translation benchmarks, while\nstill lagging behind supervised MTMs on recent\nbenchmarks (Vilar et al., 2022). Such a trend raises\nthe natural question Q: Is training on cross-lingual\nsupervised data still necessary or bene\ufb01cial?\nRegarding question Q, we think that the most\npromising direction to explore is the inclusion\nof parallel data when pre-training LLMs. The\n\ufb01rst rationale for our preference is the shrink-\ning gap on MT benchmarks between LLMs and\nMTMs: it is quite likely that LLMs will be able\nto catch-up in the nearby future, while at the\nsame time being able to perform many more tasks\nthan MTMs.\nThe second rationale is that pre-\ntraining datasets are still dominated by English,\ncompare the language composition of the pre-\ntraining dataset for PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022):\nother languages, especially lower resource ones,\nare under-represented. Therefore, a natural con-\njecture is that aligned cross-lingual data might en-\nhance the abilities of LLMs across languages other\nthan English.\nWhen assessing the multi-lingual abilities of\nLLMs we need to distinguish between the open and\nclosed generation settings. In closed generation the\narXiv:2305.11778v1  [cs.CL]  19 May 2023\ntask is performed in a single language; for example\na context paragraph is presented in German, ques-\ntions are formulated in German and answers are\nexpected in German. In open generation the task\nis performed across two languages; for example\na context paragraph is presented in English, ques-\ntions are formulated in German and answers are\nexpected in German. Now the attractiveness of in-\ncluding cross-lingual data during pre-training lies\nnot only in the ability to improve the machine trans-\nlation performance of LLMs, but also in building\na bridge between languages. While we might ex-\npect that cross-lingual supervision improves closed\ngeneration in under-represented languages, another\nnatural conjecture is that it improves open genera-\ntion, i.e. where two languages are involved.\nIn light of the above discussion we re\ufb01ne Q:\nIs cross-lingual supervised data bene\ufb01cial when\npre-training LLMs? In particular, are there gains\nboth on open and closed generation when using the\nin-context learning paradigm for evaluation?\nWe are not the \ufb01rst to consider the usage of\ncross-lingual supervision with LLMs, see Section 2.\nHowever our study differs from previous ones in\nthe following aspects:\n1. We include cross-lingual supervision at the\npre-training stage.\n2. We include cross-lingual supervision using\nthe standard supervised MT objective.\n3. We evaluate the resulting models with in-\ncontext learning considering both closed and\nopen generation settings.\n4. We learn the amount of parallel data to use\nwhile training.\nIn this work we \ufb01rst demonstrate that including\nsome cross-lingual supervision is bene\ufb01cial when\npre-training large language models, thus answer-\ning Q. Then, when faced with learning an opti-\nmal amount of cross-lingual supervision to use, we\nshow that automated curriculum learning (Graves\net al., 2017) is an effective strategy that does not re-\nquire multiple training runs and which outperforms\nstatic policies.\nWe emphasize the importance of learning the\namount of parallel data while training without re-\nsorting to a hyper-parameter search. Pre-training\nan LLM on suf\ufb01ciently many tokens is a resource\nintensive task; for example each of our experiments\nwith a 3.8B-parameter models requires 256 TPUv4\ncores for 5 days. If we treat the mixing ratio be-\ntween the parallel MT data and the LM training\ndata as a hyper-parameter \u03bb, we have in theory\njust an additional hyper-parameter. However a\ngrid search is prohibitively expensive; for exam-\nple (Kale et al., 2021) considered a less compute-\nintensive setup in which one \ufb01ne-tunes mT5 models\nfor 100k steps on a mixture of MT and LM data;\nnevertheless they were able to just compare two\nvalues of \u03bb. Furthermore, treating \u03bb as a hyper-\nparameter overlooks the fact that there might be\ndynamic scheduling strategies, i.e. varying \u03bb over\ntime, that outperform static ones in which \u03bb is held\n\ufb01xed.\n2\nRelated work\nWe are not the \ufb01rst to investigate the usage of\nparallel cross-lingual data with LLMs. (Reid and\nArtetxe, 2022) considered leveraging parallel data\nby devising a loss consisting of 3 objectives; how-\never, their technique is somewhat complicated be-\ncause it necessitates the development of a multi-\nlingual noising procedure, while we opt for includ-\ning the cross-lingual data using the standard MT\nobjective. (Chi et al., 2021) proposed a simpler\nobjective by building on top of the success of (Xue\net al., 2021): directly adding supervised MT data\nto the denoising procedure used for training mT5,\nwhich results in models outperforming mT5 in\ncross-lingual generation. Note however, that while\n(Chi et al., 2021) includes cross-lingual supervi-\nsion during pre-training, the resulting models do\nnot display in-context learning abilities and evalua-\ntion is carried out by \ufb01ne-tuning on down-stream\ntasks. (Kale et al., 2021) explored what happens by\n\ufb01ne-tuning mT5 on parallel data; therefore parallel\ndata is used during an intermediate stage between\npre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning on down-stream tasks.\nA limitation of all these studies is the emphasis on\n\ufb01ne-tuning: all of these models require \ufb01ne-tuning,\nwhich is quite different from few-shot in-context\nlearning. As such, the question of whether super-\nvised data in one task can bene\ufb01t few-shot learning\nin another task remains unexplored.\n3\nBasic Setup\n3.1\nTraining Data\nOur Language Modeling data is based on that\nfrom (Chowdhery et al., 2022) but we slightly\nData Source.\n% of Data\nSocial media conversations\u2020\n40%\nFiltered webpages\u2020\n34%\nGitHub\n4%\nBooks\u2217\n15%\nWikipedia\u2020\n5%\nNews\u2217\n2%\nTable 1: LM Data: Data sources and proportion of data.\n\u2020 means the data source is multilingual, while \u2217 means\nit is English-only.\nmodify the proportions between different sub-\ncategories, see Table 1. We do not use a public\nLanguage Modeling dataset, e.g. MC4 (Raffel et al.,\n2019), as in early experiments the high-quality data\nfrom (Chowdhery et al., 2022) yielded better in-\ncontext learning abilities. As Language Modeling\nobjective we use the recent \u201cUL2\u201d (Tay et al., 2022)\nbecause it has shown better performance in the few-\nshot setting.\nFor the MT data we use an in-house parallel cor-\npus covering the languages in Table 2, which also\nreports the sampling proportions and highlights\nwhether we consider a language in the High or Low\nresource setting. Note that our training data has al-\nways the source or the target in English. We use the\nstandard approach used when training multi-lingual\nsupervised models:\n\u27e82xx\u27e9 + source \u2192 encoder\n(1)\ntarget \u2192 decoder,\n(2)\nwhere the source sentence is pre\ufb01xed with a special\ntarget language token, \u27e82xx\u27e9, and is supplied to\nthe Encoder, while the target is supplied to the\nDecoder.\n3.2\nModel architecture\nCommonly used LLM architectures are Encoder-\nDecoder models, e.g. T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), and\nDecoder-only models, e.g. (Brown et al., 2020;\nChowdhery et al., 2022). Most supervised MTMs\nuse an Encoder-Decoder architecture. As our ex-\nperiments require pre-training from scratch and\nare therefore quite resource-demanding, we con-\nsider only one architecture, the Encoder-Decoder.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we use the mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) ar-\nchitecture at model sizes \u201clarge\u201d (1.2 billion) and\n\u201cxl\u201d (3.8 billion). We train the 1.2B models for\n250k steps and the 3.8B billion models for 500k\nsteps using the default settings from the T5X li-\nbrary (Roberts et al., 2022).

We\nemphasize that mT5 is only used for the architec-\nture, and we never use mT5 checkpoints or the data\nused to train mT5.\n3.3\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate our models with in-context learning\nusing the one-shot setting, see the Appendix for\nexplicit examples; concretely, each test input is pre-\n\ufb01xed with one example displaying the desired input\nto target behavior; the sequence thus obtained is\nsupplied to the Encoder and the target is generated\nby the Decoder.\nWe consider three tasks: Question Answering,\nMachine Translation and Summarization.\nFor\nQuestion Answering we consider two settings:\nclosed generation, where the context, the ques-\ntion and the answer are in the same language,\nand open generation where the context is in one\nlanguage and the question and the answer are in\nanother one.\nFor the closed generation setting\nwe use TyDiQA (Clark et al., 2020).\nFor the\nopen generation setting we take the non-English\nsplits of TyDiQA and translate the context to En-\nglish using the Google Translate API (translate.\ngoogle.com accessed in November 2022.); we de-\nnote the dataset thus obtained as XTyDiQA. For\nMachine Translation we use Flores (Guzm\u00e1n et al.,\n2019) and for Summarization we employ Wikilin-\ngua (Ladhak et al., 2020), with the splits and pre-\nprocessing from the GEM (Gehrmann et al., 2022)\nbenchmark.\n4\nLearning to schedule the two tasks\nA grid search on \u03bb is unfeasible. As we have two\ntasks, Language Modeling and Machine Transla-\ntion, we might treat the proportion \u03bb of the MT\ntask as a hyper-parameter to tune. Given that pre-\ntraining is very resource intensive, a grid search\non \u03bb is unfeasible. Even in the less compute in-\ntensive setting considered by (Kale et al., 2021),\nwhich is a continued pre-training of mT5 check-\npoints, they were able to compare just two values of\n\u03bb. It is therefore highly desirable to learn \u03bb during\ntraining, with the additional bene\ufb01t that a policy\nchanging \u03bb over time might outperform one that\nholds it constant.\nAutomated curriculum learning is a natural\napproach. When training a model on data from\nmultiple sources, the automated curriculum learn-\ning paradigm (Graves et al., 2017) can learn the\ndata-sampling schedule while training. In this way\nwe can learn a dynamic lambda, \u03bbt, which is a func-\ntion of the time step t; concretely, \u03bbt represents the\nprobability of sampling the MT task and 1 \u2212 \u03bbt is\nthe probability of sampling the LM task. Recent\nwork (Kreutzer et al., 2021) has shown promising\nresults when applying this curriculum approach to\nMachine Translation Systems where the data comes\nfrom multiple domains or multiple languages. For\nexample, (Kreutzer et al., 2021) demonstrates that\nthe multi-armed bandits employed by automated\ncurriculum learning perform competitively against\nseveral SOTA heuristics on multi-lingual bench-\nmarks.\nWe need to \ufb01nd the right reward function. In\norder to learn the dynamic scheduling of the MT\nand LM tasks, we need to assign a reward for us-\ning a speci\ufb01c task. Suppose that we sample a task\n\u03c4 \u2208 {MT, LM}; we then obtain a corresponding\nbatch B\u03c4 and perform gradient descent updating\nthe model parameters from \u0398 to \u0398\u2032. The speci\ufb01c\nchoice of \u03c4 has therefore resulted in a parame-\nter change, and we need to measure how useful\nit was. After bench-marking different utility func-\ntions, Kreutzer et al. (2021) recommends to mea-\nsure the loss reduction L(\u0398) \u2212 L(\u0398\u2032) on a trusted\nvalidation set. However, while in the setup of\nKreutzer et al. (2021) there is a clear choice of the\nvalidation set, we are interested in pre-training of\nan LLM that is then applied to down-stream tasks\nusing the in-context learning paradigm. Therefore,\nit is not trivial to build a validation set representa-\ntive of all the possible few-shot tasks. In particular,\nmitigation strategies would be needed to avoid over-\n\ufb01tting to a speci\ufb01c selection of tasks.\nWe use an intrinsic reward function. In early\nexperiments we contrasted the rewards assigned\nby each downstream task (e.g. Question Answer-\ning) with those assigned by the training tasks and\nfound that the signal from the former was smaller\nin magnitude and had a bigger variance. We there-\nfore propose to measure rewards intrinsically on\nthe (pre)-training data itself. Formally, after tak-\ning a gradient step on B\u03c4, we sample with equal\nprobability a reward task \u03c1 \u2208 {MT, LM} and ob-\ntain a new batch B\u03c1 on which we measure the loss\nreduction. We assign equal probability to each re-\nward task as we do not want to \ufb01x a preference of\none task over the other. One clear bene\ufb01t of using\nan intrinsic reward function is that it is no longer\nnecessary to construct a validation dataset. While\nthe usage of the training tasks themselves has been\nconsidered in (Graves et al., 2017; Kreutzer et al.,\n2021), they measure rewards on the same batch B\u03c4\nused for taking a gradient step, while we sample an\nindependent batch B\u03c1, possibly from another task.\nAs \u03c1 is sampled with 50% probability to be equal\nto \u03c4 and with 50% probability to be equal to the\nother task, we measure both task-speci\ufb01c learning\nand cross-task transfer.\nThe loss reduction needs to be rescaled. Note\nthat the loss scales for LM and MT can be different\nduring training, and so the absolute loss decrease\nL(\u0398) \u2212 L(\u0398\u2032) is affected by the task used to com-\npute L. Indeed, in Machine Translation all infor-\nmation content is given in the source sequence and\ntherefore the perplexity of a translation task is gen-\nerally lower than that of a language modeling task.\nWe solve this problem by computing the reward as\nthe relative loss reduction\nreward = 1 \u2212 L(\u0398\u2032, B\u03c1)\nL(\u0398, B\u03c1) ,\n(3)\nwhich was called \u201cpgnorm\u201d in (Kreutzer et al.,\n2021).\nClassical bandit algorithms tend to sample\nfrom a single task. The policy from sampling\nfrom the two tasks is then learned using multi-\narmed bandits (Lattimore and Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020).\nWe initially experimented with EXP3 as in (Graves\net al., 2017; Kreutzer et al., 2021). We discovered,\nhowever, that the LM task always produces slightly\ngreater reward than the MT task. As EXP3 is de-\nsigned to pick the best single arm in hindsight, it\nModel size (B)\nData Selection\nTyDiQA En\nTyDiQA Non-En\nTyDiQA\nXTyDiQA\n1.2\nLM (100%)\n40.23\n23.76\n25.59\n10.40\n1.2\nLM (90%) \u2013 MT (10%)\n39.77\n25.03\n26.67\n11.07\n1.2\nLM (50%) \u2013 MT (50%)\n41.59\n29.42\n30.78\n13.75\n1.2\nWARMUP\n39.31\n23.66\n25.40\n12.71\n1.2\nEXP3\n42.50\n30.00\n31.39\n16.54\n1.2\nFAIR\n41.14\n31.08\n32.19\n18.85\n3.8\nLM (100%)\n47.72\n32.97\n34.61\n13.96\n3.8\nEXP3\n50.23\n42.54\n43.39\n25.82\n3.8\nFAIR\n47.50\n36.65\n37.85\n26.16\nTable 3: Performance on TyDiQA and XTyDiQA, measured with EM.

To create an intermediate behavior\nbetween \u03bb = 0.5, which samples the MT objective\nmore aggressively, and \u03bb = 0.1, which samples\nit more conservatively, we consider a WARMUP\nheuristic that uses \u03bb = 0.4 for the \ufb01rst 20k steps\nand then defaults to \u03bb = 0.1. The value \u03bb = 0.4\nwas chosen by inspecting the rewards of each task\nat the beginning of training.\nAt model size 1.2B we found that adding paral-\nlel data improves performance across the evaluated\ntasks; however, the automated curriculum learn-\ning strategies outperform the other baselines; thus,\ngiven the limited experimental budget, at model\nsize 3.8B we just consider the LM (100%) as a\nbaseline.\n5.2\nQuestion Answering\nOur results for Question Answering are in Ta-\nble 3. For TyDiQA we see that adding parallel data\ncan signi\ufb01cantly improve performance on the non-\nEnglish part and does not degrade the performance\non English. On XTyDiQA, we observe that adding\nparallel data can make a signi\ufb01cant difference with\nup to +8 EM points at model size 1.2 billion and\n+12 EM points at 3.8 billion parameters. Therefore,\nwe see that including cross-lingual supervision dur-\ning pre-training improves the open generation abil-\nities of the resulting pre-trained models for the\nQuestion Answering task. We also see that our\nautomated curriculum (either EXP3 or FAIR) out-\nperforms all the other data-sampling strategies at\nmodel size 1.2B, and therefore we just experiment\nwith EXP3 and FAIR at the larger model size 3.8B.\n5.3\nSummarization\nTable 4 shows the key outcomes for the summa-\nrization task on Wikilingua. We contrasted auto-\nmated curriculum-based techniques to manual mix-\ning methods. Compared to Question Answering,\nsummarization results sway, albeit not signi\ufb01cantly,\ntowards larger models where automated curriculum\nmethods outperform the vanilla LM only method\nand our proposed FAIR method outperforms the\nothers. Interestingly, we did not observe any gains\nwhen scaling from 1.2 billion to 3.8 billion param-\neters for LM (100%), where the automated curricu-\nlum methods bene\ufb01ts from scaling model size more\nthan the than vanilla LM only method.\nModel size (B)\nData Selection\nEn\nNon-En\nAll\n1.2\nLM (100%)\n16.11\n12.37\n12.71\n1.2\nLM (90%) \u2013 MT (10%)\n15.99\n12.64\n12.94\n1.2\nLM (50%) \u2013 MT (50%)\n14.92\n11.76\n12.04\n1.2\nWARMUP\n15.21\n11.82\n12.13\n1.2\nEXP3\n15.80\n12.25\n12.57\n1.2\nFAIR\n14.45\n11.55\n11.82\n3.8\nLM (100%)\n16.2\n12.32\n12.67\n3.8\nEXP3\n17.08\n13.38\n13.72\n3.8\nFAIR\n18.15\n14.15\n14.51\nTable 4: Summarization performance evaluated with RougeL on Wikilingua.

Adding parallel data greatly improves\ntranslation results (evaluated with in-context learning), with the FAIR bandit being the best data selection strategy.\n5.4\nMachine Translation\nCurriculum learning boosts performance. For\nMachine Translation (Table 5), we partition our\nanalysis into four settings, into- and out-of-English\ntranslation (X\u2192En, En\u2192X), and high and low re-\nsource translation. We observe that the gains of us-\ning an automated curriculum method can be quite\nsubstantial, with signi\ufb01cant gains, e.g. +10 BLEU\npoints, over the LM (50%) \u2013 MT (50%) sampling\nin the En \u2192 Low setting. Compared to other meth-\nods, our proposed FAIR algorithm also boosts the\ngeneration quality further. Note that, given our\nconstrained experimental budget we thus only con-\nsidered automated curriculum strategies at model\nsize 3.8B.\nTranslating with control tokens. Recall that\nparallel data was used in a supervised fashion with\nthe MT objective. For each language, a special con-\ntrol token was pre\ufb01xed to the source sentence (1).\nSuch language control tokens do not appear in the\nLM training data; therefore a natural question is\nwhether supplying data to the pre-trained model in\nthe form (1) results in translations to the desired\nlanguage. This is indeed the case: at inference time\nthe pre-trained LM performs the supervised task\ncorresponding to each language control token.\nBetter translations are generated with in-\ncontext learning than by using control tokens.\nA natural question is whether the resulting models\nproduce better translations with in-context learning\nor by using control tokens. In Table 6 we compare\nthe \u201cTranslation Mode\u201d with control tokens (C) to\nthe one with in-context learning. For in-context\nlearning we use the one-shot setup (O), see the Ap-\npendix for examples of how the task is formulated.\nWe clearly see that the one-shot setup outperforms\nthe one with control tokens, except in the En \u2192\nLow setting, in which the second is to be preferred.\nComparison to MTM and LLM baselines.\nWe compare our results to those reported in (Lin\net al., 2021), using their same spBLEU implementa-\ntion to make the comparison fair. The \ufb01rst baseline,\nM2M (Fan et al., 2021) is an MTM trained with\ncross-lingual supervision. The other two baselines,\nXGLM (Lin et al., 2021) and GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) consist of LLMs which are trained on a self-\nsupervised objective without any extra crosslingual\nsupervision, and translations are obtained using\nin-context learning in the few-shot setup.\nWe do a comparison (Table 7) considering those\nlanguage pairs for which we also had parallel data.\nA clear advantage of our models is that we can al-\nModel\nsize\n(B)\nData Selection\nTranslation\nMode\nEn \u2192 High\nHigh \u2192 En\nEn \u2192 Low\nLow \u2192 En\n1.2\nLM (100%)\nO\n8.96\n15.76\n0.65\n3.01\n1.2\nLM (90%) \u2013 MT (10%)\nC\n6.66\n9.62\n2.54\n4.12\n1.2\nLM (90%) \u2013 MT (10%)\nO\n12.00\n20.80\n2.00\n5.99\n1.2\nLM (50%) \u2013 MT (50%)\nC\n14.68\n14.98\n15.09\n10.31\n1.2\nLM (50%) \u2013 MT (50%)\nO\n17.74\n27.14\n5.22\n13.94\n1.2\nEXP3\nC\n15.23\n15.76\n13.00\n9.52\n1.2\nEXP3\nO\n16.05\n26.20\n4.63\n18.07\n1.2\nFAIR\nC\n22.44\n19.81\n34.18\n16.84\n1.2\nFAIR\nO\n23.19\n31.81\n15.38\n26.73\n3.8\nLM (100%)\nO\n12.43\n21.02\n1.08\n5.08\n3.8\nEXP3\nC\n19.89\n21.50\n34.01\n18.63\n3.8\nEXP3\nO\n26.63\n34.88\n23.63\n31.53\n3.8\nFAIR\nC\n21.13\n15.95\n32.82\n16.20\n3.8\nFAIR\nO\n30.48\n36.63\n27.53\n36.05\nTable 6: Comparison of Translation with control tokens (C) vs the one-shot setup (O) on MT tasks (Flores) mea-\nsured with sacreBLEU. The one-shot setup yields better results except in the En \u2192 Low setting in which using\ncontrol tokens is better.\nways take the best score between translations gen-\nerated with control tokens and in-context learning\n(one-shot): except for En\u2192Fi, we outperform all\nthe other models both at 1.2B and 3.8B parameters\nscale.\nWe also looked at those language pairs reported\nin (Lin et al., 2021) for which we did not have par-\nallel data. For the languages My and Ta our LM\ndataset had very little data and our models are un-\nable to translate. For Ca, Bg and Hi we found that\nour systems do generate translations; when the tar-\nget language is English, performance can be quite\ngood as we outperform the other systems on the\ndirections Bg\u2192En, Hi\u2192En and Zh\u2192En. Details\nof this evaluation are reported in the Appendix.\n5.5\nAre the gains due to using more\nmultilingual data?\nGiven that about 77% of the data from (Chowdhery\net al., 2022) is in English, a natural conjecture is\nthat adding parallel data is bene\ufb01cial because it in-\ncreases the non-English fraction of the data. To test\nthis hypothesis we construct a new data-set by tak-\ning the non-English side of the MT data and apply-\ning to it the LM objective. We still use automated\ncurriculum learning to balance the two fractions\nof the LM data. In Table 8 we compare the two\napproaches and observe a signi\ufb01cant performance\ndrop on both Question Answering and Machine\nTranslation when using the MT data with the LM\nobjective. We conjecture that our MT data might\nbe less useful at modeling language compared to\nthe more rich kind of data from (Chowdhery et al.,\n2022).\n6\nConclusions\nWe have demonstrated that, when pre-training\nEncoder-Decoder large language models, the in-\nclusion of cross-lingual supervision in the train-\ning objective is bene\ufb01cial. In particular, we have\nfound substantial gains when evaluating the result-\ning models on Machine Translation and Question\nAnswering. One drawback of including parallel\ndata is the introduction of a new hyper-parameter\nwhich quanti\ufb01es the percentange of such data to\nuse. Even though inclusion of some cross-lingual\nsupervision is bene\ufb01cial, determining the optimal\namount by a grid search is unfeasible; however, we\nhave demonstrated that one can get good results\nby employing automated curriculum learning with\nmulti-armed bandits (Graves et al., 2017). More-\nover, in our proposed approach the learned percent-\nage can adjust during training and outperform the\nstatic data sampling baselines of (Kale et al., 2021).\n7\nLimitations\nBecause of computing limitations, we investigated\nonly Encoder-Decoder models.\nFurther experi-\nments are needed to extend the \ufb01ndings to Decoder-\nonly models.

We use T5X and Se-\nqIO; the input sequences use packing with slightly\nover 500k non-padding tokens for each batch. The\nlearning rate uses square-root decay, with a base\nlearning rate of 1.0 and 10k warm-up steps. We use\nthe default Adafactor optimizer of the T5X library.\nB\nTechnical details for using Automated\nCurriculum Learning\nHere we report a couple of crucial technical details\nfor correctly using Curriculum Learning.\n(Graves et al., 2017; Kreutzer et al., 2021) use\nrescaled rewards:\n1. Keep a priority queue of the last T rewards.\nWhile the queue is not x% full, return 0 as a\nrescaled reward (so the bandit algorithm is not\nlearning).\n2. When the queue is x% full compute the 20-th\nand 80-th quantiles.\n3. When a new reward r comes is, clip it to lie\nbetween the current 20-th and 80-th quantiles\nto obtain r\u2032; then linearly rescale r\u2032 to r\u2032\u2032 \u2208\n[\u22121, 1] where \u22121 corresponds to the 20-th\nquantile and +1 to the 80-th quantiles.\n4. Supply r\u2032\u2032 to the bandit algorithm.\n5. Enqueue r and recompute the 20-th and 80-th\nquantiles.\nTherefore, (Graves et al., 2017; Kreutzer et al.,\n2021) use effective rewards in [\u22121, 1]; however\nthe proofs of convergence for EXP3 in (Auer et al.,\n2002; Lattimore and Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020) do not work\nwith negative rewards. Also FAIR can produce\nnegative probability weights if rewards are negative.\nWe therefore rescale rewards so that r\u2032\u2032 \u2208 [0, 1] and\n0 corresponds to the 20-th quantile of the queue.\nWe use a queue of length T = 5000 and x = 10%.\nNote also that (Graves et al., 2017) claims to\nuse EXP3S; however, with their choice of param-\neters it always defaults to EXP3. We therefore do\nnot mention EXP3S in this work as it might be\nconfusing.\nC\nHyper-parameters for Curriculum\nLearning\nFor EXP3 we set the learning rate to 10\u22123 and the\nexploration rate to 25%.\nFor FAIR the exploration rate is set to 10% and\n\u00b5 is set to 10\u22122. Note that \u00b5 operates on updating\nthe moving average, so our choice corresponds to\na time horizon of 100 steps.\nD\nOne-shot task format\nOur models are evaluated with in-context learning,\nusing the one-shot paradigm. Here are examples of\nthe formulation for the different tasks.\nFor Question Answering the input is of the form:\n\u201cContext: The European jackal ...\\n\\n Q: How\nmany jackals ... ?\\n A: 70,000\\n\\n Context: The\n\ufb01rst known specimens of ... \\n\\n Q: When was the\n... ? \\n A:\u201d. The bold part is the single example\nsupplied to use the in-context learning paradigm\n(here it\u2019s one-shot).\nFor Machine Translation the input is of the form:\n\u201cGerman: Am 28. Juni wurde Marshall Italo\nBalbo, ...\\n English: On June 28, Marshal Italo\nBalbo, ...\\n \\n German: Dr. Ehud Ur, Professor\nf\u00fcr Medizin ... \\n \\n English:\u201d. The bold part is\nthe single example supplied to use the in-context\nlearning paradigm (here it\u2019s one-shot).\nFor Summarization the input is of the from: \u201cI\nwill \ufb01rst show a set of step-by-step instructions and\nthen write a short summary of every step in the\nsame language of the instructions. \\n \\n Summa-\nrize the following instructions: Loneliness can\ntake ... \\n Summary: Identify your type of lone-\nliness. Realize that loneliness is a feeling. Con-\nsider your personality. Recognize that you are\nnot alone in feeling lonely. \\n \\n Summarize the\nfollowing instructions: Usually, rainbows are ... \\n\nSummary:\u201d. The bold part is the single example\nsupplied to use the in-context learning paradigm\n(here it\u2019s one-shot). The part in italics is a prompt\nused by the GEM benchmark.\nE\nTranslating with Control Tokens\nOur models translate sentences to the desired lan-\nguages when the special language tokens are pre-\n\ufb01xed to the inputs. In this case the inputs have the\nfollowing form: \u201c<2en> Dr. Ehud Ur, Professor\nf\u00fcr Medizin ...\u201d, where \u201c<2en>\u201d denotes the task\nof translating to English.\nF\nComparison to MTM and LLM\nbaselines for languages without\nparallel data\nWe report the comparison to MTM and LLM base-\nlines for those languages for which we did not have\nFigure 1: Measuring transfer as the reward on task Y\nresulting from a gradient step on task X (X to Y in the\nlegend). At the beginning of training the rewards of\nMT to itself is lower and increases over time. There is\nalways a substantial transfer from MT to LM. We use a\nrunning average with window 500 to reduce variance.\nparallel data during training in Table 9.\nNote that our systems cannot be evaluated with\nlanguage control tokens when the target language\nwas absent from the parallel data supplied at train-\ning time; therefore we evaluate in the one-shot\nsetup. Our systems struggle with the languages My\nand Ta which were extremely unrepresented in the\nLM data. For other languages, we have indication\nthat the model is able to translate. Moreover, perfor-\nmance on translation to English can be quite good,\ne.g. outperforming the other systems especially on\nthe pairs Bg\u2192En, Hi\u2192En and Zh\u2192En.\nNote also that the model trained with FAIR out-\nperforms the model trained with LM data only.\nTherefore, parallel data has improved translations\nalso to language pairs that were not present in the\ncross-lingual supervised data.\nG\nVisualizing the rewards during\ntraining\nWe plot in Figure 1 the transfer between tasks, mea-\nsured in terms of rewards. Speci\ufb01cally, when we\ntook a gradient step on task X and evaluated the\nreward on task Y we get a measure of transfer from\nX to Y that can be plotted over time. Note that\nthere is always positive transfer from the MT to\nthe LM objective; however the LM objective has\non average higher rewards when applied to MT or\nLM. Interestingly, the transfer from MT to itself\nwas low at the beginning of training and increased\nover time.\nModel\nBg\u2192En\nCa\u2192En\nEn\u2192Bg\nEn\u2192Ca\nEn\u2192Hi\nEn\u2192My\nM2M-124 (0.6B)\n33.0\n33.4\n37.4\n31.2\n28.1\n3.5\nGPT-3 (6.7B)\n21.6\n40.2\n5.9\n23.8\n0.3\n0.1\nXGLM (7.5B)\n35.5\n41.1\n33.1\n34.0\n19.9\n11.0\nOurs (FAIR, 3.8B)\n36.9\n39.4\n16.8\n19.3\n8.0\n0.4\nOurs (100% LM, 3.8B)\n25.3\n29.7\n12.1\n14.9\n3.3\n0.4\nModel\nEn\u2192Ta\nEn\u2192Zh\nHi\u2192En\nMy\u2192En\nTa\u2192En\nZh\u2192En\nM2M-124 (0.6B)\n3.4\n19.3\n27.9\n10.0\n8.3\n20.9\nGPT-3 (6.7B)\n0.0\n12.5\n1.2\n0.5\n1\n21.1\nXGLM (7.5B)\n8.5\n15.6\n25.2\n14.1\n16.3\n20.7\nOurs (FAIR, 3.8B)\n0.4\n12.0\n28.6\n2.0\n6.4\n25.4\nOurs LM only (100% LM, 3.8B)\n0.4\n8.0\n11.6\n2.0\n3.4\n17.1\nTable 9: Comparison to MT baselines, for language pairs for which we did not include parallel data during training\n(Flores / spmBLEU).

Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools to cross-check\nand refine their initial content, like using a search engine for fact-checking, or a code\ninterpreter for debugging. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a framework\ncalled CRITIC that allows LLMs, which are essentially \u201cblack boxes\u201d to validate\nand progressively amend their own outputs in a manner similar to human interaction\nwith tools. More specifically, starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with\nappropriate tools to evaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output\nbased on the feedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive\nevaluations involving free-form question answering, mathematical program syn-\nthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances the\nperformance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importance\nof external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs1.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nThe remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has been amply\ndemonstrated across an array of language tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). Their\npotential to augment human intellect continues to burgeon (Saunders et al., 2022). However, these\nmodels are not without their shortcomings. They occasionally exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as\nhallucination (generating inaccurate or non-truthful responses), faulty code, or even toxic content\n(Maynez et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020). Such inconsistent behavior hampers\nthe trust in these models and poses hurdles to their real-world applications (OpenAI, 2023).\nTraditional approaches to mitigate these limitations typically employ additional training, involving be-\nhavior cloning, reinforcement learning, and self-training (Saunders et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020;\nJeon et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022b). However, these methods are constrained by the requirement of\nlarge-scale human annotation or data construction, which is often resource-intensive and challenging\nto obtain. To address these challenges, we present Self-Correcting with Tool-Interactive Critiquing\n(CRITIC), a unified framework that empowers black-box LLMs to verify and rectify their own\noutput through human-like interaction with external tools. Drawing inspiration from human cognition\n(Greenfield, 1991; Vaesen, 2012) and critical thinking (Marcus, 1988; Ennis, 1991), CRITIC offers a\nversatile framework that supports precise, interpretable verification and correction of generated text.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, CRITIC interacts with external tools like search engines and code interpreters\nto verify the desired aspects of an initial output and subsequently amends the output based on\nthe critiques from the verification. This verify-then-correct process can be repeated to ensure\n\u2217Work done during an internship at Microsoft Research Asia.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\n1Code released at https://github.com/microsoft/ProphetNet/tree/master/CRITIC.\n1\narXiv:2305.11738v4  [cs.CL]  21 Feb 2024\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nExternal Tools\nText APIs\nWikipedia\nSearch Engine\nCode Interpreter\nCalculator\nInput\nOutput\nVerify\nCritiques\nCorrect\nCRITIC\nKnowledge Base\nBlack-box\nLLM\nFigure 1: The CRITIC framework consists of two steps: (1) verifying the output by interacting with\nexternal tools to generate critiques and (2) correcting the output based on the received critiques. We\ncan iterative such verify-then-correct process to enable continuous improvements.\nconstant output enhancement. Contrary to methods that rely on expensive annotations or task-specific\ntraining, CRITIC utilizes in-context learning with tool interaction to proficiently identify and rectify\nunsatisfactory behaviors using the LLM itself. This unique approach makes CRITIC both practical\nand accessible, requiring only access to text-to-text tool APIs and a few-shot demonstration.\nWe evaluate our approach on a range of LLMs, including ChatGPT, Text-Davinci-003, and open-\nsource LLaMA-2 variants (7B, 13B, and 70B), spanning three distinct tasks: free-form question\nanswering, mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction. Our findings demonstrate that\nCRITIC consistently surpasses prior techniques, obviating the need for supplementary data or\ntraining. For example, when applied to ChatGPT, CRITIC attains 7.7 F1 enhancements across three\nQA tasks, 7.0% absolute gains on three mathematical reasoning tasks, and a 79.2% reduction in\ntoxicity probability. Interestingly, our results underscore the unreliability of all tested LLMs, when it\ncomes to validating their own results. We observe that exclusive reliance on self-correction without\nexternal feedback may yield modest improvements or even deteriorate performance.\nOur primary contributions include: (1) Proposing the unified CRITIC framework by integrating\nvarious tools and diverse tasks, with a series of new prompts that enable frozen LLMs to verify\nand iteratively self-correct their output through interaction with external tools. (2) Conducting\ncomprehensive experiments across distinct tasks that demonstrate significant performance improve-\nments offered by CRITIC across different base LLMs. (3) Highlighting the inadequacy of LLMs in\nself-verification and self-correction, and emphasizing that feedback from external tool interaction is\ncrucial for consistent self-improvement of LLMs.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nTruthfulness Evaluation Untruthfulness (Evans et al., 2021) is a critical issue for LLMs because\nit may hallucinate incorrect output that is hard to distinguish (Lin et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2022),\nespecially when relying on parametric memory (Lewis et al., 2020). A great deal of previous works\ndesign methods to detect hallucinated output (Evans et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021) of language\nmodels for different downstream tasks (Ji et al., 2023), including abstractive summarization (Maynez\net al., 2020; Cao et al., 2022), dialogue generation (Shuster et al., 2021), and table-to-text generation\n(Parikh et al., 2020). Notably, these works mainly study task-specific fine-tuned models with a focus\non faithfulness, i.e., factual consistent with the provided source content (Filippova, 2020; Zhou et al.,\n2021). The truthfulness evaluation for open-ended text generation is less studied, especially for LLMs\nwhich may only be accessed via APIs. We fill this gap by letting the black-box LLMs interact with\nexternal tools to verify their own output. Our method is also inspired by fact-checking in journalism\n(Wang, 2017) that assesses whether a claim made by a human is true (Thorne et al., 2018).\nNatural Language Feedback The technique of using natural language (NL) feedback is adopted\nto improve various tasks (Rupprecht et al., 2018; Scheurer et al., 2022). There are two main forms\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nPrevious toxic text: \u2026 last year before hanging himself.\nThe text has 53% toxicity of threat.

If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas \nand Ann and Cate eat 75%, how many pizza pieces are left?\nProposed Answer: ```python\nnum_pieces_per_pizza, num_pizza = 4, 4\nnum_pieces = num_pieces_per_pizza * num_pizza\npieces_bill_and_dale = num_pieces * 0.5\npieces_ann_and_cate = num_pieces * 0.75\nanswer = num_pieces - pieces_bill_dale - pieces_ann_cate```\nExecution: No runtime error\nOutput: answer = -4.0\nWhat's the problem with the above code?\n1. Plausibility: The number of pizza pieces left uneaten should \nbe a positive integer, -4.0 < 0, so the answer is not reasonable. \n2. Correctness: Let's check the code:\n> # each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4 pieces.\n> num_pieces = num_pieces_per_pizza * num_pizza\nIt calculates the total number of pieces, that's correct.\n> pieces_bill_dale = num_pieces * 0.5\n> pieces_ann_cate = num_pieces * 0.75\nEach person only eats their own personal pan pizza, \n`num_pieces * 0.5` means 50% of the total pieces, this is wrong.\nHere's a better solution: ```python\npizza_pieces = 4  # each personal pizza cut into 4 pieces\nann_cate_pieces = 4 * 0.75 * 2 # Ann, Cate eats 75%\nbill_dale_pieces = 4 * 0.5 * 2 # Bill, Dale eats 50%\ntotal_eaten = ann_cate_pieces + bill_dale_pieces \nanswer = pizza_pieces * 4  - total_eaten # pieces left```\nQuestion: Who won the 2016 Russian national silver medal with \nanother Russian ice dancer born 29 April 1995?\nProposed Answer: The 2016 Russian national silver medal was \nwon by Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin. Alexandra \nStepanova was born 29 April 1995. Ivan Bukin was born 10 April \n1993. So the answer is: Ivan Bukin.\nWhat's the problem with the above answer?\n1. Plausibility: The question asks for a name, and the answer \n\"Ivan Bukin\" is a name. So it's plausible.\n2. Truthfulness: Let's search the proposed answer in google:\n> Search Query: The 2016 Russian national silver medal was \nwon by Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin.\n> Evidence: [Alexandra Stepanova - Wikipedia] Stepanova/Bukin\nwon silver at the 2012 Russian Junior Championships\u2026\nFrom the evidence, Stepanova/Bukin won silver at the 2012 \nRussian Junior Championships, not 2016. \nLet's search the question in wikipedia:\n> Search Query: Who won the 2016 Russian national silver \nmedal with another Russian ice dancer born 29 April 1995? site: \nwikipedia.org\n> Evidence: [Victoria Sinitsina - Wikipedia] Victoria Alexandrovna \nSinitsina is a Russian ice dancer .\nThe evidence suggests that Victoria Sinitsina is a Russian ice \ndancer born 29 April 1995.

If the generation process\ninvolves API calls, the API call results are concatenated following the model-generated query .\nof feedback: scalar signals (Dasgupta et al., 2019) are commonly used for reinforcement learning\n(Ziegler et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022) and generate-then-rank framework (Chen et al., 2023a; Li et al.,\n2022), while natural language feedback (Saunders et al., 2022) is commonly used for text editing\nusing prompted LLMs (Gao et al., 2022a; Shinn et al., 2023) or trained correctors (Bai et al., 2022b).\nSources of feedback include human demonstration (Saunders et al., 2022) and evaluation (Stiennon\net al., 2020), existing corpora such as wiki edits (Schick et al., 2022), automatically constructed\ndata (Bai et al., 2022b), external metrics (Welleck et al., 2023) or knowledge (Peng et al., 2023),\nand even the LLM itself (Saunders et al., 2022; Weng et al., 2022). Nevertheless, LLM\u2019s intrinsic\nself-feedback has limited and task-specific performance compared to human feedback (Saunders\net al., 2022) and LLMs struggle with verification on truthfulness (Kadavath et al., 2022; Kuhn et al.,\n2023) and reasoning correctness (Ye & Durrett, 2022; Huang et al., 2022; 2023). To address such\nissues, we focus on fully exploiting the emergent ability of LLMs for evaluation (Fu et al., 2023) by\nempowering them with external tools.\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nAlgorithm 1 CRITIC algorithm\nRequire: Input x, prompt \u2118, model M, external tools T = {T1, T2, ..., Tk}, number of iterations n\nEnsure: Corrected output \u02c6y from M\n1: Generate initial output \u02c6y0 \u223c PM(\u00b7|\u2118 \u2295 x)\n\u25b7 Initialization\n2: for i \u2190 0 to n \u2212 1 do\n3:\nVerify \u02c6yi through interaction with T to obtain critiques ci \u223c PM(\u00b7|\u2118 \u2295 x \u2295 \u02c6yi, T )\n\u25b7 Verification\n4:\nif ci indicates that yi is correct then\n\u25b7 Stopping Criteria\n5:\nreturn \u02c6yi\n6:\nend if\n7:\n\u02c6\nyi+1 \u223c PM(\u00b7|\u2118 \u2295 x \u2295 yi \u2295 ci)\n\u25b7 Correction\n8: end for\n9: return \u02c6yn\nTools Augmented Language Models Beyond relying entirely on memorization (Tirumala et al.,\n2022), interacting with tools enhances the fidelity and potency of LLMs (Parisi et al., 2022), enabling\nthem to fully leverage their inherent reasoning and compositionality capabilities (Yao et al., 2023).\nStudies show that we can augment generation with retrievers (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Guu et al.,\n2020) or search engines (Nakano et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2022; Press et al., 2022), enhance\nmath reasoning with a calculator (Andor et al., 2019; Cobbe et al., 2021), leverage an interpreter\nto execute the generated code (Gao et al., 2022b; Chen et al., 2022), use mathematical prover to\nprove mathematical theory (Jiang et al., 2023), or use multiple tools automatically (Schick et al.,\n2023). We can teach the LLMs to use tools by pre-training (Taylor et al., 2022), fine-tuning (Nakano\net al., 2021), or in-context learning (Paranjape et al., 2023). CRITIC avoids task-specific training\nand employs in-context learning, which is more simple and general.\n3\nCRITIC: CORRECTING WITH TOOL-INTERACTIVE CRITIQUING\nWe can get an overview of the CRITIC method through Figure 1. Given any input, LLMs first\ngenerate an initial output based on parametric knowledge, then interact with appropriate external\ntools (possibly multi-round) through text-to-text APIs to verify the output. The critiques generated by\nthe verification step are concatenated with the initial output, and serve as feedback to allow LLMs\nto correct the output. We can iterate the cycle of \u201cVerify \u21d2 Correct \u21d2 Verify\u201d to continuously\nimprove the output until a specific stopping condition is met. See Algorithm 1 for a summary of\nCRITIC method, and the following sections for details.\n3.1\nIN-CONTEXT LEARNING FOR LLMS\nCRITIC utilizes the emergent abilities of chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) and few-shot\nin-context learning (Brown et al., 2020; Min et al., 2022) of LLMs. Few-shot in-context learning\nis a powerful approach that exploits the capabilities of LLMs to solve a task given a small set of\ninput-output examples at test time (Liu et al., 2023a). The few-shot setting typically involves only a\nhandful of examples (k). To accomplish this task, the examples {(xi, yi)}k\ni=1 are combined into a\nprompt p, which concatenates the input and output pairs as follows: \u27e8x1 \u00b7 y1\u27e9\u27e8x2 \u00b7 y2\u27e9 . . . \u27e8xk \u00b7 yk\u27e9.\nDuring inference, a test instance xtest is added to the prompt, and the model is then tasked with\ncompleting the sequence to generate an output ytest.\n3.2\nINTERACTION WITH EXTERNAL TOOLS\nTo enable LLMs to use tools, we first construct various external tools such as search engines, code\ninterpreters, and various APIs into text-to-text functions, then interleave the LLMs generations with\ntool use in in-context demonstrations. As shown in Figure 2, the input for a search engine can be\na query generated by LLMs, which returns a parsed search result, whereas the input for a code\ninterpreter is a program, which returns execution information and the final execution result. This free\nformat allows for human-like verify-then-correct trajectories, facilitating the construction of prompts\nintuitively and concisely while having strong interpretability and trustworthiness (Yao et al., 2023).\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n3.3\nVERIFICATION WITH TOOL-INTERACTION\nGive model M and input x, the initial answer is generated with prompt \u2118 by \u02c6y0 \u223c PM(\u00b7|\u2118 \u2295 x),\nwhere \u2295 indicates concatenation. Given previous output \u02c6yi, LLMs interact with external tools to\ncriticize the \u02c6yi and produce critiques ci \u223c PM(\u00b7|\u2118 \u2295 x \u2295 \u02c6yi, T ). If the process involves API calls,\nwe directly concatenate the API call results with the model-generated query to construct the ci. The\ntask-specific critiques can be used to detail the attributes of the output we expect to evaluate, such as\ntruthfulness, feasibility, or safety. See \u00a7D.1 for detailed experiments using CRITIC for hallucination\ndetection. For different inputs, we can use task-dependent, heuristically selected, or automatically\nselected appropriate tools for verification. We can implement automatic tool selection with in-context\nlearning, allowing different tools for different input-output pairs. In our implementation, we pre-\nspecify tools for different tasks to facilitate evaluation and experimentation. For example, as shown\nin Figure 2, the tool used for the QA task is Google, enabling LLMs to verify the truthfulness of\noutput by analyzing and interacting with Google in an interleaved manner.\n3.4\nCORRECTION WITH CRITIQUES\nLLMs can generate an improved answer conditioned on input x, previous output \u02c6yi, and critiques\nci from verification:\n\u02c6\nyi+1 \u223c PM(\u00b7|\u2118 \u2295 x \u2295 yi \u2295 ci). Critiques play a crucial role in the correction\nprocess as they identify errors, offer actionable suggestions, or provide credible groundings through\ninteraction with external tools, thus guiding a new generation to avoid similar mistakes. Motivated\nby the human process of iterative drafts refinement, we can iterate the process of verify-then-correct\nuntil specific stopping criteria are met, such as satisfying critiques from verification, reaching the\nmaximum iterations n, or receiving environmental feedback. This method facilitates continuous\noutput improvement by systematically and sample-efficiently verifying and correcting errors resulting\nfrom interactions with the world.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\nWe examine CRITIC across diverse tasks: free-form question answering concentrates on truthful-\nness related to open-ended general factual knowledge (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Min et al., 2020;\nJoshi et al., 2017) and multi-hop reasoning (Yang et al., 2018); mathematical program synthesis\nemphasizes the correctness and executability of LLM-generated programs for mathematical rea-\nsoning; toxicity reduction concerns the safety of model generation in open-ended output spaces.\nWe implement our approach using two settings: CRITIC applies corrections to all samples, while\nCRITIC\u2217 employs an oracle setting, correcting only the inaccurate samples. Subsequent sections\nprovide comprehensive implementation details, baselines, and corresponding results for each task.\nLLMs We present experimental outcomes utilizing the text-davinci-003 version of Instruct-\nGPT trained with RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), and the gpt-3.5-turbo variant of ChatGPT,\nthe most advanced GPT3.5 model tailored for chat applications.2 To promote reproducibility, we\nalso disclose results employing open-source LLaMA-2 models, encompassing 7B, 13B, and 70B\nconfigurations. We deploy the same prompts for the various LLMs.\n4.1\nFREE-FORM QUESTION ANSWERING\nWe first consider free-form question answering that has rich applications in real life (Kwiatkowski\net al., 2019) and well-known concern towards truthfulness (Evans et al., 2021).\nImplementation\nTo improve generality, we avoid relying on task-specific retrievers (Santhanam et al., 2022; Khattab\net al., 2022) that may lead to higher performance and overfitting. Instead, we build a web search tool\n3 based on Google to search queries generated by LLMs, scrape the resulting top-1 web page, and\nextract a maximum of 400 characters by fuzzy-matching the snippet from Google4. The Maximum\n2API call results reported were procured between January and April 2023.\n3Our web tools released at https://github.com/ZubinGou/llm-agent-web-tools.\n4A potential concern arises from the temporal inconsistency of the Google API, which may result in unstable\nevaluations and hinder reproducibility. To address this, we employ a caching mechanism for web search. We\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 1: Results of free-form question answering.

Please refer to Appendix\nD.7 for the iteration effect plots\nof other models.\nnumber of interactions is set to 7. We use CoT (Wei et al., 2022) to produce an initial answer and\nthen correct up to n = 3 rounds, stopping early if the answer remains the same for two consecutive\ncorrections. We consider the plausibility and truthfulness during verification, as shown in the prompts\nprovided in Appendix F. We use greedy decoding for all results.\nDatasets and Metrics We experiment with three datasets: AmbigNQ (Min et al., 2020), an enhanced\nversion of Natural Question (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) that employs multi-reference annotations to\nresolve ambiguity, along with TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). Due\nto budget constraints, we randomly sampled 500 examples from the validation set of each dataset and\nreported the results in terms of EM and F1 scores.\nBaselines 1) Vanilla few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) provides a direct answer. 2) Chain-of-\nthought prompting (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) generates step-by-step rationales before the final answer.\n3) Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022a) generates a large number of samples with p = 0.5 and\nselects the best one based on voting, with 10 samples for OpenAI models and 20 for LLaMA-2. 4)\nReAct (Yao et al., 2023) is a retrieval-augmented method that intertwines reasoning and retrieved\nknowledge. We found their original setup and actions generalized poorly across models and data,\nso we reproduced their results using our search API, which resulted in better performance, see\nprompts in Appendix F. 5) In addition to applying CRITIC to the CoT result, ReAct\u2192CRITIC\napplies CRITIC on a retrieval-augmented initial result produced by ReAct. 6) CRITIC w/o Tool\nremoves the search API and uses the LLMs to generate evidence without changing the prompt of\nCRITIC. 7) We additionally include state-of-the-art supervised methods for each dataset.\nResults As seen in Table 1 and 8: 1) CRITIC dramatically improves over the model\u2019s initial CoT\nresults across all datasets, settings, and LLMs, requiring only three corrections, while outperforms\nstore all API queries, generated through greedy decoding for every model and evaluation sample, along with\ntheir corresponding search results. This approach ensures stability, fairness, and reproducibility in our results.\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 2: Mathematical program synthesis results.

Moreover, CRITIC surpasses ReAct\n\u2192 CRITIC in the majority of cases, showing CRITIC with CoT initialization benefits more from\ncombining intrinsic knowledge with external feedback. 4) Tool-interaction plays a critical role\nin CRITIC, as the model\u2019s own critiques contribute marginally to the improvement (-0.03 and\n+2.33 F1 with the two LLMs), and even fall short compared to the initial output. 5) CRITIC can\nfurther enhance performance in retrieval-based results. 6) We demonstrate that CRITIC can correct\nuntruthful facts, rectify faulty reasoning traces, and detect outdated knowledge in Appendix E.\n4.2\nMATHEMATICAL PROGRAM SYNTHESIS\nWe then demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in various mathematical program\nsynthesis tasks (Austin et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021). This task involves generating a program y\nthat, when executed, accurately solves a problem description x, requiring a complex integration of\nlanguage comprehension and multi-step problem-solving strategies.\nImplementation\nAs shown in Figure 2, we utilize the Python interpreter as a tool to get two\ntypes of feedback: error messages and execution results. We use the original error messages from\nthe interpreter, such as \u201cNameError(\"num_pizza is not defined\")\u201d or \u201cTime out\u201d, and\nrepresent them in natural language form as \u201cExecution: {error message}\u201d. For execution\nresults, we use the value of the variable \u201canswer\u201d after the execution is completed. We use\nprogram-of-thought (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022) to generate the initial program and then apply\na maximum of n = 4 corrections, stopping if the executed result remains unchanged for two\nconsecutive revisions. We use greedy decoding for initial results following previous works (Chen\net al., 2022), and sampling with p = 0.5 for correction to avoid loopping.\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 3: Results of toxicity reduction.\nMethods\nToxicity \u2193\nFlu.\u2193\nDiversity \u2191\nMax.\nProb.\nppl\ndist-2 dist-3\nLearning Methods\nGPT-2\n0.527\n0.520\n11.31\n0.85\n0.85\nPPLM (Dathathri et al., 2020)\n0.520\n0.518\n32.58\n0.86\n0.86\nGeDi (Krause et al., 2021)\n0.363\n0.217\n43.44\n0.84\n0.83\nDEXPERT (Liu et al., 2021)\n0.314\n0.128\n25.21\n0.84\n0.84\nDAPT (Gururangan et al., 2020)\n0.428\n0.360\n31.22\n0.84\n0.84\nPPO (Lu et al., 2022)\n0.218\n0.044\n14.27\n0.79\n0.82\nQuark (Lu et al., 2022)\n0.196\n0.035\n12.47\n0.80\n0.84\nSelf-Correct (Welleck et al., 2023)\n0.171\n0.026\n11.81\n0.80\n0.83\nText-Davinci-003\n0.344\n0.210\n13.97\n0.80\n0.79\n+CRITIC\n0.180\n0.045\n14.43\n0.81\n0.79\n+CRITIC w/o Tool\n0.353\n0.227\n15.16\n0.80\n0.78\nChatGPT\n0.325\n0.192\n14.54\n0.77\n0.76\n+CRITIC\n0.173\n0.040\n15.66\n0.78\n0.77\n+CRITIC w/o Tool\n0.339\n0.223\n17.33\n0.77\n0.76\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nAvg.

Following established metrics (Chen et al., 2022), we round the predicted numbers for\ncomparison with the ground truth and report the exact match score.\nBaselines\n1) Vanilla few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) provides a direct answer without\nprogramming. 2) Program-of-thought (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022) is a SoTA method that writes\nprograms to solve problems. 3) We perform \u201cCRITIC w/o Tool\u201d ablations by only removing\ninterpreter information. 4) Additionally, we include the results of PAL and Self-Refine on Codex\n(Chen et al., 2021) from Madaan et al. (2023) in Table 10: PAL is similar to PoT, while Self-Refine\nutilizes only LLM to refine the program and stops when it generates \u201cit is correct\u201d.\nResults\nAs shown in Table 2 and Table 9, 1) CRITIC sizable improves upon the PoT across both\nLLMs, using either correction strategy: always correcting (CRITIC), or only correcting incorrect\nprograms (CRITIC\u2217). 2) CRITIC performs better when paired with more powerful LLMs. 3)\nCRITIC possesses excellent scaling capabilities. The benefits derived from CRITIC are more\npronounced when paired with larger language models. For instance, the improvements observed\nin TabMWP from 7B, 13B, and 70B models are +4.7, +9.4, and +16.0, respectively. 3) Without\nexecution feedback from the interpreter, the ability of LLMs to correct programs becomes limited\nand unstable. This can result in surprising performance deterioration, such as the 1.8-point decrease\nobserved on text-davinci-003, and it further exacerbated with Self-Refine on Codex due to\nthe unreliable feedback from the LLMs regarding program correctness.\n4.3\nTOXICITY REDUCTION\nWe investigate the task of reducing toxicity (Gehman et al., 2020), which requires generating fluent\nand nonoffensive text continuations given a prompt x. This task is both crucial for safety and\nchallenging due to the misaligned training objectives of LLMs using web text (Gehman et al., 2020).\nImplementation\nWe use PERSPECTIVE API5 as a tool to obtain fine-grained toxicity information.\nThe API provides an overall toxicity score and scores for six fine-grained attributes such as insult,\nprofanity, and identity attack. We score each output with the API, select the attribute with the highest\nscore, and represent the critique as \u201cThe text has {score} toxicity of {attribute}\u201d,\nfor example, \u201cThe text has 39\\% toxicity of insult\u201d. We set the maximum iterations n\nto 4, and terminate the detoxification when the overall toxicity of an output falls below 10%. We use\nnucleus sampling with p = 0.9, the same as all the baselines (Welleck et al., 2023).\n5https://www.perspectiveapi.com/\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nDatasets and Metrics\nWe randomly sample 1k prompts from the non-toxic prompts of the RE-\nALTOXICITYPROMPTS (Gehman et al., 2020), which was designed to elicit toxic responses. We\nscore toxicity using PERSPECTIVE API along two dimensions: 1) the maximum toxicity across 25\ngenerations, and 2) the probability of toxicity exceeding 50% in at least one of those 25 generations,\nas done in previous research (Gehman et al., 2020). We use text-davinci-003 to calculate the\nperplexity of the continuation. We report dist-2 and dist-3 for distinct bigrams and trigrams.\nBaselines\nWe compare CRITIC with the base LLMs and previously reported learning methods\nfrom Welleck et al. (2023), including PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2020), GeDi (Krause et al., 2021),\nDEXPERT (Liu et al., 2021), PPO, Quark (Lu et al., 2022) and Self-Correct (Welleck et al., 2023).\nPPO and Quark are strong RL approaches using PERSPECTIVE API as a reward. Self-Correct\n(Welleck et al., 2023) constructs toxicity reduction pairs using PERSPECTIVE API and trains a\nseparate corrector to detoxify the output for multiple rounds. For the CRITIC w/o Tool, we use the\nLLMs instead of the API to score fine-grained toxicity of the text (refer to the prompt in Appendix F).\nNotably, we present the results of previous state-of-the-art approaches for toxicity reduction using\nGPT-2, as they require extensive training and are difficult to reproduce with LLMs.\nResults\nThe results in Table 3 demonstrate that 1) CRITIC substantially lowers the occurrence\nof toxic generations, while preserving fluency and diversity as the vanilla LLMs; 2) CRITIC shows\ntoxicity mitigation capabilities on par with supervised SoTA methods, while not requiring extra data\nor training; 3) Furthermore, our findings underscore the vital importance of external feedback in\ndetoxification, as the LLM alone faces challenges in effectively mitigating toxicity.\n4.4\nADDITIONAL ABLATIONS AND ANALYSIS\nIn addition to showing the critical role of tool use, the impact of different LLMs, and the reliability of\nverification in CRITIC, here we provide further analysis to explore our proposed methods. We also\npresent a error analysis and a qualitative analysis in Appendix D.2 and E, respectively.\nEffect of Iterative Correction\nWe examine the effect of iterative correction for all tasks using\ndifferent LLMs. The results of ChatGPT are depicted in Figures 3, 4, and 5, with more results\nprovided in Appendix D.7. Our observations are as follows: 1) Iterative correction generally leads\nto continuous improvement, with a notable surge when only modifying erroneous samples (oracle\nsetting). 2) The marginal benefits of multiple corrections diminish, and typically, 2-3 rounds of\ncorrections yield most of the benefits. 3) In the absence of reliable feedback, relying solely on the\nmodel itself for iterative improvement results in inferior and relatively inefficient returns.\nComparison with Rejection Sampling\nTo further investigate the role of critiques in answer gen-\neration, we compare CRITIC\u2217 with rejection sampling (Saunders et al., 2022) for QA tasks using\nbest-of-N (Stiennon et al., 2020). Specifically, we generate n new CoTs from scratch and select the an-\nswer with the highest metric scores, employing nucleus sampling with p = 0.5. Table 1 illustrates that\ngeneration conditioned on critiques outperforms rejection sampling by 4.5 and 3.3 in EM for the two\nLLMs, respectively. This highlights the ability of critiques to not only pinpoint errors but also provide\nactionable suggestions and credible groundings, guiding the new generation to avoid similar errors.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nWe propose CRITIC, a novel plug-and-play framework that empowers frozen LLMs to self-verify\nand self-correct by interacting with the external environment. Leveraging the intuition of critical\nthinking with external feedback, CRITIC enables LLMs to validate their knowledge and improve\ntheir answers through introspection without requiring further training. Experiments on diverse tasks\nand LLMs have consistently shown the effectiveness, generality, and interoperability of CRITIC.\nMoreover, we shed light on the unreliability of LLMs in self-verification, highlighting the potential of\nexternal tool interaction to solve this problem. We hope our findings will inspire further exploration\ninto the truthfulness of language models, ultimately leading to more trustworthy AI systems.\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nZhibin Gou and Yujiu Yang were supported by the National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (Grant No.\n61991451) and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program\n(JCYJ20220818101001004).\n10\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nREFERENCES\nDaniel Andor, Luheng He, Kenton Lee, and Emily Pitler.

Consider, for example, the domain of mathematical\nprogram synthesis, attaining correction twice would yield a time overhead about twice that of\nthe PoT baseline. Nevertheless, such overheads are not exclusive to our technique. Prevalent\nprompt methodologies, such as ReAct and Self-Consistency, similarly trade-off time for enhanced\nperformance. In particular, Self-Consistency typically entails acquiring dozens, or hundreds to\nthousands, of samples for majority voting. In practice, as shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5, we can\neffectively utilize CRITIC for a relatively small number of iterations (even just one), while still\nreaping significant benefits.\nPrompt\nEngineering\nWhile\nour\nexperiments\nhave\ndemonstrated\nthe\neffectiveness\nof\nCRITIC across LLMs and settings, our experiments rely on appropriate in-context demonstrations.\nCRITIC employs ReAct style prompts (Yao et al., 2023), which facilitate natural and straightforward\nprompt construction, bearing a comparable workload to ReAct or PoT (Chen et al., 2022), while\noffering a substantial performance improvement. However, it is important to note that different\nprompt constructions may impact the experimental results. Future work should also explore more\nefficient tool usage for LLMs without relying on manually crafted demonstrations, which usually\nhave a re-encoded long context window.\nMore Tasks and Settings\nAlthough we evaluate CRITIC on a range of important tasks using\ndifferent LLMs, the effectiveness of CRITIC on other tasks and LLMs remains uncertain, as the\nLLM may not always need or be able to leverage appropriate external feedback for different inputs.\nAdditionally, our experiments were limited to the textual modality, and it should be noted that explicit\nlanguage evaluation may not always be suitable for evaluating all model outputs (Christiano et al.,\n2021). To address these challenges, future work can extend CRITIC to more diverse scenarios,\nsuch as supporting translation or multilingual tasks by incorporating dictionaries, verifying complex\nmathematical solutions and proofs using WolframAlpha, providing feedback on model decisions\nthrough simulated virtual environments, and expanding to more modalities.\nB\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nWhile the primary objective of CRITIC is to enhance the performance and reduce misaligned\nbehaviors of LLMs, measures must be implemented to detect and mitigate any potential risks\nassociated with steering LLMs towards generating content with malicious intent. In this section, we\ndiscuss the ethical implications associated with our proposed framework, CRITIC , and provide an\noverview of potential measures to mitigate these concerns.\nTrustworthiness and Transparency\nThe main goal of CRITIC is to enhance the reliability of\nLLMs through self-verification and self-correction. Transparency in the verification and correction\nprocess is vital to foster trust in the model\u2019s outputs. Users need to understand how the model reaches\nits conclusions and be able to verify the corrections made by the system.\nBias and Fairness\nLLMs inherit biases from the data they are trained on, and the external tools\nutilized within CRITIC can introduce additional biases. It is essential to carefully evaluate and\nmitigate biases in both the model and the tools to ensure fairness. By identifying and addressing\nbiases, we can strive to create more equitable and unbiased language models.\nPrivacy and Security\nThe interaction of CRITIC with external tools through APIs raises concerns\nabout data privacy and security. Implementing robust security measures, such as data anonymization\nand secure communication protocols, is crucial to protect user information and prevent unauthorized\naccess. Safeguarding user privacy and ensuring the security of sensitive data should be a top priority.\n21\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nC\nDETAILED RELATED WORK\nC.1\nNL FEEDBACK & SELF-CORRECTION\nTable 4: Comparison with related works on NL feedback and self-correction.

Most of\nthem prompt or train language models to correct their initial results. In contrast, our study is the first\nto demonstrate that such a \"Self-Verification and Self-Correction\" can be remarkably unreliable across\ndiverse tasks and various LLMs. Specifically, modest improvements or even deteriorated performance\nare observed universally using self-correct without external feedback. Consequently, CRITIC\nemphasizes the importance of feedback from external interactions for the consistent self-improvement\nof LLMs.\nOn The Unreliability of Self-Correction\nCRITIC further delves into the core reason behind\nthe unreliability of self-verification from the perspective of uncertainty estimation, as shown in\nAppendix D.1. Essentially, our tested LLMs are incapable of accurately identifying \"what they know\"\nwithout relying on external tools, i.e., LLMs (mostly) don\u2019t know what they know (Kadavath et al.,\n2022). Therefore, without the aid of oracle verification (employed in many contemporary works such\nas Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), RCI (Kim et al., 2023), and Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023)),\nself-correction might surprisingly deteriorate performance for many tasks, even worsening the initial\nanswer (as demonstrated in Table 1, 2 under CRITIC w/o Tool, and in Table 10 under Self-Refine).\nLatest Works on Unreliable Self-Correct\nRecent follow-up studies have performed more experi-\nments and analyses on tasks like reasoning (Huang et al., 2023), graph coloring (Stechly et al., 2023),\nand planning (Valmeekam et al., 2023), utilizing GPT-4. These studies corroborate the findings\nregarding the unreliability of self-correction in LLMs and provide additional insights. And they\nfurther emphasize the need for external verification.\nC.2\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION FOR SELF-VERIFICATION\nA seemingly promising option for self-verification on truthfulness is to leverage estimated uncertainty\n(Nguyen & O\u2019Connor, 2015; Malinin & Gales, 2021) as a proxy, which provides a confidence score\nto reflect the likelihood of the predicted answer being correct (Fu et al., 2023). Early work on\nprobabilistic uncertainty estimation in NLP primarily focuses on classification (Guo et al., 2017;\nMinderer et al., 2021) and text regression (Glushkova et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b), and more\nrecent work can be divided into two main categories: intrinsic estimation, which uses language\n22\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nmodel probability (Si et al., 2023; Nori et al., 2023) and sampling (Kuhn et al., 2023; Manakul\net al., 2023), and post-hoc estimation, which generally involves parameter-tuning with additional data\n(Jiang et al., 2020; Kadavath et al., 2022). Some recent studies specifically aim to train (Lin et al.,\n2022a; Kadavath et al., 2022) or prompt (Kadavath et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023; Diao et al., 2023)\nmodels to express their epistemic uncertainty using natural language. However, high certainty does\nnot mean truthful (Ott et al., 2018; Xiao & Wang, 2021; Kadavath et al., 2022), these methods suffer\nfrom poor calibration of LLMs (Jiang et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), difficulty in evaluating free-form\ntext (Kuhn et al., 2023), and poor interpretability. In this work, we address these issues and improve\nthe reliability of expressed uncertainty (Lin et al., 2022a; Kadavath et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023) by\ninteracting with external tools like search engines, see \u00a7D.1.\nC.3\nDETAILS FOR UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION BASELINES\nHere we provide details of the uncertainty estimation baselines in Section D.1: LM Probs uses\nconditional language model probability given input x as confidence, calculated as ConfLM Probs =\n\u2212 log p(y|x) = \u2212 P\ni log p(yi|y<i), where y<i denotes previously generated tokens. Norm Entropy\n(Malinin & Gales, 2021) leverages geometric mean token probability, where we calculate confidence\nas the arithmetic mean negative log-probability, given by ConfNorm Entropy = \u2212 1\nN\nPN\ni log p(yi|y<i).\nMax Entropy (Manakul et al., 2023) uses minimum log-probability to capture the most uncertain\ntoken, calculated as ConfMax Entropy = \u2212 mini log p(yi|y<i). Self-Con (Si et al., 2023) utilizes self-\nconsistency (Wang et al., 2022a) to obtain confidence. Specifically, we sample n = 20 times using\nCoT with temperature p = 0.5 to get a set of different final answers A = {a1, a2, ..., an}, and\ncalculates confidence as the frequency of the greedy answer agreedy among the set: ConfSelf-Con =\n1\nn\nPn\ni=1 \u03b4(ai, agreedy), where \u03b4(ai, agreedy) is an indicator function that evaluates to 1 if ai is equal\nto agreedy, and 0 otherwise. Self-Eval (Kadavath et al., 2022) employs LLMs to assess the validity of\ntheir own answers by utilizing a prompt in the format of:\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The\nSimpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nPossible Answer: Let\u2019s think step by step. Matt Groening named the\ncharacter Milhouse after his childhood friend, Milhouse Van Houten.\nSo the answer is: Milhouse Van Houten.\nIs the possible answer:\n(A) True\n(B) False\nThe possible answer is:\nwhere we take the probability of generating the option \u2018(A)\u2019 as the confidence score. We found that\ndisplaying extra sampled answers to the model, as suggested by the authors, actually impairs the\nCoT evaluation performance. Therefore, we only provide the model with the greedy answer. We\nuse 10-shot prompts for each dataset, as the authors mentioned that zero-shot does not work well for\nSelf-Eval.\nC.4\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRITIC AND RLHF\nWhile both CRITIC and RLHF (Stiennon et al., 2020) target important objectives for LLMs, such as\nreducing hallucination and ensuring truthfulness, their approaches are distinct and can complement\none another.\nRLHF is a white-box alignment technique that heavily depends on human annotations to fine-tune\na model, aligning it with human intentions. However, RLHF is not a one-size-fits-all solution\nto alignment challenges. For instance, an RLHF model may not consistently provide up-to-date\nfactual information, generate error-free code, or adapt to a new external environment. In these\nsituations, verification and rectification during inference are essential for the trustworthiness of LLMs.\nNaturally, CRITIC enhances LLMs by allowing LLM self-verification and self-correction through\ntool interactions, making it applicable to black-box models.\nTherefore, directly comparing the performance of RLHF and CRITIC may be unproductive and\nmisleading. For a comparison of alignment techniques, we recommend an in-depth early study on\nalignment (Askell et al., 2021). Furthermore, CRITIC has the potential to inspire and enhance\nRLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b), making it an area worth further investigation.\n23\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 5: Self-verification (i.e., Hallucination detection) results.

The hypothesis is that language models\nstruggle to accurately discriminate and critique their own knowledge without external feedback,\ni.e., LLMs don\u2019t know what they know (Kadavath et al., 2022). We find such unstable generation-\ndiscrimination-critique gaps (Saunders et al., 2022) becomes particularly prominent in tasks that\nnecessitate external knowledge or intricate reasoning, such as QA, Commonsense Reasoning, and\nMath reasoning. Without the support of Oracle verification, a technique used in concurrent works\nlike Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) and RCI (Kim et al., 2023), self-correction through self-feedback\ncan deteriorate the performance in these tasks, and even lead to incorrect modifications of initial\nresponses.\nTo assess the reliability of self-verification using LLMs, as outlined in \u00a73.3, we use LLMs to generate\nconfidence scores for their own outputs and examine the discriminative capability of these scores. We\nevaluate with free-form QA because it\u2019s an important open-ended NLG problem with clear ground\ntruth, and hallucination detection for open-ended generation is also insufficiently studied, especially\nfor LLMs (Evans et al., 2021). See Appendix C for a detailed analysis of uncertainty estimation\nmethods.\nImplementation\nWe experiment with ChatGPT following the setup described in \u00a74.1, using CoT\nfor answer generation. During verification, we generate critiques on the proposed answer and ask the\nmodel if the answer is correct by appending the following prompt:\nIn summary, the proposed answer should be:\n(A) absolutely correct (B) probably correct (C) probably wrong (D)\nabsolutely wrong\nThe proposed answer should be:\nwhere we expect the LLM to output \u2018(A)\u2019, \u2018(B)\u2019, \u2018(C)\u2019 or \u2018(D)\u2019. We use the probabilities of tokens\nfrom LLMs and take their normalized weighted summation as the final confidence score, as suggested\nby (Liu et al., 2023b). Formally, for a given set of options S = {A, B, C, D}, where each option has\na weight wi and probability pi, then the confidence score is calculated as (P\ni\u2208S wipi)/P\ni\u2208S wi,\nwhere wi is set from 4 to 1.\nDatasets and Metrics\nWe use the same data and split as described in \u00a74.1. The EM scores in Table\n1 demonstrate a range of 30 to over 80 across the three datasets, enabling an effective assessment\nof the method\u2019s generalization ability across data with varying difficulty. We observed that fuzzy\nmatching is more consistent with human evaluation than exact matching for open-ended answers,\nand thus we deem answers with an F1 score exceeding 0.6 as correct. We use the discrimination\nmetric AUROC as a better measure of uncertainty for free-form generation than calibration metrics\nECE or Brier score (Kuhn et al., 2023; Si et al., 2023). We also report the verification accuracy of\nnon-intrinsic methods.\n24\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nBaselines\nWe compare our method with intrinsic estimation scores, including LM Porbs (entropy)\n(Si et al., 2023), length-normalized predictive entropy (Malinin & Gales, 2021), maximum predictive\nentropy (Manakul et al., 2023), and sampling-based method Self-Con (Si et al., 2023). We report\nSelf-Evalution (Kadavath et al., 2022) for expressed uncertainty (Lin et al., 2022a), which asks LLMs\nto directly express confidence in their answer. Details in Appendix C.3. We also compare a baseline\ncalled Only-True, which lacks discriminative capability and predicts all answers as correct.\nResults\nExperimental results in Table 5 reveal that LLMs struggle to distinguish the veracity of their\nown answers and cannot provide reliable confidence regarding \u201cwhat they know\u201d. For instance, the\nSelf-Eval approach achieves only slightly better than random guessing accuracy (54%) in verifying\nanswers on HotpotQA, and performs even worse than the Only-True baseline on TriviaQA, despite\nthe fact that Only-True has no discrimination ability. In contrast, our proposed CRITIC significantly\nimproves the model\u2019s ability to discern facts by incorporating tool interaction, outperforming all\nprevious estimation methods while exhibiting strong generality and interpretability.\nD.2\nDETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS\nD.2.1\nERROR ANALYSIS ON FREE-FORM QUESTION ANSWERING\nIn order to further understand the failure modes after using tools for feedback, we randomly selected\n100 cases from the HotpotQA task, and manually annotated and analyzed the error types for both the\ninitial CoT and CRITIC. The results are as follows:\nTable 6: Types and corresponding percentages of success and failure modes of CRITIC and CoT on\nHotpotQA, obtained by manually analyzing randomly selected samples.

Even after\nutilizing CRITIC, hallucinations persist due to the inability to find useful evidence via a search\nengine or misunderstanding the evidence. This is illustrated in Appendix E.\n(2) Most errors after applying CRITIC arise from reasoning mistakes, refusal to answer, and incorrect\ncorrections. The refusal to answer occurs when CRITIC can\u2019t find enough evidence to support a\nresponse, which we consider an expected behavior to maintain truthfulness.\n(3) In reality, CRITIC has effectively helped us identify a large number of label ambiguities, inaccu-\nracies, and outdated issues in the HotpotQA dataset (49% in CRITIC error samples). These false\nnegatives (FN) indicate a certain bias in the different methods of evaluating free-form QA using\nautomatic metrics like EM / F1. This has motivated subsequent research to adopt a more reliable\nLLM-based evaluation for QA tasks (Shao et al., 2023).\nD.2.2\nERROR ANALYSIS ON MATHEMATICAL PROGRAM SYNTHESIS\nOn Mathematical Program Synthesis tasks, to offer readers a more comprehensive understanding of\nthe specific corrections made by CRITIC and the specific benefits derived from tool feedback, we\n25\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\ncarried out a manual statistical analysis of the types of corrections made by CRITIC on the GSM8k\nfull test set (1319 samples).\nSpecifically, we identified four different categories of initial program errors: syntax errors, runtime\nerrors, unreasonable outputs (such as irrational negative values), and other intrinsic reasoning errors.\nWe calculated the accuracy of the initial PoT (Init), and CRITIC for each type of error. The settings\nfor corrections are consistent with the non-oracle setting in the original paper, with up to four rounds\nof correction. The statistics are presented in the following table:\nAs can be seen in the table 7:\nTable 7: Error Analysis on Mathematical Program Synthesis tasks.\nError Type\nInitial Answer\nCRITIC\nCount\nAcc\nCount\nAcc\nIntrinsic Error\n281 (77.4%)\n0.0\n206 (71.8%)\n26.7\nUnreasonable Output\n61 (16.8%)\n0.0\n26 (9.1%)\n57.4\nSyntax Error\n17 (4.7%)\n0.0\n11 (3.8%)\n35.3\nRuntime Error\n4 (1.1%)\n0.0\n3 (1.0%)\n25.0\nAll Initial Errors\n363\n0.0\n246 (85.7%)\n32.2\nWrong Correction\n-\n100.0\n41 (14.3%)\n95.7\n(1) The majority of error types in the initial PoT responses are intrinsic reasoning errors (77.4%),\nsuch as misunderstanding the question or omitting conditions. The initial responses also exhibit\na relatively high proportion (16.8%) of unreasonable output errors, while syntax and runtime\nerrors are less frequent but not absent (5.8%).\n(2) CRITIC has a high success rate in correcting unreasonable output and syntax errors (57.4%\nand 35.3% respectively). However, the correction rate for intrinsic errors, for which reliable\nfeedback cannot be obtained, is relatively low (26.7%). Overall, CRITIC reduces errors in the\ninitial erroneous samples by 32.2% in a non-oracle setting.\n(3) Notably, while CRITIC has corrected a substantial number of errors in the initial PoT, as can be\nseen from the last row of the table above, there is a decrease of -4.3% in the accuracy of CRITIC\non originally correct outputs. This results in the error modes after tool feedback also including\n14.3% wrong corrections.\nD.3\nDISCUSSION ON TOOL USE COSTS\nHere we discuss the cost of tool use for CRITIC, which is actually all free.\n(1) For QA tasks, as mentioned in Sec. 4.1, we build a Web Tool for CRITIC to crawl the\nresults of Google Search and web pages like Wikipedia. We also employ a caching mechanism\nfor web search, storing about 9GB of search results from January to April 2023 during our\nexperiments. This part of the code is separately open-sourced at https://anonymous.\n4open.science/r/llm-agent-web-tools. The results of the Search Engine in the\npaper are all obtained using this code. In addition, we will also open-source all caches after the\nanonymous review period ends, to ensure stability, fairness, and reproducibility in our results.\n(2) For Mathematical program synthesis tasks, we use a local code interpreter, which is free of\ncharge.\n(3) For toxicity reduction tasks, we adopt Pespective API at https://www.perspectiveapi.\ncom/ kindly provided by Google, which is also free.\nD.4\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH TOOL IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS\nThe significance of different tools varies under different scenarios and tasks. For instance, in tasks\nthat are heavily reliant on knowledge, such as commonsense question answering (e.g., AmbigNQ and\nTriviaQA) and multi-hop knowledge reasoning tasks like HotpotQA, web tools take the leading role.\n26\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nCRITIC primarily employs Wikipedia page browsing and Google snippets, as evidenced by numerous\ncase studies in Appendix E.1. For mathematical program synthesis tasks, external knowledge is\ntypically unnecessary, and a code interpreter can function equivalently to a calculator. Consequently,\nin these experiments, our external feedback is derived from error messages and execution results\nfrom the interpreter, as illustrated in the cases in Appendix E.2.\nD.5\nCOMPLETE LLAMA-2 RESULTS\nTable 8: LLaMA-2 Results of free-form question answering. \u2217indicates an oracle setting where we\nonly apply correction on the incorrect answers.

If an answer misunderstands the\nquestion, or repeat the question, or gives a None / I don\u2019t know /\nUnknown answer, then it\u2019s not plausible.\nQuestion: Which magazine was started first Arthur\u2019s Magazine or First for\nWomen?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. Arthur\u2019s Magazine was\nstarted in 1892. First for Women was started in 1994. So Arthur\u2019s\nMagazine was started first. So the answer is: Arthur\u2019s Magazine.\nProposed Answer: Arthur\u2019s Magazine\nIs the answer plausible? The question is to choose from \"Arthur\u2019s\nMagazine\" and \"First for Women\", and the answer is \"Arthur\u2019s Magazine\n\", which is among the choices. So it\u2019s plausible.\nQuestion: What property does Rotary technology and Nickel have in common?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. Rotary technology is a type\nof engine. Nickel is a chemical element. So Rotary technology and\nNickel do not have any property in common. So the answer is: None.\nProposed Answer: None\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for a property, and the answer\n\"None\" does not answer the question. So it\u2019s not plausible.\nQuestion: What is the name of the passenger train that is now part of the\nTexas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak, that ends\nin Los Angeles, California?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. The Texas Eagle is a 1,306-\nmile train route operated by Amtrak. It ends in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia. So the name of the passenger train that is now part of\nthe Texas Eagle is the Texas Eagle. So the answer is: Texas Eagle.\nProposed Answer: Texas Eagle\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for the name of the passenger\ntrain, and the answer is \"Texas Eagle\", which contradicts the \"that\nis now part of the Texas Eagle\" in the question. So it\u2019s not\nplausible.\nQuestion: The market town which houses the St Mary and St Nicolas church\nhas haw many people?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. The question is asking about\nthe population of a market town that houses a specific church. We\ndon\u2019t have any information about the population of the town, so we\n73\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\ncan\u2019t answer this question. So the answer is: We don\u2019t have enough\ninformation to answer this question.\nProposed Answer: We don\u2019t have enough information to answer this question\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for a number, and the answer \"\nWe don\u2019t have enough information to answer this question\" does not\nprovide an answer. So it\u2019s not plausible.\nQuestion: What was the name of the 1929 novel written by the author whose\nscenario inspired the one-act ballet \"Le Train Bleu\"?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. The author of the novel is\nColette. The novel is Ch\u00e9ri. So the answer is: Ch\u00e9ri.\nProposed Answer: Ch\u00e9ri\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for the name of the novel, and\nthe answer is \"Ch\u00e9ri\", which sounds like a novel. So it\u2019s plausible.\nQuestion: Serianna is a band of what genre that combines elements of\nheavy metal and hardcore punk?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. Serianna is a band of\nmetalcore genre. Metalcore is a subgenre of heavy metal and hardcore\npunk. So Serianna is a band of heavy metal and hardcore punk. So the\nanswer is: heavy metal and hardcore punk.\nProposed Answer: heavy metal and hardcore punk\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for the genre of a band, and\nthe answer is \"heavy metal and hardcore punk\", simply repeat and\ncontradict the question, since it\u2019s not reasonable that \"heavy metal\nand hardcore punk\" combines elements of itself. So it\u2019s not plausible.\nQuestion: Eric Estornel, better known by his stage names Maceo Plex and\nMaetrik, is an American DJ, producer and DJ Awards winner , he is\nbest known for diverse production style, influenced primarily by\nhouse and techno but also tech house, as well as a longtime performer\nfor many Ibiza-based clubs, including Space, was a Superclub on the\nisland of Ibiza, Spain from 1986 to 2016, owned by who?.\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. Eric Estornel, better known\nby his stage names Maceo Plex and Maetrik, is an American DJ,\nproducer and DJ Awards winner. He is best known for diverse\nproduction style, as well as a longtime performer for many Ibiza-\nbased clubs, including Space. The owner of Space is not mentioned in\nthe question. So the answer is: The owner of Space is not mentioned\nin the question.\nProposed Answer: The owner of Space is not mentioned in the question\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for the owner of Space, and\nthe answer \"The owner of Space is not mentioned in the question\" does\nnot answer the question. So it\u2019s not plausible.\nQuestion: Mondkopf born Paul R\u00e9gimbeau, in Toulouse, France, in what year,\nis an electronic music composer, Toulouse is the capital of the\nFrench department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie?\nProposed Answer: Let\u2019s think step by step. Mondkopf born Paul R\u00e9gimbeau\nin Toulouse, France. Toulouse is the capital of the French department\nof Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. So the answer is:\nMondkopf born Paul R\u00e9gimbeau in Toulouse, France.\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for \"in what year\", and the\nanswer is \"Mondkopf born Paul R\u00e9gimbeau in Toulouse, France\", which\nmisunderstands the question. So it\u2019s not plausible.\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern\nsector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step. The Colorado orogeny is a\nmountain-building event that occurred in the western United States.\nThe eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into the Great\nPlains. The Great Plains are a vast area of flat land that extends\nfrom the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River. The elevation\n74\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nrange for the Great Plains is from about 1,000 to 2,000 feet. So the\nanswer is: 1,000 to 2,000 feet.\nProposed Answer: 1,000 to 2,000 feet\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for the elevation range, and\nthe answer is \"1,000 to 2,000 feet\", which is a elevation range. So\nit\u2019s plausible.\nQuestion: Peston on Sunday is hosted by the reporter who got the scoop on\nwhich financial crisis in the late-2000s?\nProposed Answer: Let\u2019s think step by step. Peston on Sunday is hosted by\nRobert Peston. Robert Peston got the scoop on the financial crisis in\nthe late-2000s. So the answer is: the financial crisis in the late\n-2000s.\nIs the answer plausible? The question asks for \"which financial crisis\",\nand the answer is \"the financial crisis in the late-2000s\", which\njust repeat the question. So it\u2019s not plausible.\nListing 32: Prompts for CRITIC (truthfulness) on hallucination detection with HotpotQA.\nAnalyze the following questions and proposed answers, and search for\nsufficient evidence to prove whether the proposed answer are correct.\n- You should point out possible errors in the reasoning process, but\nultimately you should only determine whether the proposed answer is\ncorrect (it is possible for the answer to be correct when the\nreasoning process is incorrect).\nQuestion: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern\nsector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\nReasoning Process: Let\u2019s think step by step.

We present LinguisticLens, a novel inter-\nactive visualization tool for making sense of and analyzing syntactic\ndiversity of LLM-generated datasets.

This ability also\nlets them generate smaller, more refined datasets for finetuning [13,\n25,27], benchmarking [29], low-resource tasks or languages [4,15],\nand counterfactual testing (e.g., examples that are identical except\nfor having different religious or gender-based identities [12]).\nA critical challenge lies in making sense of these generated\ndatasets and evaluating their quality. Given that the desired tasks are\noften novel and have no existing dataset or ground truth by definition,\nautomatically evaluating the quality of these generated examples\nwith certain metrics is not straightforward. Although crowd workers\ncan evaluate the quality of individual examples, it is costly, and\nfinding patterns across large amounts of text examples remains a\nchallenge. Moreover, understanding the specific failure modes of\nLLMs is still an evolving area, and these undesirable generated out-\nput trends can be hard to spot. In particular, generated examples\noften overfit to the seed examples in unexpected ways. One such\npathology is syntactic overfitting, where generated examples are\ngrammatically similarly or identical to the seed data. This can be\ndifficult to find as a single overfit example is not a problem, but if\nlarger portions of the dataset has the same syntactic structure, it is\narXiv:2305.11364v2  [cs.CL]  27 Sep 2023\na significant issue for dataset diversity. The same is true for lexical\noverfitting, where specific words appear frequently in the generated\ndataset more often than is desired.\nIn this paper, we present LinguisticLens, a novel interactive visual-\nization tool for making sense of synthetically-generated text datasets.\nLinguisticLens specifically focuses on analyzing the syntactic and\nlexical diversity of datasets. It allows users to explore groups of\nexamples that are clustered based on their syntactic structure and lex-\nical overlap. Clusters can be based on other text similarity methods\ntoo, including embedding similarity, and we find that our approach\nis more effective for analyzing the diversity of synthetic datasets.\nLinguisticLens runs on web browsers and users simply need to\nprovide their datasets as CSV files. A live demo can be found at\nhttps://shorturl.at/zHOUV. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability.\n2\nBACKGROUND: SYNTHESIZING DATASETS USING LLMS\nThis section provides a brief background about how people generate\ndatasets using LLMs. Suppose we want to create a small dataset\nof music recommendations to fine tune a music recommendation\nmodel that returns a set of artists based on a short query provided\nby a user. An example datapoint might have a query, \u2018oldies but\ngoodies\u2019, and a label \u2018Aretha Franklin, The Beach Boys,\nStevie Wonder, The Supremes, Bill Withers.\u2019\nWithin the prompt, we can provide a few examples that the model\ncan use to generate similar datapoints. This is known as few-shot, or\nin-context, learning. For example, the prompt could be:\nQuery: {oldies but goodies}\nRecommended Artists: {Aretha Franklin, Madonna}\nQuery: {music that makes you want to dance}\nRecommended Artists: {Kraftwerk, The Cure, B-52s}\nQuery: {\nThe model will continue the text following this pattern (e.g., see\nbelow), and from this we can parse a new set of examples. With this\napproach, LLMs can create hundreds or thousands of these synthetic\nexamples. Our goal is to make sense of them.\nchill out music}\nRecommended Artists: {Bonobo, Massive Attack}\nQuery: {female vocalists}\nRecommended Artists: {Carole King, Joni Mitchell}\n3\nRELATED WORK\n3.1\nEvaluating Datasets Generated by LLMs\nEvaluating LLM-generated datasets is not a straightforward task.\nIn the best case, one can measure downstream performance of a\nmodel trained on that data [4, 25]. When this is impossible (e.g.,\nbenchmarks or a new task), the dataset quality must be evaluated\nwith defined metrics [13]. Automatic methods for evaluating LLM-\ngenerated datasets include measuring the similarity between the\noriginal distribution and generated distribution [25], but this is dif-\nficult for unstructured text, and presupposes that a golden corpus\nexists, which would obviate the need for synthetic data in the first\nplace. Yuan et al. [29] use human evaluation to determine the quality\nof individual examples. Lara et al. [19] measure diversity along\nannotated features, such as topics and sentiment. Other methods in-\nvolve visualization-based human-in-the-loop qualitative evaluation.\nIn the image domain, Assogba et al. [2] built a visualization tool\nwith embedding-based clusters for comparing the distributions of\ngenerated and ground truth images.\n3.2\nVisualizing Text Corpora\nThere is a large body of visualization research on making sense of\nlarge text corpora [11,23,28]. Clustering, including topic modelings,\nhas been a popular approach to organizing text datasets [7, 9, 18].\nVisualization is also a ubiquitous tool for machine learning inter-\npretability [8,16,30], including those for text data [21,24,26]. Reif\net al. [21] investigated how a pretrained BERT model internally\nrepresents syntactic information through a range of visualizations.\nHowever, visual analysis of text datasets synthesized from LLMs,\nespecially their syntactic structures, is underexplored [5,10].\n4\nDESIGN CHALLENGES\nWe spoke to several software engineers and researchers at Google\nwho are using LLMs to synthesize data about the challenges they\nhad evaluating and understanding it. These use cases included mu-\nsic queries, adversarial examples for fairness analysis benchmarks,\nmedical questions, and to-do lists (with no personally identifiable\ninformation), among others. Below we summarize our key findings.\nC1. Quick overview of datasets. Most of the practitioners we\nspoke to first wanted to get a quick overview of the full dataset.\nThis included understanding what basic examples look like,\nhow much these examples tended to differ from each other,\nand how much the examples matched the seed data.\nC2. Identifying groups of examples and seeing their distribu-\ntions. Practitioners also discussed trying to finding patterns,\nspecifically identifying groups of examples that share common\ncharacteristics, and seeing their distributions. For example, in\nthe case of to-do lists, there were patterns in how long each of\nthe list items were, and how many items there were overall.\nC3. Finding near duplicates. Examples are sometimes too sim-\nilar to each other: one of the most common challenges we\ndiscussed was finding near duplicates. For example, many mu-\nsic recommendation queries follow the form \u2018[BLANK] that\n[BLANK] like [BLANK]\u2019 (e.g., \u2018music that sounds like na-\nture\u2019). There are many almost identical examples where a\nsingle word is swapped out. These are difficult to spot, e.g.,\nwhen the words are mostly different, but the overall phrasing\nis identical across a set of examples, when manually scanning\na long unordered list of data points. People found this a partic-\nularly thorny problem to address. Exact duplicates are usually\nunequivocally bad and easy to find. However, what constituted\nan undesirable near duplicate was not only dependent on use\ncases, but also difficult to automatically detect.\nC4. Understanding dataset diversity. Practitioners also wanted\nto know whether or not the dataset was diverse. However, like\nnear duplication, the notion of diversity is hard to pin down\nand differs depending on the use case: for the to-do lists, it\nmeans having a broad range of words and topics in the lists;\nfor the music queries, it means having a range of different\nphrasings, and having outliers that were far from the norm\nbut still relevant; and for the medical questions dataset, it is\nimportant that the questions are phrased in different ways.\nThe overall consensus from the practitioners was that synthesiz-\ning data with LLMs was a novel task, without a robust evaluation\nmethod or sensemaking tools to support it. Existing tools, like topic\nmodeling, could support some of the challenges (especially C1 and\nC2), but focus on individual tokens, rather than longer sequences or\nother structural properties of the text. Thus, we decided to design a\nnew tool that addresses the challenges that we identified.\nFigure 2: Visualization of a single example in LinguisticLens. Words\nare colored by their parts of speech, with the dependency graph\nshown as arcs in gray.\nFigure 3: When a user hovers on a token, we highlight other tokens\nwith the same POS tag and dependency relationship.\n5\nVISUALIZATION DESIGN OF LINGUISTICLENS\nWe designed and developed LinguisticLens for exploring and evalu-\nating the linguistic diversity of synthesized text datasets. Linguisti-\ncLens specifically focuses on finding patterns and fuzzy duplicates\nacross a set of examples. The details of our design are as follows.\n5.1\nIntroducing LinguisticLens\nFig. 1 shows an interface of LinguisticLens, which uses Lit1, a\ndeclarative web framework, and D32 for visualizing each example\nas a graph structure. It consists of multiple columns (six in this\nfigure) each representing a cluster of examples. Each cluster lists\ntext examples vertically (e.g., about 12 examples in this figure).\nEach text example (e.g., query text for a music recommender) is\nrepresented as a sequence of tokens, shown as a colored rectangle.\nWe first describes how we visualize each example and then how we\ncluster and visualize them for exploration and analysis.\n5.2\nVisualizing Individual Examples\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, each example (e.g., a query) is visually\nrepresented as a sequence of tokens, where each token is colored\nbased on its part-of-speech (POS) tag. The dependencies among the\ntokens, extracted from the dependency parse graph is shown as arcs.\nLinguisticLens displays multiple examples in a vertical column\nand provides users with interactions to easily identify patterns across\nthe examples. See section Sect. 5.3 for how these are clustered\ninto columns. For instance, when a user hovers over a token in\nan example, LinguisticLens highlights the hovered token and the\ndependency link to that token, as well as tokens and links from other\nexamples with the same grammatical relationship (e.g., from NOUN to\nADP). Since these grammatical features are precalculated, it is trivial\nto filter in this way. Fig. 3 shows an example when hovering over\nthe token \u2018tool\u2019. This enables users to quickly discover repeated\nsubstructures of examples in the dataset.\n5.3\nVisualizing Clusters of Examples\nTo help users easily discover linguistic patterns (near duplicates (C3),\ndiversity (C4)) across groups of multiple examples (C2), we design\n1https://lit.dev/\n2https://d3js.org/\nFigure 4: LinguisticLens supports the collapsed mode for overview.\nBy adapting the idea of Table Lens, it displays a thumbprint of\nexamples, enabling a quick overview of their linguistic patterns and\nthe distributions across clusters.\nLinguisticLens to cluster examples by multiple different metrics\n(e.g., POS, embedding, and token) and allow users to choose one.\nThese fuzzy duplicate clusters are shown in columns, with some\nmetadata about each cluster (e.g., count, frequent pattern).\n5.3.1\nClustering with Syntax: Technical Details\nSyntactic Feature Extraction. To represent each example with\nits syntactic information, we extract a number of features. We first\nrepresent each example in one of the three ways: as a sequence\nof its individual tokens, as a sequence of the POS tags for those\ntokens, and as a sequence of grammatical dependencies for those\ntokens.3 We then populate their n-grams (n = 1,2,3) from one\nof these approaches. Then we define pair-wise similarity between\ntwo examples by computing the n-gram overlaps and dividing by\nthe number of tokens in longer text. While embedding examples\nusing pretrained models is a well-known approach to representing\nunstructured text datasets, the embedding encodes both semantic\nand syntactic information. Thus, it is less effective for revealing\nsyntactic and lexical diversity of generated datasets.\nHierarchical Clustering. We run an agglomerative clustering\nalgorithm based on the similarity metrics defined from the extracted\nfeatures. From a dendrogram tree returned by the algorithm, we\nform a list of flattened clusters for different numbers of clusters\n(k = 3,5,10,...,50). For each cluster, we maintain an ordered list\nof examples where its order follows the order of the leaves in the\ndendrogram tree, similar to the approach used in DendroMap [3].\nThis places similar examples next to each other, which can enable\nusers to easily identify groups of similar examples, especially near-\nduplicates, when they are visualized.\n5.3.2\nOverview by Adapting Table Lens\nLinguisticLens consists of multiple columns each representing one\nof the clusters. An important challenge in visualizing text datasets is\nthat we cannot concurrently display many examples in screen, and\nit would visually overwhelming even if we could. To effectively\nprovide an overview of large number of examples (C1), we adapt\n3We used the spaCy library [17] to extract POS and dependency.\nFigure 5: Each cluster is summarized with a frequent subsequence\npattern determined based tokens and parts-of-speech of examples.\nTable Lens [20]. As shown in Fig. 4, LinguisticLens collapses\nexamples by default, but the user can expand them. It significantly\nsaves screen space while still presenting the grammatical patterns of\nindividual examples based on their POS tokens encoded by colors.\nThis enables users to quickly identify a range of linguistic patterns\nand their distributions. For example, we see a cluster (top left) of\nrepetative examples that follow the pattern NOUN ADP DET NOUN.\n5.3.3\nSummary with Frequent Pattern Mining\nTo further help users quickly get a sense of the type of examples for\neach cluster, we display the most frequent sequential pattern at the\ntop of each cluster. The pattern is formed as a sequence of items\nwhere each item is either a text token or POS tag (e.g., (music, you,\ncan, VERB, to) as shown in the last one in Fig. 5), where VERB\nis a POS tag, and the other four items are tokens. We additionally\ndisplay the number of occurrences of this pattern.\nAlgorithm Details. We extract the most frequent pattern by\nadapting a well-known sequential pattern mining algorithm [14].\nTo form inputs to the pattern mining algorithm, we transform each\nexample into a sequence of token or its POS\u2019s (e.g., (music|NOUN,\nyou|PRON, can|VERB, dance|VERB, to|ADP), allowing patterns\nthat are a mix of actual tokens and POS\u2019s. Once several candidate\npatterns are generated, we rank them to determine the most repre-\nsentative. We score each pattern with a heuristic linear function\nthat incorporates a few signals, such as the number of occurrences\n(higher score if appearing more), their length (higher score if pat-\ntern has a larger number of tokens or POS\u2019s), and proportion of\ntokens/POS\u2019s (higher score if actual tokens are used more than\nPOSes). For instance, a pattern (music, you, can, VERB, to)\ncan get a higher score than another pattern (music, PRON, can,\nVERB), even if the latter appears more times, since the former is\nlonger contains more actual tokens. We return the highest scored\npattern as the most informative pattern that summarizes each cluster.\n6\nCASE STUDIES\nWe demonstrate LinguisticLens on two different use cases described\nbelow. These were not run with domain experts, but do use real\ndata and were based on findings from our initial conversations. To\ngenerate the datasets, we started with 5-10 hand-crafted examples,\nexpanding them to 500 examples using the method described in\nSect. 2 with PaLM 2 [1]. For data privacy reasons, we do not include\nall the use cases from the motivating user conversations.\n6.1\nDialog Agent\nOur first use case is expanding a few dialogue examples into a\nlarger dataset for fine-tuning a LLM to be a dialogue model. Using\nLinguisticLens, we quickly see what individual examples look like\n(C1), and find some basic patterns (C2) from looking at clusters\nwith different metrics. E.g., we see that most examples are of similar\nlengths (using the POS metric), that there is a variety of punctuation\ntypes (embedding metric), and that there is a group of examples\nasking for different kinds of favorites (token metric).\nUndesirable Repetition (C3). We also see that there are repet-\nitive examples in Fig. 6, for example, many instances of \u2018<I/we>\nFigure 6: A dataset of dialog examples. Each cluster contains sets of\nsyntactic near-duplicates. A seed example that is used in few-shot\nexamples in prompt is shown with a gray box.\n<like/love> to...\u2019 and \u2018what is your favorite...\u2019 ex-\namples, which should be deduplicated for a more diverse dataset.\nFinding Outliers (C4). Due to the nature of agglomerative clus-\ntering, the final cluster has outlier examples that are not similar\nenough to other examples to be added to a different cluster. This\ncan be useful in two ways: sometimes these outliers are often either\ndegenerate, or so far from the desired distribution that they should\nbe deleted. However, they may also be beneficial, unique examples,\nwhich the user can incorporate into the prompt iteration.\n6.2\nMusic Recommendations\nOur second use case utilizes the music dataset described in Sect. 2.\nWe explore an overview of examples in the dataset (C1) and look\nfor some patterns in example phrasing and content (C2).\nDesirable Repetition. Interestingly, we found that Linguisti-\ncLens was also useful for finding desirable repetition, and pointed\nto areas of the dataset where more near-duplicates should be added.\nFor example, in the music dataset, there is a cluster of \u2018best music\nfrom the 90s\u2019, \u2018best music from the 70s\u2019, etc.\nThese\nwere actually deemed desirable: in fact, the user wanted to aug-\nment the dataset to include all decades. This points to the necessity\nof human in the loop evaluation: there is no way to automatically\ndetect if duplication is good or bad in a given situation.\nUndesirable Repetition (C3). As in the dialog case, we found\nclusters of examples with near-duplicate grammar (Fig. 3 - left\ncolumn). These examples are individually interesting, but are syn-\ntactically so similar to each other the user was worried a down-\nstream mode would overfit to this pattern of \u2018<nouns> that\nsound like <nouns>\u2019.\n7\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nOne area for future research is to design advanced human-in-the-loop\napproaches for users to interactively identifying example clusters\nbased on metrics of interest. Another direction is to formalize the\nnotion of syntactic overfitting and use it as an evaluation metric for\ndifferent prompting strategies. A limitation of this work is scalability,\nboth in terms of individual example lengths as well as number of\nexamples. The current interface is optimized to examples that have\nless than 10 tokens, while the lengths of input and output for LLMs\ncan be long.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Ellen Jiang, Martin Wattenberg, Ann Yuan, Lucas Dixon,\nand Google People+AI Research (PAIR) team for their feedback.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

However, existing text-to-\n3D generation methods are limited to producing 3D objects with\nsimple geometries and dreamlike styles that lack realism. In this\nwork, we present Text2NeRF, which is able to generate a wide\nrange of 3D scenes with complicated geometric structures and\nhigh-fidelity textures purely from a text prompt. To this end, we\nadopt NeRF as the 3D representation and leverage a pre-trained\ntext-to-image diffusion model to constrain the 3D reconstruction\nof the NeRF to reflect the scene description. Specifically, we\nemploy the diffusion model to infer the text-related image as the\ncontent prior and use a monocular depth estimation method to\noffer the geometric prior. Both content and geometric priors are\nutilized to update the NeRF model. To guarantee textured and\ngeometric consistency between different views, we introduce a\nprogressive scene inpainting and updating strategy for novel view\nsynthesis of the scene. Our method requires no additional training\ndata but only a natural language description of the scene as the\ninput. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Text2NeRF\noutperforms existing methods in producing photo-realistic, multi-\nview consistent, and diverse 3D scenes from a variety of natural\nlanguage prompts. Our code and model will be available upon\nacceptance.\nIndex Terms\u2014Text-to-3D, NeRF, 3D scene generation, scene\ninpainting, depth alignment.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nR\nECENT breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have\nalso sparked great interest in zero-shot text-to-3D gen-\neration [1]\u2013[4], as using natural language prompts to specify\ndesired 3D models is intuitive and, therefore, could increase\nthe productivity of the 3D modeling workflow and reduce the\nentry barrier for novices. However, contrary to the text-to-\nimage case, in which paired data is abundant, it is impractical\nto acquire large quantities of paired text and 3D data, making\nthe text-to-3D generation task still challenging [2], [5], [6].\nTo circumvent this data limitation, some pioneer works,\nincluding CLIP-Mesh [7], Dream Fields [1], DreamFusion [2],\nand Magic3D [6], use deep priors of pre-trained text-to-image\nmodels, such as CLIP [8] or image diffusion model [9], [10], to\noptimize a 3D representation, which thus empowers text-to-3D\ngeneration without the need for labeled 3D data. Despite the\ngreat success of these works, their generation results are still\nlimited to 3D scenes with simple geometries and dreamlike\nstyles. These limitations potentially stem from the fact that the\n\u2217: corresponding author.\nJ.\nZhang,\nZ.\nWan,\nC.\nWang\nand\nJ.\nLiao\nare\nwith\nDepart-\nment\nof\nComputer\nScience,\nCity\nUniversity\nof\nHong\nKong.\nE-\nmail: jbzhang6-c@my.cityu.edu.hk, ziyuwan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk, cwang355-\nc@my.cityu.edu.hk, jingliao@cityu.edu.hk. X. Li is with Tencent AI Lab. E-\nmail: xliea@connect.ust.hk\ndeep priors derived from pre-trained image models, which are\nutilized to optimize the 3D representation, can only impose\nconstraints on high-level semantics while neglecting low-\nlevel details. By contrast, recently concurrent arXived works,\nSceneScape [11] and Text2Room [12], directly employ the\ncolor image generated by text-image diffusion model to guide\nthe reconstruction of 3D scenes. Although they support the\ngeneration of realistic 3D scenes, these methods mainly focus\non indoor scenes and are hard to be extended into large-scale\noutdoor scenes due to the limitation of the explicit 3D mesh\nrepresentation such that the stretched geometry caused by\nnaive triangulation and noisy depth estimation. In contrast, our\nmethod utilizes NeRF as the 3D representation which has more\nadvantage of modeling diverse scenes with complex geometry.\nIn this paper, we present Text2NeRF, a text-driven 3D\nscene generation framework by combining the strengths of\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [13] and text-image diffusion\nmodels. We adopt NeRF as our chosen 3D representation due\nto its superiority in capturing fine-grained and photorealistic\ndetails across a wide range of scenes [14]\u2013[16]. This choice\nhelps significantly suppress the artifacts caused by a triangu-\nlar mesh representation, particularly in regions where depth\ndiscontinuity occurs. In addition, we use a pre-trained text-to-\nimage diffusion model as the image-level prior to constrain\nthe NeRF optimization from scratch without the demand of\nadditional 3D supervision or multi-view training data. Unlike\nthe previous methods, e.g. DreamFusion [2], that supervise\nthe 3D generation with the semantic priors, we leverage finer-\ngrained image priors inferred from the diffusion model, which\nconsequently allows our Text2NeRF to generate more delicate\ngeometric structure and realistic texture in the 3D scenes.\nSpecifically, we employ the diffusion model to generate text-\nrelated images as the content prior and employ a monocular\ndepth estimation method to offer the geometric prior of the\ngenerated scene. Both content and depth priors are leveraged\nto optimize the parameters of the NeRF representation.\nMoreover, to guarantee consistency between different views,\nwe propose a progressive inpainting and updating strategy\n(PIU) for the novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. Through the\nPIU strategy, the generated scene can be expanded and updated\nin a view-by-view manner following a camera trajectory. In\nthis way, the expanded area of the current view can be reflected\nin the next view by rendering the updated NeRF, which ensures\nthat the same area will not be expanded repeatedly during\nthe scene expansion process, thereby ensuring the continuity\nand view-consistency of the generated scene. Briefly, the 3D\nrepresentation of NeRF together with our PIU strategy ensures\nthe view-consistent images generated by the diffusion model,\narXiv:2305.11588v2  [cs.CV]  31 Jan 2024\n2\nFig. 1.\nWe propose Text2NeRF, a text-driven 3D scene generation framework by combining the neural radiance field representation and a pre-trained\ntext-to-image diffusion model. Our Text2NeRF is capable of generating diverse and view-consistent indoor/outdoor 3D scenes solely from natural language\ndescriptions. Please refer to our supplementary video demo for more examples.\nresulting in a view-consistent 3D scene generation. In practice,\nwe find that single-view training in NeRF leads to overfitting to\nthat specific view, causing geometric ambiguity during view-\nby-view updating due to the lack of multi-view constraints.\nTo overcome this issue, we construct a support set for the\ngenerated view, providing multi-view constraints for the NeRF\nmodeling. Drawing inspiration from [17], in addition to image\nRGB loss, we also adopt an L2 depth loss to achieve depth-\naware NeRF optimization and improve the convergence rate\nand stability of NeRF models. Considering that the depth maps\nat different views are estimated independently and could be\ninconsistent in the overlapped regions, we further introduce a\ntwo-stage depth alignment strategy to align the depth values\nof corresponding points across different views, ensuring depth\nconsistency. Thanks to these well-designed components, our\nText2NeRF is capable of generating diverse, high-fidelity,\nand view-consistent 3D scenes solely from natural language\ndescriptions, as shown in Fig. 1. The generality of our method\nallows for the generation of a wide range of 3D scenes,\nincluding indoor, outdoor, and even artistic scenes (Fig. 7 and\n8). Moreover, our approach is not limited by the view range\nand can generate 360-degree scenes (Fig. 6). Extensive ex-\nperiments demonstrate that Text2NeRF outperforms previous\nmethods both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a text-driven realistic 3D scene genera-\ntion framework combining diffusion models with NeRF,\nwhich supports zero-shot generation of various in-\ndoor/outdoor scenes from natural language prompts.\n\u2022 We introduce the PIU strategy to progressively generate\nview-consistent novel contents for 3D scenes, and build\nthe support set to provide multi-view constraints for the\nNeRF model during view-by-view updating.\n\u2022 We employ the depth loss to achieve depth-aware NeRF\noptimization, and introduce a two-stage depth alignment\nstrategy to eliminate estimated depth misalignment in\ndifferent views.\nII. RELATED WORK\nA. Text-Driven 3D Generation\nThe long-standing problem of 3D generation entails con-\nstructing diverse view-consistent 3D geometry and high-\nfidelity textures. Early works, like 3D-GAN [18], Pointflow\n[19], and ShapeRF [20] focus more on the category-specific\ntexture-less geometric shape generation based on the represen-\ntations of voxels or point clouds. Subsequently, PlatonicGAN\n[21], HoloGAN [22], and VolumeGAN [23] are proposed to\ngenerate textured 3D scenes by learning the structural and\ntextual representations from a category-specific dataset such\nas cars, faces, indoor scenes, et al. Although such methods\nachieve yield promising 3D scenes on specific categories,\nthey cannot handle text-driven generative tasks. To achieve\ntext-driven 3D generation, Text2shape [24] uses two encoder\nnetworks to learn cross-modal connections between texts and\n3D models in the embedding space from a specific paired\nscene-text dataset.\nThanks to the rapid development of text-to-image methods,\nrecent works aim to employ the pre-trained text-to-image\nmodel to guide the 3D scene generation. For example, CLIP-\nMesh [7] adopts a semantically supervised optimization strat-\negy to deduce shapes and textures for 3D meshes under the\nguidance of a pre-trained CLIP [8] model. Similar to CLIP-\nMesh, PureCLIPNeRF [25] and DreamFields [1] use the pre-\ntrained CLIP model to guide the generation of 3D objects\nwith implicit NeRF representations. Compared with the CLIP\nmodel, the state-of-the-art text image diffusion models [9],\n[10], [26], [27] undoubtedly have more powerful generation\ncapabilities due to their abundant training data and excellent\nstructure. Therefore, DreamFusion [2] and SJC [3] propose a\nscore distillation sampling (SDS) loss to extract deep semantic\npriors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models [9],\n[10] and supervise the generative network of 3D models.\nSubsequently, some follow-up works, such as Magic3D [6],\nLatent-NeRF [28], and 3DFuse [4], are proposed to improve\nthe quality of generated 3D models under the constraint of\nSDS loss. Although these methods enable producing diverse\n3D models related to the input prompts, they fail to generate\na photorealistic 3D scene with complex geometry and high-\nfidelity textures because only high-level semantic priors of the\npre-trained model are used to constrain the 3D generation. In\ncontrast, our method infers low-level content and depth priors\nfrom the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, with which\ngeometry and texture details in a photorealistic 3D scene are\nwell constrained.\n3\nMore recently, SceneScape [11] and Text2Room [12], which\nare independent and concurrent to our work, propose text-to-\n3D schemes similar to our method. Differently, they employ\nexplicit polygon meshes as the 3D representation during\ntheir generative procedure, which limits the representation of\noutdoor scenes and leads to stretched geometry and blurry\nartifacts in the fusion regions of mesh faces. In contrast, our\nimplicit NeRF representation and reconstruction strategy could\nmodel fine-grained geometry and textures without specific\nscene requirements thus enabling our method to produce both\nindoor and outdoor scenes.\nB. Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image\nSome novel view synthesis methods constrained by 3D\npresentation are able to generate a 3D-consistent experience\nfrom a single image. For example, several existing 3D pho-\ntography methods, like SVS [29], 3DP [30], and 3D-Ken-\nBurns [31], use multi-plane images (MPI) or layered depth\nimages (LDI) as 3D representations, and then employ pre-\ntrained inpainting models to complete occluded regions to\nsynthesize plausible novel views. However, such methods can\nonly produce views in a small range due to the limitation of\ntheir specific 3D representation. By contrast, some other meth-\nods achieve the 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis\nby mapping single-view image information to conventional\n3D models. For instance, SynSin [32] transforms the image\nfeatures into a point cloud based on the predicted depth in-\nformation and decodes the rendered feature map to synthesize\na novel view of the 3D scene. PixelSynth [33] constructs a\npoint cloud by directly mapping the pixel color to the 3D\npoints and introduces outpainting and refinement modules\nto fill the missing information in novel views. Worldsheet\n[34] synthesizes novel views of the 3D scene by warping a\nplanar mesh sheet according to the input image and predicted\ndepth. Intuitively, directly applying one of these methods to\nextrapolate an image generated by a text-to-image model to\nnovel views is a naive strategy for a text-driven 3D generation.\nHowever, this naive strategy is limited in several aspects. First,\ntheir scene extrapolation is based on the input image only, not\nconditioned on the text prompt. Consequently, their generated\nscene is within a limited view range around the input image\nto ensure semantic consistency. In contrast, our method allows\nfor generating new content in novel views driven by the given\ntext prompt. Therefore, ours is not limited by the view range\nand can even generate 360-degree scenes that are coherent with\nthe text description. Besides, the explicit 3D representations,\nsuch as coarse mesh or point cloud, adopted in these methods\nrestrict them from rendering fine results, while ours leveraging\nthe implicit NeRF representation is superior in representing\nand rendering high-fidelity details.\nIII. METHOD\nWe propose a text-driven 3D scene generation framework\nto progressively generate 3D scenes according to given text\nprompts as shown in Fig. 2. We first generate an initial\nview by a text-to-image diffusion model. Based on the initial\nimage, we build the support views and corresponding depth\nmaps as the support set to offer multi-view constraints for the\nNeRF reconstruction using the depth image-based rendering\n(DIBR) method. After training this initialized NeRF model,\nwe further introduce a progressive inpainting and updating\n(PIU) strategy to expand the generated scene view-by-view.\nSpecifically, we render a novel view and complete its missing\nregions via the diffusion model with the text prompt. Then\nwe take the inpainted view and constructed its support set\nas the additional supervision to update the NeRF model. By\nprogressively adding new content consistent with the existing\nscene, our framework succeeds in generating realistic 3D\nscenes with fine-grained details.\nA. Scene Initialization\nContent Generation. To obtain the initial scene content with\nrespect to the input prompt p, we first employ a pre-trained\ndiffusion model fd conditioned on p to generate a 2D scene\nimage I0 = fd(\u03f5 | p), where \u03f5 is a random Gaussian noise.\nDue to the lack of geometric information in this single view\nI0, a monocular depth estimation model fe is adopted to offer\nthe geometric inference D0 = fe (I0). The initial view I0 and\ndepth map D0 will be used to produce a support set for the\n3D scene initialization.\n3D Scene Representation. Unlike explicit representations like\npolygon meshes or point clouds [33], [35], which are hard\nto represent complex geometry, NeRF shows its power in\nrepresenting arbitrarily complex scenes. Therefore, we employ\na NeRF network f\u03b8 to represent the 3D scene. In NeRF,\nvolume rendering [13] is used to accumulate the color in the\nradiance fields:\nC(r) =\nZ tf\ntn\nT(t)\u03c3(r(t))c(r(t)) dt,\n(1)\nwhere r(t) = o + td indicates the 3D coordinates of sampled\npoints on the camera ray emitted from the camera center o\nwith the direction d. tn and tf indicate the near and far\nsampling bounds. (c, \u03c3) = f\u03b8 (r(t)) are the predicted color\nand density of the sampled point along the ray. T(t) =\nexp(\u2212\nR t\ntn \u03c3(r(s)) ds) is the accumulated transmittance. Dif-\nferent from vanilla NeRF that takes both 3D coordinate r(t)\nand view direction d in Eq. 1 to predict the radiance c, we omit\nd to avoid the effect of view-dependent specularity. Addition-\nally, inspired by [17], we introduce the depth constraint into\nNeRF optimization to achieve depth-aware NeRF optimization\nand speed up model convergence. To this end, the predicted\ndepth value z(r) is required to be calculated:\nz(r) =\nZ tf\ntn\nT(t)\u03c3(r(t))t dt.\n(2)\nTo be convenient, we denote the volume rendering on view i as\n(IR\ni , DR\ni ) = V R(f\u03b8 | i), where IR\ni\nand DR\ni are the rendered\nimage and depth map, respectively.\nSupport Set. Since the lack of multi-view supervision, directly\nadopting single-view I0 and its depth D0 to train the radiance\nfields easily leads to overfitting and geometric ambiguity. To\novercome this issue, we adopt the depth image-based rendering\n(DIBR) method [36] to construct a support set S0 for the\n4\nFig. 2. Overview of our Text2NeRF. Given an input text prompt, we infer an initial view I0 and estimate its depth D0 via a pre-trained diffusion model\nand a depth estimation model. Then we use the depth image-based rendering (DIBR) to warp the initial view and its depth map to various views to build\nthe support set S0 for initializing the neural radiance field (NeRF). Afterward, we design a progressive inpainting and updating (PIU) strategy to complete\nmissing regions consistently. During each update, we render the NeRF in a novel view k to produce the image IR\nk and depth DR\nk with missing regions. Then,\nthe diffusion model and depth estimation model are adopted to deduce completed image \u02c6Ik and its depth DE\nk . Furthermore, a two-stage depth alignment is\nimplemented on DR\nk and DE\nk to obtain aligned depth \u02c6Dk. Finally, the support set Sk of view k is added into training data to update NeRF.\ninitialization. Specifically, for each pixel q in I0 and its depth\nvalue z in D0, we compute its corresponding pixel q0\u2192i and\ndepth z0\u2192i on a surrounding view i:\n[q0\u2192i, z0\u2192i]T = KPiP\u22121\n0 K\u22121 [q, z]T\n(3)\nwhere K and Pi indicate the intrinsic matrix and the camera\npose in view i. For convenience, we denote the DIBR process\nfrom view 0 to view i as DIBR0\u2192i.\nWe manually set the intrinsic matrix K and camera pose\nP0 and then use P0 to get surrounding camera poses Pi.\nSpecifically, we first define a surrounding circle of radius \u03b6\ncentered at the current camera position and having the same z-\ncoordinate as the current camera position. Then, we uniformly\nsample \u03be points as the camera positions and employ the same\ncamera direction as the current view to produce the warping\nviews in the support set. Here, \u03b6 is the shift distance and \u03be is\nthe number of warping views. In practice, we define \u03be = 8 by\nshifting the camera position with \u03b6 = 0.2 in directions of up,\ndown, left, right, upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower\nright, respectively. With these support views, along with the\ninitial view I0, we train a NeRF as the initialized 3D scene.\nB. Text-Driven Inpainting\nAfter the scene initialization, the radiance field can be\nrendered in arbitrary novel views. However, the rendered\nresults other than the initial view 0 will inevitably have missing\ncontent since the information in the initial scene is derived\nfrom the single image I0. To complement the missing regions,\nwe employ a text-driven inpainting method based on the pre-\ntrained diffusion model fd. Specifically, we first render a novel\nview IR\nk to be inpainted. Then, we calculate the mask Mk\nof missing parts in IR\nk by warping all known views to the\nrendered view k according to Eq. 3. The rendered image IR\nk\nalong with the mask Mk and input prompt p are fed into the\ndiffusion model fd to predict an inpainting result of IR\nk :\n\u02c6Ik = fd\n\u0000IR\nk , Mk | p\n\u0001\n.\n(4)\nConsidering that the inpainting process is stochastic, al-\nthough the current diffusion model has a strong completion\nability, it is difficult to guarantee that the quality of each\nresult can meet the expected requirements. We thus perform\nthe inpainting process many times for each view IR\nk to be\ncompleted, and automatically select the one from all candidate\ninpainting results \u02c6Ij\nk that is most similar as the initial view in\nthe CLIP semantic space:\n\u02c6Ik = arg max\nj\ncos\n\u0010\nECLIP (I0) , ECLIP\n\u0010\n\u02c6Ij\nk\n\u0011\u0011\n,\n(5)\nwhere ECLIP (\u00b7) is the image encoder of CLIP model [37]. In\npractice, we generate 30 inpainting results as candidates for\neach view to be completed.\nBesides, we also use the depth estimation model fe to\nestimate the depth map DE\nk for \u02c6Ik. Note that, unlike the depth\nmap D0 of the initial view, DE\nk cannot be directly taken as the\nsupervision to update the radiance field since it is predicted\nindependently and could conflict with known depth maps such\nas DR\nk in the overlapping regions. To solve this issue, we\nimplement depth alignment to align the estimated depth map\nto the known depth values in the radiance field.\n5\nFig. 3. Example of scale and value differences. x1 and x2 are two aligned\npixels in different views. The spacial points xE\n1 and xE\n2 are projected based on\nthe estimated depth DE\nk in view k. xR\n1 and xR\n2 are points projected according\nto the rendered depth DR\nk which is constrained by known views such as view\n0. Here, \u2206E \u0338= \u2206R indicates the scale difference, and \u22061 \u0338= 0 or \u22062 \u0338= 0\nindicate the value difference.\nC. Depth Alignment\nDue to the lack of geometric constraint during the depth\nestimation, the predicted depth values could be misaligned\nin the overlapping regions [38], for example, the estimated\ndepth DE\nk of the inpainted view may be inconsistent with the\ndepth DR\nk rendered from NeRF since DR\nk is constrained by\nprevious known views. The inconsistency is manifested in two\naspects: scale difference and value difference. For instance,\nthe distance difference of two pixel-aligned spatial points and\nthe depth value of a specific point could be both different\nin depth maps estimated from different views, as shown in\nFig.3. The former is the scale difference and the latter is the\nvalue difference. In the case of scale difference, we cannot\nalign both points by shift processing because even if we\nalign the depth value of one of the points, the other point is\nstill misaligned. To eliminate the scale and value differences\nbetween the overlapping regions of the rendered depth map\nDR\nk and the estimated depth map DE\nk of the novel view, we\nintroduce a two-stage depth alignment strategy. Specifically,\nwe first globally align these two depth maps by compensating\nfor mean scale and value differences. Then we finetune a pre-\ntrained depth alignment network to produce a locally aligned\ndepth map.\nTo determine the mean scale and value differences, we first\nrandomly select M pixel pairs from the overlapping regions\nand deduce their 3D positions under depth DR\nk\nand DE\nk ,\ndenoted as\n\b\n(xR\nj , xE\nj )\n\tM\nj=1. Next, we calculate the average\nscaling score s and depth offset \u03b4 to approximate the mean\nscale and value differences:\ns =\n1\nM \u2212 1\nM\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\u2225xR\nj \u2212 xR\nj+1\u22252\n\u2225xE\nj \u2212 xE\nj+1\u22252\n,\n(6)\n\u03b4 = 1\nM\nM\nX\nj=1\n\u0000z\n\u0000xR\nj\n\u0001\n\u2212 z\n\u0000\u02c6xE\nj\n\u0001\u0001\n,\n(7)\nFig. 4.\nExamples of two inpainting strategies. The intuitive independent\ninpainting strategy simultaneously performs rendering and inpainting for each\nview. Due to there is no 3D constraint during 2D inpainting, the overlapping\nregions inpainted in different views will be view-inconsistent, as shown in\nthe red box. In contrast, our progressive inpainting strategy achieves view-\nconsistent inpainting results by introducing NeRF as a 3D constraint and\nreflecting previously inpainted content into the next view.\nwhere \u02c6xE\nj\n= s \u00b7 xE\nj\nindicates the scaled point and z(x)\nrepresents the depth value of point x. Then DE\nk can be globally\naligned with DR\nk by Dglobal\nk\n= s \u00b7 DE\nk + \u03b4.\nSince depth maps used in our pipeline are predicted by a\nnetwork, the differences between DR\nk and DE\nk are not linear,\nthat is why the global depth aligning process cannot solve the\nmisalignment problem. To further mitigate the local difference\nbetween Dglobal\nk\nand DR\nk , we train a pixel-to-pixel network f\u03c8\nfor nonlinear depth alignment. During optimization of each\nview, we optimize the parameter \u03c8 of the pre-trained depth\nalignment network f\u03c8 by minimizing their least square error\nin the overlapping regions:\nmin\n\u03c8\n\r\r\r\n\u0010\nf\u03c8(Dglobal\nk\n) \u2212 DR\nk\n\u0011\n\u2299 Mk\n\r\r\r\n2 .\n(8)\nFinally, we can derive the locally aligned depth using the\noptimized depth alignment network: \u02c6Dk = f\u03c8(Dglobal\nk\n). For\nconvenience, we denote the two-stage depth alignment process\nas align(DE\nk | DR\nk , Mk). In terms of the training of the depth\nalignment network, please refer to the implementation details\nin Sec. III-E.\nD. Progressive Inpainting and Updating\nAfter obtaining the inpainted image \u02c6Ik and the aligned depth\nmap \u02c6Dk at iteration k, we could use Eq. 3 to construct the\ncorresponding support set Sk to update the radiance field. An\nintuitive solution is to render all the views from the initialized\nradiance field and inpaint them independently. However, there\nmay be many overlapping regions to be inpainted among\ndifferent views, so the 2D text-driven inpainting model cannot\nproduce view-consistent content in all views without 3D\nconstraints, as shown in Fig. 4(a). To guarantee the view con-\nsistency and avoid the ambiguity of geometry and appearance\nduring the scene inpainting process, we propose a progressive\ninpainting and updating strategy to update the radiance fields\nview by view, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and Algorithm 1. In this\nstrategy, we update the radiance field f\u03b8 after every inpainting\n6\nAlgorithm 1 Progressive Inpainting & Updating Strategy\nInput:\nprompt p;\npre-trained diffusion model fd;\npre-trained depth estimation model fe;\ninitialized NeRF f\u03b8;\nviews to be updated V = {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N};\nviews already updated eV = {0}.\nUpdating Process:\nfor k in V do\nrendering (IR\nk , DR\nk ) = V R (f\u03b8 | k)\nmask calculation Mk \u2190 \u2229{DIBRn\u2192k}, where n \u2208 eV\nif sum(Mk) > 0 then\ntext-driven inpainting \u02c6Ik = fd\n\u0000IR\nk , Mk | p\n\u0001\nelse\ncontinue\nend if\ndepth estimation DE\nk = fe(\u02c6Ik)\ndepth alignment \u02c6Dk = align(DE\nk | DR\nk , Mk)\nsupport set Sk \u2190 \u222a{DIBRk\u2192support views}\nupdate views updated eV = eV \u222a {k}\nupdate NeRF model f\u03b8 \u2190 Sk\nend for\nReturn: updated NeRF f\u03b8\nprocess. It means that the previous inpainted content will be\nreflected in the subsequent renderings, and these parts will be\nregarded as known regions and will not be inpainted again in\nother views.\nE. Training and Implementation Details\nTraining Objective. We use a RGB loss, a depth loss, and\na transmittance loss to optimize the radiance field of the\n3D scene. Like previous NeRF-based works [13], [39], [40],\nthe RGB loss LRGB is defined as an L2 loss between the\nrendered pixel color CR and the color C generated by the\ndiffusion model fd. Different from previous works that employ\nregularized depth losses to handle uncertainty or scale-variant\nproblem [17], [41], we adopt a stricter depth loss LDepth to\nminimize the L2 distance between the rendered depth DR and\nthe aligned estimated depth \u02c6D, since the aligned depth maps\nused in our framework are scale-invariant and can be regarded\nas ground truth. Besides, inspired by [1], we design a depth-\naware transmittance loss LT to encourage the NeRF network\nto produce empty density before the camera ray reaching the\nexpected depth \u02c6z:\nLT = \u2225T(t) \u00b7 m(t)\u22252\n(9)\nwhere m(t) is a mask indicator that satisfies m(t) = 1\nwhen t < \u02c6z, otherwise m(t) = 0. \u02c6z is the pixel-wise depth\nvalue in the aligned depth map \u02c6D. T(t) is the accumulated\ntransmittance which is same as the T(t) in Eq. 1. The total\nobjective is then defined as:\nLtotal = LRGB + \u03bbdLDepth + \u03bbtLT ,\n(10)\nwhere \u03bbd and \u03bbt are constant hyperparameters balancing\nbetween terms.\nImplementation Details. We implement the Text2NeRF with\nthe Pytorch framework [42] and adopt TensoRF [39] as the ra-\ndiance field. Note that, to make TensoRF satisfy the scene gen-\neration in a large view range, we let the camera position near\nthe center of the NeRF bounding box and set outward-facing\nviewpoints. For scene generation, we use the stable diffusion\nmodel in version 2.0 [9] to generate the scene content related\nto the input prompt and use the boosting monocular depth\nestimation method [43] with pre-trained LeReS model [44] to\nestimate the depth for each view. In term of depth alignment,\nthe super-parameter M in Eq. 6 is set as min(M0, 10000)\nin practice, where M0 indicates the number of all matched\npoints in the overlapping regions. Besides, the depth alignment\nnetwork in our framework uses the same pixel-to-pixel U-\nnet architecture as the depth merging network in [43]. To\ntrain this network, we first predict 10000 depth maps using\nthe depth estimation models and add continuous non-linear\nrandom noise into these depth maps, i.e., eD = (D + \u03c41)\u00b7D1/\u03c42\nwhere D is the depth; \u03c41 and \u03c42 indicate the shift and scale\nfactors, which are randomly sampled in the range [0, 1] and\n[30, 50], respectively. Then, we use the noisy depth maps as\ninput and constrain the depth alignment network with the\nnoise-free depth maps, so that the network acquires the ability\nto locally change the depth value. Finally, we finetune the\nnetwork based on Eq. 8 to produce the local aligned depth\nfor each inpainting view. During training, we use the same\nsetting as [39] for the optimizer and learning rate and set the\nhyperparameters in our objective function as \u03bbd = 0.005 and\n\u03bbt = 1000.\nIV. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we first briefly introduce several state-of-the-\nart text-to-3D baselines and metrics (Sec. IV-A), and then we\napply our Text2NeRF to a variety of text prompts to evaluate\nits capability on photo-realistic indoor and outdoor 3D scenes\ngeneration and compare with the baseline methods (Sec. IV-B).\nFurthermore, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the\neffectiveness of major components in our method (Sec. IV-C).\nA. Setup\nBaseline Methods. To evaluate the performance of our method\non text-driven 3D scene generation, we compare our method\nwith seven baseline methods, as shown in Table. I, including\nfour generation methods guided by the high-level seman-\ntic prior (i.e., CLIP-Mesh [7], SJC [3], DreamFusion [2],\nand DreamFusion-Scene) and three methods guided by the\nlow-level image prior (i.e., 3DP [30], PixelSynth [33], and\nText2Room [12]). Here, CLIP-Mesh, SJC, and DreamFusion\nare three existing state-of-the-art text-to-3D methods which\nemploy NeRF as their 3D representation. DreamFusion-Scene\nis a modified version of DreamFusion designed for generating\n3D scenes, as the vanilla version focuses on 3D objects and is\nnot suitable for outward-facing scene generation. 3DP and Pix-\nelSynth are two novel view synthesis methods using explicit\npolygon meshes or point clouds as 3D representation, which\nrepresent a naive strategy for the text-driven 3D generation,\ni.e., applying existing novel view synthesis methods to the\n7\nFig. 5.

Here, we only show two rendering results from different\nviews for each generated scene of each method due to space limitations.

Instead, we use two metrics,\nblind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE)\n[46] and natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) [47], on\nno-reference image quality assessment to evaluate rendering\nquality of generated 3D scenes. Besides, we adopt the CLIP\ntext-image similarity score [8] to measure how well the\nrendered images align with the input prompt.\nB. Comparisons\nWe evaluate our Text2NeRF and compare it with baseline\nmethods for text-driven 3D scene generation across various\nprompts, as shown in Fig. 5. Additionally, we provide the\naverage evaluation scores of BRISQUE, NIQE, and CLIP\nfor the rendered images produced by different methods, as\nshown in Tab. I. Clearly, our method surpasses the baselines\nby generating higher-quality 3D scenes, as indicated by lower\nBRISQUE and NIQE values. Moreover, our method ensures\nthe semantic relevance between the generated scene and the\ninput text, resulting in a higher CLIP score. Overall, both\n1https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion\nqualitative and quantitative results unequivocally demonstrate\nthe superiority of our approach over the baseline methods.\nAs shown in the first three columns of Fig. 5, CLIP-\nMesh, SJC, and DreamFusion struggle to generate complex\n3D scenes related to the given prompts since their primary\ndesign focus on simple 3D object generation. Consequently,\ntheir BRISQUE and NIQE values tend to be higher compared\nto other methods, indicating relatively poorer quality in the\nrendered images of their generated scenes. In particular, CLIP-\nMesh generates 3D scenes by optimizing initial sphere and\nplanar multi-mesh representations, guided by a pre-trained\nCLIP model. Due to the absorption of environmental seman-\ntics into the planar mesh during optimization, CLIP-Mesh\nis limited to producing object-centric scenes. Similarly, SJC\nand DreamFusion adopt a looking-inside camera setting and\nsample the camera position in outer spherical coordinates of\nthe radiation field. In this way, the unbounded background\nenvironment is difficult to optimize in the central radiance\nfield, resulting in the tendency of both SJC and Dream-\nFusion to also generate object-centric scenes. Unlike SJC,\nDreamFusion incorporates an additional background spherical\nsurface outside the central radiance field. This design choice\nallows DreamFusion to include the scene environment in\nthe background representation, fulfilling high-level semantic\npriors, as observed in the examples of the garden and car.\nExcluding completely failed cases, CLIP-Mesh, DreamFusion,\nand SJC exhibit the ability to generate object-centric scenes\nwith a dreamlike style. However, they struggle to create 3D\nscenarios with complex spatial arrangements and geometry.\nIn contrast, the modified DreamFusion-Scene successfully\ngenerates text-related 3D scenes with more complex geometry.\n9\nFig. 7. More results of our 3D scene generation. It is worth noting that our method can generate diverse results from the same text prompt (g)&(j), (h)&(k),\nand (i)&(l). Please refer to the supplementary material for video results.\nNevertheless, DreamFusion-Scene still falls short in deducing\ndetailed structures and achieving photorealistic textures for the\ngenerated scenes. This limitation stems from the fact that the\ndeep semantic priors provided by the text-image method are\ninsufficient to fully constrain the low-level details.\nUnlike existing text-to-3D methods guided by the deep\nsemantic priors, the naive strategy that utilizes the novel view\nsynthesis methods, 3DP and PixelSynth, to reconstruct the\n3D scene from a single text-related image generated by the\ntext-image model. The fifth and sixth columns of Fig. 5\ndemonstrate that such methods achieve to produce photo-\nrealistic text-related 3D scenes with textual details, since they\nleverage the low-level content and depth priors to guide the\n3D reconstruction process. As a result, their BRISQUE and\nNIQE values are substantially lower than those of previous\nsemantic-guided generation methods, indicating superior scene\nquality and realism. However, their scene extrapolation is\nimplemented within a limited view range and is independent\nof the input prompt, making it difficult for them to generate\nsemantically consistent content in some novel views of the\n10\nFig. 8. 3D scenes in artistic styles generated by our Text2NeRF. Please refer to the supplementary material for video results.\nscene. Specifically, 3DP employs LDI and polygon meshes\nto represent the reconstructed 3D scene, which is susceptible\nto depth discontinuities. This can lead to missing content or\nstretched geometry in regions where depth is discontinuous, as\nillustrated in the gray area and red box in the fifth column of\nFig. 5. By contrast, PixelSynth represents the 3D scene as point\nclouds, which mitigates the sensitivity to depth discontinuities\nto some extent. However, limited by its prompt-independent\ninpainting module, PixelSynth is prone to generating incoher-\nent and blurry content, especially in the inpainted regions.\nMoreover, as shown in Fig. 6, our Text2NeRF supports text-\ndriven scene generation in a large view range thanks to\nour progressive scene inpainting and updating strategy. On\nthe other hand, other novel view synthesis methods produce\nblurred scene-filling results even at a small viewing angle since\nthe text-related guidance is not considered in such methods.\nIn comparison to the novel view synthesis methods, both\nthe concurrent work Text2Room and ours leverage the text-\nconditioned diffusion model as an inpainting module to com-\nplete missing regions in 3D scenes. To preserve the low-level\ntextural details in the 2D images generated by the diffusion\nmodel, we both introduce a color objective as the low-\nlevel image guidance. This shared characteristic allows both\napproaches to generate 3D scenes that simultaneously exhibit\nhigh quality (as indicated by low BRISQUE and NIQE values)\nand high semantic relevance (as reflected in high CLIP scores).\nHowever, there are differences in how the generated scenes are\nrepresented. Unlike Text2Room that utilizes polygon meshes\nto represent the generated scenes, we adopt the NeRF (Neural\nRadiance Fields) framework, encoding the 3D scenes in an\nimplicit network. This choice enables our method to effectively\nmodel fine-grained and photorealistic details in both bounded\nand unbounded scenes. As shown in the seventh column\nof Fig. 5, Text2Room encounters challenges in generating\ncertain outdoor scenes and often produces stretched geometry\nin regions with depth discontinuity. In contrast, our method\nsuccessfully generates indoor and outdoor 3D scenes with\ncomplex structures and achieves a higher level of photorealistic\ndetails in depth discontinuous regions.\nFurthermore, we show more examples of 3D scenes gen-\nerated by our Text2NeRF in Fig. 7. It is worth noting that\nour method can not only generate diverse results from the\nsame text prompt (Fig. 7(g)&(j), (h)&(k), and (i)&(l)), but also\nsupport to generate 3D scenes in some artistic styles (Fig. 8).\nPlease refer to the supplementary material for video results.\nC. Ablation Studies\nAblation on PIU Strategy. To investigate the effectiveness\nof the PIU strategy in our pipeline, we conduct a comparative\nexperiment by replacing it with the independent inpainting\nstrategy. As shown in Fig. 9, in the absence of the PIU strategy,\nview-inconsistent inpainted views provide equal constraints\non the content of the radiation field, which in turn produces\nsignificant artifacts in overlapping regions. Accordingly, the\nBRISQUE and NIQE values in Tab. II are higher compared\nto those obtained by our full method. By contrast, our PIU\nstrategy enables the generation process to proceed view by\nview, effectively avoiding the view-inconsistent problem that\nmay occur in the completion area.\nAblation on Support Set. To avoid overfitting and geometric\nambiguity during single-view training of NeRF, we construct\na support set for each view to provide multi-view constraints.\nHere, we further verify the effectiveness of the support set\nby removing this setting from our pipeline. As shown in\nFig. 10, the radiance field in experiment (a) is trained under\n11\nTABLE II\nABLATION STUDIES ON KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR METHOD.\nMethods\nOurs\n(full)\nw/o\nPIU\nw/o\nSupport Set\nw/o\nDepth Loss\nw/ GNLL\nDepth Loss\nw/ SSI\nDepth Loss\nw/o\nDepth Align.\nw/o Local\nDepth Align.\nw/o Global\nDepth Align.\nBRISQUE \u2193\n24.498\n33.8434\n28.3389\n27.0617\n26.1802\n25.8995\n28.1771\n27.9174\n27.1946\nNIQE \u2193\n4.618\n6.012\n5.778\n5.588\n4.837\n4.711\n5.945\n5.209\n4.839\nCLIP Score \u2191\n28.695\n25.733\n26.330\n26.782\n27.168\n27.126\n26.173\n26.527\n26.811\nFig. 9.\nEffectiveness validation of the PIU strategy. In the absence of the\nPIU (Progressive Inpainting and Updating) strategy, the missing regions in\ndifferent views are independently inpainted, leading to noticeable artifacts in\nthe final generated scene. However, by incorporating the PIU strategy, the\ngenerated scene is inpainted and updated in a view-by-view manner, ensuring\nview consistency and producing 3D scenes with distinct textures.\nFig. 10.\nEffectiveness validation of support set. Without the support set,\nalthough NeRF achieves good rendered image in the training view due to\noverfitting, it cannot produce a clear result in a novel inpainting view. By\ncontrast, the case with support set enable to obtain images with desired quality\nin both training and inpainting views. Correspondingly, compared to the blurry\nrendering image, the clear one contributes to a better inpainted result.\nthe constraint of a single initial view, i.e., without support set\nconstraints. Obviously, the NeRF is overfitting in the training\nview and cannot produce clear results in the inpainting view,\nwhich further leads to poor inpainted results. By contrast, the\ncase with a support set achieves high-quality rendering results\nin the inpainting view. Accordingly, a clear and concordant\ninpainted result can be estimated by the pre-trained diffusion\nmodel. This is also reflected in the metrics in Tab. II. Addition-\nally, we design a series of experiments to determine the hyper-\nparameters of the support set, including the number of warping\nviews \u03be and shift distance \u03b6. Specifically, we use different\nnumber of warping views and shift distance to conduct the\nsupport set and initialize the NeRF model. Then, we calculate\nthe PSNR values within valid pixels between the rendered\nimages IR\nk and the DIBR-based warping results Ik, Mk \u2190\nFig. 11.\nQuality curves for different number of warping views and shift\ndistance in the support set. Note that number 0 indicates the implementation\nwithout support set.\nFig. 12. Effectiveness validation of our depth loss. Without the guidance of\ndepth information, ambiguous depth values are produced in the near and far\nareas. In contrast, GNLL and SSI losses can constrain the depth values to a\ncertain extent, but still cannot provide a strict constraint like our L2 depth\nloss.\nDIBR0\u2192i to measure the quality of initialized NeRF: psnr\n=\n1\nNt\nPNt\nk=1 10 log10\n\u0000\r\r\u0000IR\nk \u2212 Ik\n\u0001\n\u2299 Mk\n\r\r\n2\n\u0001\n, where Nt is the\nnumber of test poses. We generate 100 test poses using a gen-\neration method similar to the support set poses, i.e., randomly\nsample \u03b6 in the range [0.1, 0.4]. As shown in Fig. 11(a), as\nthe number of warped views increases, the benefit brought by\nthe support set tends to saturate. To this end, we choose \u03be = 8\nwarping views in the experiments to balance the computation\ncost and the training benefit of the support set. By changing\nthe shift distance \u03b6 of support sets, as shown in Fig. 11(b),\nwe find that \u03b6 = 0.2 can make the support set achieve better\nperformance than other parameters. Therefore, we set \u03b6 = 0.2\nin all of our experiments.\nAblation on Depth Loss. Furthermore, to validate the effect\nof our depth loss, we compare our L2 depth loss with the\n12\nFig. 13.\nEffectiveness validation of our two-stage depth alignment. In the\nabsence of depth alignment, prominent demarcation lines arise due to depth\ndifferences in the merged depth map. Global alignment helps bring the newly\nestimated depth values closer to the known depth map as a whole, but fails\nto eliminate the demarcation lines entirely. A comparison between (a) and (c)\nreveals that local alignment improves the alignment of unaligned depth maps,\nyet without global alignment, complete elimination of differences remains\nchallenging. In contrast, our two-stage strategy effectively achieves smoother\ntransitions and harmonious results at the demarcation lines.\ncase without depth constraint and other two regularized depth\nlosses, a Gaussian negative log likelihood (GNLL) [17] depth\nloss and a scale and shift invariant (SSI) [41] depth loss.\nWithout the guidance of depth information, as shown in\nFig. 12(a), the radiance field fails to synthesize novel views\nwith plausible geometry and tends to produce ambiguous\ndepth values in the near and far areas. In contrast, GNLL\nand SSI losses have better constraining effect on near or far\ndepth, as shown in Fig. 12(b)&(c). Still, they fail to achieve\nsatisfactory results because their constraints are weaker than\nour L2 constraint (Fig. 12(d) and Tab. II). In fact, the depth\ninformation after alignment is view-consistent with the whole\ngenerated 3D scene and can be directly seen as ground truth.\nIn this case, a stricter objective function is more effective\nin constraining the generated scene than these flexible loss\nfunctions.\nAblation on Depth Alignment.\nMoreover, we conduct an\nablation study on our two-stage depth alignment strategy. In\nFig. 13(a), we present an example of scene generation without\ndepth alignment, revealing noticeable demarcation lines caused\nby depth dislocations across different views. To address this\nissue, we introduce a two-stage depth alignment strategy.\nIn the global alignment stage, we mitigate scale and value\ndifferences between known and newly predicted depth maps\nby computing the average scaling score and depth offset.\nFig. 13(b) demonstrates the impact of global alignment, where\nthe newly estimated depth values are pulled closer to the\nknown depth map as a whole. However, due to the non-linear\nnature of depth estimation by a neural network, differences\namong pixels do not vary linearly. Consequently, demarcation\nlines persist even with global alignment. In contrast, the local\ndepth alignment fine-tunes a pretrained neural network to\nreduce local differences among pixels. Comparing Fig. 13(a)\nand (c), we observe that local alignment partially brings\nunaligned depth maps closer in a non-linear manner. However,\nFig. 14. Geometric distortions caused by inaccurate depth estimation.\nwithout global alignment, it is challenging to eliminate such\ndifferences entirely. Therefore, we employ a two-stage depth\nalignment strategy to achieve smoother and more harmonious\ntransitions at the demarcation lines, as depicted in Fig. 13(d)\nand Tab. II.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose the Text2NeRF for generating\na wide range of 3D scenes with complicated structures and\nhigh-fidelity textures purely from a text prompt. We first\nleverage a pre-trained text-image diffusion model to generate\nan initial scene content and adopt a pre-trained monocular\ndepth estimation model to provide geometric prior. Then, we\ninitialize the radiance field of the scene according to the\nabove information and update the 3D scene based on the PIU\nstrategy. To avoid overfitting and geometric ambiguity during\nview-by-view updating, we introduce support sets to provide\nmulti-view constraints for single-view training in NeRF. More-\nover, we adopt depth and transmittance losses along with\nthe RGB loss to achieve depth-aware NeRF optimization and\npropose a two-stage depth alignment strategy to eliminate\ndepth disparity estimated in different views. Thanks to all well-\ndesigned modules and objectives, our Text2NeRF achieves\nto generate photo-realistic diverse 3D scenes with complex\ngeometric structures and fine-fidelity textures.\nLimitation. Although our scene generation experiments have\nyielded impressive results, it is important to acknowledge\nthat our method struggles to generate scenes with very large\nocclusions due to the limited accuracy of the depth estimation.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 14, inaccurate depth estimation causes\nevident geometric distortion in the DIBR-based warped views,\nand this distortion becomes more pronounced with increased\ncamera position offset. This results in noticeable artifacts\nand unrealism during the inpainting stage, which makes it\ndifficult to generate reasonable results for our method. On\nthe other hand, advancements in depth estimation techniques\nwill effectively alleviate this limitation. Besides, as shown in\nTab. I, compared to mesh or point cloud-based generation\nmethods, our method, like the previous NeRF-based methods\n[2], requires a longer optimization time (about 1.5 hours).\nMeanwhile, to generate 3D scenes in a large view range,\nwe set the camera positions inside the radiance field and\nmake the camera look outside. By this means, our method\ncannot generate an individual 3D object like other methods of\nsetting the camera to look inside. To overcome this limitation,\na flexible scene-adaptive camera setting strategy could be\nintroduced in our framework in the future.\n13\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. Jain, B. Mildenhall, J. T. Barron, P.

For\ninstance, one might search for \"shorebirds that\nare not sandpipers\" or \"science-fiction films\nshot in England\". To study the ability of re-\ntrieval systems to meet such information needs,\nwe construct QUEST, a dataset of 3357 natu-\nral language queries with implicit set opera-\ntions, that map to a set of entities correspond-\ning to Wikipedia documents. The dataset chal-\nlenges models to match multiple constraints\nmentioned in queries with corresponding evi-\ndence in documents and correctly perform vari-\nous set operations. The dataset is constructed\nsemi-automatically using Wikipedia category\nnames. Queries are automatically composed\nfrom individual categories, then paraphrased\nand further validated for naturalness and flu-\nency by crowdworkers. Crowdworkers also\nassess the relevance of entities based on their\ndocuments and highlight attribution of query\nconstraints to spans of document text. We an-\nalyze several modern retrieval systems, find-\ning that they often struggle on such queries.\nQueries involving negation and conjunction are\nparticularly challenging and systems are further\nchallenged with combinations of these opera-\ntions.1\n1\nIntroduction\nPeople often express their information needs with\nmultiple preferences or constraints. Queries corre-\nsponding to such needs typically implicitly express\nset operations such as intersection, difference, and\nunion. For example, a movie-goer might be looking\nfor a science-fiction film from the 90s which does\nnot feature aliens and a reader might be interested\nin a historical fiction novel set in France. Similarly,\n\u2217Work done during an internship at Google.\n1The dataset is available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/language/tree/master/language/\nquest.\nBirds of Venezuelan Andes     \u2014     Birds of Colombia\nBirds found in the Venezuelan Andes but not in Colombia\n\ud83d\uddf9 Fluent\n\ud83d\uddf9 Natural\n\u2794\nRose-crowned parakeet\n\u2794\nM\u00e9rida sunangel\n\ud83d\uddf9 Complete Evidence \n\ud83d\uddf9 Definitely Relevant\n\ud83d\uddf9 Partial Evidence\n\ud83d\uddf9 Likely Relevant\n(1)\n(3)\n(4) Relevance & Attribution Labeling\n(2)\nParaphrasing\nFigure 1: The dataset construction process for QUEST.\nFirst, (1) we sample Wikipedia category names and\nfind their corresponding set of relevant entities. (2)\nThen, we compose a query with set operations and have\nthis query paraphrased by crowdworkers. (3) These\nqueries are then validated for fluency and naturalness.\n(4) Finally, crowdworkers mark the entities\u2019 relevance\nby highlighting attributable spans in their documents.\na botanist attempting to identify a species based\non their recollection might search for shrubs that\nare evergreen and found in Panama. Further, if\nthe set of entities that satisfy the constraints is rela-\ntively small, a reader may like to see and explore\nan exhaustive list of these entities. In addition, to\nverify and trust a system\u2019s recommendations, users\nbenefit from being shown evidence from trusted\nsources (Lamm et al., 2021).\nAddressing such queries has been primarily stud-\nied in the context of question answering with struc-\ntured knowledge bases (KBs), where query con-\nstraints are grounded to predefined predicates and\nsymbolically executed. However, KBs can be in-\ncomplete and expensive to curate and maintain.\nMeanwhile, advances in information retrieval may\nenable developing systems that can address such\nqueries without relying on structured KBs, by\narXiv:2305.11694v2  [cs.CL]  31 May 2023\nmatching query constraints directly to supporting\nevidence in text documents. However, queries that\ncombine multiple constraints with implicit set op-\nerations are not well represented in existing re-\ntrieval benchmarks such as MSMarco (Nguyen\net al., 2016) and Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski\net al., 2019). Also, such datasets do not focus on\nretrieving an exhaustive document set, instead lim-\niting annotation to the top few results of a baseline\ninformation retrieval system.\nTo analyze retrieval system performance on such\nqueries, we present QUEST, a dataset with natu-\nral language queries from four domains, that are\nmapped to relatively comprehensive sets of entities\ncorresponding to Wikipedia pages. We use cate-\ngories and their mapping to entities in Wikipedia\nas a building block for our dataset construction\napproach, but do not allow access to this semi-\nstructured data source at inference time, to simulate\ntext-based retrieval. Wikipedia categories represent\na broad set of natural language descriptions of en-\ntity properties and often correspond to selective\ninformation need queries that could be plausibly\nissued by a search engine user. The relationship\nbetween property names and document text is often\nsubtle and requires sophisticated reasoning to deter-\nmine, representing the natural language inference\nchallenge inherent in the task.\nOur dataset construction process is outlined in\nFigure 1. The base queries are semi-automatically\ngenerated using Wikipedia category names. To\nconstruct complex queries, we sample category\nnames and compose them by using pre-defined\ntemplates (for example, A \u2229 B \\ C). Next, we\nask crowdworkers to paraphrase these automati-\ncally generated queries, while ensuring that the\nparaphrased queries are fluent and clearly describe\nwhat a user could be looking for. These are then\nvalidated for naturalness and fluency by a differ-\nent set of crowdworkers, and filtered according to\nthose criteria. Finally, for a large subset of the data,\nwe collect scalar relevance labels based on the en-\ntity documents and fine-grained textual attributions\nmapping query constraints to spans of document\ntext. Such annotation could aid the development\nof systems that can make precise inferences from\ntrusted sources.\nPerforming well on this dataset requires sys-\ntems that can match query constraints with cor-\nresponding evidence in documents and handle set\noperations implicitly specified by the query (see\nFigure 2: An example of a query and relevant entity\nfrom QUEST. The attribution for different query con-\nstraints can come from different parts of the document.\nFigure 2), while also efficiently scaling to large\ncollections of entities.\nWe evaluate several re-\ntrieval systems by finetuning pretrained models on\nour dataset. Systems are trained to retrieve multi-\ndocument sets given a query. We find that current\ndual encoder and cross-attention models up to the\nsize of T5-Large (Raffel et al., 2020) are largely not\neffective at performing retrieval for queries with\nset operations. Queries with conjunctions and nega-\ntions prove to be especially challenging for models\nand systems are further challenged with combina-\ntions of set operations. Our error analysis reveals\nthat non-relevant false positive entities are often\ncaused by the model ignoring negated constraints,\nor ignoring the conjunctive constraints in a query.\n2\nRelated Work\nPrevious work in question answering and informa-\ntion retrieval has focused on QA over knowledge\nbases as well as open-domain QA and retrieval over\na set of entities or documents. We highlight how\nthese relate to our work below.\nKnowledge Base QA\nSeveral datasets have been\nproposed for question answering over knowledge\nbases (Berant et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2016; Tal-\nmor and Berant, 2018; Keysers et al., 2020; Gu\net al., 2021, inter alia). These benchmarks re-\nquire retrieval of a set of entities that exist as nodes\nor relations in an accompanying knowledge base.\nQuestions are optionally supplemented with logical\nforms. Lan et al. (2021) provide a comprehensive\nsurvey of complex KBQA datasets.\nPrevious work has simultaneously noted that\nlarge curated KBs are incomplete (Watanabe et al.,\n2017). Notably, KBQA systems operate over a\nconstrained answer schema, which limits the types\nof queries they can handle. Further, these schema\nare expensive to construct and maintain. For this\nreason, our work focuses on a setting where we do\nnot assume access to a KB. We note that KBQA\ndatasets have also been adapted to settings where a\nKB is incomplete or unavailable (Watanabe et al.,\n2017; Sun et al., 2019). This was done by either\nremoving some subset of the data from the KB or\nignoring the KB entirely. A key difference from\nthese datasets is also that we do not focus on multi-\nhop reasoning over multiple documents. Instead,\nthe relevance of an entity can be determined solely\nbased on its document.\nOpen-Domain QA and Retrieval\nMany open-\ndomain QA benchmarks, which consider QA over\nunstructured text corpora, have been proposed\nin prior work.\nSome of these, such as TREC\n(Craswell et al., 2020), MSMarco (Nguyen et al.,\n2016) and Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al.,\n2019) are constructed using \"found data\", using\nreal user queries on search engines. Thakur et al.\n(2021) present a benchmark where they consider\nmany such existing datasets. Datasets such as Hot-\npotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and MultiRC (Khashabi\net al., 2018) have focused on multi-hop question\nanswering. Other work has explored e-commerce\ndatasets (for example, (Kong et al., 2022)), but\nthese have not been released publicly. Notably, the\nfocus of these datasets differs from ours as we focus\non queries that contain implicit set operations over\nexhaustive answer sets. Such queries are not well\nrepresented in existing datasets because they occur\nin the tail of the query distributions considered.\nMulti-Answer Retrieval\nRelated work (Min\net al., 2021; Amouyal et al., 2022) also studies\nthe problem of multi-answer retrieval, where sys-\ntems are required to predict multiple distinct an-\nswers for a query. Min et al. (2021) adapt existing\ndatasets (for example, WebQuestionsSP (Yih et al.,\n2016)) to study this setting and propose a new met-\nric, MRecall@K, to evaluate exhaustive recall of\nmultiple answers. We also consider the problem of\nmulti-answer set retrieval, but consider queries that\nimplicitly contain set constraints.\nIn concurrent work, RomQA (Zhong et al., 2022)\nproposes an open-domain QA dataset, focusing on\ncombinations of constraints extracted from Wiki-\ndata. RomQA shares our motivation to enable an-\nswering queries with multiple constraints, which\nhave possibly large answer sets. To make attribu-\ntion to evidence feasible without human annotation,\nRomQA focuses on questions whose component\nconstraints can be verified from single entity-linked\nsentences from Wikipedia abstracts, annotated with\nrelations automatically through distant supervision,\nwith high precision but possibly low recall (T-Rex\ncorpus). In QUEST, we broaden the scope of query-\nevidence matching operations by allowing for at-\ntribution through more global, document-level in-\nference. To make human annotation for attribution\nfeasible, we limit the answer set size and the evi-\ndence for an answer to a single document.\n3\nDataset Generation\nQUEST consists of 3357 queries paired with up\nto 20 corresponding entities. Each entity has an\nassociated document derived from its Wikipedia\npage. The dataset is divided into 1307 queries for\ntraining, 323 for validation, and 1727 for testing.\nThe task for a system is to return the correct\nset of entities for a given query. Additionally, as\nthe collection contains 325,505 entities, the task\nrequires retrieval systems that can scale efficiently.\nWe do not allow systems to access additional infor-\nmation outside of the text descriptions of entities at\ninference time. Category labels are omitted from\nall entity documents.\n3.1\nAtomic Queries\nThe base atomic queries (i.e., queries without any\nintroduced set operations) in our dataset are derived\nfrom Wikipedia category names2. These are hand-\ncurated natural language labels assigned to groups\nof related documents in Wikipedia3. Category as-\nsignments to documents allow us to automatically\ndetermine the set of answer entities for queries with\nhigh precision and relatively high recall. We com-\npute transitive closures of all relevant categories to\ndetermine their answer sets.\nHowever, repurposing these categories for con-\nstructing queries poses challenges: 1) lack of evi-\n2We use the Wikipedia version from 06/01/2022.\n3Note that these category labels can sometimes be conjunc-\ntive themselves, potentially increasing complexity.\nDomain\nTemplate\nExample\nNum.

For about half of the dataset, we\ncrowdsource relevance labels and attribution based\non document text, and investigate recall through\nmanual error analysis (\u00a75).\nWe select four domains to represent some diver-\nsity in queries: films, books, animals and plants.\nFocusing on four rather than all possible domains\nenables higher quality control. The former two\nmodel a general search scenario, while the latter\ntwo model a scientific search scenario.\n3.2\nIntroducing set operations\nTo construct queries with set operations, we define\ntemplates that represent plausible combinations of\natomic queries. Denoting atomic queries as A, B\nand C, our templates and corresponding examples\nfrom different domains are listed in Table 1. Tem-\nplates were constructed by composing three basic\nset operations (intersection, union and difference).\nThey were chosen to ensure unambiguous interpre-\ntations of resulting queries by omitting those com-\nbinations of set operations that are non-associative.\nBelow we describe the logic behind sampling\natomic queries (i.e., A, B, C) for composing com-\nplex queries, with different set operations. In all\ncases, we ensure that answer sets contain between\n2-20 entities so that crowdsourcing relevance judge-\nments is feasible. We sample 200 queries per tem-\nplate and domain, for a total of 4200 initial queries.\nThe dataset is split into train + validation (80-20\nsplit) and testing equally. In each of these sets, we\nsampled an equal number of queries per template.\nIntersection.\nThe intersection operation for a\ntemplate A\u2229B is particularly interesting and poten-\ntially challenging when both A and B have large\nanswer sets but their intersection is small. We re-\nquire the minimum answer set sizes of each A and\nB to be fairly large (>50 entities), while their inter-\nsection to be small (2-20 entities).\nDifference.\nSimilar to intersection, we require\nthe answer sets for both A and B to be substantial\n(>50 entities), but also place maximum size con-\nstraints on both A (<200 entities) and B (<10000\nentities) as very large categories tend to suffer from\nrecall issues in Wikipedia. We also limit the inter-\nsection of A and B (see reasoning in Appendix B).\nUnion.\nFor the union operation, we require both\nA and B to be well-represented through the entities\nin the answer set for their union A \u222a B. Hence,\nwe require both A and B to have at least 3 entities.\nFurther, we require their intersection to be non-zero\nbut less than 1/3rd of their union. This is so that A\nand B are somewhat related queries.\nFilms\nBooks\nPlants\nAnimals\nAll\nNum. Queries\n896\n870\n802\n789\n3357\nNum. Entities\n146368\n50784\n83672\n44681\n325505\nAvg.

For example, for A\u2229B\\C, we\nsample atomic queries A and B for the intersection\noperation, then sample C based on the relationship\nbetween A \u2229 B and C.\n3.3\nAnnotation Tasks\nAutomatically generating queries based on tem-\nplates results in queries that are not always fluent\nand coherent. Further, entities mapped to a query\nmay not actually be relevant and don\u2019t always have\nattributable evidence for judging their relevance.\nWe conduct crowdsourcing to tackle these issues.\nThe annotation tasks aim at ensuring that 1) queries\nare fluent, unambiguous and contain diverse nat-\nural language logical connectives, (2) entities are\nverified as being relevant or non-relevant and (3)\nrelevance judgements are attributed to document\ntext for each relevant entity. Crowdsourcing is per-\nformed in three stages, described below. More\nannotation details and the annotation interfaces can\nbe found in Appendix C.\n3.3.1\nParaphrasing\nCrowdworkers were asked to paraphrase a tem-\nplatically generated query so that the paraphrased\nquery is fluent, expresses all constraints in the orig-\ninal query, and clearly describes what a user could\nbe looking for. This annotation was done by one\nworker per query.\n3.3.2\nValidation\nThis stage is aimed at validating the queries we\nobtain from the paraphrasing stage. Crowdworkers\nwere given queries from the first stage and asked to\nlabel whether the query is 1) fluent, 2) equivalent to\nthe original templatic query in meaning, and 3) rate\nits naturalness (how likely it is to be issued by a\nreal user). This annotation was done by 3 workers\nper query. We excluded those queries which were\nrated as not fluent, unnatural or having a different\nmeaning than the original query, based on a ma-\njority vote. Based on the validation, we removed\naround around 11% of the queries from stage 1.\n3.3.3\nRelevance Labeling\nNext, crowdworkers were asked to provide rele-\nvance judgements for the automatically determined\nanswer sets of queries. Specifically, they were\ngiven a query and associated entities/documents,\nand asked to label their relevance on a scale of 0-3\n(definitely not relevant, likely not relevant, likely\nrelevant, definitely relevant). They were asked to\nensure that relevance should mostly be inferred\nfrom the document, but they could use some back-\nground knowledge and do minimal research.\nWe also asked them to provide attributions for\ndocument relevance. Specifically, we ask them\nto first label whether the document provides suffi-\ncient evidence for the relevance of the entity (com-\nplete/partial/no). Then, for different phrases in the\nquery (determined by the annotator), we ask them\nto mark sentence(s) in the document that indicate\nits relevance. The attribution annotation is broadly\ninspired by Rashkin et al. (2021). For negated con-\nstraints, we ask annotators to mark attributable sen-\ntences if they provide counter-evidence. Since this\nannotation was time-intensive, we collected these\nannotations for two domains (films and books). We\nfound that relevance labeling was especially dif-\nficult for the plants and animals domains, as they\nrequired more specialized scientific knowledge. In\nour pilot study prior to larger scale data collection,\nwe collected 3 relevance ratings from different an-\nnotators for 905 query and document pairs from\nthe films domain. In 61.4% of cases, all 3 raters\njudged the document to be \u201cDefinitely relevant\u201d or\n\u201cLikely relevant\u201d or all 3 raters judged the docu-\nment to be \u201cDefinitely not relevant\u201d or \u201cLikely not\nrelevant\u201d. The Fleiss\u2019 kappa metric on this data\nwas found to be K=0.43. We excluded all entities\nwhich were marked as likely or definitely not rel-\nevant to a query based on the document text from\nits answer set. Around 23.7% of query-document\npairs from stage 2 were excluded.\nRetriever \n(BM25 or T5 Dual \nEncoder)\nTop-100 Candidate \nDocuments\nRelevance \nClassifier \n(T5)\nPredicted \nDocument Set\nDocument Corpus\nQuery\nFigure 3: We compare several systems consisting of a retriever for efficiently selecting a set of candidates from the\ndocument corpus and a document relevance classifier for determining the final predicted document set.\n3.4\nDataset Statistics\nBasic dataset statistics are reported in Table 2. The\ndataset contains more entities from the films do-\nmain, because this domain is more populated in\nWikipedia. The average length of queries is 8.6\nwords and the average document length is 452\nwords. Documents from the films and books do-\nmains are longer on average, as they often con-\ntain plots and storylines. Around \u223c69% of entities\nhave complete evidence and \u223c30% have partial\nevidence. Evidence was labeled as partial when\nnot all phrases in the query had explicit evidence\nin the document (i.e., they may require background\nknowledge or reasoning). There are on average\n33.2 words attributed for each entity with the max-\nimum attribution text span ranging up to length\n1837 words. Finally, the average answer set size is\n10.5 entities.\n3.5\nAdditional Training Examples\nBeyond the annotated data, we generated additional\nsynthetic examples for training. We found includ-\ning such examples improved model performance,\nand we include these examples for the experiments\nin \u00a74. To generate these examples, we sample 5000\natomic queries from all domains, ensuring that they\ndo not already appear as sub-queries in any of the\nqueries in QUEST and use their corresponding enti-\nties in Wikipedia as their relevant entity set.\n4\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate modern retrieval systems to establish\nbaseline performances. We also perform extensive\nerror analysis to understand patterns of model er-\nrors and the quality of the labels in QUEST.\n4.1\nTask Definition\nWe consider a corpus, E, that contains entities\nacross all domains in the dataset. Each entity is ac-\ncompanied with a document based on its Wikipedia\npage. An example in our dataset consists of a query,\nx, and an annotated set of relevant entities, y \u2282 E.\nAs described in \u00a73, for all examples |y| < 20. Our\ntask is to develop a system that, given E and a query\nx, predicts a set of relevant entities, \u02c6y \u2282 E.\n4.2\nEvaluation\nOur primary evaluation metric is average F1, which\naverages per-example F1 scores. We compute F1\nfor each example by comparing the predicted set\nof entities, \u02c6y, with the annotated set, y.\n4.3\nBaseline Systems\nWe evaluated several combinations of retrievers\nand classifiers, as shown in Figure 3. For the re-\ntriever component, we consider a sparse BM25\nretriever (Robertson et al., 2009) and a dense\ndual encoder retriever (denoted DE). Following\nNi et al. (2022), we initialize our dual encoder\nfrom a T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) encoder and train\nwith an in-batch sampled softmax loss (Henderson\net al., 2017). Once we have a candidate set, we\nneed to determine a set of relevant entities. To clas-\nsify relevance of each candidate document for the\ngiven query, we consider a cross-attention model\nwhich consists of a T5 encoder and decoder.4 We\ntrain the cross-attention classifier using a binary\ncross-entropy loss with negative examples based\non non-relevant documents in top 1,000 documents\nretrieved by BM25 and random non-relevant doc-\numents (similarly to Nogueira and Cho (2019)).\nAs cross-attention classification for a large number\nof candidates is computationally expensive, we re-\nstrict BM25 and the dual encoder to retrieve 100\ncandidates which are then considered by the cross-\nattention classifier. As our T5-based dual encoder\ncan only efficiently accommodate up to 512 tokens,\n4Scores from BM25 and dual encoders trained with a soft-\nmax loss are not normalized to provide relevance probabilities\nfor documents. We found that naively applying a global thresh-\nold to these scores to produce answer sets did not perform as\nwell as using a classifier trained with a binary cross-entropy\nloss to predict document relevance.\nRetriever (K=100)\nClassifier\nAvg.

We discuss the impact\nof this and alternatives in \u00a75. Further, since T5 was\npre-trained on Wikipedia, we investigate the impact\nof memorization in Appendix D. Additional details\nand hyperparameter settings are in Appendix A.\n4.4\nManual Error Annotation\nFor the best overall system, we sampled errors and\nmanually annotated 1145 query-document pairs\nfrom the validation set. For the retriever, we sam-\npled relevant documents not included in the top-100\ncandidate set and non-relevant documents ranked\nhigher than relevant ones. For the classifier, we\nsampled false positive and false negative errors\nmade in the top-100 candidate set. This annota-\ntion process included judgements of document rel-\nevance (to assess agreement with the annotations\nin the dataset) and whether the document (and the\ntruncated version considered by the dual encoder\nor classifier) contained sufficient evidence to rea-\nsonably determine relevance. We also annotated\nrelevance for each constraint within a query. We\ndiscuss these results in \u00a75.\n5\nResults and Analysis\nWe report the performance of our baseline systems\non the test set in Table 3. In this section, we sum-\nmarize the key findings from our analysis of these\nresults and the error annotation described in \u00a74.4.\nDual encoders outperform BM25.\nAs shown\nin Table 3, the best overall system uses a T5-\nLarge Dual Encoder instead of BM25 for retrieval.\nThe performance difference is even more signifi-\ncant when comparing recall of Dual Encoders and\nBM25 directly. We report average recall (average\nper-example recall of the full set of relevant docu-\nments) and MRecall (Min et al., 2021) (the percent-\nage of examples where the candidate set contains\nall relevant documents), over various candidate set\nsizes in Table 4.\nRetrieval and classification are both challeng-\ning.\nAs we consider only the top-100 candidates\nfrom the retriever, the retriever\u2019s recall@100 sets\nan upper bound on the recall of the overall system.\nRecall@100 is only 0.476 for the T5-Large Dual\nEncoder, and the overall recall is further reduced by\nthe T5-Large classifier to 0.368, despite achieving\nonly 0.165 precision. This suggests that there is\nroom for improvement from both stages to improve\noverall scores. As performance improves for larger\nT5 sizes for both retrieval and classification, further\nmodel scaling could be beneficial.\nModels struggle with intersection and difference.\nWe also analyzed results across different templates\nand domains, as shown in Table 5. Different con-\nstraints lead to varying distributions over answer\nset sizes and the atomic categories used. There-\nfore, it can be difficult to interpret differences in F1\nscores across templates. Nevertheless, we found\nthe queries with set union have the highest aver-\nage F1 scores. Queries with set intersection have\nthe lowest average F1 scores, and queries with set\ndifference also appear to be challenging.\nTo analyze why queries with conjunction and\nnegation are challenging, we labeled the relevance\nof individual query constraints (\u00a74.4), where a sys-\ntem incorrectly judges relevance of a non-relevant\ndocument. The results are summarized in Table 6.\nFor a majority of false positive errors involving in-\ntersection, at least one constraint is satisfied. This\ncould be interpreted as models incorrectly treating\nintersection as union when determining relevance.\nSimilarly, for a majority of examples with set dif-\nference, the negated constraint is not satisfied. This\nsuggests that the systems are not sufficiently sensi-\ntive to negations.\nTemplate\nFilms\nBooks\nPlants\nAnimals\nAll\nA\n0.231\n0.436\n0.209\n0.214\n0.274\nA \u222a B\n0.264\n0.366\n0.229\n0.271\n0.282\nA \u2229 B\n0.115\n0.138\n0.049\n0.063\n0.092\nA \\ B\n0.177\n0.188\n0.216\n0.204\n0.193\nA \u222a B \u222a C\n0.200\n0.348\n0.306\n0.294\n0.287\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C\n0.086\n0.121\n0.07\n0.065\n0.086\nA \u2229 B \\ C\n0.119\n0.112\n0.121\n0.136\n0.122\nAll\n0.171\n0.248\n0.165\n0.182\n0.192\nTable 5: F1 of our strongest baseline (T5-Large DE +\nT5-Large Classifier) across templates and domains.\nThere is significant headroom to improve both\nprecision and recall.\nAs part of our manual er-\nror analysis (\u00a74.4), we made our own judgements\nof relevance and measured agreement with the rel-\nevance annotations in QUEST. As this analysis\nfocused on cases where our best system disagreed\nwith the relevance labels in the dataset, we would\nexpect agreement on these cases to be significantly\nlower than on randomly selected query-document\npairs in the dataset. Therefore, it provides a fo-\ncused way to judge the headroom and annotation\nquality of the dataset.\nFor false negative errors, we judged 91.1% of\nthe entities to be relevant for the films and books\ndomains, and 81.4% for plants and animals. No-\ntably, we collected relevance labels for the films\nand books domains and removed some entities\nbased on these labels, as described in \u00a73, which\nlikely explains the higher agreement for false neg-\natives from these domains. This indicates signifi-\ncant headroom for improving recall as defined by\nQUEST, especially for the domains where we col-\nlected relevance labels.\nFor false positive errors, we judged 28.8% of\nthe entities to be relevant, showing a larger dis-\nagreement with the relevance labels in the dataset.\nThis is primarily due to entities not included in the\nentity sets derived from the Wikipedia category tax-\nonomy (97.7%), rather than entities removed due\nto relevance labeling. This is a difficult issue to\nfully resolve, as it is not feasible to exhaustively\nlabel relevance for all entities to correct for recall\nissues in the Wikipedia category taxonomy. Future\nwork can use pooling to continually grow the set\n# Constraints\n1\n2\n3\nNeg.\nRetriever\nA \u2229 B\n63.5\n36.5\n\u2014\n\u2014\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C\n56.5\n37.0\n6.5\n\u2014\nA \\ B\n80.3\n19.7\n\u2014\n59.1\nA \u2229 B \\ C\n47.6\n40.5\n11.9\n26.2\nClassifier\nA \u2229 B\n83.3\n16.7\n\u2014\n\u2014\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C\n73.2\n22.0\n4.9\n\u2014\nA \\ B\n81.0\n19.1\n\u2014\n38.1\nA \u2229 B \\ C\n95.5\n4.6\n0.0\n68.2\nTable 6: Analysis of false positive errors from the T5-\nLarge classifier and cases where a non-relevant docu-\nment was ranked ahead of a relevant one for the T5-\nLarge dual encoder.

Despite this, our analysis suggests\nthere is significant headroom for improving pre-\ncision, as we judged a large majority of the false\npositive predictions to be non-relevant.\nTruncating document text usually provides suf-\nficient context.\nIn our experiments, we truncate\ndocument text to 512 tokens for the dual encoder,\nand 384 tokens for the classifier to allow for the\ndocument and query to be concatenated. Based on\nour error analysis (\u00a74.4), out of the documents with\nsufficient evidence to judge relevance, evidence oc-\ncurred in this truncated context 93.2% of the time\nfor the dual encoder, and 96.1% of the time for the\nclassifier. This may explain the relative success of\nthis simple baseline for handling long documents.\nWe also evaluated alternative strategies but these\nperformed worse in preliminary experiments5. Fu-\nture work can evaluate efficient transformer vari-\nants (Guo et al., 2022; Beltagy et al., 2020).\n6\nConclusion\nWe present QUEST, a new benchmark of queries\nwhich contain implicit set operations with corre-\nsponding sets of relevant entity documents.

Future\nwork could consider approaches that have better\ninductive biases for handling set operations in natu-\nral language expressions (for example, Vilnis et al.\n(2018)). The attributions in QUEST can be lever-\naged for building systems that can provide fine-\ngrained attributions at inference time. The potential\nof pretrained generative LMs and multi-evidence\naggregation methods to answer set-seeking selec-\ntive queries, while providing attribution to sources,\ncan also be investigated.\n7\nLimitations\nNaturalness.\nSince our dataset relies on the\nWikipedia category names and semi-automatically\ngenerated compositions, it does not represent an\nunbiased sample from a natural distribution of\nreal search queries that contain implicit set opera-\ntions. Further, we limit attention to non-ambiguous\nqueries and do not address the additional challenges\nthat arise due to ambiguity in real search scenarios.\nHowever, the queries in our dataset were judged to\nplausibly correspond to real user search needs and\nsystem improvements measured on QUEST should\ncorrelate with improvements on at least a fraction\nof natural search engine queries with set operations.\nRecall.\nWe also note that because Wikipedia cat-\negories have imperfect recall of all relevant enti-\nties (that contain sufficient evidence in their docu-\nments), systems may be incorrectly penalised for\npredicted relevant entities assessed as false positive.\nWe quantify this in section 5. We have also limited\nthe trusted source for an entity to its Wikipedia\ndocument but entities with insufficient textual ev-\nidence in their documents may still be relevant.\nIdeally, multiple trusted sources could be taken\ninto account and evidence could be aggregated to\nmake relevance decisions. RomQA (Zhong et al.,\n2022) takes a step in this latter direction although\nthe evidence attribution is not manually verified.\nAnswer Set Sizes.\nTo ensure that relevance la-\nbels are correct and verifiable, we seek the help\nof crowdworkers. However, this meant that we\nneeded to restrict the answer set sizes to 20 for the\nqueries in our dataset, to make annotation feasible.\nOn one hand, this is realistic for a search scenario\nbecause users may only be interested in a limited\nset of results. On the other hand, our dataset does\nnot model a scenario where the answer set sizes are\nmuch larger.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Isabel Kraus-Liang, Ma-\nhesh Maddinala, Andrew Smith, Daphne Domansi,\nand all the annotators for their work.

We also replicated\neach positive example 50 times. We found an ap-\nproximately even number of positive and negative\nexamples lead to better performance than training\nwith a large class imbalance. We found a com-\nbination of random negatives and negatives from\nBM25 performed better than using only either in-\ndividual type of negative examples. Additionally,\nselecting negative examples from BM25 performed\nbetter than selecting negative examples from the\nT5-Large dual encoder.\nFor the T5 input we concatenated the query and\ntruncated document text. The T5 output is the\nstring \u201crelevant\u201d or \u201cnot relevant\u201d. To classify doc-\nument relevance at inference time, we applied a\nthreshold to the probability assigned to the \u201crel-\nevant\u201d label, which we tuned on the validation\nset.

We quantify the degree of missing\nentities by denoting recall as rA and rB, such that\n| \u02c6A| = rA \u2217 |A| and | \u02c6B| = rB \u2217 |B|.

For sim-\nplicity, we also assume that the overlap between\n\u02c6A and \u02c6B is such that | \u02c6A \u2229 B| = rA \u2217 |A \u2229 B| and\n| \u02c6A \u2229 \u02c6B| = rA \u2217 rB \u2217 |A \u2229 B|.\nDerivation\nWhat is the recall (r) and precision\n(p) of \u02c6A \\ \u02c6B relative to A \\ B as a function of rA,\nrB, and r\u2229?\nFirst, we derive this function for recall:9\nr = |(A \\ B) \u2229 ( \u02c6A \\ \u02c6B)|\n|(A \\ B)|\nr = |( \u02c6A \\ B)|\n|(A \\ B)|\nr = | \u02c6A| \u2212 | \u02c6A \u2229 B|\n|A| \u2212 |A \u2229 B|\nr = rA \u2217 |A| \u2212 rA \u2217 r\u2229 \u2217 |A|\n|A| \u2212 (r\u2229 \u2217 |A|)\nr = rA \u2217 (1 \u2212 r\u2229) \u2217 |A|\n(1 \u2212 r\u2229) \u2217 |A|\nr = rA\nAnd for precision:\np = |(A \\ B) \u2229 ( \u02c6A \\ \u02c6B)|\n|( \u02c6A \\ \u02c6B)|\n9We note some useful properties of pairs of sets X and Y :\nX \\ Y = X \u2229 Y c, |X \\ Y | = |X| \u2212 |X \u2229 Y |, if X \u2282 Y then\nX \u2229 Y = X, and if X \u2282 Y then Y c \u2282 Xc.\np = |( \u02c6A \\ B)|\n|( \u02c6A \\ \u02c6B)|\np = | \u02c6A| \u2212 | \u02c6A \u2229 B|\n| \u02c6A| \u2212 | \u02c6A \u2229 \u02c6B|\np =\nrA \u2217 |A| \u2212 rA \u2217 r\u2229 \u2217 |A|\nrA \u2217 |A| \u2212 rA \u2217 rB \u2217 r\u2229 \u2217 |A|\np =\nrA \u2217 (1 \u2212 r\u2229) \u2217 |A|\nrA \u2217 (1 \u2212 rB \u2217 r\u2229) \u2217 |A|\np =\n(1 \u2212 r\u2229)\n(1 \u2212 rB \u2217 r\u2229)\nDiscussion\nWhile recall is simply equal to rA,\nprecision is a more complicated function of rB\nand r\u2229, and can be very low for large values of\nr\u2229. Intuitively, if subtracting \u02c6B from \u02c6A removes\nmost of \u02c6A, then the precision of the resulting set\nwill be dominated by the relevant entities missing\nfrom \u02c6B. This motivates limiting the intersection of\nthe two sets used to construct queries involving set\nintersection. For example, if rB = 0.95, then with\nr\u2229 < 0.8, we can ensure p > 0.83.\nC\nAnnotation Details\nThe annotation tasks in QUEST were carried out by\nparticipants who were paid contractors. They are\nbased in Austin, TX and either have a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree (55%) or equivalent work experience (45%).\nThey were paid by the hour for their work and were\nrecruited from a vendor who screened them for\nknowledge of US English.

These approaches\nhave led to the development of versatile models capable of tackling a wide array\nof tasks, while delivering state-of-the-art performance. However, current models\ninherently lack the capacity to produce the requisite language for open-ended tasks,\nsuch as Audio Captioning or Audio Question Answering. We introduce Pengi,\na novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all\naudio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and\ntext, and generates free-form text as output. The input audio is represented as a\nsequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder. A text encoder does\nthe same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are combined as a\nprefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model. The unified architecture\nof Pengi enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional\nfine-tuning or task-specific extensions. When evaluated on 21 downstream tasks,\nour approach yields state-of-the-art performance in several of them. Our results\nshow that connecting language models with audio models is a major step towards\ngeneral-purpose audio understanding 1.\nFigure 1: Examples of audio and text prompt inputs and their corresponding textual responses. Images\nare for illustration purposes only. Our proposed model Pengi enables close-ended tasks, such as\nclassification or retrieval and open-ended tasks, such as captioning or question & answering.\n1\nIntroduction\nMachine Listening breaks down audio understanding into separate and independent audio tasks. For\nexample, Sound Event and Scene Classification, Audio Retrieval, and Audio Captioning. Because\nthese audio tasks are intrinsically related, we can leverage from Transfer Learning (TL). TL focuses\non applying knowledge gained while solving one task to solve a related task. The learning method\ninvolves pre-training a model with a large compilation of datasets from different tasks followed by\nfine-tuning on a target dataset. These models have shown the potential to learn general-purpose audio\n1Code is available here: https://github.com/microsoft/Pengi\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2305.11834v2  [eess.AS]  19 Jan 2024\nrepresentations [55] that can successfully be used in a variety of downstream tasks. To leverage\nfrom larger amounts of audio that is unlabeled, the community has employed Self-Supervised and\nUnsupervised Learning [52, 53, 46, 21]. These methods do not require labels [55, 7] and have\nachieved state-of-the-art performance. However, both methods require an additional fine-tuning step\nbefore they can be applied to any downstream task.\nTo address this drawback, another Transfer Learning (TL) method called Zero-Shot Learning provides\ndirect inference capabilities and removes the need of fine-tuning. These models use contrastive\nobjectives to learn the similarity between natural language descriptions and audio content to provide a\nscore that identifies the most probable class label for a given testing audio. Examples are CLAP [17],\nMulan [28], and LAION-CLAP [60]. Despite not seeing the training data of a target task, Zero-Shot\nmodels achieve surprising performance in close-ended tasks, such as classification and retrieval.\nHowever, these models inherently lack the capacity to produce the requisite language for open-ended\ntasks, such as Audio Captioning or Audio Question Answering (AQA).\nCurrent audio models that can perform open-ended tasks do not support or have not been evaluated\non closed-ended tasks [39, 33]. It is yet to be explored how to leverage TL to enable both types of\ntasks in the audio domain. We drew inspiration from recent advances in Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) and Visual Language Models (VLM). In NLP, Raffel et. al. [51] explored a unified framework\ncalled T5 where all text-based tasks are framed as text input to text output problems. T5 was trained\nwith a single objective function and supported a diverse set of tasks, like translation, question &\nanswering, and classification. FLAN [8] showed that language models trained on a collection of text\ntasks phrased as instructions, enabled models to respond better to similar instructions at inference\ntime. This TL technique showed performance improvement across a range of models, prompting\nsetups, and evaluation tasks. On the other hand, VLM incorporates visual information by combining\na language model and an image encoder to transfer knowledge across modalities. Tasks are framed\nas text and image input to text output problems. Captioning training consists of optimizing a text\ngeneration objective, and can transfer moderately well to visual question & answering in the zero-shot\nsettings. Examples include, Frozen [54], Flamingo [2], and other models [56, 54, 2, 44, 41]. But their\nperformance on close-ended tasks still lags behind contrastive models [49, 61]. In the audio domain,\nthere are no models that resemble any of these capabilities, let alone that support both close-ended\nand open-ended audio tasks simultaneously.\nIn this paper, we introduce Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model (ALM) that takes as input, an audio\nrecording and a text prompt, and generates free-form text as output. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe following contributions are achieved for the first time in the literature:\n\u2022 A novel Audio Language Model capable of supporting multiple close-ended and open-ended\naudio tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions of the architecture.\nPengi draws inspiration from VLM but tackles intrinsic challenges in the audio domain.\n\u2022 We propose a new learning framework where we frame all audio tasks as audio and text\ninput to text output tasks. Our framework uses a single training procedure and a caption-\ning objective function. For training, we designed new audio task templates inspired by\nInstruction Tuning.\n\u2022 We extensively evaluated Pengi on 21 downstream tasks across various audio domains\nyielding state-of-the-art performance in several of them. Thus, establishing a baseline for\ngeneral-purpose ALM.\n2\nRelated Work\nAudio Language Models. In the domain of audio processing, Transfer Learning has facilitated the\nrise of Self-Supervised Learning and Zero-Shot Learning techniques [52, 53, 45, 24, 27, 26, 3, 17,\n28, 25, 59, 60, 43, 13, 16, 18, 65, 10]. These approaches have led to the development of versatile\nmodels capable of tackling a wide array of tasks, while delivering SoTA performance. However,\ncurrent models can tackle either close-ended tasks or open-ended tasks. ALM pose a new learning\nparadigm for audio processing that can support all tasks. The language modeling approaches to audio\nfind utility in generating audio given an input description [4, 1]. But it is yet to be explored how to\ntrain them for general-purpose audio understanding and what their performance would be.\nLanguage Models. Transfer Learning has been extensively utilized in Natural Language Processing\nwith the recent shift to Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning [31, 50, 5, 57]. The work by Raffel et. al.\n[51] explored a unified framework for text tasks by converting all text-based tasks into the text-to-text\n2\nformat. The experimental results showed the methods can achieve SoTA results when combined and\nscaled. FLAN [57] released in 2022 uses instruction fine-tuning to fine-tune an existing language\nmodel on a large set of varied instructions. Pengi adapts a similar idea for the audio domain, where\neach audio-tasks is considered a text generation task conditional on the input text and input audio.\nThis allows audio tasks to be represented in (audio-text)-text format and enables learning a single\nunified model for all the tasks. For training, we created (audio-text)-text templates for audio tasks\nand trained Pengi with them.\nVisual Language Models. Inspired by the success of Transfer Learning and Few-Shot Learning\nin NLP, a host of VLM were proposed for vision tasks. VLM intend to extend the pre-trained\nlanguage model and adapt them to incorporate visual information. VisualBERT [37] and SimVLM\n[56] explored different ways to convert images into tokens and jointly train the model on interleaved\nimages and text. Inspired by prefix-tuning [38] and prompt-tuning [36], Frozen [54] and Clipcap\n[44], use a frozen language model and align the image embeddings for the language model. To better\nfuse image information, Flamingo [2] uses a gated-cross-attention dense layer in the language model.\nThe interleaved image-text training also enables Flamingo to do few-shot learning. Drawing parallels\nwith VLM, Pengi can be considered an ALM based on audio conditional prefix tuning where the\nprompt is produced by an audio encoder.\n3\nApproach\nIn this section, we describe Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by\nframing all audio tasks as text generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording and a text prompt,\nand generates free-form text as output. The unified architecture in Figure 2 enables open-ended\ntasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions of the\narchitecture.\n3.1\nUnified Architecture\nFigure 2:\nPengi has a unified architecture that takes as input, an audio recording and a text prompt, and\ngenerates free-form text as output. At training, the architecture learns an audio encoder a\u03d5 and a mapping\nnetwork m1 to represent an input audio as a sequence of continuous embeddings. A frozen text encoder g\u03c8 and\na learnable mapping m2 do the same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are concatenated as a\nprefix to leverage from a pre-trained frozen autoregressive language model f\u03b8 to perform multiple tasks. At\ninference, the language model generates tokens autoregressively conditioned on the audio and text input.\nAudio Encoder. The audio encoder a\u03d5 transforms the raw audio input into an audio embedding.\nWe used the audio transformer backbone from CLAP [17] as our audio encoder due to its success\nin diverse audio and multimodal tasks. Models in Computer Vision [44, 2, 41] use a frozen image\nencoder like CLIP, but CLAP is trained on a magnitude smaller collection of audio-text pairs.\nTherefore, we unfroze its weights for our training procedure.\n3\nText Encoder. The text encoder g\u03c8 transforms the input text prompt into a text embedding. The\nprompt can be any form of natural language, such as a task-specific prompt or a question. The\ntext encoder is frozen so its weights are not updated during training. The text encoder can be any\noff-the-shelf text encoder and allows our architecture to learn and perform well in close-ended tasks.\nMapping Networks and Prefix. To construct the prefix to be fed to the causal language model, we\nused two mapping networks (m1 and m2). The mapping networks [44] convert an embedding into a\nsequence of k embeddings. The audio embedding is transformed by m1 and the text embedding by\nm2, both are trainable. Both sequences are concatenated to form the fixed-length prefix.\nCausal Language Model. To generate the text output we used a pre-trained autoregressive causal\nlanguage model which is kept frozen during training and inference [54]. Even though the language\nmodel is frozen, the audio prefix receives gradients enabling the parameters of mapping network\n(m1) and audio encoder a\u03d5 to be optimized with gradient descent and backpropagation. At inference,\nthe language model generates tokens autoregressively conditioned on the audio and text prefix.\n3.2\nTraining and Inference\nWe propose a new learning framework where we frame all audio tasks as audio and text input to text\noutput tasks. Our framework uses a single training procedure and objective function. Let the training\ndata in audio-text-to-text format be referred to as {xi,ti,ci} where xi, ti and ci are the ith audio file,\nith input text, and ith output text or caption respectively.\nTo create a prefix, the audio encoder a\u03d5 and mapping network m1 projects the audio xi into a\nsequence of k embeddings. Similarly, the text encoder g\u03c8 and mapping network m2 projects the\ninput text ti into a sequence of k embeddings. Both sequences are concatenated to form prefix pi for\nthe pre-trained frozen language model f\u03b8.\npi = pi\n1, ..., pi\n2k = concat{m1(a\u03d5(xi)), m2(g\u03c8(ti))}\n(1)\nThe language model f\u03b8 is fed with the prefix-caption concatenation of all {zi}N\ni=1, where zi is:\nzi = pi\n1, ..., pi\n2k, ci\n1, ..., ci\nl\n(2)\nThe model is trained as a standard captioning system, where it learns to predict a caption (text tokens)\nci conditioned on the prefix in an autoregressive fashion. We used Cross-Entropy as the loss function:\nL = \u2212\nN\nX\ni=1\nl\nX\nj=1\nlog p\u03b3(ci\nj|pi\n1, ..., pi\n2k, ci\n1, ..., ci\nj\u22121)\n(3)\nwhere \u03b3 denotes model\u2019s trainable parameters which include audio encoder parameters \u03d5 and\nparameters from both mapping networks. The text encoder and the causal language model are frozen.\nAt inference time, the prefix is constructed using the test audio and a text prompt. The causal language\nmodel f\u03b8 generates the next token sequentially conditioned on the prefix. The language model assigns\nprobabilities to all vocabulary tokens at each prediction, which are used to determine the next token\ndepending on the choice of decoding. In our experiments, we used beam search decoding with a\nbeam size of 5 for inference and downstream tasks.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nTraining Datasets and Templates\nOur Audio Language Model Pengi is trained on a collection of audio-text tasks phrased as instruction\ntemplates. The templates are inspired by instruction tuning and enable models to respond better to\nsimilar instructions at inference time. This TL technique is novel for audio and yielded performance\nimprovement across a range of input prompting examples and downstream tasks.\nThe training datasets are modified to adapt to our proposed framework (audio-text)-to-text format by\nconstructing 8 audio-task templates. Before our study, there was no evidence that the templates could\nlead to good performance across open- and close-ended tasks. Each template consists of audio input,\ninput text prompt, and text output. Examples are \"this is the sound of\", \u201cthis emotion is\" or \u201cquestion:\n{question}\". All the templates are in Table 1, out of which one template is the Auxiliary task \u201cgenerate\nmetadata\". With it, we add audio-text pairs that are not task-specific. Drawing parallels, this training\ndata setup is inspired by instruction tuning format of FLAN [57, 8]. Defining new templates or\nvariations of the ones proposed here is a promising direction to explore.\n4\nTask\nInput prompt\nOutput format\nAudio\nCaptioning\ngenerate audio caption\n{caption}\nAudio\nQA\nquestion: {question}\n{answer}\nSound Event\nClassification\nthis is a sound of\n{event a}, {event b}, ..\nAcoustic Scene\nClassification\nthis acoustic scene is\n{scene}\nTask\nInput prompt\nOutput format\nSpeech Emotion\nRecognition\nthis emotion is\n{emotion}\nSpeech Sentiment\nRecognition\nthis sentiment is\n{sentiment}\nMusic\nAnalysis\nmusic analysis\nthis is a sound of music\nin language {language}\nand genre {genre} ..\nMusic\nNote Analysis\nthis music note is\nproduced by {instrument},\npitch {pitch}, ..\nAuxiliary\ngenerate metadata\n{metadata}\nTable 1: The training datasets are modified to adapt to our proposed framework (audio-text)-to-text format by\nconstructing 8 audio-task templates. Each template consists of audio input, input text prompt, and text output.\nThe {} symbol indicates variable content. The Auxiliary task template allowed us to add audio-text pairs that are\nnot task-specific.\nThe training data is collected from multiple audio datasets coming from different sources. In all, we\ncollected 3.4 million audio-text pairs and mapped them to the 8 templates. The number of training\npairs makes this model one of the largest if not the largest non-speech audio model in literature. We\nuse only the training set of each dataset. The datasets and their mapping to a task are the following.\nSound Event Classification: AudioSet [23], FSD50K[22]; Acoustic Scene Classification: CochlScene\n[29]; Speech Emotion and Sentiment Recognition: MSP Podcast [40], CMU MOSI [62], CMU\nMOSEI [63], MELD [48]; Music Analysis: NSynth [19], FMA [9]; Audio Captioning: AudioCaps\n[32], ClothoV2 [15]; Audio Question and Answering: ClothoAQA [39]; Auxiliary: WavText5K [12],\nSoundDescs [35], MACS [42], WavCaps [43], FreeSound [20] and FindSound2.\n4.2\nDownstream Tasks\nThe unified architecture of Pengi enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks.\nOpen-ended tasks. This task type requires free-form text generation and there is flexibility in the\ncorrectness of the output. Examples are Audio Captioning and AQ&A. Pengi will take as input the\ntesting audio and the desired prompt to generate the text output. It does not require any additional\nfine-tuning or task-specific components.\nClose-ended tasks. This task type is restricted to predefined values that can be classes or numbers.\nExamples are classification and retrieval. Pengi will take as input the testing audio and the desired\nprompt. Ideally, the free-form text output from Pengi should contain the exact predefined value. For\nexample, a predefined class is \u201cdog\" but Pengi may output \u201cdog barking\" or \u201ccanine\". Although\nthese answers are reasonable, they are incorrect under most metrics. To evaluate the correctness, we\nproposed two methods: Log-likelihood and Text matching (Fig. 3). Unless explicitly mentioned, all\nexperiments in our paper use the Text-matching method for evaluation.\nFigure 3: Text-matching method used during inference\nfor close-ended tasks. TE indicates Text Embedding.\nLog-likelihood: We take the concatenated prefix\nfrom a testing audio, the prompt, and append\none of the predefined values (e.g class name,\nnumber) to create a candidate output. We would\nhave N candidate outputs corresponding to N\npredefined values. For example in classification,\nif we have 100 testing audios and 5 classes, we\nwould have 5 output candidates per audio. The\noutputs and the predefined values are used to\ncompute Log-likelihood scores and determine\nthe model\u2019s prediction. This method is expen-\nsive for the extensive evaluation in our study.\nText-matching: In this setup, the free-form output is matched to the predefined values using text em-\nbeddings (Fig.3). For example, in a classification setting, we compute sentence-level text embeddings\nfor Pengi\u2019s output and for all the class labels in a given dataset. Then, we calculate cosine similarity\nto determine the model\u2019s prediction. We used Pengi\u2019s text encoder to compute the embeddings, but\nany off-the-shelf text encoder could be used.\n2https://www.findsounds.com\n5\nDownstream tasks. We used 21 downstream tasks (Table 2) to benchmark the open-ended and\nclose-ended capabilities of Pengi. The open-ended tasks consist of Audio Captioning and AQA.\nThe close-ended tasks consist of classification, regression, and retrieval. Datasets like Clotho have\nmore than one type of annotations, so they are used for multiple tasks like Audio Captioning and\nText-to-Audio Retrieval.\nDomain\nDataset\nFiles\nDur.

We used the audio transformer HTSAT[6] as our audio encoder and\nCLIP\u2019s [49] text encoder. The audio is sampled at 44.1 kHz and is converted to a log Mel spectrograms\nwith 64 Mel bins, a hop size of 320 ms, and a window size of 1024 ms in the range of 50-8000 Hz.\nWe randomly truncated all audio files to 7 seconds in length for HTSAT. The max length of the text\nencoder is set to 40 for computational efficiency. We performed another step of CLAP (Contrastive\nLanguage-Audio Pretraining) training using the above two encoders [17]. This enables experiments\nwhere the audio encoder can be kept frozen to see the utility of CLAP\u2019s [17] audio embeddings\nsimilar to VLM [44, 54, 2]. The mapping networks m1 and m2 each use an 8-layer transformer\nwith a prefix length of 40. The total prefix length after concatenating the audio and text is 80. The\nhyper-parameters of the encoders and the CLAP training are mostly left as in the original papers, the\ndetails are in Appendix D.\nCausal Language Model. We used the GPT2 line of models, specifically GPT2-base (124M). The\nmodel is kept frozen through all the experiments.\nPre-training. We used Adam Optimiser [34] for 60 epochs and with a batch size of 384 on 20 V100\nGPUs. We used a linear schedule with 2000 warmup steps and a base learning rate of 1e-4.\n5\nResults\n5.1\nBenchmarking Pengi\nWe assessed Pengi on 21 downstream tasks covering various domains. Pengi is the first audio model\nthat can perform both, open-ended and close-ended tasks. A fair comparison against another model\nthat can perform both is not possible. We chose CLAP [17] as the baseline because it is the only\nZero-Shot model with a comprehensive evaluation (16 downstream tasks). The next best evaluation\nwas only on 8 tasks. Thus, providing no evidence of performance across domains like speech and\nmusic, which tend to be the most difficult. Moreover, we compared against SoTA results even if it\ncame from different models and learning methods. We compared against SoTa Zero-Shot models\nin Table 8, a subset of Table 3, for Sound Event Classification.

Table 9, against\nSSL, supervised and trained on speech audio models.\nOpen-ended tasks. Pengi sets new state-of-the-art performance for open-ended tasks. We used\nAudio Captioning and AQA for open-ended tasks. The CLAP model can only support close-ended\ntasks and cannot perform open-ended tasks without additional modules and fine-tuning. Therefore,\nwe compared against supervised trained models in Section 5.2.\nClose-ended tasks. Pengi performs better than CLAP on most audio classification tasks, and can also\noutperform the literature. Although CLAP and Pengi employed different learning methods and used\na different amount of training data, it is to be noted that Pengi can compete with strong contrastive\nmethods like CLAP and other methods in the literature.\n5.2\nAudio Captioning and AQA\nAudio Captioning. Pengi\u2019s performance outperformed supervised models in the two captioning tasks\nAudioCaps and Clotho, as shown in Table 7. The captioning competition IEEE DCASE 2022 3 ranks\nmodels based on the metric SPIDEr, a combination of CIDEr and SPICE. Specifically, for AudioCaps\nPengi outperformed the literature by a relative 6.6% and for Clotho by a relative 26%. All models\nused both, AudioCaps and Clotho datasets in training. One of the best captioning models is from\nKim et al. [33]. The authors followed a similar training procedure to ours with audio encoders and\na language model. Unlike Pengi, which uses a single audio encoder, they employed two mapping\nnetworks to capture both global and temporal features from the audio. Despite having two audio\nrepresentations, the model underperformed our approach.\nSimilar to Multi-Task Learning [64, 11], we hypothesize that learning a shared audio encoder and\nmapping networks helps Pengi to solve individual tasks better. We addressed this hypothesis by\nconducting an ablation study in Table 4. In experiment A, we trained and evaluated Pengi only on\naudio-captioning data with text prompts of \u201cgenerate audio caption\". Then, we contrasted audio\ncaptioning performance against experiment B, where we trained on data across different tasks, in\nother words, our proposed setup in this paper. From Table 4, we see consistent improvement in both\nAudioCaps and Clotho downstream tasks. Specifically, experiment B outperforms experiment A by a\nrelative 2.5% and 2.3% on AudioCaps and Clotho respectively. This indicates that Pengi\u2019s shared\narchitecture does help in improving performance on individual tasks.\nAudio Captioning \u2191\nExp.\nEval.\ndataset\nBLUE1\nSPIDEr\nA\nAudioCaps\n0.6439\n0.4551\nB\nAudioCaps\n0.6912\n0.4667\nA\nClotho\n0.5619\n0.2648\nB\nClotho\n0.5702\n0.2709\nTable 4: Effect of shared audio\nencoder training\nAudio Q&A \u2191\nModel\nAcc\nM1\n0.575\nM2\n0.627\nM3\n0.635\nPengi\n0.645\nTable 5: AQ&A results\nText-to-Audio Retrieval \u2191\nModel\nRetr.\nR@1\nR@5\nR@10\nChen et al.\nClotho\n1.5\n4.4\n7.5\nGont. et al.\nClotho\n2.1\n7.0\n12.0\nMei et al.\nClotho\n4.0\n14.1\n21.6\nKim et al.\nClotho\n7.6\n19.6\n28.8\nSoham et al.\nClotho\n16.7\n41.0\n54.1\nPengi\nClotho\n9.4\n26.1\n36.7\nTable 6: T2A Retrieval results\n3https://dcase.community/challenge2022/task-automatic-audio-captioning\n7\nModel\nEval.\ndataset\nBLUE1\nBLUE2\nBLUE3\nBLUE4\nMETEOR\nROUGEL\nCIDEr\nSPICE\nSPIDEr\nChen et al.\nAudioCaps\n0.489\n0.292\n0.178\n0.106\n0.152\n0.346\n0.265\n0.093\n0.179\nGontier et al.\nAudioCaps\n0.635\n0.461\n0.322\n0.219\n0.208\n0.450\n0.612\n0.153\n0.383\nMei et al.\nAudioCaps\n0.682\n0.507\n0.369\n0.266\n0.238\n0.488\n0.701\n0.166\n0.434\nKim et al.\nAudioCaps\n0.708\n0.547\n0.402\n0.283\n0.238\n0.499\n0.710\n0.167\n0.438\nPengi\nAudioCaps\n0.691\n0.419\n0.371\n0.253\n0.232\n0.482\n0.752\n0.182\n0.467\nChen et al.\nClotho\n0.516\n0.325\n0.215\n0.141\n0.153\n0.350\n0.314\n0.102\n0.208\nGontier et al.\nClotho\n0.461\n0.282\n0.182\n0.117\n0.136\n0.318\n0.251\n0.083\n0.167\nMei et al.\nClotho\n0.516\n0.318\n0.204\n0.127\n0.157\n0.351\n0.313\n0.105\n0.209\nKim et al.\nClotho\n0.539\n0.346\n0.227\n0.142\n0.159\n0.366\n0.319\n0.111\n0.215\nPengi\nClotho\n0.57\n0.369\n0.242\n0.15\n0.172\n0.375\n0.416\n0.126\n0.271\nTable 7: Pengi outperforms the best Audio Captioning performance from supervised models. All models used\nboth, AudioCaps and Clotho datasets in training. SPIDEr is the metric used to rank models in IEEE DCASE\nChallenge. Higher is better for all metrics.\nAQA. Pengi outperformed the existing literature [39]. Authors in [39] collected the only dataset\navailable (ClothoAQA). They converted the AQA task into a classification task, instead of a generation\ntask. Authors trained and fine-tuned a model in a supervised setup. In contrast, we used the free-form\ntext from Pengi, where the answer is correct only when it directly matches the human response.\nNote that Pengi includes the training set of ClothoAQA among its training sets, but there is no\nfurther fine-tuning on this task. The results are shown in Table 5. The first column indicates three\ndifferent baseline models from [39]. Pengi achieved 64.5% and outperformed the existing supervised\nbenchmark by a relative 1.5%.\n5.3\nZero-Shot Sound Event Classification\nWe compared Pengi\u2019s classification performance against Zero-Shot contrastive models in the literature.\nThe existing literature restricts the training and evaluation tasks to a few sound event datasets. Hence,\nwe matched our comparisons to sound event datasets. The downstream datasets of ESC50, US8k,\nDCASE17 Task4 contain audio files and labels not seen by Pengi during training. We considered\nthese three datasets to constitute a zero-shot setup for Pengi. For FSD50k, the audio files in the\ntraining split have been used for training Pengi. Hence, we do not consider this a pure zero-shot setup\nbut nonetheless, report numbers for insights.\nOn Zero-Shot ESC50 performance, Pengi beats AudioCLIP [25], CLAP [17], and LAION CLAP\n[60] by 32%, 11%, and 1% respectively (See Table 8). Interestingly, human performance on ESC50\nis 81% accuracy and Pengi\u2019s performance is 92%. Mei et. al. [43] added ChatGPT augmented\naudio-text pairs to CLAP training [60] and showed an improvement in performance from 91% to 94%\non ESC50. On US8k, Pengi performed better than Wav2CLIP and AudioCLIP but lower than CLAP\nand LAION CLAP. Overall, even though Pengi is a text generation model, its Zero-Shot performance\non close-ended Sound Event Classification is competitive.\nZero-Shot Sound Event Classification \u2191\nModel\nESC50\nFSD50K\nUS8K\nDCASE17\nTask 4\nWav2CLIP\n0.414\n0.030\n0.404\n-\nAudioCLIP\n0.694\n-\n0.653\n-\nCLAP\n0.826\n0.302\n0.732\n0.3\nLAION\n0.91\n-\n0.77\n-\nPengi\n0.92\n0.468\n0.719\n0.338\nTable 8: The literature on Zero-Shot audio models only reports performance on Sound Event Classification\ndatasets. Pengi\u2019s classification performance is competitive. The \u2018-\u2019 indicates numbers are not available. The\nevaluation metric for DCASE17 is the F1 score while FSD50K employs mAP, ESC50 and US8K use Accuracy.\n5.4\nText-to-Audio Retrieval\nFor Text-to-Audio Retrieval in a contrastive learning setup, the user query is converted into a text\nembedding which is then used to retrieve the top k audios by their audio embeddings [12, 60]. Pengi\nis a generative model and does not allow a contrastive setup. Although Pengi has an audio encoder\nand a text encoder that could replicate the contrastive setup, we wanted to evaluate our model from\nthe generative perspective. First, Pengi is used to index a database by generating audio captions for\nall the audio recordings. Second, the user text query is matched directly to the dataset captions. The\nassociated audio files of the top k dataset captions are considered to be the top k retrieved audio.\nNote that the cosine similarity computation is between two text embeddings and not audio and text\nembeddings. Thus, the quality of generated captions for indexing the dataset is important for retrieval\nperformance.\n8\nIn Table 6, we compared Pengi\u2019s Text-to-Audio retrieval performance against the literature. The\nmodels used for comparison are audio captioning models using the above-described procedure of\nindexing and query matching, and not the contrastive-like setup. Pengi outperforms the literature on\nR@1. However, contrastive models [17],[60], [12] are substantially better than generative models for\nthe task of directly matching text to audio for retrieval. An example of contrastive model performance\nis shown in Table 6 as a gray row.\n5.5\nNext text-token prediction for learning audio representations\nPengi uses next-text token prediction to learn audio representations, hence a natural question is:\n\u201cCan next text-token prediction objective help in learning general purpose audio representations?\".\nTo answer this question, we performed linear probe [49] and shallow learning [55] experiments.\nAfter Pengi\u2019s pre-training, we took the audio encoder a\u03d5 in Fig 2 and trained one, two, or three\nfully-connected linear layer(s) with cross-entropy on top. Note that, we kept Pengi\u2019s audio encoder\nfrozen and it did not include the mapping network m1. We selected representative datasets from\nthe domain of Sound Events, Music, and Speech Emotion for the linear probe experiment. Pengi\u2019s\nlinear probe (one layer) and shallow learning (two or three layers) numbers are compared against the\nbest single model submissions from the HEAR challenge [55] in Table 9. The results from HEAR\nchallenge reported the maximum of both settings (L1 or L2, L3). Apart from Wav2vec2 which is\ntrained on speech data, all other models were trained on non-speech audio. Pengi\u2019s linear probe L1\nand L3 performance is consistently better than CLAP [17]. In the Sound Events and Music domain,\nPengi outperformed other models. In the Speech Emotion [14] domain, Pengi performed better than\nnon-speech models but lower than models trained on speech (Wav2vec2). The experiment indicates\nthat the next token prediction does help in learning audio representations useful for various domains.\nSound Events \u2191\nMusic \u2191\nSpeech Emotion \u2191\nModel\nESC50\nFSD50k\nGTZAN Genres\nOpera\nRAVDESS\nCREMA-D\nYAMNet\n0.8375\n-\n0.847\n0.9405\n0.479\n0.4533\nOpen L3\n0.7505\n0.4470\n0.879\n0.9746\n0.604\n0.5497\nWav2CLIP\n0.7589\n0.3617\n0.748\n0.9363\n0.684\n0.5116\nPaNN\n0.9085\n-\n0.860\n0.9112\n0.429\n0.5550\nWav2Vec2\n0.5610\n0.3417\n0.780\n0.9067\n-\n0.6562\nCLAP (L1)\n0.8995\n0.5024\n0.73\n0.6399\n0.4044\n0.2315\nCLAP (L3)\n0.9310\n0.5690\n0.8330\n0.8263\n0.4512\n0.2830\nPengi (ZS)\n0.9195\n0.4676\n0.3525\n0.6229\n0.2032\n0.1846\nPengi (L1)\n0.8915\n0.5608\n0.8000\n0.9193\n0.4774\n0.5057\nPengi (L3)\n0.9485\n0.6235\n0.9010\n0.9883\n0.6108\n0.5916\nTable 9: Shallow learning experiment where the audio encoder is frozen in all the experiments.

Unless specified, each model reports the best of L1, L2, and L3.\n6\nLimitations\nTrade-off between close-ended and open-ended tasks performance. The classification and text\ngeneration performance of Pengi is competitive against contrastive models. However, text-based\nretrieval performance lags behind that of contrastive models [12, 60]. Although these models excel\nat retrieval, they are limited to close-ended tasks. Thus, there is a trade-off between both types of\nlearning methods proposed so far in the literature.\nLimitations inherent to Language Models. Pengi benefits from the encyclopedic knowledge of\npre-trained Language Models (LM). However, as pretrained LM is a component of Pengi, they also\ninherit their limitations. For example, LM are known to hallucinate [30] and specific to Pengi, can\nproduce responses not grounded or conditioned on audio. Similarly, Pengi falls back to LM behavior\nif no audio is provided or if the audio knowledge is limited. Therefore, the risks of LM, namely\npropagating stereotypes, and biases and potentially producing offensive language are still applicable\nto Pengi. The recent works [50, 58] in the NLP field try to address these issues. However, specifically\nstudying risks and limitations can uncover new insights that can accelerate the development of ALMs.\n7\nConclusions\nWe proposed Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing\nall audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and a text prompt, and\ngenerates free-form text as output. Pengi is capable of handling both, close-ended and open-ended\naudio tasks. We benchmarked Pengi on 21 downstream tasks and show it yields SoTA performance\nin several of them. Our findings break ground in prompting language models with audio for general-\npurpose audio understanding.\n9\nReferences\n[1] A. Agostinelli, T. I. Denk, Z. Borsos, J. Engel, M. Verzetti, A.

In Section D, we discuss the contrastive model and its training details. In Section E, we\nevaluate Pengi\u2019s performance with the audio encoder kept frozen. In Section F, we analyze the effect\nof text encoder on zero-shot performance. In Section G, we analyze and highlight types of Pengi\nerrors. Lastly, in section H, we compare contrastive and generative pretraining.\nFigure 4: More examples of audio and text prompt input and their corresponding textual responses.\nImages are for illustration purposes only.\nFigure 5: The user can also add an additional second text input and guide the output of Pengi. For\nexample, the user can add \"in the background\" after the audio and text prefix and Pengi produces the\noutput \"a person is speaking\". Compared to Fig 2, the output of Pengi changes to what the user has\nprompted in the second text input which is about background sounds.\n14\nA\nAdditional text input\nPengi takes as input, an audio recording and text, and generates free-form text as output. During\ninference, an audio encoder a\u03d5 and a mapping network m1 represent each audio recording as a\nsequence of continuous embeddings. Similarly, a text encoder g\u03d5 and a mapping network m2 does\nthe same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a\npre-trained frozen language model f\u03b8. The language model generates tokens starting from the prefix.\nThe text input acts as task induction and helps guide the language model to produce the desired\noutput. Let\u2019s take an example of human speech recording. A text input of \"generate audio caption\"\nwill generate a caption like \"a person speaking with a car moving in the background\", while a text\ninput of \"this sentiment is\" will produce a response like \"negative\". However, there are instances\nwhere we want to guide the language model further to answer or complete a specific query we\nhad. We can do this by additional text input. This is depicted in Fig 5. The second text input gets\ntokenized by the frozen language model\u2019s tokenizer and converted into continuous embedding by the\nfrozen language model\u2019s embedding function. Therefore, the new prefix consists of a sequence of\nembeddings associated with audio, first text input, and second text input which originates from the\naudio encoder, text encoder, and frozen language model\u2019s embedding function respectively.\nSome examples and the effects of the second text input are shown in Fig 6. Empirically, we have seen\nthe additional second input produces meaningful output only when used with text input of \"generate\nmetadata\". The examples shown in Fig 6 are cherry-picked. The additional text input often causes\nPengi to lose track of the audio data and hallucinate its own text or fall back to frozen language model\nbehavior. It is not clear how to ground the output in audio information when additional text input\nis provided. Further investigation in this direction will enable new scenarios including in-context\nlearning.\nFigure 6: Examples of audio-text input with additional text input and their corresponding textual\nresponses. Images are for illustration purposes only. The \u2018-\u2019 symbol indicates additional text input\nwas not used.\nB\nInferring audio prefix\nThe audio encoder and text encoder followed by mapping networks, jointly forms the prefix which\nprompts the frozen language model. To understand more about Pengi\u2019s natural language response,\nwe try to interpret prefixes as a sequence of tokens or words. Each prefix embedding is mapped to\nthe highest similarity token from the GPT2 vocabulary [44]. The similarity method used is cosine\nsimilarity. This is possible as the prefix and GPT2 embeddings occupy the same latent space. We\n15\nuse this method on a few examples from the ESC50 dataset [47]. The examples of Pengi\u2019s generated\noutput and the inferred audio prefix are shown in Table 10. The interpretations are hard to follow but\ndo contain salient words that are related to audio content. For example, each inferred audio prefix\ncontains words associated with content of audio like babies, thunder, chicken, etc which also appear\nin corresponding Pengi\u2019s natural language output.\nOne reason interpreted prefix does not have a clear structure is that the mapping network has to do\ntwo things at once - comprehend both the audio and text input and guide the fixed language model.\nMokady et. al.[44] observed that the interpreted prefix is more comprehensible when GPT2 is also\nfine-tuned. A similar method can be followed to infer the text input prefix, but we didn\u2019t find any\ninterpretable insights there.\nText output\nInferred audio prefix\na baby is crying loudly and loudly\nand, the my\u2019s the first the and and fixme the the supern the. coma\nthe BST in in improvis the babies in in the noises from noises\nin the ( the the and innovative for\na thunder claps and then a thunderstorm hits\nand- the bigHUD the the the and as\"]\nthe theth P the. weather the close andscape. thunder in- the\nAudiostorms interview click in the the and i unsettling,\na rooster is crowing loudly\nand at the newone the new the and to OUR the theron the. chickens\ntheities the in imperson the chickens to in the Audio sitcom.\nchickens in the ( the the, Mumbai the\na bird is singing in the background\nand, the great bird the first the and and OUR the the number La\nthe in bird the one great and photography and bird that. in\nAudio owl interview singing being: the and I innovative,\nTable 10: Examples of Pengi output and their corresponding inferred audio prefix. The input text prompt is\n\"generate audio caption\" for all examples. We bold the salient words relating to the input audio and text output.\nC\nEffect of text prompts\nThe choice of input text prompt changes Pengi\u2019s downstream task performance. We analyze the\nperformance of seven of the input text prompts defined in Section 4.1 for downstream tasks. For some\ntasks, only specific prompts are applicable, for example, \u2018question: {}\u2019 prompt for AQA and \u2018this\nemotion is\u2019 for emotion recognition. Pengi\u2019s performance on each downstream task corresponding to\nthe different input text prompts is shown in Table 11). In summary, we see that the prompt \u2018generate\nmetadata\u2019 works well on average for close-ended downstream tasks.\nText prompts \u2191\nDownstream\nDataset\nquestion:\n{}\ngenerate audio\ncaption\ngenerate\nmetadata\nthis is a\nsound of\nthis acoustic\nscene is\nthis music\nnote is\nthis emotion\nis\nClotho Cap.\n-\n0.2709\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAudioCaps Cap.\n-\n0.4667\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nClothoAQA\n0.6453\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nESC50\n-\n0.8870\n0.9195\n0.6910\n-\n-\n-\nFSD50k\n-\n0.4676\n0.4504\n0.4572\n-\n-\n-\nUS8k\n-\n0.7185\n0.6585\n0.5731\n-\n-\n-\nDCASE17\n-\n0.3150\n0.3143\n0.3506\n-\n-\n-\nAudioSet\n-\n0.1216\n0.1230\n0.1635\n-\n-\n-\nTUT 2017\n-\n0.2562\n0.3525\n0.2216\n0.1716\n-\n-\nGTZAN Genres\n-\n0.3230\n0.3420\n0.3180\n-\n-\n-\nGTZAN MS\n-\n0.9440\n0.9606\n0.9922\n-\n-\n-\nOpera\n-\n0.2373\n0.6229\n0.4449\n-\n-\n-\nNSynth Instrument\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.5007\n-\nNSynth Pitch\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.8676\n-\nNSynth Velocity\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.3728\n-\nNSynth Qualities\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.3860\n-\nRAVDESS\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.1846\nCREMAD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.2032\nVocal Sounds\n-\n0.5778\n0.6035\n0.5688\n-\n-\n-\nSESA\n-\n0.5162\n0.5402\n0.5350\n-\n-\n-\nESC50 Actions\n-\n0.5277\n0.5111\n0.4846\n-\n-\n-\nClotho Ret.

The metrics used for each downstream tasks are same as Table 3.\n16\nD\nConstrastive Learning model details\nWe follow and train a CLAP [17] model for the choice of contrastive model used in our experiments.\nWe use transformer-based audio and text encoder. The audio encoder is HTSAT [6] and the text\nencoder is from CLIP [49]. Both the encoders are followed by a linear transformation called the\nprojection layer. We finetune both the encoder and their projection layers. After contrastive training,\nthe audio encoder and text encoder are used in Pengi.\nConsider a batch size of N. Let the audio and text embedding be represented by Et \u2208 RN\u00d7d and\nEa \u2208 RN\u00d7d. Then the resulting similarity matrix C is:\nC = \u03c4(Et \u00b7 Ea\nT )\n(4)\nWe use the loss function (L) of symmetric cross-entropy: projections\nL = 0.5(\u2113text(C) + \u2113audio(C))\n(5)\nwhere \u2113k = 1\nN\nPN\ni=0 log diag(softmax(C)) along text and audio axis respectively.\nimplementation details. The audio is sampled at 44.1 kHz and is converted to a log Mel spectrogram\nwith 64 Mel bins, a hop size of 320 secs, and a window size of 1024 secs in the range of 50-8000 Hz.\nWe randomly truncate all audio files to 7 seconds in length for HTSAT. All models are trained with\nAdam Optimiser [34] for 45 epochs with a batch size of 1536 on 20 V100 GPUs. We use a linear\nschedule with 2000 warmup steps and a base learning rate of 1e-4.\nResults. To verify the training, we check our CLAP\u2019s performance on the ESC50 dataset.

We used the audio\ntransformer backbone from CLAP trained in Section D as our audio encoder in our experiments. In\nComputer Vision, Visual Language Models [44, 2, 41] use an image encoder from CLIP [49] which is\nfrozen throughout experiments. However, there is a magnitude order difference in data collection of\nimage-text vs audio-text pairs. Therefore, for Pengi we train the audio encoder as well. Nonetheless,\nwe report numbers on Pengi\u2019s performance if the audio encoder is kept frozen. The results are shown\nin Table 13.

All other downstream tasks use Accuracy.\nF\nEffect of text encoder\nPengi\u2019s architecture in Figure 2 consists of a text encoder g\u03c8 that transforms the input text into\ntext embeddings. Then a mapping network m2 converts these embeddings into a sequence of k\nembeddings. A natural question that arises here is \"Why is an explicit mapping needed for input\ntext?\". We conducted two experiments to evaluate the effect of omitting m2 and/or the text encoder.\nWe denote Exp A as Pengi without the text encoder and m2 (input text directly to LM), and Exp B as\nPengi without the text encoder but with m2 (input text to m2). In Exp A, we found that removing\nresulted in a loss of coherence between the input text prompt and the output text. For example, an\ninput prompt about identifying an emotion class \"the emotion is \" resulted in random text output\nand thus random performance. In Exp B, we removed the text encoder but retained m2. The Exp B\narchitecture is depicted in Fig 7 and its results are shown in Table 14. By removing the text encoder,\nthe model performs slightly lower than the proposed architecture with both components.\nFigure 7: Pengi architecture without the text encoder g\u03c8. The text prompt is tokenized and embedded\nby text embedder, followed by the mapping network m2.

The \u2018\u2717\u2019 indicates that\nthe model cannot support the task. Higher is better for all numbers. The evaluation metric is mAP for FSD50k,\nAudioSet, ESC50-Actions, and NSynth sonic; F1 score for DCASE17; and SPIDEr for AudioCaps and Clotho\ncaptioning. All other downstream tasks use Accuracy.\nG\nDifferent type of Pengi errors\nThere are three types of errors that lead to a drop in Pengi\u2019s performance. We categorize them into\naudio concept errors, hierarchy errors, and text-matching errors.\nAudio concept errors. These types of errors are when the model gets the base audio concepts wrong.\nFor example, while generating an audio caption, the model predicts it as \"a sound of a dog barking in\na neighboring field\" instead of \"a sound of door knocks with cars moving nearby\". This indicates the\nmodel fails to detect the sound event of a door knock and confuses it with dog barking. These are\nPengi model errors stemming from the audio encoder.\nHeirarchy errors. The hierarchy error comes from a mismatch between Pengi\u2019s model prediction\nand the target domain classification. For example, in classifying sound events, Pengi predicts the\nsound as \"domestic sounds\", however for ESC50, the target classification requires a more fine-grained\nclassification within domestic sounds like Vaccum cleaner, Toilet flush, brushing teeth, etc. If text\nmatching is used for classification, then the model will not be able to categorize \"domestic sounds\"\ninto any of the fine-grained classes. To solve this error and get a more fine-grained response, we can\nuse improved text prompts or switch to the log-likelihood method.\nText-matching errors. The text-matching errors are the errors that result from the text embeddings or\nthe text-matching method used. This means depending on the text embedding and similarity method\nused, the performance of Pengi on close-ended tasks will change.\nH\nConstrastive Learning and Generative Pretraining\nWe compare our model Pengi with CLAP [17], a state-of-the-art Zero-Shot model that has been\nevaluated on 16 downstream tasks. However, CLAP is trained on a smaller amount of audio-text data.\nThis leads us to ask: \u201cIs the improved performance due to the larger training data or the generative\npretraining?\u201d. We already know that generative pretraining allows us to perform open-ended tasks\nlike Audio Captioning, AQA, which are not possible with contrastive models. But this does not tell\nus if: generative pretraining is beneficial for close-ended tasks like classification?. To answer this\nquestion, we train a CLAP model with the same data 4.1) that we use to train Pengi. We call this\nmodel CLAP*.\nResults. The results are shown in Table 15. We see generative pertaining (Pengi) outperforming\ncontrastive learning (CLAP*) on average. Moreover, with generative pretraining, the model can\nperform open-ended tasks like Audio Captioning and Audio Question Answering.\nAn interesting observation is Pengi outperforms human performance (81%) on ESC50. Humans\nhave limitations inherent to how much information a participant can handle at once. In the case of\nESC50, humans listen to the audio once, and have to remember the audio content, task description,\nand choose among 50 different classes. Moreover, listeners have different degrees of familiarity with\nprototypical content from different sound classes, whereas Pengi has been exposed to similar content\nduring training. In a sense, Pengi is an expert listener, whereas the humans in the listening experiment\nwere not.\n19\n"

    "text": "Scaling laws for language encoding models in fMRI\nRichard J. Antonello\nDepartment of Computer Science\nThe University of Texas at Austin\nrjantonello@utexas.edu\nAditya R. Vaidya\nDepartment of Computer Science\nThe University of Texas at Austin\navaidya@utexas.edu\nAlexander G. Huth\nDepartments of Computer Science and Neuroscience\nThe University of Texas at Austin\nhuth@cs.utexas.edu\nAbstract\nRepresentations from transformer-based unidirectional language models are known\nto be effective at predicting brain responses to natural language. However, most\nstudies comparing language models to brains have used GPT-2 or similarly sized\nlanguage models. Here we tested whether larger open-source models such as those\nfrom the OPT and LLaMA families are better at predicting brain responses recorded\nusing fMRI. Mirroring scaling results from other contexts, we found that brain\nprediction performance scales logarithmically with model size from 125M to 30B\nparameter models, with \u223c15% increased encoding performance as measured by\ncorrelation with a held-out test set across 3 subjects. Similar logarithmic behavior\nwas observed when scaling the size of the fMRI training set. We also characterized\nscaling for acoustic encoding models that use HuBERT, WavLM, and Whisper,\nand we found comparable improvements with model size. A noise ceiling analysis\nof these large, high-performance encoding models showed that performance is\nnearing the theoretical maximum for brain areas such as the precuneus and higher\nauditory cortex. These results suggest that increasing scale in both models and data\nwill yield incredibly effective models of language processing in the brain, enabling\nbetter scientific understanding as well as applications such as decoding.\nLarge language models have come to dominate the field of AI due to incredible capabilities that range\nfrom reasoning [1] to code generation [2] to even predicting how a human brain would respond to\nlanguage [3]. Rapid improvement in these abilities has largely been driven by scale: the most capable\nmodels today use nearly identical architectures to early transformer language models [4], but have\norders of magnitude more parameters and larger training data [5]. Overall, model capabilities\u2013often\nmeasured as zero-shot performance across a range of language tasks\u2013tend to scale logarithmically\nwith the number of model parameters [6, 7], suggesting that improvements will continue as model\nscale increases. Here we test whether these scaling \u201claws\u201d hold for the task of modeling the human\nbrain.\nThe human brain is the quintessential language processing system, but there is still much to learn\nabout how it processes and represents language. One paradigm used for this purpose is the encoding\nmodel: given measured brain responses to natural language, construct a model that predicts those\nresponses from the natural language stimulus [8\u201319]. If an encoding model is able to accurately\npredict brain responses across a range of new stimuli, then that model must use similar representations\nto the brain. High-performing encoding models can then be interpreted to gain insight into the brain\u2019s\ncomputations [20\u201322] or the function of different brain areas [11, 23\u201325]. The highest performance\nis currently offered by encoding models that are based on large language models such as GPT-2\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2305.11863v4  [cs.CL]  30 Jan 2024\nXL [26]. To build an encoding model, a language model is fed the same language stimuli that the\nhuman subject is hearing or reading. The internal states at each layer of the language model are\nthen extracted, yielding contextual embeddings that capture semantic and syntactic properties of\nthe stimuli [27]. These embeddings are then entered into a linear regression model that predicts the\nhuman brain responses, often measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nThough text-based language models are the norm, language encoding models have increasingly\nbeen trained with acoustic features derived from audio-based neural networks [28\u201334]. Models like\nHuBERT [35] are able to derive phonetic, lexical, and semantic properties by learning from unlabeled\nwaveforms or annotated transcripts [36]. Even when trained with human-plausible amounts of\ntraining data, these models can be more effective than language models in predicting brain responses\nin low-level speech processing areas such as the auditory cortex [31]. While earlier works examined\nthe utility of several self-supervised audio models in brain encoding, newer models have since been\nreleased with substantially increased training data and speech recognition performance.\nIn this paper, we study whether encoding models for fMRI benefit from scaling neural network model\nparameters and datasets to the same degree as other tasks. We show that using contextual embeddings\nfrom larger language models can increase the prediction performance of encoding models by 15%\nover smaller counterparts. Larger acoustic models improve similarly with model size, showing\nlargest improvements in auditory cortex and in higher-level areas. Finally, encoding performance for\nboth model types scales logarithmically with the amount of fMRI training data from each subject,\ndemonstrating an increasing need for very large fMRI datasets. These new state-of-the-art encoding\nmodels may enable a new frontier in the study of biological language comprehension and may provide\ndeeper insight into the mechanisms that the brain uses to reason about and employ natural language.\n2\nMethods\n2.1\nLanguage models and speech audio models\nDecoder-only transformer architectures have become dominant in recent years for language modeling\n[37]. For semantic encoding, we used representations from two families of large decoder-only\nTransformer language models, OPT [38] and LLaMA [39]. From the OPT family we used the\npretrained 125 million, 1.3 billion, 13 billion, 30 billion, 66 billion, and 175 billion parameter models.\nFrom the LLaMA family, we used the pretrained 33 billion and 66 billion parameter models.\nHuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 [35, 40] have been previously used to study auditory perception in the\nbrain [29, 31, 33]. Both are trained to learn representations from unlabeled audio. WavLM [41]\nextends the HuBERT paradigm with data augmentation and also adds new data sources to increase\nthe total training dataset size. Whisper [42] is a family of encoder-decoder models that use 680,000\nhours of weakly-labeled audio \u2013 an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets \u2013 to reach\nstate-of-the-art speech recognition performance. In this work, we used the pretrained Base, Large,\nand X-Large variants of HuBERT; the Base+ and Large variants of WavLM; and multilingual variants\nof the Tiny, Base, Small, Medium, and Large Whisper models.\nTable 1 shows the architecture details for all neural network models used in this work.\n2.2\nMRI data\nWe used publicly available functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from 3\nhuman subjects as they listened to 20 hours of English language podcast stories over Sensimetrics S14\nheadphones [43, 44]. Stories came from podcasts such as The Moth Radio Hour, Modern Love, and\nThe Anthropocene Reviewed. Each 10-15 minute story was played during a separate scan. Subjects\nwere not asked to make any responses, but simply to listen attentively to the stories. For encoding\nmodel training, each subject listened to roughly 95 different stories, giving 20 hours of data across 20\nscanning sessions, or a total of \u223c33,000 datapoints for each voxel across the whole brain. For model\ntesting, the subjects listened to two test stories 5 times each, and one test story 10 times, at a rate of 1\ntest story per session. These test responses were averaged across repetitions.\nDetails of the MRI methods can be found in the original publications [43, 44], but important points\nare summarized here. MRI data were collected on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner at The University of\nTexas at Austin Biomedical Imaging Center using a 64-channel Siemens volume coil. Functional\nscans were collected using a gradient echo EPI sequence with repetition time (TR) = 2.00 s, echo\ntime (TE) = 30.8 ms, flip angle = 71\u00b0, multi-band factor (simultaneous multi-slice) = 2, voxel size\n= 2.6mm x 2.6mm x 2.6mm (slice thickness = 2.6mm), matrix size = 84x84, and field of view =\n2\nTable 1: Model architecture summary.\nLANGUAGE MODELS\nFamily\nLayers\nWidth\nParameters\nOPT [38]\n12\n768\n125M\n24\n2048\n1.3B\n40\n5120\n13B\n48\n7168\n30B\n64\n9216\n66B\n96\n12288\n175B\nLLaMA [39]\n60\n6656\n33B\n80\n8192\n66B\nAUDIO MODELS\nFamily\nLayers\nWidth\nParameters\nWhisper [42] a\n4\n384\n8M\n6\n512\n21M\n12\n768\n88M\n24\n1024\n307M\n32\n1280\n637M\nHuBERT [35]\n12\n768\n95M\n24\n1024\n317M\n48\n1280\n964M\nWavLM [41]\n12\n768\n95M\n24\n1024\n317M\naWhisper counts include only the encoder.\n220 mm. Anatomical data were collected using a T1-weighted multi-echo MP-RAGE sequence with\nvoxel size = 1mm x 1mm x 1mm.\nAll subjects were healthy and had normal hearing. The experimental protocol used by [43, 44] was\napproved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Texas at Austin. Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all subjects.\nIn addition to motion correction and coregistration [43], low frequency voxel response drift was\nidentified using a 2nd order Savitzky-Golay filter with a 120 second window and then subtracted\nfrom the signal. To avoid onset artifacts and poor detrending performance near each end of the scan,\nresponses for training data were trimmed by removing 20 seconds (10 volumes) at the beginning\nand end of each scan, which removed the 10-second silent period and the first and last 10 seconds of\neach story. Test responses were trimmed by an additional 80 seconds (40 volumes) to account for an\nfMRI artifact (see Section 3.5). The mean response for each voxel was subtracted and the remaining\nresponse was scaled to have unit variance.\n2.3\nEncoding model construction\nWe used the fMRI data to estimate voxelwise brain encoding models for natural language using the\nintermediate hidden states of the various language and speech models discussed in Section 2.1. First,\nactivations for each word in the stimulus text were extracted from each layer of each LM. In order\nto temporally align word times with TR times, we applied Lanczos interpolation together with a\nfinite impulse response model [43]. Previous hidden state extraction methods (e.g. [23]) involved\nextracting the hidden state at the last token of the final word from a fresh context of fixed length\nof N tokens. This method requires N forward passes through the model in order to compute the\nhidden state for a single word. As this is impractical for models over a certain size, we improved\ncomputational efficiency here using a dynamically-sized context window. For a given story, contexts\nwere grown until they reached 512 tokens, then reset to a new context of 256 tokens. More formally,\nthe hidden state for token i, H(i) is defined as\nH(i) =\n(\n\u03b8\n\u0000X(0,i)\n\u0001\ni \u2264 512\n\u03b8\n\u0010\nX(256\u230a\ni\n256\u230b\u2212256,i)\n\u0011\ni > 512\nwhere X(j,k) is the context of the tokenized story X from the token at index j to the token at index k\nand \u03b8 is the function parameterized by the language model. This allowed hidden state extraction for\nmost tokens to be completed with a single forward pass per token, rather than N forward passes as in\nprevious methods. Differing tokenization schemes for handling whitespace across language models\npresented a challenge for consistent evaluation and were handled on a case-by-case basis.\nUnlike the analyzed language models, the audio models used are bi-directional, so we must use a\nfresh context to preserve the causality of the extracted features. We windowed the stimulus waveform\nwith a sliding window of size 16 s and stride 100 ms before feeding it into model. At each layer, we\n3\nuse the hidden state of the final token as the model\u2019s representation for the window. As Whisper\nfollows an encoder-decoder architecture, we only use states from the encoder, since it operates only\non the waveform. We then downsample the features as before with Lanczos interpolation.\nLet f(H(S)) indicate a linearized ridge regression model that uses a temporally transformed version\nof the language model hidden states H(S) as predictors. The temporal transformation accounts for\nthe lag in the hemodynamic response function [9, 45]. We use time delays of 2, 4, 6, and 8 seconds of\nthe representation to generate this temporal transformation. For each subject s, voxel v, and language\nmodel layer hi, we fit a separate encoding model f v,s\nhi to predict the BOLD response \u02c6B from our\nembedded stimulus, i.e. \u02c6B(x,v,hi) = f v,s\nhi (Hi(S)). Encoding model performance for a given layer\nwas computed as the average voxelwise performance of that layer\u2019s hidden states across of all of\ncortex for all of our 3 subjects. For all figures with cortical flatmaps, we present the flatmap for one\nsubject. Cortical flatmaps showing results for the other two subjects are shown in Section F of the\nsupplement.\n2.4\nStacked regression\nA unified \u201coptimized\u201d encoding model combining the LLaMA language model and Whisper audio\nmodel was computed using an adaptation of the stacked regression approach from Lin et al. [46]. For\nevery even-numbered non-embedding layer l in the Whisper model, as well as the 18th layer of the\n33 billion LLaMA model, we held-out \u223c20% of the training data and built an encoding model using\nthe remaining \u223c80% of the training data. This was repeated for each of 5 folds. The predictions of\nthese encoding models on the 5 folds of held-out training data were concatenated to generate full\nheld-out predictions of the training data, f v,s\nhl\n\u0010\nx(i)\nhl\n\u0011\n. After this cross validation procedure, we build\na covariance matrix for each voxel v and subject s, Rv,s of the residuals such that\nRv,s\np,q =\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u0010\nyv,s \u2212 f v,s\nhp\n\u0010\nx(i)\nhp\n\u0011\u0011 \u0010\nyv,s \u2212 f v,s\nhq\n\u0010\nx(i)\nhq\n\u0011\u0011\nwhere n is the total number of time points and yv,s is the ground truth BOLD response for voxel v\non subject s. We then optimize the quadratic problem min\u03b1v,s\u03b1v,s\u22a4Rv\u03b1v,s such that \u03b1v,s\nhj > 0 and\nPk\nj=1 \u03b1v,s\nhj = 1 with a quadratic program solver [47] to get a convex set of attributions \u03b1v,s which\nserve as weights for each feature space in the joint encoding model. This yields the final encoding\nmodel\n\u02c6yv,s =\nk\nX\nj=1\n\u03b1v,s\nhj f v,s\nhj (xj)\nwhere k is the number of feature spaces. As a final step, we validate this stacked encoding model\nindependently using a held-out validation set and build a final encoding model that uses the stacked\nprediction for voxels where the stacked approach is significantly better on this validation set and uses\nthe prediction from the 18th layer of LLaMA otherwise.\nTo determine which layers of the model are used to model each voxel, we computed voxelwise\nattribution center-of-mass. For each of the \u03b1v,s, the center-of-mass attribution C(\u03b1v,s) is computed\nas\nC(\u03b1v,s) =\nm\nX\ni=1\ni\u03b1v,s\nhi ,\nwhere m is the total number of Whisper layers used in the stacked attribution. This allows us to\nsummarize whether the attributions are primarily weighted on the earlier or later layers of the network\nfor that voxel.\n2.5\nNoise ceiling computation\nData from brain recordings such as fMRI are inherently noisy, so it is useful to distinguish response\nvariance that could potentially be explained by some model from noise variance that cannot be\nexplained. We estimated the amount of explainable variance, or noise ceiling, using the averaged\nresponses from the test story with 10 repeats and the method of Schoppe et al. [48]. The maximum\ncorrelation coefficient of the ideal encoding model is estimated as CCmax =\n\u0010q\n1 + 1\nN \u00d7 NP\nSP\n\u0011\u22121\n,\n4\nSemantic\nSpeech\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\nFigure 1: Scaling laws of Semantic and Speech Audio Encoding Models - Figures 1a and 1b show\nlogarithmic scaling of semantic encoding model performance with number of parameters and number\nof stories. Figure 1c shows average voxelwise r2 for each layer of all tested models averaged across\n3 subjects. Figures 1d, 1e, and 1f show analogous results for speech audio models. Error bars for\nFigures 1b and 1e denote standard error across bootstraps. Error bars for Figures 1c and 1f denote\nSNR-normalized subject-axis standard error. r2 is computed as |r| \u2217 r.\nwhere N is the number of repeats of our test data, NP is the noise power or unexplainable variance,\nand SP is the signal power or the amount of variance that could in principle be explained by the ideal\npredictive model. Using these estimates, we can then extract a normalized correlation coefficient\nCCnorm =\nCCabs\nCCmax , where CCabs is the product-moment correlation coefficient of the model\u2019s\npredictions against the ground truth fMRI responses. In some voxels, random noise can cause\nCCabs > CCmax, leading to CCnorm estimates greater than one. To regularize CCnorm estimates\nfor noisy voxels we set CCmax values smaller than 0.25 to 0.25. The normalized correlations\nCCnorm are only used for the noise ceiling analysis in Figure 3. All other reported correlations are\nuncorrected (CCabs). For brain map visualizations we only show voxels with CCmax > 0.35.\n2.6\nCompute specifications\nThe generation of the encoding models presented in this paper required significant computational\nresources. Ridge regression was performed using compute nodes with 128 cores (2 AMD EPYC\n7763 64-core processors) and 256GB of RAM. In total, roughly 4,000 node-hours of compute was\nexpended. Feature extraction from language and speech models was performed on specialized GPU\nnodes that were the same as the previously-described compute nodes but with 3 NVIDIA A100 40GB\ncards. Feature extraction required roughly 200 node-hours of compute on these GPU nodes.\n3\nResults\n3.1\nScaling laws for semantic encoding models\nEncoding models were fit for each of three subjects using roughly 20 hours of fMRI training data.\nFor the 125 million parameter OPT model we also fit encoding models using varying amounts of\ntraining data in order to study the effect of training data size on encoding model performance. To\ncapture encoding model performance, we compute the average prediction performance across all\nvoxels in the cortex of each subject.\nFigure 1a shows the relationship between language model size, measured as number of parameters,\nand encoding performance, measured as percent change in average prediction performance across\nall voxels in cortex relative to the smallest model. For consistent comparison, we only compare\nbetween the six model sizes from the OPT family. The layer that performed best for each model\nsize was used. The result shows approximately logarithmic scaling of encoding performance with\nmodel size. For each order of magnitude increase in the number of parameters in the language, the\nencoding performance of the average subject increases by roughly 4.4%. However, this logarithmic\nrelationship (r = 0.91) tapers off to a plateau for models in excess of \u223c30 billion model parameters.\n5\nEncoding Performance (R)\nr=0.75\nr=0.80\nr=0.75\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTR\n0\nZ-scored Response\nVoxel 25558\nAG\nVoxel 80037\nVoxel 55879\nVoxel 42921\nVoxel 15032\nAG\nPrCu\nPFC\nAC\nBroca\nAG\nPrCu\nBroca\nAC\nPFC\n1\n2\n3\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTR\n0\nZ-scored Response\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTR\n0\nZ-scored Response\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTR\n0\nZ-scored Response\nr=0.76\nr=0.76\nFigure 2: Large-scale encoding models - Performance of an encoding model built using OPT-30B\non 20 hours of training data from a single subject. Surrounding plots show model predictions (red)\nagainst the average response (dashed black) over 10 separate trials (gray) on a held-out natural\nlanguage test stimulus for selected voxels (Clockwise from bottom left: Well-predicted voxels from\nfusiform body area (FBA), Broca\u2019s area, precuneus, prefrontal cortex, and secondary auditory cortex.)\nOnly voxels with CCmax > 0.35 are shown. (PFC = prefrontal cortex, PrCu = precuneus, AC =\nauditory cortex/Wernicke\u2019s area, AG = angular gyrus)\nWe hypothesize this is an effect of the increased hidden state size that larger models possess, combined\nwith limitations in our dataset size. Each encoding model was fit using the same 33,000 data points.\nAs the models grow wider, the regression problem becomes more ill-conditioned. When FIR delays\nare added, models past the 30B parameter threshold have more hidden states than there are data points\nto train the regression, which lowers encoding performance. Further analysis of the relationship\nbetween dataset size and model size is provided in Section E in the supplement.\nFigure 1b shows the relationship between the number of training stories (roughly proportional\nto total training data) and encoding performance on OPT-125M (layer 9). Here we see a strong\nlogarithmic relationship between training data size and encoding performance. Each time the number\nof training stories increases by an order of magnitude, the encoding performance of the average\nsubject increases by 122%. This strong relationship (r = 0.989) gives compelling support to the\nusefulness of collecting \u201cdeep\u201d datasets that focus on collecting a greater amount of data from a few\nsubjects rather than a smaller amount of data from many subjects.\nFigure 1c shows the encoding performance for each layer of each LM. The LLaMA models are\nmarginally better at encoding than the OPT models, and also have a different pattern, with peak\nperformance in relatively early layers followed by slow decay. In contrast, the OPT models have\nmaximum performance with layers that are roughly 3/4 into the model. This mirrors results in other\nGPT-like models [3, 49]. This divergence from the typical pattern may warrant further study into\nthe underlying mechanisms that define these trendlines. We suspect that the larger training set of the\nLLaMA models (1.4T tokens) over the OPT models (180B tokens) may explain its better encoding\nperformance.\n3.2\nScaling laws for speech audio encoding models\nWe trained encoding models of increasing sizes from three families of audio models: HuBERT,\nWavLM, and Whisper. Encoding models were fit using an identical procedure as with the LMs in\nSection 3.1 \u2013 individually for three subjects, with roughly 20 hours of training data. We repeat the\nanalyses from Section 3.1 on the audio models to examine the importance of model size and training\ndataset size on encoding performance.\n6\nFigure 1d shows how audio model size affects encoding performance. We use the Whisper model\nfamily for this analysis, since it has the most models of different sizes. Again, the best performing\nlayer for each size was used. As before, there is a logarithmic relationship (r = 0.991) between\nmodel size and encoding performance; performance for the average subject increases roughly 32.2%\nfor every additional order of magnitude increase in model size. Though the scaling improvements are\ngreater overall than with OPT, it should be noted that the smallest Whisper models are substantially\nsmaller than the OPT models, and have lower baseline performance, which exaggerates the difference.\nAdditionally, within auditory cortex, we observe that encoding performance does not plateau with\nmodel size (see Section B.1), suggesting that improvements in AC are complemented by reductions\nin performance elsewhere.\nFigure 1e shows how additional training data improves the encoding performance of Whisper Large\n(636 million parameters, layer 30). As before, we fit separate encoding models on increasing amounts\nof training data. Additional training data for Whisper has an effect that is comparable to OPT:\nEncoding performance is linearly related to log-dataset size (r = 0.988), and increasing the training\ndataset by an order of magnitude increases performance by 144%.\nFigure 1f shows the performance of each layer of every Whisper and WavLM model. For legibility,\nHuBERT results are omitted from this plot and are included in the supplement (Figure B.2). The\nupper-middle and uppermost layers of each model tend to have the best performance, aligning with\nprevious results on acoustic encoding models [29, 31]. In contrast with WavLM, the Whisper models\nincrease in performance with layer depth; this can likely be attributed to our choice of only using the\nencoder module from the network.\nVoxelwise scaling laws, examining the relationships described in Figure 1 on a per-voxel basis, can\nbe found in Section A of the supplement.\n3.3\nLarge-scale encoding models\nAfter characterizing these scaling laws, we next visualized the performance of one of the top-\nperforming semantic encoding models 1.\nFigure 2 shows the encoding performance of the best OPT model, which uses the 33rd layer of\nOPT-30B, as measured on the test story with 10 repeats. For several voxels from different areas of\ncortex we show the encoding model predicted timecourse and ground truth BOLD response. We see\nstrong prediction performance across cortex, with \u201cclassical\u201d language regions like Broca\u2019s area and\nauditory cortex being well explained, as well as areas that are typically considered to be more \u201camodal\u201d\nin nature, like prefrontal cortex. Voxelwise correlations for this subject are as high as r = 0.82. A\nsimilar map showing the change in encoding performance from OPT-125M (comparable to GPT\nmodels used in earlier papers) to OPT-30B is given in the supplemental material (see Figure C.1).\n3.4\nNoise ceiling analysis\nWe further investigated the degree to which encoding models can be improved past this point. To do\nthis, we performed a noise ceiling analysis whereby for each voxel, we estimated its CCmax (see\nSection 2.5). This gave us an approximation of the degree to which an ideal encoding model could\nexplain the response variance in each voxel. We then renormalized the correlations from Figure 2 to\ncompute a normalized correlation coefficient CCnorm.\nFigure 3a shows the room for improvement, or the difference between the correlation coefficients\nmeasured in Figure 2 and their CCmax. Voxels are yellow if there is significant room for improvement,\nand purple if the model for that voxel is already close to optimal. Regions that are typically believed\nto contain high-level representations of language such as angular gyrus (AG) [50\u201352] still have the\npotential for substantial modeling improvement, while some areas in temporal cortex (near AC),\nprefrontal cortex (PFC), and the precuneus (PrCu) are nearly optimal. Figure 3b shows a histogram of\nabsolute correlation coefficients (CCabs), and Figure 3c shows the normalized correlations CCnorm.\n1Keeping with the scaling results from Section 1, we chose to demonstrate this using the best model from\nthe OPT family, however it should be noted that the best model from the LLaMA family is about 5% more\nperformant as measured by correlation. This LLaMA model is further explored in Section 3.6.\n7\nLess RfI\nMore RfI\nLow CCmax\nHigh CC\nmax\nAG\nPrCu\nPFC\nAC\nBroca\nAG\nPrCu\nBroca\nAC\nPFC\nFigure 3: Noise Ceiling Analysis - Figure 3a: A two channel flatmap showing which ROIs remain\npoorly explained by an encoding model built from the 33rd layer of OPT30B.

Voxels are more yellow\nif they have high room for improvement, defined as the difference between the best possible encoding\nmodel and this model.

(PFC =\nprefrontal cortex, PrCu = precuneus, AC = auditory cortex, AG = angular gyrus)\n3.5\nLong context artifacts\nGranting encoding models access to contexts as long as 512 tokens implicitly gives them access\nto the information that the fMRI scan has started recently. For instance, if the input context has\nonly 64 tokens, this implies that the context is occurring at the 64th token in the story. In parallel,\nresponses in some voxels tend to rise or fall gradually over the first minute of each scan (potentially\ndue to underconstrained detrending at scan edges, MRI magnetization reaching steady state, or neural\nadaptation). The combination of these two effects can have unintended effects on the fair evaluation\nof these models by artificially inflating measured performance, as encoding models are adept at\ncapturing this early slow drift. We found that long context effects exist up to roughly 100 seconds\ninto a story, so to mitigate this issue we simply exclude the first 100 seconds of predicted and actual\nresponses from each test story when measuring encoding model prediction performance. Figure D.1\nin the supplement gives a map of the effect of long-context artifacts on measured encoding model\nperformance. Long-context artifacts can inflate measured performance by up to 20%, but the effects\nare mostly localized to areas typically associated with low-level speech processing such as early\nauditory cortex. This effect is most prominent for encoding models using early LM layers and speech\nmodels, and tends to not be as significant for later LM layers.\n3.6\nUnifying semantic and speech encoding models with stacked regression\nWe used stacked regression (see Section 2.4) to augment our best semantic model with the Whisper\nspeech model representations. Figure 4a shows the regions that benefit from this augmentation,\nblended with a flatmap showing the overall semantic encoding model performance. We observe that\nthese benefits are highly localized to auditory cortex and mouth motor cortex. The butterfly plot in\nFigure 4b shows the effect on voxels modified by this augmentation. We see that the auditory cortex\nvoxels that are best predicted by the semantic model are also those that are most improved by this\naugmentation. Figure 4c plots the center of mass of the attribution weights \u03b1v,s. For voxels where\nthe attribution weights favored the later layers of the Whisper model, the voxel is plotted in a brighter\nhue. We see that this attribution plot demonstrates a clear progression of auditory information from\nprimary AC to secondary AC coinciding with layer depth. Figure 4d shows the benefits of this\nstacked regression augmentation. We see that the lion\u2019s share of the improvements happen in primary\nAC and early secondary AC.\n4\nDiscussion & conclusions\nThese results suggest the existence of two major effects on the capacity of encoding models to predict\nBOLD response given finite brain data. First, LM changes that correspond to downstream task\n8\nAttribution CoM\n\u0394 Encoding Performance\nFigure 4: Stacked Regression - Figure 4a: A flatmap shows which regions of cortex improve when\naugmenting a semantic encoding model built from the 18th layer of LLaMA-33B with the layers\nof Whisper using stacked regression. Voxels used the stacked regression if the stacked regression\nperformed better on a validation set. The effect is highly localized to auditory cortex. Figure 4b:\nA butterfly plot comparing the voxelwise encoding performance of the stacked regression encoding\nmodel to the baseline semantic model. Figure 4c: The center-of-mass of the stacked regression\nattributions, C(\u03b1v,s) are visualized in auditory cortex. Figure 4d: The improvement in encoding\nperformance of the stacked regression model over the baseline is visualized in auditory cortex.\nperformance improvement tend to also improve encoding performance, such as when moving from\na LM trained on little data to one trained on more data. Second, increasing hidden state size while\nkeeping other metrics fixed tends to lower encoding performance, as it worsens the conditioning of\nthe encoding model regression problem without a corresponding benefit to model effectiveness. The\nconflict between these two effects has led to a scenario where the largest model is not necessarily\nthe best for predicting BOLD responses, as we have seen for both the OPT and LLaMA LMs where\nencoding model performance peaks at about 30B parameters. Rather, a careful balance must be struck\nbetween model size and model efficacy in order to maximize encoding performance. Audio models,\non the other hand, have not yet seemed to reach this plateau.\nWhat are the use cases for better encoding models? One promising application is the use of encoding\nmodels to supplement more classical experimentation techniques, as suggested by Jain et al. [20].\nHigher encoding performance leads to more trustworthy model predictions and more accurate\nconclusions. Another use case of effective encoding models is language decoding, or predicting\nthe language stimulus from the BOLD response. Recent work has shown that effective language\ndecoding models can be built from encoding models by applying Bayesian techniques [45, 53], so it\nis likely that the performance of such decoders will improve along with the performance of encoding\nmodels [33, 44]. Finally, improved encoding performance could enable fine-grained control over\nvoxel activation through stimulus generation, as demonstrated by Tuckute et al. [54].\nGiven our results, what can computational neuroscientists do to improve the performance of their\nown encoding models? One potential observation is that deep datasets [43, 55\u201357] \u2014 those that\nfocus on collecting many samples from a few subjects, rather than a little data from many subjects \u2014\nare more useful for modelling brain activity. Encoding performance improvements scale well with\nboth model size and dataset size, and large datasets will no doubt be necessary in producing useful\nencoding models. Another straightforward adjustment that can be performed is to simply use larger,\nmore performant LMs for building encoding models. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no other natural\nlanguage encoding models paper at the time of this writing has used models larger than GPT-2 XL,\nwhich is a 1.5B parameter model with performance far below the best 30B parameter models. This\n9\ncould be due to valid concerns that the amount of natural language brain data available is insufficient\nto train effective encoding models on such a scale. However, we found that even in low data cases,\nsuch as with as little as an hour\u2019s worth of data, encoding models built from larger models tend to\noutperform their smaller counterparts, as seen in Figure E.1 of the supplement. We have released\ncode as well as selected precomputed features, model weights, and model predictions generated for\nthis paper. 2 We hope this data release will encourage the use of more performant encoding models\nin natural language computational neuroscience.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge and thank the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University\nof Texas at Austin for providing HPC resources that have significantly contributed to the research\nresults reported within this paper.

However,\nexisting datasets are limited in size and cov-\nerage, and are largely restricted to stereotypes\nprevalent in the Western society. This is es-\npecially problematic as language technologies\ngain hold across the globe.\nTo address this\ngap, we present SeeGULL, a broad-coverage\nstereotype dataset, built by utilizing genera-\ntive capabilities of large language models such\nas PaLM, and GPT-3, and leveraging a glob-\nally diverse rater pool to validate the preva-\nlence of those stereotypes in society. SeeG-\nULL is in English, and contains stereotypes\nabout identity groups spanning 178 countries\nacross 8 different geo-political regions across\n6 continents, as well as state-level identities\nwithin the US and India.\nWe also include\n\ufb01ne-grained offensiveness scores for different\nstereotypes and demonstrate their global dis-\nparities. Furthermore, we include comparative\nannotations about the same groups by anno-\ntators living in the region vs. those that are\nbased in North America, and demonstrate that\nwithin-region stereotypes about groups differ\nfrom those prevalent in North America.\nCONTENT WARNING: This paper contains\nstereotype examples that may be offensive.\n1\nIntroduction\nLanguage technologies have recently seen impres-\nsive gains in their capabilities and potential down-\nstream applications, mostly aided by advancements\nin large language models (LLMs) trained on web\ndata (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, there is\nalso increasing evidence that these technologies\nmay re\ufb02ect and propagate undesirable societal bi-\nases and stereotypes (Kurita et al., 2019; Sheng\n\u2217Work done while at Google Research\net al., 2019; Khashabi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019;\nHe et al., 2020). Stereotypes are generalized beliefs\nabout categories of people,1 and are often re\ufb02ected\nin data as statistical associations, which the lan-\nguage models rely on to associate concepts. For in-\nstance, Parrish et al. (2022) demonstrate that LLM-\nbased question-answer models rely on stereotypes\nto answer questions in under-informative contexts.\nNot all statistical associations learned from data\nabout a subgroup are stereotypes; for instance, data\nmay associate women with both breast cancer and\nnursing as a profession, but only the latter asso-\nciation is a commonly held stereotype (Wilbourn\nand Kee, 2010). Recent work has built stereotype\nbenchmark datasets (e.g., StereoSet (Nadeem et al.,\n2021), CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020)) aimed\nto detect such stereotypes in NLP model predic-\ntions. While these datasets have been instrumental\nin demonstrating that language models may rein-\nforce stereotypes, they have several key limitations.\nFirst, they are limited in their size and coverage,\nespecially for subgroups across the globe. Second,\nthey are curated exclusively with manual effort,\nand are thus limited by the world-view of the data\ncreators and miss out stereotypes they might not\nbe aware of. Third, they do not qualify the stereo-\ntypes with any associated harms or offense (Blod-\ngett et al., 2021). Finally, they assume a single\nground truth on whether a certain association is a\nstereotype or not, whereas stereotypes often vary\nfrom place to place. These limitations greatly re-\nduce their utility in preventing stereotype harms in\nlanguage technologies in the global landscape.\nIn this paper, we show that we can leverage the\nfew-shot learning and generative capabilities of\nLLMs to obtain a broad coverage set of stereotype\n1We use the de\ufb01nition of stereotype from social psychol-\nogy (Colman, 2015).\narXiv:2305.11840v1  [cs.CL]  19 May 2023\nFigure 1: SeeGULL covers stereotypes at a global scale for 179 identity groups across 8 different geo-political\nregions and 6 continents as well as at a local level (state-level identities within US and India).\ncandidates. While prior studies demonstrating that\nLLMs reproduce social stereotypes were in the\ninterest of evaluating them, we are instead tapping\ninto it as a capability of LLMs to generate a larger\nand broader-coverage set of potential stereotypes.\nWe demonstrate that this approach works at a global\nscale (i.e., across 178 countries) as well as within\nlocal contexts (i.e., state-level identities within the\nUS and India). We then employ a globally diverse\npool of annotators to obtain richer socially situated\nvalidation of the generated stereotype candidates.\nOur contributions are \ufb01ve-fold:\n\u2022 A novel LLM-human partnership approach to\ncreate large-scale broad-coverage eval datasets.\n\u2022 The resulting dataset, SeeGULL (Stereotypes\nGenerated Using LLMs in the Loop), contain-\ning 7750 stereotypes about 179 identity groups,\nacross 178 countries, spanning 8 regions across 6\ncontinents, as well as state-level identities within\n2 countries: the US and India (Figure 1).\n\u2022 We demonstrate SeeGULL\u2019s utility in detecting\nstereotyping harms in the Natural Language Infer-\nencing (NLI) task, with major gains for identity\ngroups in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa.\n\u2022 We obtain offensiveness ratings for a majority of\nstereotypes in SeeGULL, and demonstrate that\nidentity groups in Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle\nEast, and Latin America have the most offensive\nstereotypes about them.\n\u2022 Through a carefully selected geographically di-\nverse rater pool, we demonstrate that stereotypes\nabout the same groups vary substantially across\ndifferent social (geographic, here) contexts.\nSeeGULL is not without its limitations (see Sec-\ntion 6). The dataset is only in English, and is not\nexhaustive. However, the approach we propose is\nextensible to other regional contexts, as well as to\ndimensions such as religion, race, and gender. We\nbelieve that tapping into LLM capabilities aided\nwith socially situated validations is a scalable ap-\nproach towards more comprehensive evaluations.\n2\nRelated Work\nStereotypes are beliefs and generalizations made\nabout the identity of a person such as their race,\ngender, and nationality. Categorizing people into\ngroups with associated social stereotypes is a re-\noccurring cognitive process in our everyday lives\n(Quinn et al., 2007). Decades of social scienti\ufb01c\nstudies have led to developing several frameworks\nfor understanding dimensions of social stereotyp-\ning (Fiske et al., 2018; Koch et al., 2016; Abele and\nWojciszke, 2014; Osgood et al., 1957). However,\nnuances of social stereotypes manifested in real-\nworld data cannot be uniquely explored through\nany single framework (Abele et al., 2021). Most\nclassic studies of stereotypes rely on theory-driven\nscales and checklists. Recent data-driven, bottom-\nup approaches capture dynamic, context-dependent\ndimensions of stereotyping. For instance, Nicolas\net al. (2022) propose an NLP-driven approach for\ncapturing spontaneous social stereotypes.\nWith the advances in NLP, speci\ufb01cally with sig-\nni\ufb01cant development of LLMs in recent years, a\nlarge body of work has focused on understand-\ning and evaluating their potential risks and harms\n(Chang et al., 2019; Blodgett et al., 2020; Bender\net al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2022). Language\nmodels such as BERT and GPT-2 have been shown\nto exhibit societal biases (Sheng et al., 2019; Ku-\nrita et al., 2019); and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019),\nand De-BERTA (He et al., 2020) have been shown\nto rely on stereotypes to answer questions(Parrish\net al., 2022), to cite a few examples.\nTo address this issue, there has been signi\ufb01cant\nwork on building evaluation datasets for stereo-\ntypes, using combinations of crowd-sourcing and\nweb-text scraping.\nSome notable work in En-\nglish language include StereoSet (Nadeem et al.,\n2021), that has stereotypes across 4 different di-\nmensions \u2013 race, gender, religion, and profession;\nCrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020), which is a\ncrowd-sourced dataset that contains sentences cov-\nering 9 dimensions such as race, gender, and na-\ntionality. N\u00e9v\u00e9ol et al. (2022) introduce French\nCrowS-Pairs containing stereotypical and anti-\nstereotypical sentence-pairs in French. Bhatt et al.\n(2022) cover stereotypes in the Indian context. Ad-\nditionally, there are studies that have collected\nstereotypes for different sub-groups as part of so-\ncial psychological research (Borude, 1966; Koch\net al., 2018; Rogers and Wood, 2010).\nWhile\nthey add immense value to measuring stereotyp-\ning harms, the above datasets are limited in that\nthey contain stereotypes only widely known in one\nspeci\ufb01c region (such as the United States, or In-\ndia), are small in size with limited coverage of\nstereotypes, and re\ufb02ect limited world views. (such\nas the Western context). Alternately, for scalable\ndownstream evaluations of fairness of models, ar-\nti\ufb01cially constructed datasets (Dev et al., 2020; Li\net al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2018) that test for prefer-\nential association of descriptive terms with speci\ufb01c\nidentity group in tasks such as question answering\nand natural language inference, have been used.\nWhile they typically target stereotypical associa-\ntions, they lack ground knowledge to differentiate\nthem from spurious correlations, leading to vague\nmeasurements of \u2018bias\u2019 (Blodgett et al., 2020).\nBuilding resources with broad coverage of both\nidentities of persons, and social stereotypes about\nthem is pivotal towards holistic estimation of a\nmodel\u2019s safety when deployed. We demonstrate a\nway to achieve this coverage at scale by simulating\na free-response, open-ended approach for capturing\nsocial stereotypes in a novel setting with LLMs.\n3\nSeeGULL: Benchmark Creation\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained\non a subset of the real-world data (Chowdhery\net al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020; He et al., 2020)\nwhich contains both implicit and explicit stereo-\ntypes (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). This makes LLMs\na good candidate for generating stereotypes about\ngeographical identity groups that exist around the\nglobe. However, since generative models also gen-\neralize well beyond the training data, they can gen-\nerate statistical associations that look like stereo-\ntypes but are instead statistical noise. To \ufb01lter out\nsuch stereotypical-looking noisy associations, we\nleverage a globally diverse rater-pool to validate the\nprevalence of the generated stereotype candidates\nin the society. We use a novel LLM-human partner-\nship to create a broad-coverage stereotype bench-\nmark, SeeGULL: Stereotypes Generated Using\nLLMs in the Loop, that captures a subset of the\nreal-world stereotypes.\nOur focus in this paper is on broad geo-\ncultural coverage of stereotype evaluation in\nEnglish NLP for two primary reasons.\nFirst,\nEnglish NLP sees disproportionately more re-\nsearch/resources/benchmarks, and is increasingly\nbeing deployed in products across the globe. Hence\nthere is an immediate need for making evaluation\nresources (including stereotype benchmarks) in En-\nglish itself that have global/cross-cultural coverage.\nSecondly, this is in line with recent calls (Hovy and\nYang, 2021; Hershcovich et al., 2022; Prabhakaran\net al., 2022) to look beyond cross-lingual NLP and\nbuild cross-cultural competence in AI/NLP.\nOur work is a \ufb01rst step towards this goal w.r.t.\nstereotype evaluations, and we envision future work\nexpanding it to multilingual coverage.There are two\nmain steps in creating SeeGULL: (i) Stereotype\ngeneration using LLMs, and (ii) Human validation\nof the generated associations. Figure 2 presents an\noverview of the overall approach.\n3.1\nStereotype Generation Using LLMs\nIn this section we describe sequentially the process\ntowards generation of SeeGULL.\nSeed Set Selection\nTo generate stereotypes at\na global geo-cultural scale, we consider 8 differ-\nent regions based on the UN SDG groupings2: (i)\nSub-Saharan Africa, (ii) Middle East (composed\nof Northern Africa and Western Asia), (iii) South\nAsia (composed of Central and Southern Asia), (iv)\nEast Asia (composed of Eastern and South-Eastern\nAsia), (v) Latin America (includes the Caribbean),\n(vi) Australia (includes New Zealand), (vii) North\nAmerica, and (viii) Europe.\nThe countries are\ngrouped based on geographic regions as de\ufb01ned by\nthe United Nations Statistics Division.\nThe above 8 regions constitute the Global (G)\naxis. We also generate local (L) stereotypes for\n2https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/\nregional-groups/\nFigure 2: Overview of our approach for creating the broad coverage stereotype benchmark, SeeGULL: Stereotypes\nGenerated Using LLMs in the Loop. The generated stereotype candidates are validated by human annotators for\nidentifying their prevalence in the region.\nState-level identities for India and the United States.\nWe select states from India and the US as the cul-\ntural differences in their states and stereotypes are\nwell documented and publicly available. We use\nexisting stereotype sources and construct separate\nseed sets for the above axes. Table 1 presents these\nsources. (See Appendix A.2 for details). We man-\nually selected 100 seed examples for generating\nstereotypes for the Global axis. For the State-level\naxis, we selected 22 and 60 seed stereotype exam-\nples for US and India, respectively.\nFew-shot Prompting\nWe leverage the few-shot\ngenerative property of LLMs (Brown et al., 2020)\nto generate potential stereotype candidates similar\nto the seed set shown in Figure 2, albeit with a\nbroader coverage of identity groups and attributes.\nWe use generative LLMs PaLM 540B (Chowdhery\net al., 2022), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), and T0\n(Sanh et al., 2021) and prompt them with n known\nstereotypical associations of the form (identity(id),\nattribute(attr)), where id denotes the global and\nthe state-level identity groups, and attr denotes\nthe associated descriptive attribute terms (adjec-\ntive/adjective phrase, or a noun/noun phrase).\nFor a total of N already known stereotypes in the\nseed set, we select all possible stereotype combi-\nnations of n = 2 and prompt the model 5 different\ntimes for the same input stereotype (\u03c4 = 0.5). We\nexperimented with n \u2208 [1, 5] and observed that the\nnumber of unique stereotype candidates generated\ndecreased on increasing the number of examples n\nin the input prompt. A greater number of example\nstereotypes as input primed the LLMs to be more\nconstrained resulting in fewer potential stereotype\ncandidates. To ensure quality as well as diversity\nof the generated stereotype candidates, we select\nn = 2 for our experiments. (See Appendix A.3 for\ndetails). Figure 2 demonstrates the different prompt\nvariants we use for our experiments. We also re-\norder the stereotypical associations for each variant\nto generate more diverse outputs and prompt the\nmodel for a total of\n\u0000N\n2\n\u0001\n\u00d7 5\u00d7 2 for any given seed\nset. (See Appendix A.4 for details).\nPost-processing\nWhile most generated outputs\ncontained tuples of the form (id, attr), they were\nsometimes mixed with other generated text. We ex-\ntract potential stereotype candidates of the form (id,\nattr) using regular expression. We remove plurals,\nspecial characters, and duplicates by checking for\nre\ufb02exivity of the extracted stereotype candidates.\nWe also mapped identity groups to their adjectival\nand demonymic forms for both the Global (G) and\nthe State-level (L) axis \u2013 to different countries for\nthe G, and to different US states and Indian states\nfor the L. This results in a total of 80,977 unique\nstereotype candidates across PaLM, GPT-3, and\nT0, for both the axes combined.\nSalience Score\nSince a single identity group can\nbe associated with multiple attribute terms (both\nspurious and stereotypical), we \ufb01nd the salience\nscore of stereotype candidates within each coun-\ntry or state. The salience (SL) score denotes how\nuniquely an attribute is associated with a demonym\nof a country. The higher the salience score, more\nunique the association as generated by the LLM.\nWe \ufb01nd the salience score of a stereotype candidate\nusing a modi\ufb01ed tf-idf metric.\nsalience = tf(attr, c) \u00b7 idf(attr, R)\nFor the Global axis, the function tf(attr, c) de-\nnotes the smoothed relative frequency of attribute\nattr in country c, s.t., c \u2208 R where R is set\nof regions de\ufb01ned in Section 3.1; The function\nidf(attr, R), on the other hand, is the inverse doc-\nument frequency of the attribute term attr in re-\ngion R denoting the importance of the attribute\nattr across all regions. We follow a similar ap-\nproach for the State-level (L) axis and compute the\nsalience score for Indian and the US states.\n3.2\nValidation of the Generated Stereotypes\nCandidate selection.\nIn order to \ufb01lter out rare\nand noisy tuples, as well as to ensure that we vali-\ndate the most salient associations in our data, we\nchoose the stereotype candidates for validation as\nper their saliency score. Furthermore, in order to\nensure that the validated dataset has a balanced dis-\ntribution across identities and regions, we chose the\ntop 1000 candidates per region, while maintaining\nthe distribution across different countries within\nregions as in the full dataset. A similar approach\nwas followed for the axis L as well.\nAnnotating Prevalence of Stereotypes\nStereo-\ntypes are not absolute but situated in context of\nindividual experiences of persons and communi-\nties, and so, we hypothesize that the annotators\nidentifying with or closely familiar with the iden-\ntity group present in the stereotype will be more\naware of the existing stereotype about that sub-\ngroup. Therefore, we obtain socially situated \u2018in-\nregion\u2019 annotations for stereotype candidates con-\ncerning identities from a particular region by re-\ncruiting annotators who also reside in that same\nregion. This means, for the Global (G) axis, we\nrecruited annotators from each of the 8 respective\nregions, whereas for Local (L) axis, we recruited\nannotators residing in India and the US. Each can-\ndidate was annotated by 3 annotators. We asked\nannotators to label each stereotype candidate tuple\n(id, attr) based on their awareness of a commonly-\nheld opinion about the target identity group. We\nemphasized that they were not being asked whether\nthey hold or agree with a stereotype, rather about\nthe prevalence of the stereotype in society. The\nannotators select one of the following labels:\n\u2022 Stereotypical (S): If the attribute term ex-\nhibits a stereotype for people belonging to\nan identity group e.g. (French, intelligent).\n\u2022 Non-Stereotypical (N): If the attribute term\nis a factual/de\ufb01nitional association, a noisy\nassociation, or not a stereotypical association\nfor the identity group e.g. (Irish, Ireland)\n\u2022 Unsure (with justi\ufb01cation) (U): If the anno-\ntator is not sure about any existing association\nbetween the attribute and the identity.\nSince stereotypes are subjective, we follow the\nguidelines outlined by Prabhakaran et al. (2021)\nand do not take majority voting to decide stereo-\ntypes among candidate associations. Instead, we\ndemonstrate the results on different stereotype\nthresholds. A stereotype threshold \u03b83\n1 denotes the\nnumber of annotators in a group who annotate a\ntuple as a stereotype. For example, \u03b8 = 2 indicates\nthat at least 2 annotators annotated a tuple as a\nstereotype. With the subjectivity of annotations in\nmind, we release the individual annotations in the\nfull dataset 3, so that the appropriate threshold for\na given task, or evaluation objective can be set by\nthe end user (D\u00edaz et al., 2022; Miceli et al., 2020).\nWe had a total of 89 annotators from 8 regions\nand 16 countries, of whom 43 were female iden-\ntifying, 45 male identifying, and 1 who identi\ufb01ed\nas non-binary. We describe this annotation task\nin more detail in Appendix A.6, including the de-\nmographic diversity of annotators which is listed\nin Appendix A.6.2. Annotators were professional\ndata labelers working as contractors for our vendor\nand were compensated at rates above the preva-\nlent market rates, and respecting the local regu-\nlations regarding minimum wage in their respec-\ntive countries. We spent USD 23,100 for annota-\ntions, @USD 0.50 per tuple on average. Our hourly\npayout to the vendors varied across regions, from\nUSD 8.22 in India to USD 28.35 in Australia.\n4\nSeeGULL: Characteristics and Utility\nIn this section we discuss the characteristics, cover-\nage, and utility of the resource created.\n4.1\nDataset Comparison and Characteristics\nDataset\nG\nL\nRS\nO\n#I\n#S\nBhatt et al.

SeeGULL captures the Global (G)\nstereotypes for 179 global identity groups as well as\nState-level (L) stereotypes for 50 US states and 31\nIndian states. Appendix A.7 shows the distribution\nof identity groups for 8 regions \u2013 Europe (EU), East\nAsia (EA), South Asia (SA), Sub-Saharan Africa\n(AF), Latin America (LA), Middle East (ME), Aus-\ntralia (AU), and North America (NA), and the US\nstates (US), and Indian (IN) states.\nOverall, SeeGULL contains 7750 tuples for the\nGlobal axis that are annotated as stereotypes (S)\nby at least one annotator. It covers regions largely\nignored in existing benchmarks like LA (756), EA\n(904), AU (708), AF (899) and ME (787). (Note:\nThe numbers in parenthesis denote the number of\nstereotypes). Figure 3 presents the number of in-\nregion stereotypes for the Global (G) axis for dif-\nferent stereotype thresholds \u03b8 = [1, 3]. (See ap-\npendix A.7 for state-level stereotypes). Most re-\ngions have hundreds of tuples that two out of three\nannotators agreed to be stereotypes, with Europe\nand Sub Saharan Africa having the most: 690 and\n739, respectively. Furthermore, 1171 tuples had\nunanimous agreement among the three annotators.\nSeeGULL also captures the regional sensitivity\n(RS) of stereotype perceptions by situating them\nin different societal contexts (described in Sec-\ntion 5.1), unlike existing benchmarks that present\nstereotypes only in a singular context.

Table 2 presents a\nsample of the SeeGULL dataset with the salience\nscore (SL), #stereotype annotations in the region\n(In(S)) as well as outside the region(Out(S)), along\nwith their the mean offensiveness (O) rating. We\ndiscuss more about the latter annotations in Section\n5. Table 11 presents more detailed examples.\n4.2\nEvaluating Harms of Stereotyping\nSeeGULL provides a broader coverage of stereo-\ntypes and can be used for a more comprehensive\nevaluation of stereotype harms. To demonstrate\nthis, we follow the methodology proposed by Dev\net al. (2020) and construct a dataset for measuring\nembedded stereotypes in the NLI models.\nUsing the stereotypes that have been validated\nby human annotators in the SeeGULL benchmark,\nwe randomly pick an attribute term for each of the\n179 global identity groups (spanning 8 regions).\nWe construct the hypothesis-premise sentence\npairs such that each sentence contains either the\nidentity group or its associated attribute term. For\nexample, for the stereotype (Italian, seductive):\nPremise: A seductive person bought a coat.\nHypothesis: An Italian person bought a coat.\nWe use 10 verbs and 10 objects to create the\nabove sentence pairs. The ground truth association\nfor all the sentences in the dataset is \u2018neutral\u2019. For a\nfair comparison, we construct similar datasets using\nthe regional stereotypes present in existing bench-\nmarks: StereoSet (SS) and CrowS-Pairs (CP).

SeeGULL\u2019s broader coverage\nof stereotypes uncovers more embedded stereotype harms across all models as seen by higher mean entailment\n(M(E)) and the %Entailed (%E) scores for the Global axis, and for regions like Latin America (LA), Sub-Saharan\nAfrica (AF), Europe (EU), North America (NA), East Asia (EA), South Asia (SA), and Australia (AU). \u2018-\u2019 indicates\nthat no stereotype was uncovered using that dataset. Best results are highlighted in boldface.\niments by creating a dataset of random associations\nbetween an identity group and an attribute term.\nWe evaluate 3 pre-trained NLI models for stereo-\ntyping harms using the above datasets: (i) ELMo\n(Peters et al., 2018), (ii) XLNet (Yang et al., 2019),\nand (iii) ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) and present\nthe results in Table 3. We measure the mean entaile-\nment M(E) = P(entail)/|D| and %Entailed (%E)\nfor the above NLI models to evaluate the strength\nof the stereotypes embedded in them. The higher\nthe value, the greater the potential of stereotyping\nharm by the model.\nFrom Table 3, we observe that the M(E) for the\nGlobal axis is higher when evaluating the mod-\nels using SeeGULL. Except for East Asia (EA),\nSeeGULL results in a higher %E across all models\n(at least 2X more globally, at least 10X more for\nLatin America (LA), and at least 5X more for Sub-\nSaharan Africa (AF)). We also uncover embedded\nstereotypes for Australia in the NLI models, which\nare completely missed by the existing benchmarks.\nOverall, SeeGULL results in a more comprehen-\nsive evaluation of stereotyping in these language\nmodels, and thus allows for more caution to be\nmade when deploying models in global settings.\nWhile here we only present results indicating im-\nprovement in coverage of measurements in NLI,\nthe stereotype tuples in SeeGULL can also be used\nfor evaluating different tasks (such as question an-\nswering, document similarity, and more), as well\nfor employing mitigation strategies which rely on\nlists of words (Ravfogel et al., 2020; Dev et al.,\n2021). We leave this for future work.\n5\nSocially Situated Stereotypes\n5.1\nRegional Sensitivity of Stereotypes\nStereotypes are socio-culturally situated and vary\ngreatly across regions, communities, and contexts,\nimpacting social interactions through harmful emo-\ntions and behaviors such as hate and prejudice\n(Cuddy et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the sub-\njective and the contextual nature of stereotypes\nresult in a varied perception of the same stereotype\nacross different regions. For example, a stereotyp-\nical tuple (Indians, smell like curry) might only\nbe known to Indian annotators residing outside of\nIndia, but they might not be aware of the regional\nstereotypes present within contemporary India. To\ncapture these nuances and differences across differ-\nent societies, we obtain additional annotations for\nsalient stereotype candidates from 3 \u2018out-region\u2019\nannotators for the Global (G) axis. For each region\nin the Global (G) axis other than North America,\nwe recruited annotators who identify themselves\nwith an identity group in that region but reside\nin North America. We use North America as the\nreference in this work due to the ease of annota-\ntor availability of different identities. Future work\nshould explore this difference w.r.t. other contexts.\nThe annotation task and cost here is the same as in\nSection 3.2, and is also described in Appendix A.6.\nFigure 4 demonstrates the agreement and the sen-\nsitivity of stereotypes captured in SeeGULL across\nthe in-region and out-region annotators for 7 differ-\nent regions (\u03b8 = 2) for the Global axis: namely Eu-\nrope, East Asia, South Asia, Australia, Middle East,\nFigure 4: Regional sensitivity of stereotypes: The left side shows an agreement plot where Y-axis denotes different\nregions and X-axis denotes the number of stereotypes \u03b8 = 2 that are prevalent outside the region (out-region), in the\nregion (in-region), and ones that overlap across both the regions. The right side presents examples of stereotypes.\nSub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. It demon-\nstrates the difference in the stereotype perceptions\nacross the two groups of annotators. We see that at\nleast 10% of the stereotypes are only prevalent out-\nside the region, e.g.: (French, generous), (Danish,\nincoherent), (Indians, smelly), (Afghans, beautiful);\nsome other stereotypes are prevalent only in the\nregion, e.g.: (Swiss, ambivalent), (Portuguese, sea-\nfarer), (Danish, music lovers), (Afghans, stubborn),\n(Nepalese, slow), and there is at least a 10% overlap\n(across all regions) for stereotypes that are preva-\nlent both within and outside the region, e.g.: (Ital-\nian, gangsters), (German, Nazis), (Pakistani, con-\nservative), (Afghans, brutal), (Indians, poor). (See\nFigure A.8 for agreement for thresholds \u03b8 = 1, 3).\n5.2\nOffensiveness of Stereotypes\nA stereotype makes generalized assumptions about\nidentities of people. While all stereotypes are thus\nreductive, some can be more offensive than oth-\ners based on the generalization (for instance, if the\nassociation is about criminal conduct). Each stereo-\ntype tuple in our dataset contains an attribute term\nthat describes a generalization made about the iden-\ntity group. To understand the offensiveness of the\ngenerated stereotypes, we obtain annotations for\nthe attribute terms and impute them to the stereo-\ntypes. We have a total of 12,171 unique attribute\nterms for all identity groups across the global and\nstate-level axes combined. Each attribute term is\neither an adjective/adjective phrase or a noun/noun\nphrase. We compute the association frequency\nfor each attribute term by calculating the number\nof stereotype candidates its associated with. The\nhigher the number, the more stereotypes we can\nget offensiveness annotations for. We then sort the\nattribute terms in decreasing order of their associ-\nation frequency and select the top 1800 attribute\nwords and phrases, which obtains ~85% coverage\nof our entire dataset.\nSince all the attributes are in English, for this\ntask, annotators were recruited only in one region,\nNorth America, and the requirement for annotation\nwas pro\ufb01ciency in English reading and writing. We\nobtain annotations for each attribute term from 3\nannotators who are pro\ufb01cient in English reading\nand writing. We ask how offensive would the given\nattribute be, if it were associated as a generalization\nabout a group of people, i.e., \u2018Most id are attr\u2019,\nwhere id is an identity group such as Australians,\nMexicans, etc., and attr is the given attribute term\nsuch as \u2018lazy\u2019, or \u2018terrorist\u2019. The task is subjective\nin nature and the annotators are expected to label\nan attribute on a Likert scale ranging from \u2018Not\noffensive (\u22121)\u2019, \u2018Unsure 0\u2019, \u2018Slightly Offensive\n(+1)\u2019, \u2018Somewhat Offensive (+2)\u2019, \u2018Moderately\nOffensive (+3)\u2019, to \u2018Extremely Offensive (+4).\nThis task is described in more detail in Appendix\nA.9. Annotators were paid for this task according to\nlocal regulations in the country they were recruited\nin, as described in Section 3.2.\nWe share the mean rating across 3 annotators\nfor each attribute as well as individual annota-\ntions. These ratings of offensiveness of attributes\nare mapped back to individual identities, the at-\ntribute is stereotypically associated with, denoting\nan interpretation of the offensiveness of the stereo-\ntypes. Table 4 shows some examples of the at-\nAttribute\nScore\nAssociated Identity Groups\ngangsters\n4\nItalian, Mexican\nkillers\n4\nAlbanian, Vietnamese, Mexican\nterrorist\n4\nPakistani, Somalis, Syrian, Yemeni\nsmell bad\n2.6\nTurks, Indians, Mexican, Moroccan\npoor\n2.3\nColombian, Mexican, Thai, Malaysian\nrude\n2.0\nFrench, German, Pakistani\ndishonest\n1.3\nChinese, Bangladeshi, Nigerian\nrich\n-1\nNorwegian, Swiss, Japanese\nkind\n-1\nPeruvian, Nepalese, Indian, Australian\npatriotic\n-1\nRussian, United States, North Korean\nTable 4: Mean offensiveness ratings of some attribute\nterms, and some of their associated identity groups.\ntributes along with their mean offensiveness scores\nand their commonly associated identity groups. At-\ntributes like \u2018gangsters\u2019, \u2018killers\u2019, \u2018terrorist\u2019, were\nannotated as \u2018Extremely Offensive (+4)\u2019 by all the\nannotators, whereas \u2018patriotic\u2019, \u2018rich\u2019, \u2018kind\u2019 were\nconsidered \u2018Not Offensive (-1)\u2019 by all the annota-\ntors. On the other hand, attributes such as \u2018smell\nbad\u2019, \u2018poor\u2019, \u2018dishonest\u2019, \u2018rude\u2019 were more subjec-\ntive and had ratings ranging from \u2018Not Offensive\u2019\nto \u2018Extremely Offensive\u2019 across the 3 annotators.\nFrom Figure 5, we also observe that the region of\nSub-Saharan Africa has the most offensive stereo-\ntypes followed by the Middle East, Latin America,\nSouth Asia, East Asia, North America and \ufb01nally\nEurope. Pakistan, as a country, has the most offen-\nsive stereotypes followed by Mexico, Cameroon,\nAfghanistan, and Ethiopia. Australians, Indians,\nJapanese, Brazilians and New Zealanders have the\nleast offensive stereotypes (See Appendix A.9.4 for\noffensiveness distribution of stereotypes).\nFigure 5: Offensiveness of stereotypes across regions.\nWe aggregate the offensiveness scores associated with\nthe stereotypes for each country. The color green de-\nnotes the least offensive stereotypes, and the color red\nindicates the most offensive stereotypes.\n6\nConclusion\nWe employ a novel LLM-human partnership based\napproach to create a unique stereotype benchmark,\nSeeGULL, that covers a geo-culturally broad range\nof stereotypes about 179 identity groups spanning\n8 different regions and 6 continents. In addition\nto stereotypes at a global level for nationality, the\ndataset also contains state-level stereotypes for 50\nUS states, and 31 Indian states and union territories.\nWe leverage the few-shot capabilities of LLMs such\nas PaLM, GPT-3, and T0 and get a salience score\nthat demonstrates the uniqueness of the associa-\ntions as generated by LLMs. We also get annota-\ntions from a geographically diverse rater pool and\ndemonstrate the contextual nature and the regional\nsensitivity of these stereotypes. Further, we investi-\ngate the offensiveness of the stereotypes collected\nin the dataset. The scale and coverage of the dataset\nenable development of different fairness evaluation\nparadigms that are contextual, decentralized from\na Western focus to a global perspective, thus en-\nabling better representation of global stereotypes in\nmeasurements of harm in language technologies.\nLimitations\nAlthough, we uncover and collate a broad-range of\nstereotypes, it is not without limitations. Firstly, we\ngenerate stereotypes using seeds which in\ufb02uence\nand skew the output stereotypes retrieved. Our cov-\nerage could thus be greatly affected and potentially\nincreased with different or more seed stereotypes.\nSecondly, stereotypes are inherently subjective in\nnature and even though we do get 6 annotations\nfrom annotators residing in different regions, they\nhave a limited world view and might not be aware\nof all the existing stereotypes. Additionally, cer-\ntain stereotypes make sense only in context. For\nexample the stereotype (Asians, hardworking) is\nnot offensive by itself but becomes problematic\nwhen we compare or rank Asians with other social\ngroups. Moreover, the stereotype (Asians, socially\nawkward) exists in tandem with the former stereo-\ntype which is offensive. Although we do capture\nregional sensitivity of stereotypes, our work does\nnot capture the contextual information around these\nstereotypes. For capturing in-region vs out-region\nstereotypes, we only select annotators from North\nAmerica but the out-region annotators can belong\nto any of the other regions as well. That is out-\nside the scope of this work. Additionally, we em-\nphasise that this work is not a replacement to the\nmore participatory work done directly with differ-\nent communities to understand the societal context\nand the associated stereotypes. The complemen-\ntary usage of our method with more community\nengaged methods can lead to broader coverage of\nevaluations of harm (Dev et al., 2023).\nEthics Statement\nWe generate and validate stereotypical associations\nabout a person\u2019s identity based on the geographi-\ncal location they are from. Geographic identity is\na complex notion and a person can identify with\nmore than one location, and subsequently culture.\nThis identity also can have signi\ufb01cant overlap with\nother identities such as religion or race and that also\ncolors experiences and stereotypes experienced.\nWe develop this dataset as a \ufb01rst step towards in-\ncluding a fraction of the complex stereotypes expe-\nrienced across the world and hope for future work\nto build on it to include more (and more complex)\nstereotypes so that our models and systems can\nbe evaluated more rigorously. Hence, SeeGULL\nshould be used only for diagnostic and research\npurposes, and not as benchmarks to prove lack of\nbias. The paper also contains stereotypes that can\nbe offensive and triggering and will be released\nwith appropriate trigger warnings.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Kathy Meier-Hellstern, Partha Talukdar,\nKellie Webster, and Shaily Bhatt for their helpful\ndiscussions and feedback; Kevin Robinson, Marie\nPellat, and Dasha Valter for crucial help with the\nexperiments; and Dinesh Tewari and the annotation\nteam for facilitating our data work.

We release the data card for the\nSeeGULL dataset at: https://github.com/google-\nresearch-datasets/seegull/seegull_datacard,\nfollowing the format proposed by\nPushkarna\net al. (2022). The data card includes details of the\ndataset such as intended usage, \ufb01eld names and\nmeanings, annotator recruitment and payments\n(also in Appendix A.6 and A.9), and more.\nA.2\nStereotype Sources for Creating Seed Set\n\u2022 StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021):Stereoset\ncontains stereotypes about race, gender, pro-\nfessions, and religion. We randomly select 50\nsentence pairs from the \u2019race\u2019 category as it\ncontains stereotypical sentences about differ-\nent nationalities. We then manually extract tu-\nples of the form (identity, attribute) from these\nsentences. For example, one of the stereotyp-\nical sentences about the target \u2018Ghanaian\u2019 is\n\u2018He was skinny and malnourished\u2019. We extract\nthe two stereotypes \u2013 (Ghanaian, skinny), and\n(Ghanaian, malnourished) from this sentence.\nWe extract 30 such stereotypical tuples from\nthe StereoSet dataset for the global axis.\n\u2022 UNESCO (Klineberg, 1951): They listed out\nadjectives that were most frequently used\nto describe Russians, Americans, British,\nFrench, Chinese, Australians, Germans, Ital-\nians, Dutch, Norwegians, and Americans. The\ndescription of the above nationality were col-\nlected from Australians, British, French, Ger-\nmans, Italians, Dutch, Norwegians, and Amer-\nicans. There were 70 such (identity, attribute)\npairs and we extract all of it to create the seed\nset for the global axis.\n\u2022 Koch (Koch et al., 2018): They highlight\nparticipant-generated stereotypes describing\ninter-state prejudice as held by the US citizens\nabout different US states on a 2D cognitive\nmap. We assume each dimension of the map\nto be an attribute that is associated with differ-\nent US states. We extract 22 such stereotypes\nabout US states.\n\u2022 Borude (Borude, 1966): They surveyed 238\nsubjects and highlight the 5 most frequent\ntraits about Gujaratis, Bengalis, Goans, Kan-\nnadigas, Kashmiris, Marathis, and Punjabis.\nThe traits can be viewed as attributes associ-\nated with the mentioned identity groups. We\ncollect 35 (identity, attribute) pairs as seed set\nfor Indian states.\n\u2022 Bhatt (Bhatt et al., 2022): The paper presents\nstereotypes held about different states in In-\ndia by Indian citizens. We select 15 seed ex-\namples for Indian States where there was an\nannotator consensus.\nTable 5 presents the number of seed examples used\nfrom the above sources.\nA.3\nN-shot Analysis\nTo \ufb01nd the most optimal n for n-shot prompting,\nwe randomly select 100 examples from\n\u0000100\nn\n\u0001\ncom-\nbinations and prompt the model 5 times for each\nexample. Table 6 shows the #stereotype candidates,\n#identity groups (Id), and # attribute terms(Attr)\nfor different values of \u2018n\u2019. To ensure quality as well\nas diversity of the generated stereotype candidates,\nwe select n = 2 for our experiments.\nA.4\nDifferent types of input variants for\nprompting LLMs\n\u2022 Identity-Attribute pair (identity, attribute): In-\nput stereotypes of the form (x1, y1), (x2, y2)\nand (x2, y2), (x1, y1) where the model is ex-\npected to generate more stereotypical tuples\nof the form (identity, attribute).\n\u2022 Attribute-Identity pair (attribute, identity): In-\nput stereotypes of the form (y1, x1), (y2, x1)\nand (y2, x2), (y1, x1) where the model is\nasked to generate stereotypes of the form (at-\ntribute, identity).\n\u2022 Target identity (identity,\nattribute,\niden-\ntity):\nInput\nstereotypes\nof\nthe\nform\n(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, where the model is\nasked to complete the attribute for a given\ntarget identity group x3 while also generating\nmore stereotypical tuples of the form (x, y).\n\u2022 Target\nattribute\n(attribute,\nidentity,\nat-\ntribute):\nInput stereotypes of the form\n(y1, x1), (y2, x2), (y3, where the model is\nasked to complete the target identity group for\nthe given attribute and generate more stereo-\ntypical tuples of the form (y, x).\nTable 7 demonstrated examples the above input\ntypes and examples of the input variants.\nA.5\nSteps for Post-processing\n\u2022 Use regex to extract tuples either of the form\n(identity, attribute) from the generated text.\nDataset\nAxis\n#Examples\nSeed Examples\nStereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021)\nGlobal\n30\n(Ghanaian, skinny), (Ghanaian, malnourished)\nUNESCO (Klineberg, 1951)\nGlobal\n70\n(French, intelligent),\n(Chinese, hardworking)\nKoch (Koch et al., 2018)\nUS States\n22\n(Montanan, republican),(Texan, anti-gun control)\nBorude (Borude, 1966)\nIndian States\n35\n(Punjabi, industrious),(Kannadiga, superstitious)\nBhatt (Bhatt et al., 2022)\nIndian States\n15\n(Tamilian, mathematician),(Uttar Pradeshi, poet)\nTable 5: Existing stereotype sources used for constructing the seed set for three different axis: (i) Global, (ii)\nUS states, (iii) Indian states.

This same\ntask was provided to annotators for tasks described\nin Sections 3.2 and 5. Note: The annotators are not\nbeing asked whether they believe in the stereotype\nor not, rather whether they know that such a stereo-\ntype about the identity group exists in society. The\nlabels and their signi\ufb01cance is provided in Table 8.\nA.6.2\nAnnotator Demographic Distribution\nOur annotator pool was fairly distributed across\nregional identities. Table 9 and Table 10 show\nthe annotator distribution across different regions\nand for different ethnicity, respectively. We cap-\nture in-region and out-region ratings separately in\nthe dataset, hence avoiding any US-skew. To be\nprecise, we had 2 groups of annotators: (i) We\nrecruited annotators from 16 countries across 8 cul-\ntural regions to annotate stereotypes about regional\nidentities from corresponding regions (e.g., South\nAsian raters from South Asia annotating stereo-\ntypes about South Asians) (Section 3.2). (ii) We\nrecruited a separate set of annotators residing in\nthe US but identifying with the other seven re-\ngional identities to study out-region annotations\n(Section 5.1), i.e., South Asian raters from the US\nannotating stereotypes about South Asians. Note:\nTable 9 combines these pools, resulting in a higher\nnumber of annotators from the US.\nA.6.3\nCost of Annotation\nAnnotators were professional data labelers work-\ning as contractors for our vendor and were com-\npensated at rates above the prevalent market rates,\nand respecting the local regulations regarding min-\nimum wage in their respective countries. We spent\nUSD 23,100 for annotations, @USD 0.50 per tu-\nple on average. Our hourly payout to the vendors\nvaried across regions, from USD 8.22 in India to\nUSD 28.35 in Australia.\nA.7\nCoverage of Identity Groups and\nStereotypes\nIdentity Coverage\nWe de\ufb01ne coverage as the\nnumber of different unique identity groups that\nhave annotated stereotypes and compare the cov-\nerage of different identity groups in SeeGULL\nwith existing benchmark datasets \u2013 StereoSet (SS),\nCrowS-Pairs (CP), Koch, Borude, and Bhatt. For\nSS and CP, we consider two variants \u2013 the original\nInput Type\nInput Examples (selected from the seed set)\nGenerated Stereotype Candidates\n(x1, y1), (x2, y2)\n(German, practical), (British, domineering)\n(Italians, seductive), (French, good at\nfashion), (Japanese, hardworking)\n(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3,\n(German, practical), (British, domineering), (Mexican,\n(y1, x1), (y2, x1)\n(practical, German), (domineering, British)\n(sociable, Argentine), (brave, Mexican),\n(environmentally-conscious, Swedes)\n(y1, x1), (y2, x2), (y3,\n(practical, German), (domineering, British), (hardworking,\nTable 7: Input variants for prompting LLMs and their corresponding generated stereotype candidates. We use\nfew-shot prompting and give n = 2 existing stereotypes as input (xi denotes the identity term, and yi denotes\nthe associated attribute). We also re-order the stereotypes for each input variant and prompt the model 5 times\n(\u03c4 = 0.5) to ensure diversity and language quality.\nLabel\nSigni\ufb01cance\nExample Tuple\nS\nThe associated token exhibits a stereotype for an\nidentity term.\n(Mexicans, lazy) indicates a well-known\nstereotype the society holds about Mexicans.\n(Asians, good at math) is a stereotype associ-\nated with Asians.\nNS\nThe associated token is a factual, neutral associa-\ntion, not a stereotype, or the opposite of a stereo-\ntype for the identity term.\n(Asians, Asia) is a factual association.\n(Americans,\ntrees),\nor\n(Norwegian,\nsalmon) (Blodgett et al., 2021) is a noisy\nassociation and not a stereotype.\n(Asians, good drivers) is not an existing stereo-\ntypical association.\nU\nNot sure if the associated token is a stereotype in\nthe society\nTable 8: Description of the annotation task for annotating stereotypes.\ndataset (SS(O) and CP(O)) and the demonyms only\nversion of the dataset (SS(D) and CP(D). From\nFigure 6, we observe that we cover 179 identity\ngroups in SeeGULL whereas CP(D) and SS(D)\nonly cover 24 and 23 identity groups, respectively.\nThe other datasets have far fewer identity terms.\nWe cover unique identity groups in regions like\nLatin America, East Asia, Australia, and Africa\nwhich is missing in the existing datasets.

    "text": "Controlling the Extraction of Memorized Data\nfrom Large Language Models via Prompt-Tuning\nMustafa Safa Ozdayi1\u2217, Charith Peris2\u2020, Jack Fitzgerald2, Christophe Dupuy2,\nJimit Majmudar2, Haidar Khan2, Rahil Parikh2, Rahul Gupta2\n1Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas\n2Alexa AI, Amazon\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are known to\nmemorize signi\ufb01cant portions of their training\ndata.\nParts of this memorized content have\nbeen shown to be extractable by simply query-\ning the model, which poses a privacy risk. We\npresent a novel approach which uses prompt-\ntuning to control the extraction rates of memo-\nrized content in LLMs. We present two prompt\ntraining strategies to increase and decrease ex-\ntraction rates, which correspond to an attack\nand a defense, respectively. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our techniques by using\nmodels from the GPT-Neo family on a pub-\nlic benchmark. For the 1.3B parameter GPT-\nNeo model, our attack yields a 9.3 percent-\nage point increase in extraction rate compared\nto our baseline. Our defense can be tuned to\nachieve different privacy-utility trade-offs by a\nuser-speci\ufb01ed hyperparameter. We achieve an\nextraction rate reduction of up to 97.7% rela-\ntive to our baseline, with a perplexity increase\nof 16.9%.\n1\nIntroduction\nPretrained large language models (LLMs; Devlin\net al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020;\nSoltan et al., 2022), commonly trained on massive\ncrowd-sourced corpora, have been of much interest\nin the recent past due to their usage as backbones in\nstate-of-the-art models across multiple downstream\nNLU tasks. However, they have been shown to\nmemorize signi\ufb01cant portions of their training data\nthat can be extracted using appropriately-crafted\nprompts (Carlini et al., 2020, 2022; Zhang et al.,\n2021). Such extractions pose a privacy risk to the\ncontributors of the training data.\nIn this context, methods that allow developers\nto control the extractability of memorized exam-\nples from LLMs are of much value. For example,\n\u2217 Work done while the author was an intern at Amazon;\nmustafa.ozdayi@utdallas.edu\n\u2020 perisc@amazon.com\nmethods that increase extraction rates correspond\nto attacks in an adversarial setting, and provide\ndevelopers with the ability to analyze privacy-risk.\nMethods that decrease extraction rates, referred to\nas defenses, are useful for protecting against such\nattacks. Historically, defense methods tend to be\ncompute intensive (Abadi et al., 2016; Dupuy et al.,\n2021).\nIn this work, we train continuous soft-prompts\n(Lester et al. 2021; hereafter referred to simply as\nprompts) and leverage them as a way of passing\nan external signal into an LLM, to control the ex-\ntraction of memorized data. We freeze the model\nweights, and only use the trained prompt to con-\ntrol the generation. First, we train prompts in an\nattack setting and study the extent of extractable\nmemorized content in our models. Second, we ex-\nplore a defense setting where we create prompts\nthat reduce extraction rates and achieve different\nprivacy-utility trade-offs, via a user-speci\ufb01ed hy-\nperparameter. Since the original model weights\nare frozen in both these settings, our methods are\ncompute ef\ufb01cient across the board.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the\n\ufb01rst to adapt the use of instructive prompts for the\nanalysis and mitigation of privacy in LLMs. We\nhave released the code developed for our experi-\nments1.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\nPrevious work has shown that LLMs display mem-\norization and has explored a range of methods that\nquantify extractability (Carlini et al., 2018, 2020,\n2022).\nDifferentially-private training (Dwork,\n2006; Abadi et al., 2016) is a popular method\nthat has been used to mitigate this risk. However,\nit tends to reduce model utility and requires re-\ntraining of the LLM, which might not be feasible\ndue to heavy computational burden.\n1https://github.com/amazon-science/controlling-llm-\nmemorization\narXiv:2305.11759v1  [cs.CL]  19 May 2023\nFigure 1: A schematic of our setup. The upper section\nshows our training and testing setup while the lower\nsection shows our evaluation metrics.\nThe use of instructive prompts for language mod-\nels has been extensively researched, including use\nduring pretraining (Raffel et al., 2020), as a sec-\nond stage of training (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2021), and during inference to guide model output\n(Brown et al., 2020). Within the third category, in\norder to improve upon manual prompt engineering\nresearchers have implemented methods to learn dis-\ncrete natural language prompts (Shin et al., 2020),\nto mine them (Jiang et al., 2020), or, neglecting\nnatural language, to learn continuous prompts (Li\nand Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021).\nOur work leverages continuous prompts as a way\nof passing an external signal to a model to trigger\na desired model behavior (i.e., less or more memo-\nrized data in open language generation, which map\nto an extraction attack and defense, respectively).\n3\nMethod\nPrompt-tuning requires the prepending of a prompt\nto the pre\ufb01x embedding and access to the training\nloss (see Figure 1). Given these constraints, we\nexplore a white-box attack where the adversary has\naccess to the target model parameters, and a black-\nbox defense where the adversary interacts with the\ntarget model via an API. We therefore do not test\nour defense against our own attack.\nLet [pre\ufb01x || suf\ufb01x] be a sequence in the training\nset where the pre\ufb01x is of length k tokens. Carlini\net al. (2022) de\ufb01ned a suf\ufb01x to be k-extractable\nif the model generates the suf\ufb01x exactly, after be-\ning prompted with its the corresponding length-\nk pre\ufb01x. Our white-box attack aims to increase\nthe number of k-extractable sequences, while our\nblack-box defense aims to reduce the number of\nk-extractable sequences that can be extracted by an\nadversary who submits pre\ufb01xes via an API.\n3.1\nAttack\nIn the attack setting, we assume that the adversary\nhas a set of [ pre\ufb01x || suf\ufb01x ] sequences Strain,\nsampled from the training set of the target model.\nTheir goal is to extract the suf\ufb01xes corresponding\nto a disjoint set of pre\ufb01xes, denoted by Stest2.\nTo do so, the adversary \ufb01rst initializes a prompt:\na continuous set of l \u00d7 e parameters where e is the\nembedding size of the model, and l is the length of\nthe prompt, a hyperparameter decided by the adver-\nsary. The prompt is trained over Strain to facilitate\nthe correct generation of suf\ufb01xes. To do this, we\n\ufb01rst prepend the prompt to the embedding of the\npre\ufb01x and pass the joint embedding through the\nmodel for generation. We then minimize the loss\nobjective (see below) with respect to the prompt\nwhile keeping the parameters of the model frozen.\nWe explore two loss objectives.\nThe \ufb01rst is\ncausal language modeling (hereafter referred to as\nCLM), where we minimize the cross-entropy loss\nover the entire sequence (Radford et al., 2019). In\nthe second, the prompt is optimized by minimizing\nthe cross entropy loss of only the suf\ufb01xes, given\nthe pre\ufb01xes. Here, the training is aligned with our\ninference task such that during training the model\nis penalized only on the suf\ufb01x tokens; hence we\nrefer to it as aligned CLM. During inference, the\nlearned prompt is prepended to each embedding\nof the pre\ufb01xes in Stest, and the joint embedding is\npassed to the model for generation (see Figure 1).\n3.2\nDefense\nIn the defense setting, the defender (API owner)\ntrains the prompt, and prepends it to the incoming\npre\ufb01xes before passing them to the model. Our\nalgorithm is inspired by machine-unlearning liter-\nature (Halimi et al., 2022), and defenses against\nmembership inference and backdoor attacks (Chen\net al., 2022; Ozdayi et al., 2021). We introduce a\n2For simplicity, we assume all pre\ufb01xes are k-length. This\ncan easily be ensured by padding or truncating different length\npre\ufb01xes if needed in a real-world setting.\nhyperparameter named learning threshold denoted\nby \u03b8. During prompt training (see Section 3.1),\nwhen loss is less than \u03b8 we do gradient ascent to\npenalize the prompt. If the loss is greater than \u03b8,\nwe perform gradient descent with respect to the\nprompt as usual. Training is stopped once the av-\nerage epoch loss is equal or above \u03b8. This allows\nus to increase training loss in a controlled manner\nand stabilize it around \u03b8. Through this process, we\ncan achieve various privacy-utility trade-offs ef\ufb01-\nciently without re-training any part of the model.\nTo explore \u03b8, we set the initial value to be slightly\nabove the model training loss and increase in steps\nof 0.25 until desired performance is achieved.\n4\nExperiments\nFor our experiments, we use the 125M and 1.3B\nparameter variants of the GPT-Neo models (Black\net al., 2021). These are public, decoder-only trans-\nformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) trained using\nCLM on the Pile dataset (Gao et al., 2020). We\nextract Strain and Stest from the Language Model\nExtraction Benchmark dataset (Google-Research).\nThis dataset contains 15k sequences sampled from\nthe training split of the Pile where each sequence\nis partitioned into a pre\ufb01x and suf\ufb01x. In the default\nevaluation setting, both pre\ufb01x and suf\ufb01x consist of\n50 tokens. We ensure a random train/test split of\n14k/1k samples.\nOur evaluation metric of choice is Exact extrac-\ntion rate which is the fraction of correctly gener-\nated suf\ufb01xes (i.e., all tokens of the generated suf\ufb01x\nmatch with ground-truth suf\ufb01x) over the test set.\nWe additionally discuss fractional extraction rate\nand present results in Appendix A. As a baseline,\nwe use the attack analyzed in Carlini et al. (2022),\nwhich consists of feeding the pre\ufb01xes to the model,\nand generating suf\ufb01xes with greedy decoding. This\nis the only extraction attack for this setting apart\nfrom our work, to the best of our knowledge. Our\ntraining setup is discussed in Appendix B. All ex-\nperiments are repeated over 5 runs with a new ran-\ndom train/test split in each run.\n4.1\nAttack\nWe explore the performance of our attack across\nseveral dimensions: prompt length, suf\ufb01x size, pre-\n\ufb01x size, and beam size. We use greedy-decoding\nin all cases, except the beam size experiments.\nPrompt Length\nFirst, we explore prompt length\nin the context of the default setting (pre\ufb01x and suf-\n\ufb01x consist of 50 tokens; Figures 2-A1 and 2-A2).\nWe note that prompts tuned with both CLM and\naligned CLM provide improvements over the base-\nline in all cases, with aligned CLM providing the\nbest performance. Given this, we train prompts\nusing the aligned CLM objective for all other ex-\nperiments, including our defense.\nWith aligned CLM, we achieve the highest ex-\ntraction rates of 25.8% and 54.3% for the 125M\nand 1.3B models, respectively (an improvement of\n8.9 and 9.3 percentage points, respectively), with\na 100 token prompt (blue line). We observe that ex-\ntraction rates increase with prompt length and tend\nto saturate after prompt length 100. Over-\ufb01tting\nwas ruled out as a potential cause of saturation as\nthere is no increase in test loss observed during\ntraining. This suggests that there is a max limit on\nthe parameter count in the prompt that might add\nvalue for extraction purposes given our objective.\nWe note that more sophisticated training strategies\n(designing better loss functions, better prompt ini-\ntialization etc.) might yield better extraction rates.\nSuf\ufb01x Size\nNext, we \ufb01x the pre\ufb01x size to 50 and\nvary the suf\ufb01x size. As shown in Figures 2-B1\nand 2-B2, extraction rates decrease roughly expo-\nnentially with suf\ufb01x size. We note that as suf\ufb01x size\nincreases, longer prompts (\u2265 20) provide greater\nimprovements over the baseline. For example, with\na prompt length of 100 (blue line) using the 1.3B\nmodel, at suf\ufb01x size 5 we observe an extraction\nrate increase of 5.3 percentage points. Whereas at\nsuf\ufb01x size 50, the increase is 9.3 percentage points.\nPre\ufb01x Size\nNext, we \ufb01x the suf\ufb01x size to 50 and\nvary the pre\ufb01x size. As shown in Figures 2-C1\nand 2-C2, extraction rates increase roughly loga-\nrithmically (as in Carlini et al. 2022). Contrary to\nsuf\ufb01x size, we observe that the gaps between base-\nline and attacks decrease with increasing pre\ufb01x\nsize. This suggests that our attack stands to bene\ufb01t\na less informed adversary (small pre\ufb01x sizes) when\ncompared to the baseline.\nBeam Decoding\nFinally, we utilize the default\nsetting with pre\ufb01x and suf\ufb01x sizes at 50 tokens\nand vary the beam size (beam size=1 corresponds\nto greedy decoding).

As mentioned in Section 3,\nour defense is designed for a black-box adversary,\nand cannot be tested against our white-box attack.\nTherefore, we utilize the baseline attack (Section 4)\nto quantify privacy. We note that longer prompts\ndid not add value in a defense setting, so we resort\nto using a prompt of length 1. We utilize perplexity\n(PPL) on generated suf\ufb01xes, to quantify the utility\nof the model in addition to using exact extraction\nrate as in Section 3.1. To measure PPL, we use a\nrandom subset of 1k sequences sampled from the\ntest split of the Pile, ensuring that PPL is measured\non data unseen by the model. We also compare our\nmetrics with those of similar sized models that were\nnot trained on the Pile dataset (GPT2 models). Our\npremise here is that better performance in terms of\nprivacy and utility, when compared to an out-of-\ndomain model of similar size, would mean that our\ndefense mechanism is of value to an API owner.\nIn Table 1, we display our results obtained using\nthe default evaluation setting (pre\ufb01x and suf\ufb01x com-\nprise of 50 tokens). Our defense achieves lower\nextraction rates with competitive PPL values. For\nthe 125M model, we achieve an exact extraction\nrate reduction of 99.4% relative to baseline with a\nPPL increase of 25.3% at \u03b8 = 1.75. For the 1.3B\nmodel, the extraction rate is reduced by 97.7% rel-\native to baseline with a PPL increase of 16.9% at\n\u03b8 = 1. The ability to achieve lower extraction rates\nwith lower PPL values as measured against the\nGPT2 models of the corresponding size, provides\nevidence that our defense is effective.\n5\nConclusion\nWe present the \ufb01rst known effort to leverage\nprompt-tuning to control the extractability of mem-\norized data from LLMs in an open language genera-\ntion task. We develop a novel data extraction attack\nand defense, and illustrate their performance under\nvarious settings. Our attack consistently outper-\nforms the baseline in terms of exact extraction rate.\nOur defense provides competitive privacy-utility\ntrade-offs and would prove bene\ufb01cial to API own-\ners with model trained on sensitive content. These\nresults are achieved ef\ufb01ciently, without any change\nto the original model weights. We details avenues\nof future work in Appendix C\n6\nLimitations\nWe brie\ufb02y mention some limitations of our work.\nFirst, we have only used a single dataset, and a\nsingle model family in our experiments. This is\nmainly due to the fact that the benchmark we use\nis the only publicly available dataset at this time\nto the best of our knowledge. We also solely fo-\ncused on extraction metrics, but did not do a deeper\nanalysis on the extracted sequences. A \ufb01ne-grained\nanalysis of extracted sequences could yield impor-\ntant insights for understanding memorization and\nextraction in LLMs. Similarly, we also did not an-\nalyze what our prompts converge to, and whether\nthey yield explainable prompts at the time of con-\nverge. Such analysis can provide better insights as\nto why, for example, training prompts with aligned\nCLM performs better that the basic CLM setting.\nFinally, we believe the evaluation of our defense\ncould be improved further by measuring other util-\nity metrics (e.g., accuracy) on downstream tasks.\n7\nEthical Considerations\nWe leverage prompt-tuning to control the ex-\ntractability of memorized data from LLMs in an\nopen language generation task and explore two\nsettings; an attack and a defense. We acknowl-\nedge that our attack methodology could be misused\nby an adversary with white-box access to extract\nmemorized private information from a target large\nlanguage model. Our goal is to raise awareness\nin the community to the possibility and severity\nof this nature of attack. We hope that developers,\narmed with this knowledge, can use relevant de-\nfense mechanisms to avoid such potential misuse.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Wael Hamza for\nhelpful discussions on this topic and Stephen Rawls\nfor help with securing the GPU instances that were\nrequired for experimentation.\nReferences\nHuggingface accelerate.\nMart\u00edn Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian J.

Counterfactual memorization in neu-\nral language models. ArXiv, abs/2112.12938.\nA\nFractional Extraction Rate Results\nFractional extraction rate is the fraction of gener-\nated tokens that are both correct and in the right\nposition, over the dataset (see lower section of Fig-\nure 2). Our reason to measure this metric is to pro-\nvide a more detailed assessment of risks associated\nwith extraction. Exact extraction rate is particu-\nlarly important in cases where the attacker requires\nan exact match in order for the extraction to be\nof use; a good example is the case of extracting a\ncredit card number. In such cases, even getting a\nfew tokens incorrect will render the attack useless.\nHowever, when the attacker cares more about the\nmeaning of the extracted sequences, fractional ex-\ntraction rate can be a better metric to assess the risk.\nThis is because a human might be able to infer the\ncorrect meaning of the sequence even when few\ntokens are wrong.\nThe results related to this metric are shown in\nFigure 3. Comparing these results with the exact\nextraction rate results (Figure 2), we observe the\nsame trends across all of our experiment. We note\nthat the same shared trends are observed in the case\nof our defense. In this case the fractional extraction\nrate results are tabulated in Table 2.\nB\nTraining Setup\nOur soft-prompts are initialized to random word\nembeddings as described in Lester et al. (2021).\nWe use a batch size of 128 and an Adam opti-\nmizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate\nof 5e \u2212 4. For the attack setting, the prompts are\ntrained for 15 epochs. In the defense case, the\nprompts are trained until training loss stabilizes\naround the speci\ufb01ed \u03b8 value (as described in Sec-\ntion 3.2), which happens within 2-3 epochs in our\nexperiments.\nWe use a Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019) imple-\nmentation where we leverage the HuggingFace Ac-\ncelerate (HF) and DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020)\nlibraries to handle distributed training over 8 GPUs\nFigure 3: The change in fractional extraction rates against prompt length (3-A1, 3-A2), suf\ufb01x size (3-B1, 3-B2),\npre\ufb01x size (3-C1, 3-C2) and beam size (3-D1, 3-D2).

In this study,\nwe employ \u201cIntrospective Tips\u201d to facilitate LLMs in self-optimizing their decision-making.\nBy introspectively examining trajectories, LLM re\ufb01nes its policy by generating succinct and\nvaluable tips. Our method enhances the agent\u2019s performance in both few-shot and zero-\nshot learning situations by considering three essential scenarios: learning from the agent\u2019s\npast experiences, integrating expert demonstrations, and generalizing across diverse games.\nImportantly, we accomplish these improvements without \ufb01ne-tuning the LLM parameters;\nrather, we adjust the prompt to generalize insights from the three aforementioned situa-\ntions. Our framework not only supports but also emphasizes the advantage of employing\nLLM in in-contxt decision-making. Experiments involving over 100 games in TextWorld\nillustrate the superior performance of our approach.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-\n4 (OpenAI, 2023), Google\u2019s PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and other benchmarks (Meta,\n2023; Taori et al., 2023) have consistently achieved remarkable performance across various\nNLP tasks. The integration of LLMs into decision-making tasks (Huang et al., 2022a; Ahn\net al., 2022; Kwon et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022) has garnered signi\ufb01cant\nattention, as it presents an opportunity to develop decision-making agents that can emulate\nhuman-like cognitive processes (Shevlin et al., 2019). In decision-making tasks, such as\nin the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), limited interactions hinder optimal policy\nlearning (Yarats et al., 2021). Owing to the power of LLMs, which have undergone extensive\npre-training on vast amounts of data, agents can leverage the generalization capabilities of\nLLMs to enhance their performance across di\ufb00erent tasks.\nIn addition, common sense\nknowledge is a valuable asset in safety decision-making tasks (Brunke et al., 2022), and\nLLMs possess a wealth of this knowledge due to their extensive training and tuned with\nhuman feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022). By leveraging the inherent common sense knowledge\nwithin LLMs, decision-making agents can make more informed decisions, e\ufb00ectively tackling\nchallenges such as sparse rewards and enhancing the learning process.\nHowever, LLMs sometimes demonstrate errors or hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Peng\net al., 2023), especially in domain-speci\ufb01c scenarios. Recent works focus on designing self-\ncorrection mechanisms to enhance the LLM\u2019s decision-making performance. For example,\n1\narXiv:2305.11598v1  [cs.AI]  19 May 2023\nChain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) concentrates on static reasoning for one-step\nactions without self-correction. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Re\ufb02exion (Shinn et al., 2023)\nfocus on dynamic reasoning based on historical interactions to enable better decision-making\nperformance. However, these works primarily focus on generating instructions or re\ufb02ections\nspeci\ufb01c to individual agents, hindering the adoption of the generalization and universality\nabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, the absence of correction for the generated re\ufb02ections can\nlead to errors during the decision-making process.\nHumans possess high generalization and self-evolution capabilities due to their natural\nability to summarize tips through introspection (Cox, 1996; Van Merrienboer and Sweller,\n2005). Introspection enables humans to re\ufb02ect on their past experiences (successes or fail-\nures), distill key insights, and extract valuable lessons that can be applied to new situations.\nInspired by the remarkable introspection capabilities of humans, we introduce \u201cIntrospec-\ntive Tips\u201d (or \u201cTips\u201d for short) as a novel prompt-based paradigm, empowering an LLM\ndecision-making agent with self-optimizing capabilities via learning tips from trajectories of\nitself, experts, and other environments. Figure 1 provides an example of introspective tips\nin a text-based game.\nFigure 1: In both Game 1 and Game 2, the agent is tasked with checking the cookbook\nand cooking a meal. The cookbooks for each game are di\ufb00erent, but the initial state\nremains the same. After playing in Game 1, the agent is asked to participate in Game 2,\nusing tips or re\ufb02ections generated from the Game 1 trajectory. The agent\u2019s re\ufb02ection\nfocuses on the errors made in Game 1 and is speci\ufb01c to that game. Tips, on the other\nhand, o\ufb00er more general and high-level information about the game. Utilizing tips from\nGame 1, the agent learns that the stove is for frying ingredients and uses the oven to roast\nthe apple. The agent subsequently updates its knowledge about the game by\nincorporating a third tip. However, when using re\ufb02ections, the agent receives an irrelevant\nmessage about potatoes, which leads to its failure to check the cookbook and complete the\ntask in Game 2. In this case, the general tips prove to be more helpful in guiding the\nagent\u2019s behavior and improving its performance, whereas the speci\ufb01c re\ufb02ections from\nGame 1 do not provide useful information for Game 2.\nDistinct from re\ufb02ection (Shinn et al., 2023), which is a self-analysis process that delves\ninto an agent\u2019s actions and experiences in detail, \u201dtips\u201d are compact pieces of information\no\ufb00ering high-level guidance or suggestions.\nThe goal of tips is to provide succinct and\n2\npractical advice for enhancing decision-making performance without requiring an in-depth\nexamination of past trajectories. In contrast, re\ufb02ections can only be derived from the agent\nitself and primarily concentrate on learning from failures. Tips, on the other hand, can be\nacquired from the trajectories of other agents and human experts, focusing on learning from\nboth successes and failures. For example, in the game setting, the agent can generalize tips\nto correctly use oven based on its successful trajectory, but re\ufb02ection may focus more on\nfailures.\nAdditionally, in contrast to using original trajectories as prompts, introspective tips serve\nas condensed and comprehensive insights extracted from lengthy trajectories. This allows\nLLMs to overcome the challenges in discerning the intricate relationship between dependent\nactions and sparse rewards across multiple trajectories (Adhikari et al., 2020). Introspective\ntips provide distinct advantages in terms of their applicability and generalization across\ndi\ufb00erent agents and contexts, as opposed to previous prompting methods such as re\ufb02ections.\nUnlike re\ufb02ections that target speci\ufb01c agents, tips can be shared among di\ufb00erent agents,\nallowing for higher generalization performance. In the game setting of Figure 1, the tips\ngeneralized by the agent can be applied to various game settings with di\ufb00erent recipes. In\ncontrast, re\ufb02ections are more speci\ufb01c to a single past trajectory.\nFurthermore, designing suitable prompts for LLMs to generate introspective tips is a\ncrucial challenge; manually crafting prompts can be burdensome. Therefore we propose\na framework that dynamically adjusts the prompt based on insights derived from past\ntrajectories or expert demonstrations through introspection.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Introspective Tips for Self-Optimizing Decision-Making: We introduce Introspec-\ntive Tips as a novel prompt-based paradigm, empowering LLM decision-making agents\nwith self-optimizing capabilities for both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Unlike pre-\nvious RL agents, Introspective Tips o\ufb00ers an end-to-end solution without the need for\ntraining or \ufb01ne-tuning. It generates meaningful and easy-to-understand tips, facilitating\nhuman understanding and intervention in the decision-making process.\n\u2022 Multiple Strategies in di\ufb00erent scenarios for Learning Introspective Tips: We\npresent distinct strategies applicable in di\ufb00erent scenarios to prompt LLMs to learn Intro-\nspective Tips from their own trajectories, expert demonstrations, and multi-environment\ntrajectories, which also shows the generalization and adaptability of Introspective\nTips.\n\u2022 A Dynamic Prompt Adjustment Framework: To simplify the prompting engineer-\ning process, we introduce a framework that dynamically adjusts the prompt by leverag-\ning insights from past trajectories or expert demonstrations through introspection. This\nframework streamlines the improvement process, enhances the model\u2019s adaptability, and\nenables more e\ufb03cient decision-making.\n\u2022 Comprehensive Evaluation and Comparison: Our extensive experiments encom-\npass over 100 games in TextWorld (Adhikari et al., 2020; C\u02c6ot\u00b4e et al., 2019), testing\nfew-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our decision-\nmaking agent against state-of-the-art methods in the \ufb01eld (Tuli et al., 2022), highlighting\n3\nthe e\ufb00ectiveness and superiority of Introspective Tips. With tips generated from 48 tra-\njectories, LLM agent performs better than previous deep learning method training for\n100, 000 episodes in the unseen game with the highest di\ufb03culty level.\n2 Related work\nLanguage model for decision making LLMs (OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022)\nhave exhibited impressive pro\ufb01ciencies, facilitating their use in tasks beyond mere language\ngeneration and increasingly serving as policy models for decision-making in interactive set-\ntings (Yang et al., 2023). Wei et al. (2022) demonstrates that incorporating a series of\nintermediate reasoning steps can enhance decision-making abilities. Yao et al. (2022) in-\ntroduces ReAct, a method for interleaved reasoning and action generation that fosters\nimproved synergy between language comprehension and interactive decision-making tasks.\nShinn et al. (2023) presents Re\ufb02exion, a technique that equips an LLM-based agent with a\nself-re\ufb02ective LLM and a straightforward heuristic for detecting hallucination and ine\ufb03cient\naction execution to examine the hypothesis. Madaan et al. (2023) adopts a similar strategy,\nenabling an LLM to o\ufb00er feedback on its previously generated text and re\ufb01ne it to meet\nspeci\ufb01c requirements. When regarded as dialogue agents, LLMs can also be trained to learn\nfrom human feedback and optimize their output (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022).\nWith further training, Li et al. (2022) constructs a general framework for decision-making\ntasks using pre-trained LMs, even in scenarios where language is neither provided as input\nnor output. Other studies (Singh et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022a,b; Liang et al., 2022;\nVemprala et al., 2023) have explored innovative strategies involving prompt engineering\nand the utilization of high-level function libraries to enhance the capabilities of LLMs.\nRecent attempts explored di\ufb00erent aspects of LLMs for decision-making. Huang et al.\n(2022a) and Ahn et al. (2022) use LLMs to generate plans or sub-goals that guide low-level\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agents in taking actions. Kwon et al. (2023) utilize LLMs as\nproxy reward functions by prompting them with desired behaviors. Yao et al. (2022) focus\non enabling LLM agents to select actions in text-based environments. In addition, a recent\napproach considers LLMs as world models (Brooks et al., 2022), where the agent learns the\npolicy by interacting with the LLM-based world model. In this paper, we focus on directly\ngrounding LLM in decision-making to take action because the other three methods required\nlearning an extra decision-making agent, which required more samples.\nIn-context reinforcement learning In-context learning pertains to the ability of se-\nquence prediction models to adapt to novel downstream tasks solely through the use of\nprompts without retraining or \ufb01ne-tuning (Lu et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020; Min et al.,\n2022). When applied to reinforcement learning, in-context learning models can generalize\nto diverse downstream tasks when provided with contexts such as demonstrations and task\ninformation. Laskin et al. (2022) recasts RL as an across-episode sequential prediction prob-\nlem, and trains a causal transformer to autoregressively predict actions based on preceding\nlearning histories as context. Brooks et al. (2022) employs the LLM as a world model for\nplanning future trajectories and executing decisions in-context. Team et al. (2023) develops\na versatile in-context learning algorithm capable of adapting to new and open-ended 3D\nchallenging problems as rapidly as humans, by training an RL agent at a large scale. Lu\net al. (2023) proposes to meta-learn across random linear projections of the observation and\n4\naction spaces of randomly sampled DMControl tasks (Tassa et al., 2018). Trained on an\nextensive dataset, Gato (Reed et al., 2022) can generalize to new tasks by conditioning on\ndemonstrations of the desired behavior.\nText-based game Text-based games are typically turn-based experiences played via\na command line terminal.\nDuring each turn, the game state is conveyed through mul-\ntiple lines of text, which enables players to input text commands that modify the state\naccording to their preferences\n(Liu et al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Osborne et al.,\n2022). Text-based games can be formally characterized as partially observable Markov de-\ncision processes (POMDPs) (C\u02c6ot\u00b4e et al., 2019), considering that the agent only observes\npartial information about the environment at each turn. Intrinsic obstacles such as long-\nterm dependencies, partial observation of current states, and sparse rewards, and complex\naction combinations render these games particularly challenging. Various deep learning ap-\nproaches have been employed to address text-based games (Xu et al., 2022; Yin and May,\n2019; Ammanabrolu and Hausknecht, 2020; Kimura et al., 2021).\nFocusing on tasks in\nthe TextWorld domain (C\u02c6ot\u00b4e et al., 2019), Adhikari et al. (2020) explores learning graph-\nstructured state representations via a data-driven approach, introducing the Graph Aided\nTransformer Agent (GATA) that learns to construct and update graph-structured beliefs\nwhile optimizing rewards. Building upon their work, Tuli et al. (2022) equips GATA with an\ninternal structured representation of natural language instructions using Linear Temporal\nLogic (LTL) to enhance the instruction-following capabilities of text-based game agents.\n3 Method\nIn this section, we elaborate on the method employed to leverage the capabilities of LLMs\nin sequential decision-making tasks, particularly text-based games, by addressing LLMs\ninherent limitations and capitalizing on their strengths. LLMs\u2019 pro\ufb01ciency in understand-\ning and generating human-like text renders them promising candidates for tasks involving\nnatural language processing, such as text-based games. However, they lack speci\ufb01c domain\nknowledge when asked to make decisions in certain tasks thus may not reach the greatest\npotential when used directly.\nWe conjecture that the function space of generative LLMs P(\u03b8) is su\ufb03ciently expansive\nto encompass the function of an expert policy in text-based games. The action space of\npolicy \u03c0 is constrained by text output. By selecting an appropriate prompt pr containing\nenough domain knowledge, we can derive a model P(\u03b8|pr) that can function as a \u03c0 in\ndecision making, bridging the gap between LLMs and reinforcement learning.\nThrough\nincorporating strategies including learning from past experiences, expert demonstrations,\nand multiple games, we aim to develop a versatile and robust framework that excels in a wide\nrange of gaming scenarios. This approach ultimately opens up the journey of discovering\nthe potential of LLMs in the domain of complex sequential decision-making tasks.\n3.1 Challenges and Solutions for LLMs in Decision-Making Problems\nThere are several major challenges when applying Language Learning Models (LLMs) to\nsolve decision-making problems, including self-optimization, input length limitations, and\nprompt dependence. In this section, we discuss these challenges and potential solutions.\n5\nSelf-Optimizing decision-making LLMs can exhibit errors or hallucinations, partic-\nularly in domain-speci\ufb01c scenarios. Developing self-optimizing mechanisms to enable LLMs\nto correct their mistakes is essential for improving their decision-making performance. More-\nover, allowing LLMs to self-optimize across various scenarios poses a signi\ufb01cant challenge.\nCurrent approaches, such as self-re\ufb02ection, attempt to rectify errors by concentrating on the\nmodel\u2019s own mistakes. However, this method has limitations, including the risk of LLMs\nbecoming misled by their own errors during re\ufb02ection and lacking a comprehensive under-\nstanding of the task or environment. To address these challenges, we employ \u201dIntrospective\nTips\u201d to facilitate LLMs in self-optimizing their decision-making. We empower LLMs to\nlearn from their own trajectories, expert demonstrations, and trajectories in di\ufb00erent envi-\nronments. By extracting concise and actionable advice from these trajectories, the agent\ngains a better understanding of the environment. Furthermore, by re\ufb01ning its own tips, the\nproblem of hallucination is alleviated.\nLimited input length Language models like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM (Chowd-\nhery et al., 2022) often encounter input length limitations. In RL, agents typically face\nlengthy and complex trajectories, as well as sparse rewards that o\ufb00er feedback only after\nnumerous steps or interactions. Due to the restricted input capacity and extended trajec-\ntories, LLMs struggle to discern the relationship between actions and rewards, ultimately\nimpeding the acquisition of the optimal policy. To address these issues and optimize the\navailable input space, we use tips that e\ufb00ectively condense the training dataset or critical\ninformation generally found in classical RL settings. By incorporating these summaries,\nLLMs can better understand the relationships within the data and identify essential pat-\nterns that might be otherwise obscured by the sheer length or complexity of the trajectories.\nMoreover, providing concise, relevant information enables LLMs to focus on the crucial as-\npects of the problem at hand, potentially leading to more accurate results. This strategy\ncan be particularly bene\ufb01cial in scenarios where the agent must learn from limited data or\nadapt to changing environments, as the distilled information can help guide the learning\nprocess more e\ufb03ciently.\nPrompt dependence: The LLM\u2019s performance on a speci\ufb01c problem heavily relies\non the quality and order of prompts. In order to solve the sequential decision problem in\ntext-based games, that is to produce more relevant and valuable responses in each round, it\nis crucial to craft prompts in decision making. However, creating prompts using human in-\nteraction can be time-consuming and tedious. To address this issue, our method introduces\na framework that dynamically adjusts the prompt based on past trajectories through intro-\nspection, streamlining the process and improving the model\u2019s adaptability. While designing\na speci\ufb01c tip for one game can be laborious, we also explore the possibility of generating\na universal prompt that can transform the LLM into an e\ufb03cient RL agent across various\ngames and contexts.\nThis general prompt would further facilitate the LLM\u2019s ability to\nadapt and perform e\ufb00ectively in a wide range of decision-making situations.\n3.2 Basic setting\nIn our basic setting (Fig 2a), we directly utilize an LLM as an agent participating in a\ntext-based game. A sample interaction proceeds as follows:\n6\nFigure 2: LLM as RL agent\nsystem: You are an agent playing in a\ntext-based game. All of your available ac-\ntions are in the ActionList:\ninventory() # print player\u2019s inventory\n... (see appendix for the full list of action)\nBased on the game\u2019s description that I\ngive you, provide me with only one action\nper step in the action list and wait for my\nresponse. (Following is the description of\nthe \ufb01rst state in a TextWorld game.)\nAgent: inventory()\nThe system (user) clearly de\ufb01nes the\nrole and action space for the LLM agent\nand provides an initial text-based descrip-\ntion of the environment, setting the scene\nfor the agent.\nThe LLM-agent interprets\nthe provided information and decides on an\naction based on its understanding of the\ngame\u2019s context. The agent submits its cho-\nsen action as text, which the system inter-\nprets, processes, updates the environment,\nand provides new feedback, including infor-\nmation on invalid actions or a description of\nthe updated state, to the agent. The LLM-\nagent continues to interact with the game, choosing actions and receiving feedback, until\nthe game reaches its conclusion. The game concludes as a success if the agent completes all\nrequired steps, or as a failure if the agent takes erroneous actions or reaches the maximum\nnumber of turns. Throughout the entire process, the agent\u2019s goal is to navigate the game\nworld and make decisions based on textual input and output.\n3.3 Strategies for three scenarios\nWe have developed strategies for three scenarios to enhance the agent\u2019s learning addressing\nthe two challenges:\nLearning from its own history: The agent employs a history replay method to\ngenerate tips for self-improvement. The agent is prompted as the basic setting to \ufb01nish a\nbasic trial. If the agent fails, the agent creates several tips to address its past mistakes. In\nsubsequent attempts, these tips serve as prompts. If the agent fails even if provided with\ntips, it is prompted to generate more e\ufb00ective tips for itself. The agent is also provided with\nall its previous actions that led to failure in the game. By introspectively analyzing its past\n7\nactions and their outcomes, the agent generates valuable insights to re\ufb01ne its policy. This\nself-enhancement process enables the agent to overcome obstacles and make better choices\nin future gameplay. Moreover, since tips and incorrect actions are shorter than an entire\ntrajectory, the agent can learn from a more extensive history than relying solely on past\nexperiences as memory (Fig 2b).\nLearning from expert demonstrations: The agent evaluates its performance by\ncomparing it to expert demonstrations and makes adjustments as necessary. In this setting,\nthe agent is instructed to observe both the actions leading the expert agent to achieve the\ngoal and the actions causing it to fail the game. By examining successful strategies and\ntactics employed by experts, the agent can pinpoint areas for improvement and generat tips\nthat can help modify its actions accordingly. This learning approach is faster compared to\na purely trial-and-error method. For instance, the agent can learn the correct usage of an\nappliance by contrasting its failed attempts with the successful actions demonstrated by an\nexpert in a text-based game, rather than experimenting with all possible actions.\nThe agent generates tips based on these observations, and these tips serve as new\nprompts when playing subsequent rounds.\nIf the agent fails even when provided with\ntips, it is prompted to re\ufb02ect on the given advice. This method enables knowledge trans-\nfer from expert demonstrations, resulting in a more e\ufb03cient and informed decision-making\nprocess. Feedback from the environment acts as guidance for the LLM model, assisting it\nin determining the accuracy and e\ufb00ectiveness of its generated tips (Fig 2c).\nLearning from multiple games: In this scenario, agents are allowed to participate\nin several games. All \ufb01nal tips (tips that lead to a successful trial) generated across these\ngames are sent to another LLM, which is then tasked with generating general tips to help the\nagent become an expert across various game settings. In this context, the LLM leverages\nits knowledge of summarization to produce comprehensive and valuable tips that enable\nthe agent to improve its performance in a wide range of games. These games share some\nsimilarities but with some information di\ufb00erent. For example, in the cooking game, these\ngames share a similar theme (cooking in a modern house), similar text commands, and\nsimilar entities (i.e., interactable objects within the games), but with di\ufb00erent cookbooks\nand maps involved in the game. The LLM generalizes knowledge across diverse games,\nfunctioning similarly to a Meta-RL agent. The general tips are served as prompts in the\nunseen test game. This ability allows the LLM to perform e\ufb00ectively in a broad range of\ntext-based games, positioning it as a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in complex\nenvironments (see Fig 2d).\nBy incorporating these strategies in the three scenarios, our method presents a robust\nframework for exploiting the potential of LLMs in reinforcement learning for text-based\ngames. Learning from past experiences, expert demonstrations, and multiple games allows\nthe agent to adapt and excel in various gaming scenarios, ultimately demonstrating the\nversatility and e\ufb00ectiveness of LLMs in the realm of reinforcement learning.\n4 Experimental Results\nWe conduct experiments on text-based games to assess the performance of LLMs as agents\nand address three key questions: Q1: Can LLMs learn from their historical trajectories and\nimprove their performance by re\ufb02ecting on di\ufb00erent tips? Q2: Can LLM learn from expert\n8\nFigure 3: Few shot performance over di\ufb00erent di\ufb03culty levels of games\ndemonstrations and can expert demonstration boost the learning of di\ufb00erent strategies?\nQ3: Can LLMs generalize some tips to play in various game settings? For Q1 and Q2, we\nanalyze the few-shot decision-making capabilities of LLMs, while for Q3, we concentrate on\ntheir zero-shot decision-making abilities.\n4.1 Experiment setup\nTable 1: Statistics of The Game\nLevel\n#Ingredients\n#Locations\nPoints\n(Cook, Cut, Open )\n0\n1\n1\n3\n(\u00d7, \u00d7, \u2713)\n1\n1\n1\n4\n(\u00d7, \u2713, \u2713)\n2\n1\n1\n5\n(\u2713, \u2713, \u2713)\n3\n1\n9\n3\n(\u00d7, \u00d7, \u2713)\n4\n3\n6\n11\n(\u2713, \u2713, \u2713)\nWe concentrate on the TextWorld Cooking domain, which gained prominence through\nGATA (Adhikari et al., 2020) and Microsoft\u2019s TextWorld Problems: A Language and Rein-\nforcement Learning Challenge (Trischler et al., 2019). Following Adhikari et al. (2020) and\n9\nTuli et al. (2022), we divide the games into \ufb01ve subsets with di\ufb00erent di\ufb03culty levels. For\neasier games (with smaller di\ufb03culty levels), the recipe requires fewer ingredients, and the\nagent does not need to navigate through the world. For harder games, the agent is asked\nto navigate through di\ufb00erent rooms to acquire various ingredients and cook the meal. The\nscore is related to the relevant steps required in the cookbook of each game. If the agent\ncompletes a required step, it will earn one point. For the hardest game, the agent is required\nto \ufb01nish 11 steps to complete this task. These steps involve opening certain containers to\nobtain the ingredients, cutting the ingredients as required (dice, slice, chop), and cooking\nthe ingredient using the correct heat source (oven or stove). Statistics of the games are\npresented in Table 1. In the dataset, expert demonstrations are provided in the form of\nwalkthroughs and do not require human intervention for generation. Following previous\nwork, we measure the performance of the algorithms using two metrics: normalized game\npoints and game success rate. We test the game in 20 di\ufb00erent games for each di\ufb03culty\nlevel. By averaging the points over the 20 games, and then dividing by the maximum score\nan agent can earn, we obtain the normalized game points. The game success rate is calcu-\nlated as the percentage of games in which the agent successfully completes all the required\nsteps. We use GPT-4 as our base LLM.\n4.2 Few-shot performance\nWe \ufb01rst test the few-shot performance of our method. We make a comparison between\npurely replay, tips summary using past history, and tips summary compared to expert\ntrajectory. The latter two cases corresponds to our \ufb01rst and second scenario. For purely\nreplay, we directly ingest the past trajectory as LLM\u2019s prompts to see if it can learn. Given\nthat the input length is limited, we set the maximum number of trajectories as 3 in the\nexperiments. For tips summary memory, the LLM agent is provided with the past failed\nactions and the tips generated from the last trial. We observe that with tips memory, the\nagent can collect more information using di\ufb00erent trials and cumulatively achieve a high\nsuccess rate (larger than 0.9) and high points earned (larger than 0.95) in the end, as shown\nin Figure 3. With expert demonstration, the agent can learn faster and achieve zero error\nin all di\ufb03culty levels after at most 6 trajectories. This comparison shows that concise tip\nsummary assists the LLM in gathering information and making better decisions.\nWith\nexpert demonstrations, the LLM can learn more e\ufb03ciently compared to solely relying on\ntrial and error.\nWe further show an example about how tip summary can help the agent make better\ndecision.\nIn this log \ufb01le (showing only relevant information), the agent is tasked with\nroasting a purple potato using a prede\ufb01ned ActionList in a text-based game. In the \ufb01rst\nattempt, the agent mistakenly uses the stove to cook the purple potato, resulting in frying\nit and losing the game. The agent then generates a tip to use the \u201droast\u201d action. However,\nthis is an invalid action, and it fails again. Next, the agent generates a second tip to use\nthe \u201dcook\u201d command with the stove, suggesting a di\ufb00erent heat setting or method to avoid\nfrying. Unfortunately, in this text-based game, there are no commands to change the heat\nsetting, leading to another failure. After the third attempt, the agent realizes it should try\nusing an oven to roast the potato, and \ufb01nally succeeds in the fourth trial. This demonstrates\nthat improved tips can lead to successful learning.\n10\n4.3 Zero-shot Performance\nFirst trial:\n>agent: cook purple potato with stove\nsystem: You fried the purple potato.\nTips to win the game next time:\n1. You should try roast the potato next\ntime instead of cook purple potato with\nstove after dicing the purple potato;\nSecond trial:\n>agent: roast the potato\nsystem: Invalid action.\n>agent: cook purple potato with stove\nsystem: You fried the purple potato.\nTips to win the game next time:\n1.\nYou should try cook purple potato\nwith stove next time after you have dicing\nthe purple potato, but make sure to use a\ndi\ufb00erent heat setting or method to avoid\nfrying the purple potato;\nThird trial:\n>agent: cook purple potato with stove\nsystem: You fried the purple potato.\nTips to win the game next time:\n1.\nYou should try cook purple potato\nwith oven next time instead of cook pur-\nple potato with stove, as the recipe sug-\ngests roasting the purple potato rather\nthan frying it;\nForth trial:\n>agent: cook purple potato with oven\nsystem: You roasted the purple potato.\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\nIn this experiment, we focus on training\nLLM agents using tips generated from the\ntraining set. We collect \ufb01nal tips, which are\nthose leading to successful trials, from dif-\n\ufb01culty level 4 (the most challenging level)\ngames in the training set.\nThese tips are\nthen sent to another LLM, which generates\ntips aimed at helping the agent become pro-\n\ufb01cient across various game settings. The \ufb01-\nnal tips can be found in the appendix. We\nused 10 games, which consist of 48 trajecto-\nries in total (averaging 4.8 trajectories per\ngame) to generate the \ufb01nal tip.\nWe then\ntest these tips on an unseen test set across\ndi\ufb00erent di\ufb03culty levels.\nTo evaluate our\nLLM model with general tips as prompts,\nwe compare it to state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ntext-based game agents utilizing deep learn-\ning techniques, including TDQN (Adhikari\net al., 2020), GATA (Adhikari et al., 2020),\nand ITL (Tuli et al., 2022).\nThese mod-\nels are trained on 100 di\ufb00erent games for\neach di\ufb03culty level, with 100,000 episodes\nper level. Results for levels 0 to 3 are pro-\nvided by the authors of (Tuli et al., 2022),\nwhile level 4 results are obtained from Ad-\nhikari et al. (2020).\nAs shown in Figure 4, we prompt the\nLLM with general tips and test it on lev-\nels 1 to 4.\nGiven level 0\u2019s simplicity, we\ndo not provide tips for this level. Our \ufb01nd-\nings reveal that the LLM with tips, using\nonly 10 games and 48 trajectories, achieves\nperformance comparable to SOTA methods\nfor di\ufb03culty levels 0-3. For levels 3-4, LLM\noutperforms other methods, due to the rea-\nsoning ability of the LLM that allows us to\nbypass the need to learn navigation and the correct tips generated in the same di\ufb03culty\nlevel, an aspect that hinders SOTA methods(Adhikari et al., 2020).\nLimitation Despite these achievements, the LLM agent underperforms in some lower\ndi\ufb03culty level games. This underperformance can be attributed to two factors. First, the\nLLM fails to generate a general tip that addresses speci\ufb01c situations encountered in easier\nlevels. For instance, in di\ufb03culty level 1, when an ingredient is already in its desired state\n11\naccording to the recipe (e.g., roasted or fried), the corresponding actions (roasting or frying)\nbecome unnecessary. By incorporating human-generated tips (see the appendix for the full\nlist of tips), the LLM agent can achieve signi\ufb01cantly higher points and success rates, as\ndemonstrated in Table 2. Second, the LLM\u2019s probabilistic nature leads to non-deterministic\noutputs, which occasionally cause the agent to disregard the tips and execute erroneous\nactions. Despite being provided with tips, the LLM agents will still make some mistakes\ndue to their inherent probabilistic behavior. Nevertheless, even with this randomness, the\nLLM agent with general tips can outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents speci\ufb01cally\ntrained to excel in this task.\nFigure 4: Performance of LLM as a text-based game agent compared to SOTA methods.\nGiven that experimental results of di\ufb03culty level 4 is not included in Tuli et al. (2022), we\nobtain data from Adhikari et al. (2020) and some data is missing.\nTable 2: Performance of the LLM agent with human-generated tips across di\ufb00erent\ndi\ufb03culty levels.\nLevel 0\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 4\nPoints\nSuc.

Drawing inspiration from human in-\ntrospection, this approach enables agents to extract and learn from generalized, high-level\ninformation that can be applied across various tasks and contexts. To e\ufb00ectively imple-\nment Introspective Tips, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts prompts based\non insights derived from past trajectories or expert demonstrations through introspection.\nThis approach alleviates the burden of manual prompt crafting while empowering LLM\nagents with self-optimizing capabilities. By leveraging the rich common sense knowledge\nand generalization abilities of LLMs, our Introspective Tips paradigm outperforms SOTA\nmethods in text-based game. Future work could focus on re\ufb01ning the framework for prompt\ngeneration, exploring more sophisticated methods for extracting tips from trajectories, and\nevaluating the e\ufb00ectiveness of introspective tips in a broader range of tasks and real-world\napplications.\n12\nReferences\nA.

Make sure to gather all required ingredients and tools before starting to cook. Use\nthe \u201dexamine(item)\u201d and \u201dtake(item)\u201d actions to interact with items in the environ-\nment.\n17\n\u2022 3. Pay attention to the cooking methods mentioned in the recipe, such as roasting\nor frying, and use the appropriate appliances like the oven and stove. To operate an\nappliance, use actions from the ActionList, such as \u201dcook(food, heat source)\u201d.\n\u2022 4. Use the correct actions from the ActionList to prepare the ingredients, such as\n\u201dslice(food, sharp object)\u201d, \u201ddice(food, sharp object)\u201d, or \u201dchop(food, sharp object)\u201d.\n\u2022 5. Keep track of your inventory and the state of each item to avoid making mistakes\nin the preparation process. Use the \u201dinventory()\u201d action to check your inventory.\n\u2022 6.\nFollow the steps in the recipe in the correct order, ensuring each ingredient is\nprepared as instructed.\n\u2022 7. Once all ingredients are prepared according to the recipe, use the \u201dprepare meal()\u201d\naction to combine them into a meal.\n\u2022 8. If you encounter any di\ufb03culties or errors, refer back to the ActionList and the\nenvironment description to make sure you\u2019re using the correct actions and items.\nB.2\nHuman-generated tips\n\u2022 1 If you get stuck, use the actions goal(), examine(cookbook), inventory() and look()\nto \ufb01gure out what you have and what you need to do.\n\u2022 2 Before cooking an ingredient, always use inventory() \ufb01rst to check current state of\nthe ingredient. If an ingredient is already in the desired state(roasted or fried) as per\nthe recipe, there is no need to perform the actions (roast or fry) mentioned in the\nrecipe.\n\u2022 3 Try take(food) before you prepare(meal). After you take(food), use inventory() to\ncheck the status of the food.\n\u2022 4 Make sure the food is in your inventory before you prepare(meal). Try eat(meal)\nwhen the meal is prepared.\n\u2022 5 Dice, chop, and slice are di\ufb00erent.\n\u2022 6 Fry and Roast are di\ufb00erent. Use correct heat source to cook the ingredient. Oven\nis for roasting something, not frying something.\n\u2022 7 Use cook(food, oven) to roast something, instead of putting the food into the oven\nand wait.\n\u2022 8 Be careful when you cook(food, stove) or cook(food, oven), make sure the food is\nnot fried or roasted before. Otherwise you may burn the food and lose the game.\n18\nAppendix C. Prompts\nPrompts for generating the tips:\nGenerating tips for the \ufb01rst trial\nNow you failed the game.

    "text": "Empower Large Language Model to Perform Better\non Industrial Domain-Specific Question Answering\nFangkai Yang1\nPu Zhao1\nZezhong Wang2\u2217\nLu Wang1\nJue Zhang1\nMohit Garg1\nQingwei Lin1\nSaravan Rajmohan1\nDongmei Zhang1\n1Microsoft\n2The Chinese University of Hong Kong\nAbstract\nLarge Language Model (LLM) has gained\npopularity and achieved remarkable results in\nopen-domain tasks, but its performance in real\nindustrial domain-specific scenarios is aver-\nage due to its lack of specific domain knowl-\nedge. This issue has attracted widespread at-\ntention, but there are few relevant benchmarks\navailable. In this paper, we provide a bench-\nmark Question Answering (QA) dataset named\nMSQA, centered around Microsoft products\nand IT technical problems encountered by cus-\ntomers. This dataset contains industry cloud-\nspecific QA knowledge, an area not exten-\nsively covered in general LLMs, making it\nwell-suited for evaluating methods aiming to\nenhance LLMs\u2019 domain-specific capabilities.\nIn addition, we propose a new model inter-\naction paradigm that can empower LLM to\nachieve better performance on domain-specific\ntasks where it is not proficient. Extensive ex-\nperiments demonstrate that the approach fol-\nlowing our method outperforms the commonly\nused LLM with retrieval methods. We make\nour source code and sample data available at:\nhttps://aka.ms/Microsoft_QA.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent advancements in large language models\n(LLMs), including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 (Ouyang\net al., 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Google\u2019s\nPaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and other bench-\nmark models (Touvron et al., 2023; Taori, 2023;\nTeam, 2023), have demonstrated impressive perfor-\nmance across various natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. These models are pretrained on ex-\ntensive data, which imbues them with remarkable\nlanguage understanding and generation capabili-\nties (Bubeck et al., 2023). However, when it comes\nto domain-specific problems, LLMs exhibit limited\nperformance due to their insufficient pretraining\non domain knowledge, where the overwhelming\n\u2217 Work done during the internship at Microsoft.\npresence of domain-general data causes them to\nprioritize common knowledge, leading to a poten-\ntial oversight of crucial domain-specific informa-\ntion (Lee et al., 2023; Castro Nascimento and Pi-\nmentel, 2023; Lecler et al., 2023). Fine-tuning and\nmaintaining LLMs to incorporate domain-specific\nknowledge can be expensive for most companies\nand researchers.\nMoreover, the availability of\ndomain-specific data is often restricted and confi-\ndential, introducing risks of potential data leakage\nduring fine-tuning of LLMs (Mauran, 2023).\nThe existing works primarily focus on enhanc-\ning the performance of LLMs in specific domains\nby employing retrieval-based methods (Liu, 2022;\nShi et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023a) or external\nmodules (Wu et al., 2023; Auto-GPT, 2023) to ex-\ntract domain-specific knowledge. However, these\napproaches suffer from certain limitations. Firstly,\nretrieval-based methods face challenges in handling\ncomplex queries as they may not retrieve all the nec-\nessary domain-specific context, leading to incom-\nplete information. Additionally, retrieved chunks\ncan suffer from the issue of \u201cquote out of context\u201d\nwhere the retrieved information may not fully cap-\nture the intended meaning (Engel, 1982). As the\nexample shown in Figure 1, retrieved chunks con-\ntain keywords or spans of the question, but they do\nnot understand the question, resulting in generating\ninaccurate answers. Secondly, due to the length\nlimitation of prompts, it becomes challenging to\nincorporate all retrieved data for in-context learn-\ning. This poses a constraint on these methods in\nleveraging domain-specific knowledge.\nHumans integrate domain-specific knowledge\nwith domain-general knowledge through interac-\ntions (Siegler, 1989; Penner and Klahr, 1996; Li\net al., 2014). For example, Penner et al. (Penner\nand Klahr, 1996) conducted an experiment where\nchildren inferred factors affecting the sinking rates\nof objects. Initially, children believed weight alone\ndetermined sinking, but the experiment helped\narXiv:2305.11541v3  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2023\nGrounded Answer:\nIf the machine is Hybrid AAD \njoined, a cloud only user won\u2019t be \nable to join, as while you login to a \nHybrid AAD join machine, \u2026\nQuestion:\nWe are planning to use hybrid\njoined devices (AD&AAD) as one \nstep to a cloud-only approach \u2026 \nCan a cloud-only user logon to a \nhybrid joined computer? \u2026\n\u2026 Hybrid Azure AD joined \n|\\n\\nOn an Azure AD-joined or \nregistered device \u2026\n\u2026 ### Hybrid service \naccounts\\n\\nSome hybrid \u2026\n\u2026\nA cloud-only account can't logon \nto a hybrid joined computer.

Case details are in Table 17 in Appendix I.\nthem understand the effects of object shape and\nmaterial on sinking rates. This domain-specific\nknowledge was extracted and learned through in-\nteractive experiences with various objects, rather\nthan being conveyed through formal, abstract rules.\nInspired by this, we introduce a novel model inter-\naction paradigm that bridges domain-general and\ndomain-specific knowledge. Our approach involves\nfine-tuning a smaller LLM, i.e., LLaMA (Touvron\net al., 2023), using domain documentation to align\nit with domain-specific knowledge. At runtime, our\nfine-tuned model provides domain-specific knowl-\nedge to LLMs. This paradigm replaces traditional\nretrieval modules with the generation of domain-\nspecific knowledge, enabling easy maintenance and\nprivacy protection within the specific domain.\nIn this paper, we focus on the cloud domain and\nspecifically address question-answering (QA) tasks\nusing our proposed model interaction paradigm.\nWhile LLMs have demonstrated their effectiveness\nin QA tasks, there is limited exploration and eval-\nuation of LLMs in domain-specific QA tasks in-\nvolving long-form answers. Our contributions are\nsummarized as follows:\n\u2022 We release a cloud-domain QA dataset that\ncontains 32k QA pairs from the Microsoft\nQ&A forum2. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first cloud-domain QA dataset. We\nbelieve that this benchmarking dataset will\nassist the research community in evaluating\ntheir models in domain-specific scenarios.\n1The QA example details can be found in https://learn.\nmicrosoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2096/\n2The data is collected and post-processed from the\nMicrosoft Q&A forum (https://learn.microsoft.com/\nen-us/answers/questions/), which is publicly available.\n\u2022 We propose a new model interaction paradigm\nthat empowers the LLM with generated\ndomain-specific knowledge. Evaluation re-\nsults highlight the significant performance of\nour model interaction paradigm in generating\nanswers enriched with domain-specific knowl-\nedge, compared with retrieval-based methods.\n\u2022 We propose novel evaluation metrics for as-\nsessing long-form answers in QA tasks, which\nare aligned with human evaluations and have\nthe potential for automation evaluation.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nQuestion Answering Datasets\nQuestion\nanswering\n(QA)\n(Hirschman\nand\nGaizauskas, 2001) aims to provide answers based\non knowledge or given context. Recent advance-\nments in LLMs have shown promising results\nin various QA datasets (Wang, 2022). However,\nexisting evaluations mainly focus on answer\ntypes like multiple-choice or span extraction,\nwhich are comparatively easier to assess LLM\nperformance.\nEvaluating long-form question\nanswering (LFQA) (Fan et al., 2019; Krishna et al.,\n2021; Nakano et al., 2021; Su et al., 2022) poses\nchallenges due to limited datasets and appropriate\nevaluation metrics. In particular, LLMs are often\nnot evaluated in specific domains, and available\ndomain-specific QA datasets, such as medical (Pal\net al., 2022; Jin et al., 2019), financial (Chen et al.,\n2021), and legal domains (Zheng et al., 2021),\ntypically include questions, answers, and relevant\nparagraphs. However, in practical QA scenarios,\nthis additional contextual information may not\nalways be available. Our paper addresses this by\nreleasing an LFQA dataset specific to the cloud\ndomain, along with new evaluation metrics. Our\napproach eliminates the need for an additional\nparagraph to extract domain-specific knowledge,\nmaking it suitable for industrial applications while\nensuring data privacy.\n2.2\nAugmented Large Language Models\nRecent efforts have been made to enhance the con-\ntext generation ability of LLMs in specific domains\nby incorporating external knowledge (Mialon et al.,\n2023). One group of approaches leverages exter-\nnal modules, such as Visual ChatGPT (Wu et al.,\n2023), HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023) and Auto-\nGPT (Auto-GPT, 2023). They highly rely on the\nLLM\u2019s prompting management and the availability\nof external tools or applications. However, such\nexternal modules are not always available when\nit comes to domain-specific scenarios. Another\ngroup of approaches is retrieval-augmented (Liu,\n2022; Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Shi\net al., 2023), which leverages retrieval-based meth-\nods like BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) and dense\npassage retrieval (DPR) (Karpukhin et al., 2020).\nThis approach retrieves relevant data or text chunks,\nwhich are then used as additional context to in-\ncorporate domain-specific knowledge with LLMs,\nthus improving their performance. However, they\nmay not be able to handle complex questions\nthat require information from multiple sources or\nmodalities. Our method is able to comprehend com-\nplex questions and provide comprehensive domain-\nspecific knowledge without the \u201cquote out of con-\ntext\u201d issue.\n3\nMSQA Dataset Creation\nCurrent public Q&A forums, such as Quora, Red-\ndit, Stack Overflow, contain responses to a variety\nof open-ended questions. However, there are lim-\nited Q&A forums dedicated to specific domains\nthat have a large number of active users. In light\nof this, we chose to focus on the publicly available\nMicrosoft Q&A forum3 for our dataset creation,\nprimarily due to its extensive collection of avail-\nable questions and corresponding answers. These\ndomain-specific QAs cover a wide range of Mi-\ncrosoft technologies and products, such as Azure\nand Microsoft 365. Additionally, Microsoft of-\nfers publicly available and well-documented doc-\numentation, which serves as a valuable external\n3https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/\nresource for extracting domain-specific knowledge.\nWe make our MSQA dataset openly accessible to\nthe NLP community. We hope this resource could\nfacilitate the exploration of LLM\u2019s capabilities in\nhandling industrial domain-specific questions.\n3.1\nData Collection and Post-Processing\nWe select questions and answers spanning from\nthe Microsoft Q&A forum from October 2019 to\nMay 2023. These QA pairs went through a filtering\nprocess based on user ratings. Firstly, we retain QA\npairs where the answers were marked as \u2018Accepted\u2019.\nSecondly, we exclude QA pairs involving multi-\nturn discussions, as they are outside the scope of\nthis paper. Additionally, we focus on text-based\nQA pairs and discard samples containing image\nattachments, leaving multi-modality QA tasks for\nfuture work. Furthermore, we gather metadata of\neach QA pair, including the number of up-votes\nreceived by both the question and answer, question\ntags, and other relevant information.\nThe QA pairs obtained through the aforemen-\ntioned collection process may contain noisy in-\nformation, particularly in human-written answers.\nThis noise stems from the inclusion of irrelevant\ndetails like user names, IDs, decoration symbols,\nand platform-generated context. They introduce\nunwanted noise during the fine-tuning process. To\nmitigate this, we conduct additional data post-\nprocessing, following a set of principles detailed in\nAppendix A.\n3.2\nStatistics\nFollowing data post-processing, our dataset con-\nsists of 32k QA pairs. Table 1 summarizes the\nstatistics. Each question within the dataset is ac-\ncompanied by a diverse range of relevant topic\ntags, comprising a total of 332 distinct tags, such\nas Azure Virtual Machine, PowerPoint, Windows\nServer. These tags serve to categorize and provide\ncontextual information for the questions. To gain\na preliminary understanding of the different types\nof questions, we employ a categorization approach\nbased on the first interrogative words. The major-\nity of questions fall into the \u201cIs\u201d category, which\nseeks judgments (Is it possible to ...), while others\nrequire explanations from answers, such as \u201cHow\u201d\nor \u201cWhy\u201d. Interestingly, even \u201cIs\u201d questions often\nelicit explanatory answers. Table 8 in Appendix B\nshows randomly sampled examples of MSQA ques-\ntions based on their types.\nQuestion Tag (%)\n1st Question word (%)\nAzure\n28.55\nIs\n19.18\nWindows\n16.73\nHow\n11.91\nM365\n15.14\nWhy\n10.75\nOther\n39.58\nDo\n7.14\nAvg # of token\nCan\n6.57\nQuestion\n347.15\nWhat\n5.94\nAnswer\n382.18\nOther\n38.33\nTable 1: Statistics of MSQA\n4\nMethodology\nThe model interaction paradigm (shown in Fig-\nure 2) involves two key steps: (a) obtaining a\ndomain-specific model that incorporates aligned\nknowledge, (b) providing the generated domain-\nspecific knowledge to LLMs, enabling them to gen-\nerate answers enriched with domain knowledge.\nIn the first step, we pre-train small language mod-\nels4 using the publicly available Azure documenta-\ntion5. This documentation serves as a comprehen-\nsive knowledge base for Microsoft Azure, contain-\ning cloud-domain knowledge of Microsoft\u2019s cloud\nproducts. Note that Microsoft maintains extensive\ndocumentation covering various product offerings.\nHowever, we specifically focus on Azure documen-\ntation as it aligns with the prevalent tags related to\nAzure found in the Q&A forum, which captures the\nmost frequently asked questions (shown in Table 1).\nBy narrowing down our focus to Azure, we aim\nto evaluate the efficacy of our model interaction\nparadigm within a well-defined domain.\nAfter completing the pre-training phase, we\nimbue the small language models with domain-\nspecific knowledge from the Azure knowledge base.\nWe then adapt the model to the LFQA task through\ninstruction tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022), allow-\ning it to specialize and become more accurate in\nthe QA task. To facilitate instruction tuning, we\nconstruct instructions from the training set of the\nMSQA dataset. Each instruction consists of a three-\nelement tuple, including an instruction prompt, an\ninput query or statement, and a corresponding re-\nsponse. The instruction template is shown in Ta-\nble 2 (Appendix C shows an example instruction).\nThe details of the training setup and parameters can\nbe found in Appendix D.\n4We use LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) in this paper.\n5https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs\nLM\nPre-trained LM\nDomain-specific LM\nDomain-specific \ndocumentation\nInstructions\nOffline\nStep 1: obtain the domain-specific model\nStep 2: LLM incorporates domain knowledge and generate answer\nDomain knowledge\nLLM\nAnswer\nOnline\nQuestion\nDomain-specific LM\nFigure 2: The model interaction framework.\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a\nresponse that appropriately completes the request.\nInstruction: Please answer the following questions\nconcerning {Tags}.\nInput: {Question}\nResponse: {Answer}\nTable 2: The instruction template.\nBy engaging in instruction tuning, the pre-\ntrained small LM learns and assimilates domain-\nspecific knowledge, enabling it to generate rele-\nvant responses when encountering domain-specific\nqueries or statements.\nIn the second step, the fine-tuned domain-\nspecific language model serves as an expert in\nAzure. During runtime, the domain-specific LM\nleverages its knowledge to provide domain-relevant\ninformation in response to a given question. Then\nthe LLM takes both the question and the domain\nknowledge to generate the final response. By en-\nriching the LLMs with domain-specific knowledge,\ntheir comprehension of the question context is en-\nhanced, resulting in more accurate and contextually\nappropriate responses. Note that our approach does\nnot propose replacing the LLM with a domain-\nspecific LM. Instead, we propose a model inter-\naction paradigm, leveraging the domain-specific\nLM as an expert to provide knowledge. Through\nour application practice, we have observed that\ndomain-specific knowledge may not excel in lan-\nguage expression and general question answering,\nas questions may contain both Azure-related and\ngeneral queries. Additionally, our domain-specific\nmodel can function as a compatible plugin within\nthe existing retrieval-based system, offering supple-\nmentary information beyond just chunks.\n5\nExperiment\n5.1\nBaselines\nWe leveraged two LLMs,\nnamely GPT-3.5\n(gpt-35-turbo) and GPT-4 (gpt-4), as the back-\nbone to output the answer by taking the extra in-\nformation from either the data-retrieval methods or\nour approach. We utilize two data retrieval meth-\nods, i.e., BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) and dense\npassage retrieval (DPR) (Karpukhin et al., 2020).\nThese methods were employed to retrieve the top-3\nrelevant information chunks from Azure documen-\ntation, which were then used as supplementary in-\nformation for the backbone LLMs during answer\ngeneration. We make the below baselines:\nRaw LLM (LLM). Questions were directly posed\nto the backbone LLMs without providing any addi-\ntional information.\nLLM+BM25/+DPR. The LLM incorporated both\nthe question and retrieved chunks using BM25 and\nDPR, respectively.\nLLM+EXP. The LLM utilized the domain knowl-\nedge from our domain-specific LM as extra infor-\nmation to generate answers.\nAppendix E shows the baseline prompt details.\n5.2\nEvaluation Metrics\nEvaluating long-form generated answers lacks an\nautomatic metric, and thus, we employ standard\nmetrics, our proposed metrics, and human evalua-\ntion to assess the quality of the generated answers.\nLexical-Overlap-Based\nMetrics.\nWe\nem-\nploy BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-1,\nROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and ME-\nTEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), as the lexical-\noverlap-based metrics to measure the N-gram\nalignment between the generated answers and the\ngrounded answers.\nSemantic-Overlap-Based Metrics. To evaluate\nthe semantic overlap between the generated an-\nswers and the ground truth, we utilize BERT-\nScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and report F1 score.\nAdditionally, we calculate the similarity between\nthe embedding of the grounded answer and the em-\nbedding of the generated answer, referred to as the\nSIM metric.\nBesides\nthe\nabove\nmetrics,\nwe\npropose\nthree novel metrics for the LFQA scenario:\nKeyword/Span-Hit-Rate (KHR). We extract key-\nwords or spans from the grounded answer, remov-\ning those presented in the question. This yields\na distinct keyword/span set, and we measure the\nrate of hits in the generated response (Table 12 in\nAppendix E shows the prompt).\nCan-Answer-Rate (CAR). To prevent answer hal-\nlucinations, we require the backbone LLMs to an-\nswer only when confident. CAR represents the\npercentage of answerable questions and evaluates\nthe informativeness of extra information provided\nby data-retrieval methods or our approach.\nLLM-based Metrics. LLMs have demonstrated\nimpressive performance as evaluators and annota-\ntors in recent studies (Wang et al., 2022; Chiang\net al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023b). In our work, we\nemploy an LLM as an evaluator to compare and\nrank two responses based on their similarity to the\ngrounded answer (see full prompt in Appendix F.1).\nHowever, concerns have been raised regarding the\nreliability of LLMs as evaluators due to their sen-\nsitivity to response positions (Wang et al., 2023).\nTo address this issue, we incorporate the chain-of-\nthought concept (Wei et al., 2022) in our prompt\ndesign, which involves providing detailed explana-\ntions before scoring the responses. Moreover, we\npropose a rule where we trust the LLM evaluator\nonly when the score gap exceeds 1 (excluding 1),\nallowing for a single round of scoring. Otherwise,\nwe conduct two scoring rounds, switching response\npositions, and rank them based on the average score\nof the two rounds. Note that GPT-4 exhibits signif-\nicantly fewer conflict cases compared to GPT-3.5,\nleading us to select GPT-4 as the evaluator. Fur-\nther details of the score gap study are available in\nAppendix F.2.\nHuman Evaluation. There still requires human\nevaluation as there is a lack of good metrics of\nlong-form answers (Fan et al., 2019; Krishna et al.,\n2021). We evaluate a small subset of test samples\n(30 randomly sampled QA pairs). Five evaluators\nwith domain knowledge are given QA pairs and\nthree responses from different methods. They are\nasked to rank these three responses based on their\nsimilarity with the grounded answer. The evalua-\ntion setup and user interface are in Appendix G.\n6\nResults\nAs suggested in (Krishna et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2023)\nand our experiments, the lexical-overlap-based met-\nrics are not an informative way to evaluate the\nquality of LLM-generated answers due to their\npoor correlation with grounded human-written an-\nswers. As shown in Table 15 and 16 in Appendix H,\nthe lexical-overlap-based scores demonstrate fewer\nMetrics (%)\nLLM\nLLM+BM25\nLLM+DPR\nLLM+EXP\nBERT-Score\n52.47\n53.83\n54.94\n56.21\nSIM\n61.84\n62.46\n64.87\n67.08\nKHR\n22.53\n23.25\n24.30\n24.61\nCAR\n98.37\n92.07\n95.34\n99.77\nTable 3: The results of semantic-overlap-based metrics\nover different methods with GPT-3.5 as backbone LLM.\nMetrics (%)\nLLM\nLLM+BM25\nLLM+DPR\nLLM+EXP\nBERT-Score\n51.79\n52.33\n54.83\n56.91\nSIM\n67.94\n68.30\n68.78\n71.19\nKHR\n30.40\n32.15\n32.50\n33.13\nCAR\n76.22\n73.89\n87.41\n99.30\nTable 4: The results of semantic-overlap-based metrics\nover different methods with GPT-4 as backbone LLM.\nvariations across different methods, and the scores\nare low in general, suggesting that these metrics\nare not suited.\nTable 3 and 4 show the results of semantic-\noverlap-based metrics, i.e. BERT-Score and SIM,\nwith GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 serving as the back-\nbone LLMs for answer generation, respectively.\nThe worst performance is observed for Raw LLM,\nhighlighting the usefulness of extra information\nprovided through data-retrieval methods or our\nmethod. LLM+DPR has better performance than\nLLM+BM25, and our LLM+EXP achieves the best\nperformance. Note that the difference between\nRaw LLM and other baselines is relatively small,\npossibly due to the pre-training of LLMs, which\nalready contains some knowledge related to Mi-\ncrosoft Azure.\nOur KHR metric has a similar\npattern as the lexical-overlap-based metric. How-\never, we observe that CAR is initially high for Raw\nLLM with GPT-3.5 (Table 3), but decreases when\nextra information from data-retrieval methods is\nprovided. This suggests that GPT-3.5 may exhibit\nblind confidence, leading to potential answer hal-\nlucinations. By incorporating extra information,\nit gains access to relevant information and is not\nsolely reliant on its own knowledge. In contrast,\nGPT-4 demonstrates superior performance and is\nnot blindly confident in its answers, even without\nextra information (76.22% CAR in Table 4). Note\nthat responses that cannot answer the question, e.g.,\n\u201cSorry, I cannot give a confident answer.\u201d, are ex-\ncluded when calculating other metrics.\nLLM+DPR performs better than LLM+BM25,\nas indicated by the previous analysis. Hence, we se-\nlect LLM+DPR as the representative data-retrieval\nmethod for both LLM-based metric evaluation and\nhuman evaluation to optimize resources and reduce\nhuman efforts.

The favor rate means the percent-\nage of a certain method selected as the best over\nthe test set. Table 6 shows the human evaluation\nresult with at least two agreements among evalua-\ntors. Similar to the LLM-based metric, LLM+EXP\nshows the best performance in the favor rate and\nthe average ranking. Moreover, LLM+EXP has\nthe least \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d rate, representing the con-\nfidence of the human evaluators. The agreement\nanalysis in Appendix G.2 shows that human eval-\nuation is reliable and consistent among evaluators.\nThe results align with the LLM-based metric, high-\nlighting the significant performance of our method\nand the potential of using the LLM-based metric as\nan automation evaluation. We present case studies\nin Appendix I to give a comprehensive comparison\nof different methods. The retrieved-based methods\ntend to provide scattered and often \u201cquote out of\ncontext\u201d chunks. In contrast, the domain knowl-\nedge from our method offers more concise and\nrelevant information, with a significantly shorter\nlength compared with the retrieved chunks.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we deal with the challenge of em-\npowering LLMs with domain-specific knowledge,\nenabling them to accurately answer questions in\nindustrial scenarios.\nDue to the limited avail-\nability of relevant benchmarks, we introduce the\nMSQA dataset, tailored for cloud domain QA.\nOur novel model interaction paradigm effectively\nequips LLMs with domain-specific knowledge,\nbridging the gap between general models and indus-\ntry demands. Experiments demonstrate and high-\nlight the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in\nstandard and newly proposed metrics.\nLimitations\nIt is essential to discuss the limitations of this pa-\nper. One primary limitation is the dataset used for\nexperimentation is confined to Microsoft Azure. It\npotentially impacts the generalizability of the pro-\nposed model interaction paradigm in other domain-\nspecific scenarios. Another limitation is the pa-\nrameter tuning in instruction tuning. It is unlike\npre-training, where we have a large amount of data\nto perform a few epochs to make the model imbue\nAzure domain knowledge. In instruction tuning, it\nis challenging to set the number of epochs prop-\nerly. There still lacks a well-defined and automated\nmetric to evaluate LFQA in order to select good\ncheckpoints with less effort. From our practice,\nsetting a large max token length and more epochs\ndoes not necessarily make a better model. More-\nover, this paper focuses on text-based QA, exclud-\ning QA scenarios with image attachments. Lastly,\nthe proposed model is trained and evaluated exclu-\nsively in English, while the Microsoft Q&A forum\nincludes QAs in other languages. These limitations\nconstrain the applicability of our model to other\nlanguages and multi-modality scenarios.\nEthics Statement\nAlthough we use language models trained on data\ncollected from the web, which have been shown\nto have issues with gender bias and abusive lan-\nguage, we have taken significant precautions to\nensure the ethical integrity of our research. Our\npre-training and instruction-tuning data have been\ncarefully verified to exclude any toxic text, and we\ncollected the data from the Microsoft Q&A forum,\nwhere engineering experts and administrators take\nmoderation and inspection. We have implemented\nrigorous filtering mechanisms and conducted thor-\nough validation to remove inappropriate content\nand any user information. All data used, includ-\ning human evaluation data, is anonymized and pro-\ncessed in compliance with privacy regulations, with\nno disclosure of personally identifiable information.\nWhile acknowledging the limitations and the need\nfor ongoing research, we are dedicated to advanc-\ning responsible and unbiased AI technologies and\nwelcome any inquiries regarding the ethical aspects\nof our work.\nReferences\nAuto-GPT. 2023.\nAuto-gpt:\nAn autonomous\ngpt-4\nexperiment.\nhttps://github.com/\nSignificant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.\nAccessed:\n2023-05-15.\nSatanjeev Banerjee and Alon Lavie. 2005.

When does pre-\ntraining help? assessing self-supervised learning for\nlaw and the casehold dataset of 53,000+ legal hold-\nings. In Proceedings of the eighteenth international\nconference on artificial intelligence and law, pages\n159\u2013168.\nA\nData Post-Processing\nDue to the fact that the data is collected from an on-\nline Q&A forum, the context of answers is usually\ncomplex and includes a large number of decorative\nsymbols and platform-generated content, which\nmakes the data not easy to use and causes poten-\ntial noise in fine-tuning. To address this issue, we\nconducted a deep sampling of the collected data\nin order to summarize the existing problems and\nidentify their patterns. We design the following\ndata filtering pipeline:\n\u2022 Remove user-related information, such as\nusernames and IDs, e.g., bob@1234567, as\nthese personal details are irrelevant to the QA\ncontent and contain noise. For example, in-\ncluding such information in the instruction-\ntuning data would make fine-tuned model out-\nput answers starts with hallucinated user name\nand IDs. Additionally, removing this informa-\ntion helps protect privacy.\n\u2022 Standardize all links appearing in the data ac-\ncording to the Markdown link reference syn-\ntax, organizing them into a unified format, i.e.,\n[description](link). We find these links\nare also meaningful, and the model could ex-\ntract information from the context of the links.\nThe fine-tuned model generates relevant and\nvalid links in the response.\n\u2022 Remove platform-generated contents, such as\n\"\u2013please\ndon\u2019t\nforget\nto\nupvote and Accept as answer\nif the reply is helpful\u2013\"\n\u2022 Remove irregular decorative symbols added\nby users, such as \"****\" for separation.\n\u2022 Address different types of line breaks and han-\ndling consecutive multiple line breaks. We\nadopted a strategy to replace consecutive mul-\ntiple line breaks with a single line break, while\npreserving the integrity of code blocks by not\nmerging multiple spaces within them.\n\u2022 Detect image links in questions and remove\nsamples with screenshots. This dataset fo-\ncuses solely on plain text, with multimodal\ndata exploration reserved for future work.\n\u2022 Detect the length of questions and specifically\nlabel samples with questions exceeding 8192\ntokens, as these may require special handling\nor truncation for current models.\nFor reference, Figure 3 provides an example of\ndata post-processing, showcasing the removal of\nuser names and platform-generated context.\nFigure 3: An example of data post-processing. The\nhighlighted red part is removed in post-processing.\nBy implementing this data filtering pipeline, we\naim to improve the quality and usability of the\ncollected data for research purposes.\nB\nStatistics and Question Samples\nAs shown in Table 7, the average length of ques-\ntions is 347.15 tokens, whereas the average length\nof answers is 382.18 tokens. Additionally, based on\nthe analysis conducted, the average upvote counts\nare 0.05 for questions, 0.26 for answers, and 0.32\nfor samples. Upvotes serve as an indicator of the\ncontent\u2019s perceived value by other users within the\ncommunity, and these counts have been collected\nand calculated independently.\nWe randomly sampled questions based on their\ntypes as shown in Table 8.\nC\nInstruction Tuning\nBelow is an instruction example used in the instruc-\ntion tuning:\n\"Below\nis\nan\ninstruction\nthat\ndescribes\na\ntask.\nWrite\na\nresponse\nthat\nappropriately\ncompletes the request\nStatistic\nValue\n#data\n32252\n#tags\n332\nAvg. #questions per tag\n97.36\nAvg. #tags per question\n1.35\nAvg. #tokens per question\n347.15\nAvg. #tokens per answer\n382.18\nAvg. #upvotes per question\n0.05\nAvg. #upvotes per answer\n0.26\nAvg. #upvotes per sample\n0.32\nTable 7: Additional statistics of MSQA\nInstruction:\nPlease answer the\nfollowing\nquestions\nconcerning\nAzure Virtual Machines.\nInput: I have set Auto shut down\ntime for my VM as 00:30 local\ntime.

If you update\nthe auto shutdown schedule for\nyour\nVM\nwithin\n30\nminutes\nof\nthe previously scheduled shutdown\ntime, the new shutdown time takes\neffect the next day.\"\nD\nTraining Setup and Parameters\nThe source code, configurations, and data asso-\nciated with our work can be accessed at: https:\n//aka.ms/Microsoft_QA. Both the pre-training\nand instruction tuning are conducted in a V100\n32GB node with 8 GPUs. The DeepSpeed6 frame-\nwork was employed for the training process.\nDuring the pre-training phase, we employed un-\nsupervised learning with a next-word prediction\ntraining approach. We split the Azure documen-\ntation into 184,655 samples for pre-training. The\npre-training parameters were set as follows: 8 train-\ning epochs, a maximum token length of 512, a\nbatch size of 64, and a learning rate of 2e\u22125 with\na cosine decaying scheduler. To ensure efficient\nprocessing, the Azure documentation was divided\ninto separate samples, each with a maximum to-\nken length of 512 and no overlap. Image links and\nrelative links to other Azure markdown files were\nremoved, while clickable links were retained.\n6https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed\nIs\nLooking at migration and also backup/restore options for ConfigMgr. Historically, Microsoft\ndo not support either of the below for ConfigMgr Primary servers:\n\u2022 **Migration to VM method**; Physical to Virtual (P2V)\n\u2022 **Backup method**; VM snapshots\nIs that still the case for both these scenarios?\nHow\nHow to have administrator reset password for ADB2C user?

Is there no need for multiple \"instances\" like there is\nfor pass-through Authentication?

However,\nmany users already have an E3 license. The issue occurs when a user is logged into OWA\nand is connecting to our on-premise exchange server. When they receive an O365 link (e.g.,\n[https://forms.office.com/](https://forms.office.com/)), the user gets the error, \u2019You do not have\npermission to view or respond to this form\u2019, even though the user has an E3 license. When they\nopen up an incognito window and sign into O365 with the same credentials, everything works\nflawlessly. If someone could explain the theory behind how this works, that would be great.\nWhat is the difference between these two credentials even though the credentials are exactly\nthe same? Thank you.\nTable 8: Examples of questions randomly sampled by their types. The questions are highlighted .\nIn the instruction-tuning phase, we selected QA\npairs that had tags related to Azure, resulting in\na dataset of 10,089 samples.\nTo split the data\ninto train and test sets, we computed the TF-IDF\nsimilarity between each pair of questions and ex-\ncluded questions with high similarity from the test\nset. Consequently, the training set comprised 9,517\nsamples, while the test set contained 572 samples.\nWe restrict the number of the test set considering\nthe generation and evaluation cost with LLMs. The\ninstruction tuning parameters were set as follows:\n3 epochs, a maximum token length of 512, a batch\nsize of 64, and a learning rate of 1e\u22125 with a cosine\ndecaying scheduler. Note that we utilized a smaller\nnumber of epochs in the instruction-tuning process\ncompared to pre-training to mitigate the risk of\noverfitting the training questions and answers.\nE\nBaseline and Metric Prompts\nIn this section, we list the prompts of baselines:\nLLM, LLM+BM25/DPR, and LLM+EXP from Ta-\nble 9 to Table 11.\n[System]\nAs a helpful assistant, your task is to create responses\nto the user\u2019s questions.

Fig-\nure 4 shows the percentage of conflict and non-\nconflict cases when using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as\nevaluators, respectively. Note that each sample has\ntwo scoring rounds, and if a conflict arises between\nthese two rounds, both rounds are labeled as con-\nflict. Notably, the GPT-4 evaluator exhibits a sig-\nnificantly lower conflict rate compared to GPT-3.5.\nThen, we select GPT-4 as our preferred evaluator.\nFurthermore, we observe that conflicts mostly oc-\ncur within a score gap range of 0-2. On the other\nhand, we calculate the conflict/non-conflict ratio\nfor each score gap value (see Table 14). When the\nscore gap is 0 or 1, the ratio indicates a high proba-\nbility of conflict. Based on these observations, we\npropose a rule where we trust the LLM evaluator\nonly when the score gap exceeds 1. Otherwise, we\nconduct two scoring rounds by switching response\npositions and rank them based on the average score\nof two rounds. This approach mitigates scoring\nconflicts and ensures a reliable and efficient evalua-\ntion process, primarily relying on a single scoring\nround for most cases.\nG\nHuman Evaluation\nG.1\nEvaluation Setup and User Interface\nTo ensure reliable evaluations, we randomly select\na small subset of test samples consisting of 30 QA\npairs. During the selection process, we exclude\nQA pairs that have grounded answers containing\nlinks or phrases such as \"the answer is not sup-\nported in Microsoft Q&A forum.\" These types of\ngrounded answers are not suitable for meaningful\ncomparisons.\nTo conduct the evaluations, we engage crowd-\nworkers who possess expertise in the cloud domain\nand are familiar with Microsoft products. We em-\nploy five such evaluators. Each sample receives five\nindependent evaluations from these qualified eval-\nuators. We consider an evaluation reliable when\nthere is agreement among at least two out of the\nfive evaluators.\nFigure 5 shows the user interface (UI) of human\nevaluation in our study. The UI presents the com-\nponents involved in evaluating a single sample. It\nbegins with the display of a QA pair, followed by\nthree responses generated by different methods. To\nminimize any potential bias, the positions of the\nresponses are shuffled randomly for each sample\nevaluation. This ensures that the evaluator does\nnot implicitly associate a particular response with a\nspecific method. The evaluator\u2019s task is to rank the\nposition of each response based on its similarity to\nthe grounded answer. As the rank is assigned to\neach response individually, it is possible for two\nresponses to receive the same rank. For example,\nboth Response 1 and Response 2 can be assigned\nRank 1 if they are equally similar to the grounded\nanswer. This flexibility allows for a more nuanced\nevaluation and accommodates cases where multi-\nple responses are equally relevant or accurate. The\nevaluators are also provided the \"I don\u2019t know\" op-\ntion if they do not have a confident evaluation of\nthe sample. Before proceeding with the evaluation\nof the 30 test samples, each evaluator is given a sep-\narate test sample to familiarize themselves with the\nevaluation process. This preliminary test sample\nserves as a practice round, allowing the evaluators\nto become acquainted with the evaluation criteria\nand interface.\nFigure 5: The user interface template of human evalu-\nation.

Although BLEU and METEOR indicate\nbetter performance for LLM+EXP, the differences\nare not significant.

The grounded answer is negative,\nas only users with both on-prem and cloud presence\ncan log on to hybrid AAD. We compare the results\nobtained from retrieved chunks and our domain\nknowledge generated from the domain-specific LM.\nThe data-retrieved chunks contain scattered infor-\nmation related to keywords in the question, such as\nAAD joined devices and configurations of hybrid\nAAD joined devices. However, they do not directly\naddress the question of whether cloud-only users\ncan log on to hybrid AAD joined devices. On the\nother hand, our domain knowledge provides a di-\nrect answer, stating that users require an on-prem\naccount to log on to hybrid joined devices. Incorpo-\nrating this extra information results in significantly\ndifferent responses, with data-retrieval+LLM sug-\ngesting it is a configuration issue.\nTable 18 presents another question asking about\nobtaining metrics for specific blob containers\u2019\ntransactions and the affected files. The grounded\nanswer recommends using Log Analytics to ag-\ngregate statistics from logs, a method not avail-\nable in the Azure portal. The retrieved chunks\ngathered information on Azure Storage and Azure\nMonitor Metrics but did not offer a clear approach\nfor obtaining specific metrics for blob containers.\nConsequently, data-retrieval+LLM responses sug-\ngested that the metrics could be obtained through\nthe Azure portal and erroneously mentioned Azure\nStorage Analytics as a possible solution. On the\nother hand, our response from the domain-specific\nLM explicitly suggests utilizing Azure Log Analyt-\nics and provides a step-by-step guideline, aligning\nwith the grounded answer.\nQuestion\nCloud-only account on hybrid joined device?\nHello everyone,\nwe are planning to use hybrid joined devices (AD & AAD) in future as one step (of\nmany) to a cloud-only approach.\nWhat we are currently wondering (because it\u2019s not working in the lab environment):\nCan a cloud-only user logon to a hybrid joined computer?

Counterfactuals are hypothetical situations\nthat can lead to a different decision or choice. In this paper,\nthe authors frame the counterfactual search problem as a\ndesign recommendation tool that can help identify modi\ufb01ca-\ntions to a design, leading to better functional performance.\nMCD improves upon existing counterfactual search methods by\nsupporting multi-objective queries, which are crucial in design\nproblems, and by decoupling the counterfactual search and\nsampling processes, thus enhancing ef\ufb01ciency and facilitating\nobjective tradeoff visualization. The paper demonstrates MCD\u2019s\ncore functionality using a two-dimensional test case, followed\nby three case studies of bicycle design that showcase MCD\u2019s\neffectiveness in real-world design problems. In the \ufb01rst case study,\nMCD excels at recommending modi\ufb01cations to query designs\nthat can signi\ufb01cantly enhance functional performance, such as\nweight savings and improvements to the structural safety factor.\nThe second case study demonstrates that MCD can work with a\npre-trained language model to suggest design changes based on a\nsubjective text prompt effectively. Lastly, the authors task MCD\nwith increasing a query design\u2019s similarity to a target image and\ntext prompt while simultaneously reducing weight and improving\nstructural performance, demonstrating MCD\u2019s performance on\na complex multimodal query. Overall, MCD has the potential to\nprovide valuable recommendations for practitioners and design\nautomation researchers looking for answers to their \u201cWhat\nif\u201d questions by exploring hypothetical design modi\ufb01cations\nand their impact on multiple design objectives. The code, test\nproblems, and datasets used in the paper are available to the\npublic at decode.mit.edu/projects/counterfactuals/.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nModifying existing designs to generate new ones is an\nessential aspect of various engineering sectors, such as\naerospace, automotive, architecture, pharmaceuticals, con-\nsumer goods, and many others. Design modi\ufb01cation signif-\nicantly impacts the performance, ef\ufb01ciency, and safety of\nengineered systems. Effective methods for design modi\ufb01cation\ncan lead to more sustainable and environmentally friendly\ntechnologies, better transportation systems, and safer infras-\ntructure. Furthermore, improved design modi\ufb01cation methods\ncan enable cost savings and improved ef\ufb01ciency, making\nproducts more accessible and affordable for society. However,\ncoming up with good design modi\ufb01cations can be challenging,\nas it requires navigating huge design spaces and making nu-\nmerous trade-offs between competing objectives. Often there\nare too many design attributes and potential modi\ufb01cations to\nconsider. Not surprisingly, designers often struggle with the\navailable choices and may often ask themselves, \u201cWhat if?\u201d.\nAs a designer, the ability to ask \u201cWhat if?\u201d questions\nis crucial in the iterative process of design modi\ufb01cation.\nBy exploring hypothetical scenarios, designers can identify\nopportunities to improve design performance and functionality.\nHowever, answering \u201cWhat if?\u201d questions can be challenging\nas it requires considering an extensive range of potential\nmodi\ufb01cations and their effects on multiple design objectives.\nCounterfactuals are a powerful reasoning tool that allows\ndesigners to ask such questions by exploring hypothetical\ndesign modi\ufb01cations and their impact on multiple design\nobjectives.\nA counterfactual is a hypothetical situation that depicts\nwhat could have happened if a speci\ufb01c event or action did\nnot occur. It requires envisioning an alternate reality where\na different choice or decision was made and analyzing the\ndifferences in results. Counterfactuals are often employed in\nreasoning, decision-making, and causal inference. They aid in\ncomprehending the impact of particular events or actions on\noutcomes and considering the rami\ufb01cations of various choices.\nCounterfactuals are typically employed to understand how\nan outcome would change given a different set of actions.\nThis style of counterfactual can be applied to design problems\nto answer questions like: \u201cHow would the performance of\nthis design change if I modi\ufb01ed this particular attribute?\u201d\nThere are many tools to predict these \u2018classic\u2019 counterfactuals,\nsuch as simulations and predictive models. In this work, we\ninstead consider an \u2018inverse\u2019 counterfactual problem, which\nstates: \u201cWhat events would have needed to occur to result in\nthis other outcome?\u201d In design contexts, this often equates\nto the question: \u201cWhat attributes of my design would I need\nto change to achieve a particular performance target, design\nclassi\ufb01cation, or functional requirement?\u201d\nThis paper proposes an approach to answer such \u2018inverse\u2019\ncounterfactual hypotheticals using multi-objective optimiza-\ntion. Our proposed approach, Multi-Objective Counterfactuals\nfor Design (MCD), allows users to input a design and a set\nof desired attributes, then recommends targeted modi\ufb01cations\nto the design to achieve these attributes. It identi\ufb01es these\nmodi\ufb01cations by querying a set of attribute predictors in a\ndirected search procedure dictated by an evolutionary algo-\nrithm. We demonstrate how predictors ranging from machine\narXiv:2305.11308v1  [cs.AI]  18 May 2023\nlearning regressors to text embedding models can support\ntarget attributes ranging from functional performance targets\nto subjective text requirements.\nMCD can be viewed as an AI design assistant that allows\nusers to ask challenging objective and subjective questions\nabout an existing design, such as: \u201cWhat modi\ufb01cations would\nit take to make this product 10% lighter?\u201d, \u201cWhat would make\nmy design look like this other concept?\u201d, or \u201cHow would my\ndesign need to change to look more sleek and futuristic?\u201d\nBy enabling designers to interact with AI systems simply and\nintuitively, counterfactuals open the doors to more successful\nhuman-AI collaboration by enhancing and accelerating the\ndesign process. A block diagram demonstrating MCD\u2019s an-\nticipated usage scenario is shown in Figure 1.\nA particularly related body of research to our work is coun-\nterfactual explanations, originally developed as a tool to inter-\npret black-box machine learning (ML) models. Counterfactual\nexplanations allow practitioners to understand the behavior of\notherwise uninterpretable models by asking questions about\ncounterfactual scenarios. A classic motivating example for\ncounterfactual explanations involves a model that is deciding\nwhether to approve a loan, where the applicant may ask:\n\u201cWhat would I need to change for this model to approve my\napplication?\u201d Broadly speaking, these counterfactuals answer a\nvery versatile question: \u201cHypothetically, what would I need to\nchange about the input to my model for it to predict another\noutcome?\u201d Many of the common challenges that designers\nface can be framed as such a question. For example, given a\nmodel that predicts the functional performance of a design, a\ndesigner can ask how to change the design to achieve some\ndesired functional performance. Despite this, counterfactual\nexplanations have not yet been used in design engineering\nproblems, to the best of our knowledge1.\nIn this paper, we showcase our MCD method and demon-\nstrate that counterfactual search is a simple yet powerful AI-\ndriven design tool that real designers can leverage for a variety\nof tasks. To do so, we make several key contributions, which\nwe summarize as follows:\n1) We introduce Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for De-\nsign (MCD), a new method to search for counterfactual\ndesign modi\ufb01cations to achieve desired outcomes. We\nformulate MCD as a multi-objective search problem to\nminimize the magnitude and extent of the modi\ufb01cations,\nencourage proximity to the data manifold, and satisfy\nuser-provided multi-modal requirements.\n2) We demonstrate that MCD effectively suggests targeted\ndesign modi\ufb01cations to improve the functional perfor-\nmance of query designs, illustrating that counterfactual\nsearch could be viewed as an effective design recom-\nmendation tool.\n3) We present the \ufb01rst text and image-based counterfactual\nsearch in design using the Contrastive Language-Image\n1A search for the term \u201ccounterfactual explanations\u201d on the entire ASME\ndigital collection, that includes design venues such as the IDETC conference\nand the Journal of Mechanical Design, returns zero results on March 10, 2023.\nFig. 1: Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD) is\na human-AI collaborative design recommendation tool. Users\nprovide an initial design and a set of counterfactual attributes\nthey would like to achieve. MCD queries a set of attribute\npredictors to search for a set of diverse modi\ufb01cations to the\noriginal design that achieve the counterfactual attributes.\nPre-training (CLIP) method. These cross-modal queries\nwere previously not possible with existing counterfactual\nmethods.\n4) We demonstrate that MCD can effectively handle mul-\ntimodal queries, including a mixed-variable text, image,\nand parametric query, the \ufb01rst example of multimodal\nqueries to a counterfactual search model, to our knowl-\nedge.\nII. BACKGROUND\nCounterfactuals are a useful tool for investigating causality\nand forecasting the potential outcomes of different actions.\nCounterfactuals have been extensively used in various \ufb01elds,\nincluding psychology, philosophy, social sciences, and ma-\nchine learning as they offer a valuable tool for examining\ncausality and understanding the consequences of actions [1].\nIn psychology, counterfactual thinking has been studied in\nrelation to emotions, such as regret and disappointment. In phi-\nlosophy, counterfactuals have been used to explore questions\nof determinism and free will. In social sciences, counterfactual\nanalysis is widely used to evaluate the impact of policies\nand interventions. Counterfactual explanations are also gaining\ntraction in the \ufb01eld of machine learning as a means to improve\nthe interpretability and fairness of machine learning models.\nIn this literature review, we discuss three key areas that\nrelate closely to our work \u2014 1) explainability and counter-\nfactuals in machine learning, 2) multi-objective optimization\napproaches to counterfactuals, and, 3) a multi-modal, zero-\nshot machine learning model that enables us to capture user\nrequirements.\nA. Explainability and Counterfactuals in Machine Learning\nCounterfactual explanations are frequently used as a ma-\nchine learning explainability tool. In machine learning, par-\nticularly deep learning, predictions are often mysterious and\nintractable. To remedy this intractability, a wealth of ma-\nchine learning \u2018explainability\u2019 tools have been proposed in\nrecent years. One common approach involves determining\nthe sensitivity of the output with respect to the various\ninput parameters (features), a technique known as \u2018feature\nimportance.\u2019 Some popular methods in this category include\nLocal Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) [2]\nand Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) [3]. In the design\nautomation community, these methods are often used to deter-\nmine which design parameters have outsized impacts on design\nperformance [4]\u2013[7] or which parameters are important for\nrelationships between products [8]. Another common approach\nto explainability involves visualizing a model\u2019s decisions in\nsome way. This technique lends itself well to data modalities\nthat are easily appreciated visually, such as images, for which\nsaliency maps are a common explainability method [9]\u2013[11].\nCounterfactuals were \ufb01rst proposed for machine learning\n(ML) explainability by Wachter et al. [12]. Since then, re-\nsearchers have proposed a wealth of counterfactual explanation\napproaches, which Verma et al. [1] and Guidotti et al. [13]\nreview. Among the popular methods are Diverse Counter-\nfactual Explanations (DiCE) [14], Feasible and Actionable\nCounterfactual Explanations (FACE) [15], and Multi-Objective\nCounterfactuals (MOC) [16]. Counterfactuals make for a great\nexplainability tool since they allow users to intuitively under-\nstand the ML model\u2019s internal decision thresholds (i.e. \u201cWhere\ndoes my model start predicting a different outcome?\u201d). Much\nlike LIME and SHAP, many counterfactuals take a localized\napproach, with some even \ufb01tting local approximations to the\ndata manifold to guide their explanations [17]. Counterfactuals\nhave most commonly been proposed for tabular data, but\nhave also been applied to images [18] and text [19], among\nother modalities. In general, good counterfactual explanations\nshould typically demonstrate the following properties:\n1) Validity: First and foremost, a good counterfactual ex-\nplanation should result in the desired outcome. Depend-\ning on the nature of the problem, this desired outcome\nmay be a class, an inequality, a range, an exact equality,\nor some combination of the above. For example, if\nwe are querying a model that predicts the mass of a\ndesign and we specify a range of 2-3 kg, a proposed\ncounterfactual should have a predicted mass in this\nrange.\n2) Sparsity: Good counterfactuals should be easy to real-\nize, meaning that they should not change many features\nof the query. Sparsity refers to the number of features\nthat must be modi\ufb01ed to realize a counterfactual.\n3) Proximity: While the number of modi\ufb01cations needed\nto realize a counterfactual is an important consideration,\nthe extent of these modi\ufb01cations is also important.\nIn simple terms, we would like counterfactuals to be\nas similar to the query as possible. This is typically\nquanti\ufb01ed as a distance to the original query.\n4) Manifold Proximity: In the classic usage of counterfac-\ntuals as an ML explainer, a predictive model has been\ntrained on a dataset and is being iteratively queried by\nthe counterfactual model. If queries lie too far from\nthe data manifold on which the predictor was trained,\npredictions (and by extension counterfactuals) will no\nlonger be accurate. In other use cases where the coun-\nterfactual is not explaining a statistical model, manifold\nproximity may not be desirable.\n5) Actionability: In many problems, certain input parame-\nters may not be changeable, but will nonetheless play\na role in the output of the model. For example, the\nweight of the rider will play a signi\ufb01cant role in the\nstructural loading of a bicycle. However, when designing\na bicycle, we can\u2019t choose to simply make the rider\nlighter. A good counterfactual explanation should only\nmodify actionable features. Several works, such as [15],\nhave also proposed more nuanced methods to handle\nactionability.\n6) Causality: Features in a dataset may be causally linked,\nimplying that changing one feature may necessitate\nchanging another. In general, establishing causality is\ndif\ufb01cult. However, in design, we may be aware of causal\nrelationships thanks to our fundamental understanding of\nthe physics relating various input variables. For example,\nselecting a denser material for a given design may neces-\nsitate increasing the weight, provided that the geometry\nremains unchanged. This has clear rami\ufb01cations for\neffective counterfactuals, which should ideally capture\nand respect any known causal relations in the problem.\nA strong counterfactual method should undoubtedly generate\nhigh-quality counterfactuals. However, good counterfactual\nmethods should also exhibit several properties that may not be\nre\ufb02ected in the strength of individual counterfactual examples\nthemselves:\n1) Diverse Sets: As emphasized in [14], it may be highly\ndesirable to generate diverse sets of counterfactuals. This\ngives the user a wealth of options, ideally with different\nactionable requirements to achieve the query objective.\n2) Model-Agnosticism: Ideally, the algorithms used for the\ngeneration of counterfactual explanations should treat\nthe model as a black box and interact with the model\nonly through its predict function\n[1]. These \u201cmodel-\nagnostic\u201d algorithms allow for wider applicability and\ncode reuse. Notably, model-agnostic approaches do not\nrely on gradient information from the predictor but\nmay be less sample-ef\ufb01cient than methods that leverage\ngradients, when available.\nResearchers\nhave\nalso\nadopted\ncounterfactuals\nin\na\nrecommender-system setting. Tran et al. [20] review the use\nof counterfactual explanations in recommendation systems and\npropose a method to generate counterfactuals for recommender\nsystems. While related, this work differs slightly from our\nproposed use case, in which the counterfactual-generating\nmodel is the recommender. Regenwetter [21] also brie\ufb02y in-\nvestigates leveraging Diverse Counterfactual Explanations [14]\nfor design recommendations, citing challenges due to the\nlimitations of single-objective queries.\nB. Multi-Objective Counterfactual Explanations\nCounterfactual explanations can be viewed as an optimiza-\ntion problem, and can similarly be implemented using an op-\ntimization algorithm. Many methods summarize the optimiza-\ntion objective as a weighted sum of the different objectives\ndiscussed earlier. However, another approach instead frames\nthe counterfactual search process as a classic multi-objective\noptimization problem. Dandl et al. [16] were the \ufb01rst to\nformalize this parallel between counterfactual explanations and\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) in Multi-Objective Coun-\nterfactuals (MOC). By handling objectives individually rather\nthan as a single aggregated objective, MOC realizes a key\nbene\ufb01t of Multi-Objective Optimization, namely the ability to\ngenerate non-dominated sets of counterfactual explanations.\nWhereas a single-objective approach returns a counterfactual\nthat optimizes for a statically weighted aggregation of objec-\ntives, the non-dominated set allows designers to adaptively\nselect counterfactuals based on their speci\ufb01c search priorities,\nwhich typically depend on the problem at hand.\nMulti-Objective Counterfactuals (MOC) [16] is a primary\ninspiration for Multi-Objective Counterfactuals in Design\n(MCD). However, we have expanded on MCD in several key\ndirections. Chie\ufb02y, despite its name, MOC does not inherently\nsupport multi-objective queries. Furthermore, MOC does not\ndistinguish between hard and soft constraints, despite the\nfact that this functionality is ingrained in the Non-Dominated\nSorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) [22] that MOC is\nbuilt around. MCD addresses these gaps while also decoupling\nthe optimization and sampling steps, and introducing new\nways to integrate counterfactuals with a multi-modal, zero-\nshot machine learning model.\nSince the overarching goal of MCD is not to explain\npredictors, but rather to search for design recommendation\ncounterfactuals, we refer to the problem as \u2018counterfactual\nsearch.\u2019 Note that unlike counterfactual explanations, counter-\nfactual search does not require ML predictors and can work\nwith many types of forward models. It also has the additional\ngoals of manifold similarity and meeting multi-objective multi-\nmodal requirements.\nC. Cross-Modal Design Recommendations\nThe multitude of data modalities spanned by design data\nremains a prominent challenge in data-driven design [23]\u2013\n[25]. Though a model explained by a counterfactual method\nmay make predictions in one modality, users may instead\nprefer to query targets in an entirely different modality. We\nwill demonstrate in this paper that MCD can be used in\nconjunction with rendering pipelines and trained language\nmodels to generate counterfactuals for a parametric model\nusing images or even text prompts. In this way, counterfactuals\ncan capture complex and abstract user requirements in a \u2018zero-\nshot\u2019 fashion, requiring no additional training to understand the\ncontext of the prompts. To provide context for this discussion,\nwe will introduce a brief background on relevant subjects in\ncross-modal learning.\nWhen handling data of modalities like graphs [26], im-\nages [27], 3D geometry [28], text [29], [30], and mixed\nmodalities, a common general technique involves mapping\ndatapoints to a vector space. This effectively creates a link\nfrom datapoints of the modality to datapoints in the vector\nspace. Two or more modalities can then be linked by creating\nshared embeddings for the modalities using the same vector\nspace.\nShared text-image embeddings are an example of cross-\nmodal embeddings that have garnered signi\ufb01cant attention in\nrecent years [31]. Radford et al. [32] propose one of the most\nwidely used models for text-image shared embeddings called\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). CLIP trains a\ntext embedding and image embedding model simultaneously\non a dataset of text-image pairs. The models are rewarded\nfor mapping matching pairs to similar embedding vectors and\nmapping non-matching pairs to dissimilar embedding vectors.\nIn our second and third case studies, we will be leveraging\npre-trained CLIP models to query counterfactuals using text\nprompts. Next, we move on to discuss our methodology.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we discuss the construction of the opti-\nmization algorithm behind MCD, emphasizing the constraints,\nobjectives, and operators used. We then present our approach\nfor sampling diverse sets of counterfactuals and discuss how\nwe decouple the optimization from the \ufb01nal sampling step.\nFinally, we demonstrate the capabilities of MCD on a simple\n2D problem.\nA. Objectives\nOptimization algorithms typically seek to \ufb01nd constraint-\nsatisfying solutions that achieve optimal objective scores.\nWe will \ufb01rst discuss how objectives are de\ufb01ned in MCD,\nthen go on to discuss constraints. Broadly, we consider two\ntypes of objectives: Objectives related to counterfactual quality\nand user-speci\ufb01ed auxiliary objectives (often used for soft\nconstraints). The former draw on the work of Dandl et al. [16],\nwho, among other things, leverage Gower distance [33] and\nthe number of changed features as optimization objectives in\nMOC.\n1) Gower Distance: Gower Distance [33] is a metric that\nindicates the distance between mixed feature data points.\nIts use as an objective tackles the issue of \u201cproximity\u201d\nintroduced in Sec. II-A. The Gower distance between\nd-dimensional counterfactual p and query q is given in\nterms of their feature values pi and qi for i \u2208 [1...d], as:\nfpr(p, q) = 1\nd\nd\nX\ni=1\n\u03b4G(pi, qi)\n(1)\n\u03b4G(pi, qi) is a function that depends on feature type and\nis given as:\n\u03b4G(p, q) =\n(\n1\n\u02c6\nRi |pi \u2212 qi|\nif pi is numerical\n1pi\u0338=qi\nif pi is categorical\n(2)\nHere, \u02c6Ri is the range of the feature i observed in the\ndataset.\n2) Changed Feature Ratio: This objective calculates the\nproportion of features that the proposed counterfactual,\np, modi\ufb01es from the query, q. Its use as an objective\ntackles the issue of \u201csparsity\u201d introduced in Sec. II-A.\nfsp(p, q) = ||p \u2212 q||0\nd\n= 1\nd\nd\nX\ni=1\n1pi\u0338=qi\n(3)\n3) Average Gower Distance: To measure the \u201cmanifold\nproximity\u201d discussed in Sec. II-A, Dandl et al. [16]\ncalculate the average Gower distance to the k nearest\nobserved data points si...sk from the dataset S:\nfmp(p, S) = 1\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\n1\nd\nd\nX\nj=1\n\u03b4G(pj, si\nj)\n(4)\n4) Problem-Speci\ufb01c Objectives: Just as the user may\nspecify non-negotiable requirements for the model out-\ncome (hard constraints), they may also specify objectives\n(f1(p)...fM(p)) that they would like to satisfy, and later\nspecify targets for these objectives during sampling.\nThese auxiliary objectives are directly included as opti-\nmization objectives in NSGA-II.\nB. Constraints\nIn a counterfactual search, a variety of optimization con-\nstraints may be present. Constraints are considered non-\nnegotiable and always take precedence over objectives. In\npractice, many optimization algorithms, including the variant\nof the NSGA-II algorithm driving MCD, prioritize resolving\nconstraint violations before proceeding to the optimization of\nobjectives. MCD considers several types of constraints:\n1) Variable and Constant Features: Like many counter-\nfactual models, we implement a mechanism to constrain\nwhich features are allowed to be modi\ufb01ed by a coun-\nterfactual, as speci\ufb01ed by the user. This addresses the\nchallenge of \u201cactionability\u201d introduced in Sec. II-A. We\ncall the set of actionable features A.\n2) Model Output Constraints: Users querying a counter-\nfactual method may have requirements for the output of\ntheir model. In most counterfactual search approaches,\nthese requirements are treated as non-negotiable hard\nconstraints to satisfy the \u201cvalidity\u201d property introduced\nin Sec. II-A. MCD supports such hard requirements,\nwhich are handled as constraints in NSGA-II2, but\n2By default, we expect queries in the form of inequalities. Since range and\nequality constraints (or objectives) can be speci\ufb01ed using two inequalities, we\n\ufb01nd this to be an adequately versatile interface for most types of constraints.\nIn rare cases where users need to specify complex constraints, such as disjoint\nranges, they can do so by creating a custom constraint function and passing\nit in as a black box.\ndoes not require them. We consider any output with\na constraint as belonging to a set B and require that\nLb \u2264 fb(p) \u2264 Ub \u2200 b \u2208 B. Instead, we also allow\nusers to specify soft constraints in the form of additional\noptimization objectives, paired with targets to be used\nduring sampling.\n3) Domain-Speci\ufb01c\nConstraint\nFunctions: There are\ncases in which certain hard constraints are known a\npriori. MCD can be con\ufb01gured to respect such hard\nconstraints through user-speci\ufb01ed black-box constraint\nfunctions. Domain-speci\ufb01c constraints can be used for\na variety of different purposes, including encoding\ncausality relations into the optimization as discussed\nin Sec. II-A. We specify these constraint functions\nas g1(p)...gK(p) and, for simplicity, assume they are\nsatis\ufb01ed for gk(p) \u2265 0\nC. Formulation as MOO problem\nIn summary, we express the multi-objective optimization\nproblem in terms of the variables, sets, and functions de\ufb01ned\nabove as follows:\nminimize: fi(p), \u2200 i \u2208 {pr, sp, mp, 1, ..., M}\n(5)\nsubject to: fj(p) \u2212 Lj \u2265 0, Uj \u2212 fj(p) \u2265 0, \u2200 j \u2208 B,\ngk(p) \u2265 0, \u2200 k \u2208 {1, ..., K},\npl = ql, \u2200 l \u0338\u2208 A\nD. Algorithm\nAny gradient- or non-gradient-based multi-objective opti-\nmization method could be used in MCD. To demonstrate our\nresults in this paper, we leverage the Non-Dominated Sorting\nGenetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) [22] as the backend of MCD.\nNSGA-II is a multi-objective genetic algorithm that boasts\nseveral innovative features, such as non-dominated sorting\nfor elitist selection, crowding distance to encourage diversity,\nand genetic operators such as tournament selection, simulated\nbinary crossover, and polynomial mutation. We use an imple-\nmentation of NSGA-II from [34], including the mixed-variable\nselection, crossover, and mutation functions provided.\nThe initial population always consists of the query and\na set of randomly sampled points from the dataset or the\nuser-speci\ufb01ed design space boundaries. In problems with\ncontinuous variables, we \ufb01nd that without any precautions to\nmaintain the exact parameter values from the original query,\nthese values tend to get \u2018lost,\u2019 and can never be exactly\nreconstructed, hurting the sparsity objective of counterfactuals.\nTo allow the algorithm to \u2018rediscover\u2019 the exact parameter\nvalues from the query, we introduce a custom operator that\nrandomly reverts individual parameter values back to the\nquery\u2019s values with a certain probability.\nE. Sampling\nContrary to other counterfactual search approaches, our\nmethod decouples the optimization and sampling steps. Con-\nventionally, a user will have to decide on the priorities between\nvarious objectives (e.g. proximity, diversity, manifold proxim-\nity, etc.) before running the optimization. This is impractical,\nas these objectives are challenging to select intuitively, and\nmust often be chosen through trial and error. For example, a\ndesigner might realize that the generated counterfactuals are\nmuch too different from the query to be practically realiz-\nable. By avoiding retraining, our method can save signi\ufb01cant\ncomputational expense and, as we will discuss in Sec. V,\nenable users to quickly consider counterfactuals from different\nregions of the objective landscape. We decouple the search and\nsampling process as follows:\n1) Given a query, a set of constraints, and objectives, the\noptimizer generates a collection of candidate counterfac-\ntuals by running NSGA-II.\n2) The sampling algorithm collects a set of objective pri-\nority weights and optional targets from the user. By\ncollecting these weights after training, MCD allows\nrapid counterfactual sampling under different objective\nweights without the need for retraining, unlike other\napproaches.\n3) Each candidate counterfactual is assigned an aggre-\ngate quality score, which is calculated as a sum of\nindividual objective scores, weighted by their priority.\nFor any objectives with speci\ufb01ed targets, the Design\nTarget Achievement Index [35] is used to quantify\ntarget achievement before factoring into the aggregate\nscore. The aggregate score, S of a counterfactual can-\ndidate, p, is given in terms of objective priority weights\nwpr, wsp, wmp by:\nS(p) = wprfpr(p, q) + wspfsp(p, q) + wmpfmp(p, S)\n+DTAI(p, t, \u03b1, \u03b2)\n(6)\nHere, DTAI(p, t, \u03b1, \u03b2) is the Design Target Achieve-\nment Index of the candidate given auxiliary objective\ntargets, t, priority weights, \u03b1, and decay parameters,\n\u03b2 [35].\n4) A performance-weighted diversity matrix is calculated\nusing a Gower distance-based similarity kernel to evalu-\nate the similarity between counterfactuals. Matrix entries\nare calculated as a function of aggregate scores and a\ndiversity parameter, wd as:\nDi,j = \u03b4G(i, j) (S(i)S(j))\n1\nwd\n(7)\n5) A diverse set of high-performing counterfactuals is\nsampled from this matrix using k-greedy diverse sam-\npling [36].\nIf the user requests only a single counterfactual instead of a\ndiverse set, the candidate with the highest aggregate quality\nscore is returned.\n(a) Balanced Sampling (wpr = 0.5, wsp = 0.2, wmp = 0.5, wd =\n0.2)\n(b) High Prox. Weight (wpr = 50, wsp = 0.2, wmp = 0.5, wd =\n0.2)\n(c) High Diversity Weight (wpr\n=\n0.5, wsp\n=\n0.2, wmp\n=\n0.5, wd = 20)\n(d) High Sparsity Weight (wpr = 0.5, wsp = 20, wmp = 0.5, wd =\n0.2)\nFig. 2: Counterfactual sets returned for three query designs\nunder different weightings of counterfactual quality objectives.\nPerformance space constraints are indicated on the plots. Valid\ncounterfactuals must simultaneously meet both constraints.\nF. Showcasing Functionality on 2D Examples\nBefore showcasing the capabilities of MCD on real design\ndatasets, we will \ufb01rst demonstrate its performance on a simple\ntwo-dimensional problem for ease of visualization. We select a\nchallenging two-objective problem and sample synthetic data.\nWe then query three different designs, D1-3, and specify the\nsame challenging constraint criterion for each query, which\nis only satis\ufb01able in four small disjoint regions of the space.\nMathematically, we constrain the performance space values\nY1 and Y2 such that 0.4 \u2264 Y1 \u2264 0.6 and Y2 \u2265 0.6. In simple\nterms, any valid counterfactual must lie near the star-shaped\ncontour on the left and strictly within the circle on the right\nin the contour plots in Fig. 2. We consider four choices of\nobjective weights:\n1) First we examine a fairly \u201cbalanced\u201d selection of objec-\ntive weights (wpr = 0.5, wsp = 0.2, wmp = 0.5, wd =\n0.2) in Fig. 2a. In this setting, the sampled counterfac-\ntual sets achieve a balance of proximity, diversity, and\nsparsity.\n2) Next, we consider a setting where proximity is pri-\noritized over other objectives (wpr\n=\n50, wsp\n=\n0.2, wmp = .05, wd = 0.2) in Fig. 2b. In this setting,\nmost counterfactuals in each set are sampled from the\nmode nearest the queries, though counterfactuals are still\ndiversi\ufb01ed within these modes.\n3) We next consider a case where diversity is given\nprecedence over other objectives (wpr = 0.5, wsp =\n0.2, wmp = 0.5, wd = 20) in Fig. 2c. In this case,\nthe sampled counterfactual sets are very well distributed\nacross the feasible regions of the space.\n4) Finally, we consider the case where sparsity is given\nthe highest priority (wpr = 0.5, wsp = 20, wmp =\n0.5, wd = 0.2) in Fig. 2d. Many sampled counterfac-\ntuals change only one parameter from the query, when\npossible.\nEach of these subsets is sampled from the same set of\ncounterfactual candidates with no re-optimization necessary.\nNow, having demonstrated MCD\u2019s functionality on a simple\n2D problem, we move on to a more complex real-world design\nproblem: Bike frame design.\nIV. CASE STUDY 1: DESIGN REFINEMENT USING\nSTRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE QUERIES\nIn our \ufb01rst case study, we consider the counterfactual:\n\u201cWhat if my design were 30% lighter?\u201d Speci\ufb01cally, we\nconsider a bicycle frame design problem where we are trying\nto improve the structural properties and reduce the weight of\na query design. We use a regression model trained on the\nFRAMED dataset consisting of Finite Element (FE) simula-\ntion results from 4500 community-designed bike frames [37],\nincluding weight, safety factors, and de\ufb02ections under various\nloading conditions. The trained regression model is an Auto-\nGluon tabular AutoML regressor [38] intended to predict the\nstructural performance of bicycle frames accurately.\nTo illustrate MCD\u2019s capabilities, we feed it three variants\nof the same query. The \ufb01rst has a single objective: \ufb01nding\ncounterfactuals that reduce the predicted mass of a given\ndesign. The second has two competing objectives: Maximize\na design\u2019s safety factor while minimizing its mass. The third\nhas the same objectives as the second but restricts MCD to\nonly vary a more constrained and actionable set of features.\nIn each example, we query the same design: a steel tube road\nbike with minor structural inef\ufb01ciencies. These inef\ufb01ciencies\nlargely stem from a down tube with insuf\ufb01cient wall thickness,\nrequiring other components to be over-engineered. This bike\nhas a safety factor3 of 1.24 and a mass of 4.26 kg, so our\nprimary objective is to reduce the mass. Each optimization\nran for 100 generations with a population size of 500.\na) Single objective query: In the \ufb01rst variant, MCD was\ntasked with \ufb01nding counterfactuals that reduced the mass of\nthe original design from 4.26 kg to under 3 kg. MCD effec-\ntively successfully discovered hundreds of valid counterfactu-\nals and sampled a set of \ufb01ve diverse counterfactuals which had,\non average, a mass of 2.3 kg, as tabulated in Table I. Although\nMCD succeeded in its explicitly stated objective, a closer\nlook reveals that it did nothing to remedy the wall thickness\nissue in the down tube, and as a consequence of weight\nsavings in other parts of the sampled frames, the average safety\nfactor across sampled counterfactuals was an abysmal 0.48.\nThis disregard for secondary objectives is quite characteristic\nof the many existing single-objective counterfactual search\nalgorithms and illustrates why MCD\u2019s novel support of multi-\nobjective queries is so essential for design problems. Our next\nexample showcases how to leverage multi-objective queries to\navoid these issues.\nTABLE I: Generated counterfactuals for variant 1 (34 columns\nomitted). Like many single-objective counterfactual engines,\nMCD tends to achieve single-objective queries at the expense\nof secondary objectives. MCD\u2019s unique support of multi-\nobjective queries remedies this problem.\nMaterial\nStack\n(mm) ...\nDown Tube\nThick.

Again, MCD successfully discovered\nnumerous counterfactuals, and the diverse 5-bike set sampled\nthis time had an average mass of 2.4 kg and a safety factor\nof 1.7, as shown in Table II. This time, MCD realized that\nthe bike could be made signi\ufb01cantly more weight-ef\ufb01cient by\nincreasing the down tube wall thickness to relieve structural\nstress on other components to be lightened. However, it also\n3We use predicted safety factor in FRAMED\u2019s in-plane loading sce-\nnario [37]\nchanged the material of the bike from steel to aluminum or\ntitanium in four of the \ufb01ve counterfactuals, a modi\ufb01cation\nthat would likely carry a signi\ufb01cant increase to the cost and\nmay thus be unactionable. In the presence of a cost prediction\nmodel, MCD could consider cost as another query objective.\nHowever, even without such a model, MCD can be ordered to\nleave certain design parameters unchanged, as we demonstrate\nin our \ufb01nal example.\nTABLE II: Generated counterfactuals for variant 2 (34\ncolumns omitted).

It\nproceeded to \ufb01nd tens of valid designs through variations in\ncertain tube diameters, lengths, and other structural con\ufb01gura-\ntions. From these valid designs, a 5-bike set was sampled that\nhad an average mass of 2.5 kg and an average safety factor of\n1.8, as shown in Table III.\nTABLE III: Generated Counterfactuals for Query 3 (34\ncolumns omitted). When restricted from modifying frame\nmaterial, MCD is still able to recommend design modi\ufb01cations\nthat meet the safety factor and mass targets.\nMaterial Stack\n(mm) ...\nDown Tube\nThick.

In our next ex-\nample, we consider a scenario in which more abstract text\nqueries are provided instead of hard performance constraints.\nV. CASE STUDY 2: MODIFYING DESIGNS USING\nCROSS-MODAL TEXT QUERIES\nIn this case study we examine subjective counterfactuals\nlike: \u201cWhat if my design looked more \u2018cyberpunk themed?\u201d\u2019\nClassically, counterfactual search requires a query in the same\ndata modality as the predictive model. This can be constrain-\ning, since it may be more natural in many cases to place\nqueries in a different data modality, especially if that modality\nis more intuitive for human users. This is often the case for\nimages or text, which are much more easily understood by\nhumans compared to tabular or parametric data. Accordingly,\nwe demonstrate how we can query MCD in a cross-modal\nsetting using text prompts.\nA. Methodology: Case Study 2\nTo enable cross-model queries, we construct an objective\nevaluation function comprised of several key building blocks:\n\u2022 To begin, we require a rendered image of a bicycle design.\nWe construct an automated rendering pipeline that works\nin conjunction with the BikeCAD software to generate\nan image of a bicycle given a parametric vector.\n\u2022 We then calculate an embedding for the generated bike\nimage using a pre-trained CLIP model introduced in\nSec. II-C that maps the generated bike renders to a vector\nembedding space.\n\u2022 Next, we compute the embedding vector for a target text\nprompt using a pre-trained CLIP text embedding model.\n\u2022 Finally, we calculate cosine similarity between the two\n512-dimensional embedding vectors.\nIn this case study, this entire objective evaluation pipeline\nserves as the predictor for counterfactual search. By generating\ncounterfactuals that minimize this cosine similarity objective,\nthe optimizer ensures that generated counterfactuals better\nmatch the given text prompts.\nWe select a subset of the BIKED [5] dataset\u2019s parameter\nspace to consider during optimization and choose a generic\nred road bike design as a query design. We choose two\ntext prompts as optimization objectives: \u201cA futuristic black\ncyberpunk-style road racing bicycle\u201d and \u201cA sturdy compact\nbright blue mountain bike with thick tires.\u201d Because the\ndemands of human designers are often dif\ufb01cult to quantify\nusing traditional parametric methods, the \ufb01rst text prompt was\nselected to be highly subjective. The second prompt is less\nsubjective, offering details about design features, but stops\nshort of explicit design guidelines. In this context, the user\nis effectively asking questions like: \u201cHow would my red road\nbike design change if I wanted it to look more like a black\ncyberpunk-style bike?\u201d We optimize for 400 generations with a\npopulation size of 100. Next, we perform a series of sampling\noperations with different objective weights, as shown in II-C.\nBy selecting the optimal bikes at a sweep of different objective\nweights, we can visualize the best bikes under numerous\ncon\ufb01gurations of objective priorities.\nCounterfactual quality objective weights in the ith row were\nchosen as:\nw1 = w2 = w3 = 0.2\n2i\n(8)\nIn this way, counterfactuals with better proximity, sparsity,\nand manifold proximity were prioritized toward the top of the\ngrid, while counterfactuals were given more leeway to deviate\n(a) Rendered Image of Query Design\n(b) Objective Priorities\n(c) Map of Rendered Bicycle Images Corresponding to Generated Counterfactuals\n(d) Similarity to:\n\u2018A futuristic black\ncyberpunk-style road\nracing bicycle\u2019\n(e) Similarity to:\n\u2018A sturdy compact bright\nblue mountain bike with\nthick tires\u2019\n(f) Counterfactual\nProximity\n(Gower Distance)\n(g) Counterfactual\nSparsity\n(Changed Feature Ratio)\n(h) Counterfactual\nManifold Proximity\n(Average Gower Distance)\nFig. 3: Visualization of the objective manifold for cross-modal counterfactual selection. Designs sampled from the top of the\nmanifold prioritize proximity, sparsity, and manifold proximity. Designs in the left and right corners prioritize similarity to two\nrespective text prompts. Heatmaps show individual objective scores (lighter is better).\nfrom the query design and data manifold toward the bottom.\nDiversity weight, wd, was irrelevant, as only one design was\nsampled for each combination of objective weights.\nSimilarly, auxiliary objective weights in the jth column\nwere set through the DTAI objective weighting parameter, \u03b1,\nin terms of the number of columns, n (in our case 6), as:\n\u03b11 = 1.5n\u2212j, \u03b12 = 1.5j\u22121\n(9)\nThese objectives allowed similarity to the \ufb01rst text prompt to\ntake precedence on the left edge of the grid and similarity to\nthe second text prompt to take precedence on the right.\nB. Discussion: Case Study 2\nAs expected, models at the top of the grid are appreciably\nsimilar to the red bike; some were essentially indistinguish-\nable. Bikes further down the grid become progressively more\nvisually different, which is corroborated by objective scores,\nas shown in Figs. 3f-3h.\nBikes in the lower left corner of the grid can be subjectively\nidenti\ufb01ed as more similar to \u201cA futuristic black cyberpunk-\nstyle road racing bicycle.\u201d Among the key modi\ufb01cations are\na color change and a shift to tri-spoke wheels, which may be\nmore on-theme for a \u2018cyberpunk-style\u2019 bike. Similarity to the\ntext prompt as evaluated by CLIP agrees, as shown in Fig. 3d.\nLikewise, bikes towards the bottom right corner of the grid\ncan be subjectively identi\ufb01ed as more similar to \u201cA sturdy\ncompact bright blue mountain bike with thick tires.\u201d Bikes in\nthis corner have the slanted down tube which is characteristic\nof mountain bikes; have the requested color change; and have\na thick rear tire. Notably, the model either does not discover\na modi\ufb01cation to the front tire or does not \ufb01nd that such\na modi\ufb01cation improves similarity to the prompt. Also, the\nmodels maintain the dropped handlebars present on the query,\nwhich are characteristic of road bikes. Nevertheless, similarity\nto the text prompt as evaluated by CLIP was found to be best\nin this corner, as shown in Fig. 3e.\nIn this case study we demonstrated that MCD effectively\nhandles multi-objective cross-modal prompts. Next, we move\non to consider a challenging multi-modal query case as our\n\ufb01nal case study.\nVI. CASE STUDY 3: MODIFYING DESIGNS USING\nMULTIMODAL TEXT, IMAGE, AND PARAMETRIC QUERIES\nIn this \ufb01nal case study, we examine hybrid counterfactuals\nlike: \u201cWhat if my design were lighter, looked more \u2018cyberpunk\nthemed,\u2019 had better structural properties, and looked like this\nother design?\u201d Having considered multi-objective cross-modal\nqueries in the previous case study, we now present our most\nchallenging case study. This time, we provide a multi-objective\nmulti-modal query consisting of a target text prompt, image,\nframe safety factor, and frame mass.\nA. Methodology: Case Study 3\nTo calculate image and text similarity, we leverage the\nrendering pipeline and pre-trained CLIP model used in case\nstudy 2. To calculate structural performance, we use the\nAutoGluon [38] model trained in [37], which was used in\ncase study 1. We again select the same generic red road bike\nas our query design and select \u201cA futuristic black cyberpunk-\nstyle road racing bicycle\u201d as our text prompt. For our target\nimage, we select an image of a Fuji Wendigo 1.1 mountain\nbike which closely matches the second text description from\nthe previous case study.\nLike the last case study, we sample designs in a grid,\nas shown in Fig. 4 based on a variable objective weighting\nscheme. We select a spread of DTAI objective weighting\nparameter (\u03b1) values in terms of the ith row and jth column\nas follows:\n\u03b1text = 2n\u2212j, \u03b1image = 2j\n\u03b1sf = 1.5n\u2212i\u22121, \u03b1mass = 1.5i\n(10)\nThis time, we hold the counterfactual quality objective weights\nconstant at:\nw1 = w2 = w3 = 0.05\n(11)\nB. Discussion: Case Study 3\nAs in the previous case study, MCD modi\ufb01es several\ncomponents to better match the text query of the models on\nthe left side, including recoloring them black and replacing\na regular spoked wheel with a disk wheel. However, due to\nthe proximity, sparsity, and manifold proximity weights being\n\ufb01xed at moderate values, it does not deviate as far from the\ndataset as some of the most extreme designs in the previous\ncase study.\nThe bikes on the right side of the grid are visibly more\nsimilar to mountain bikes, displaying the characteristic slanted\ntop tube and, in some cases, adding a front suspension to\nthe design. Interestingly, MCD does not generate any blue\nbikes, indicating that the color of the reference image is not\nas strongly emphasized as when a color is explicitly stated in\na text prompt.\nStructural modi\ufb01cations of the bike frame are challenging\nto appreciate in renderings because the largest drivers of\nstructural performance are tube wall thickness parameters\nand material, none of which have a visual signature in the\nrendering. However, Figs. 4g and 4h indicate that bikes at the\ntop and bottom prioritize safety factor and weight, respectively,\nas intended.\nFrom Fig. 4i, we can see that the bikes toward the top of\nthe grid fall far outside of the data manifold. Unsurprisingly,\nwe see various design infeasibilities in these bikes, such\nas colliding components. Unless explicitly prevented using\nconstraints, such infeasibilities are typically more common as\ncounterfactuals fall further from the data manifold.\nThough some of the generated counterfactuals suffer from\ninfeasibilities, we have demonstrated that MCD can provide\nmeaningful counterfactuals in high-dimensional (i.e., 4 auxil-\niary objectives and 3 counterfactual quality objectives) and\nmultimodal objective spaces. Next, we proceed to discuss\nMCD\u2019s limitations.\nVII. LIMITATIONS\nMCD makes several key contributions to counterfactual\noptimization methods for designers, such as incorporating\n(a) Rendered Image of Query Design\n(b) Target Mountain Bike Image\n(c) Objective Priorities\n(d) Map of Rendered Bicycle Images Corresponding to Generated Counterfactuals\n(e) Similarity to:\n\u2018A futuristic black\ncyberpunk-style road\nracing bicycle\u2019\n(f) Similarity to\nTarget Mountain Bike\nImage\n(g) Safety Factor\n(h) Model Mass (kg)\n(i) Counterfactual\nManifold Proximity\n(Average Gower Distance)\nFig. 4: Visualization of the objective manifold for multimodal counterfactual selection. Designs sampled towards the top and\nbottom of the manifold prioritize safety factor and weight respectively. Designs sampled towards the left and right edges\nprioritize similarity to a target text prompt and target image, respectively. Heatmaps show individual objective scores (lighter\nis better). Designs that fall far outside of the data manifold struggle with component overlap and other infeasibility issues.\nmultiple objectives. However, it also has a few limitations. In\nmodel-agnostic con\ufb01gurations, MCD must use a gradient-free\noptimizer, preventing it from leveraging gradient information,\neven if some of the predictive models are differentiable. While\nthis gradient-free approach allows MCD to support nondif-\nferentiable predictors and avoid local minima, it potentially\nmakes MCD less sample-ef\ufb01cient than similar gradient-based\napproaches.\nAnother key limitation stems from the dif\ufb01culty of genetic\nalgorithms in handling a large number of objectives. Because\nMCD adds three counterfactual quality objectives to the objec-\ntive space, it slightly exacerbates the dimensionality issue of\nmulti-objective genetic algorithms. Future work will explore\nMCD variants that leverage gradient information and many-\nobjective optimization methods to address these limitations.\nAdditionally, we would like to acknowledge certain limi-\ntations with the text-based queries presented in the last two\ncase studies. Though CLIP embeddings can capture more\nabstract and subjective ideas, they struggle to capture \ufb01ne-\ngrained technical details of designs. As such, we recommend\nthat users with highly technical constraints specify them\nparametrically, instead of through text. However, as machine\nlearning models continue to improve, querying counterfactual\nmodels for precise technical details through text and images\nmay improve signi\ufb01cantly.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have introduced Multi-Objective Counter-\nfactuals for Design (MCD), a specialized counterfactual opti-\nmization method for design tasks. We \ufb01rst discussed previous\ncounterfactual optimization approaches, many stemming from\nmachine learning explainability literature. We then identi\ufb01ed\nkey limitations with existing works, particularly their inability\nto sample multi-objective queries and the inherent coupling of\nthe optimization and sampling process. Next, we demonstrated\nusing 2D examples how MCD solves these two challenges.\nWe presented a bicycle frame optimization problem and\nshowed how MCD\u2019s support of multi-objective queries allows\nit to recommend meaningful modi\ufb01cations to a query design\nwhich improves structural performance. We then identi\ufb01ed\nthat although previous counterfactual search models have not\nsupported cross-modal queries, advancements in multi-modal\nlearning reasonably allow counterfactuals to be queried in\ndifferent data modalities. Next, we showcased how MCD can\nbe queried with text prompts, and illustrated how MCD\u2019s\ndecoupling of optimization and sampling allows it to visu-\nalize complex objective manifolds without re-optimization.\nFinally, we asked MCD to generate counterfactuals given a\nmultimodal text, image, and parameter query. By effectively\nrecommending design modi\ufb01cations to match these queries,\nMCD demonstrated that it can support complex multimodal\nqueries.\nAll in all, MCD is a valuable tool for designers looking\nto optimize their designs and design automation researchers\nlooking to interact intuitively with their models. We are excited\nto release our code and examples at http://decode.mit.edu/\nprojects/counterfactuals/ and anticipate a variety of interesting\nuse cases across the community.\nIX.

    "text": "Comparing Machines and Children: Using\nDevelopmental Psychology Experiments to Assess the\nStrengths and Weaknesses of LaMDA Responses\nEliza Kosoy1, 2, Emily Rose Reagan1, Leslie Lai2, Alison Gopnik1, and Danielle Krettek Cobb2\n1Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA\n2Google LLC, The Empathy Lab, Mountain View, CA, USA\nAbstract\nDevelopmental psychologists have spent decades devising experiments to test the\nintelligence and knowledge of infants and children, tracing the origin of crucial\nconcepts and capacities. Moreover, experimental techniques in developmental psy-\nchology have been carefully designed to discriminate the cognitive capacities that\nunderlie particular behaviors. We propose this metric as a tool to aid in investigating\nLarge Language Models\u2019 (LLM) capabilities in the context of ethics and morality.\nResults from key developmental psychology experiments have historically been\napplied to discussions of children\u2019s emerging moral abilities, making this work a\npertinent benchmark for exploring such concepts in LLMs. We propose that using\nclassical experiments from child development is a particularly effective way to\nprobe the computational abilities of AI models in general and LLMs in particular.\nFirst, the methodological techniques of developmental psychology, such as the use\nof novel stimuli to control for past experience or control conditions to determine\nwhether children are using simple associations, can be equally helpful for assessing\nthe capacities of LLMs. In parallel, testing LLMs in this way can tell us whether\nthe information that is encoded in text is sufficient to enable particular responses,\nor whether those responses depend on other kinds of information, such as infor-\nmation from exploration of the physical world. In this work we adapt classical\ndevelopmental experiments to evaluate the capabilities of LaMDA, a LLM from\nGoogle. We propose a novel LLM Response Score (LRS) metric which can be used\nto evaluate other language models, such as GPT. We find that LaMDA generates\nappropriate responses that are similar to those of children in experiments involving\nsocial and proto-moral understanding, perhaps providing evidence that knowledge\nof these domains is discovered through language. On the other hand, LaMDA\u2019s\nresponses in early object and action understanding, theory of mind, and especially\ncausal reasoning tasks are very different from those of young children, perhaps\nshowing that these domains require more real-world, self-initiated exploration and\ncannot simply be learned from patterns in language input.\n1\nIntroduction:\nIn 1950 Alan Turing famously said \u201cInstead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult\nmind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child\u2019s? If this were then subjected to an\nappropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain (Turing [1946]).\u201d Developmental\npsychologists have spent decades devising experiments to determine the intelligence and knowledge\nof infants and children. This field of study has revealed types of knowledge that are in place well\nbefore formal education and serve as the the foundation for further human intelligence (Baltes et al.\nNeurIPS MP2 (Morality and AI) Workshop 2023\n[1999]). This research allows us to track a child\u2019s cognitive development trajectory and discern\nthe underlying cognitive capacities behind behaviors, which can stem from conceptual structures,\nassociations, external interactions, or cultural language transmission.\nUsing classical experiments from child development may be a particularly effective way to probe\nthe understanding of AI models in general and LLMs in particular (Ullman [2023]). First, the\nmethodological techniques of developmental psychology such as the use of novel stimuli to control\nfor past experience or control conditions to determine whether children are using simple associations\ncan be very helpful for assessing LLMs (Frank [2023]). We could not accurately judge a child\u2019s\ncognitive capacities simply through conversation, though this extrapolation often been made with\nLLMs. Thus, systematic human developmental methods can help bridge our understanding of LLMs.\nWe find that LaMDA generates appropriate responses that are similar to children in experiments\ninvolving social and moral understanding, perhaps providing evidence that the core of these domains\nis discovered or accessible through language. However, LaMDA\u2019s responses in Perception, Theory\nof Mind, and especially Causal Reasoning tasks are very different from those of young children,\nperhaps showing that these domains require more real-world, self-initiated exploration and cannot\nsimply be learned from patterns in language input. These results suggest that capacities linked to\nmorality may be rooted in language. We explored two hypotheses regarding the relationship between\nLaMDA\u2019s responses and children\u2019s responses. First, we considered whether LaMDA aligns with\nthe human developmental trajectory by assessing its performance on tasks mastered at different\nstages of life. Second, we investigated whether LaMDA might excel in domains that can more easily\nbe learned from language alone but struggle in exploration-based domains. In acknowledging and\nunderstanding the divergences between human and AI learning trajectories and patterns, we may be\nbetter equipped to train more optimal models and glean an understanding of what may make human\ncognition uniquely human.\nWe propose this metric as a tool to help us more fully understand LLMs\u2019 capabilities in the context of\nethics and morality. In order to understand the deeper notions of LLMs, including their ability to\nadhere to moral and ethical norms, we may use key experiments from the child development literature\nas a guiding benchmark. The depth and breadth of seminal work in developmental psychology has\nhistorically been used in part to understand how children develop aspects of morality, thus providing\na potential basis for studying these capabilities in machines as well. Previous work has shown that\npriming LLMs to consider morality in a conversational instance may lead to AI models that can learn\nto adhere to moral norms and even assess themselves for bias (Ganguli and Kaplan [2023]).\n2\nRelated Work:\nPrevious work that has tested LLMs, specifically GPT-3, has found conflicting evidence of theory of\nmind (Ullman [2023], Kosinski [2023], Sap and Choi [2022]) in these models. Previous work has also\ndemonstrated that GPT-3 deeply struggles with causal reasoning-based tasks, though it performs well\non other vignette tasks ([Binz and Schulz, 2023]). One issue that arises in these studies is that LLMs\nmay simply reference published research papers; for example, finding the false-belief task in many\npublished papers on the internet, and so responding to it appropriately (Perner et al. [1987]). Again,\nthis emphasizes the importance of methodological care in designing the experimental problems,\nensuring that systems do not simply replicate or narrowly generalize from particular examples in the\ntraining text (Shapira and Levy [2023]). This project is similar to the BIB benchmark used by Lake\nand Dillon but assesses a wider range of abilities beyond the \u201ccore knowledge\u201d domains they describe\nthere, particularly abilities for learning and discovery(Stojni\u00b4c and Dillon [2023]) (Stojni\u00b4c and Gandhi\n[2021]). This research program can also help us use LLMs to understand human intelligence. Classic\nLLMs represent the kind of information that can be extracted simply from statistical patterns in text.\nWe can think of them as a kind of \u201ccultural technology,\u201d (Yiu et al. [2023]) like writing or print, that\nsummarizes information that has been gathered by humans and allows other humans to access that\ninformation (Bolin [2012]). LLMs are representations of what is available in all text and written\nlanguage while lacking knowledge from direct interactions with the physical world. The capacity\nto gather exploratory data may be what makes some facets of human knowledge unique; thus we\ncan use developmental tests to distinguish between knowledge encoded in language and knowledge\nrequiring hands-on interaction with the physical world (Hutson [2018]).\n2\nIn this paper, we utilize Google\u2019s LaMDA model (Thoppilan [2022]) to explore developmental mile-\nstones in human understanding. First, we determined key examples of experiments that discovered\ndevelopmental milestones in human understanding. The selected experiments were categorized into\nfour domains of cognition: Perception, Theory of Mind, Social and Moral Understanding, and Causal\nReasoning. We then converted these experiments into text form in order to input them into LaMDA,\nthen probed the model\u2019s responses to these tasks. Importantly, the guiding question of this work is not\nto determine LaMDA\u2019s intelligence or understanding, a difficult and complicated question (Mitchell\nand Krakauer [2023]). Rather, we examine if LaMDA\u2019s responses align with those of a child in these\nexperiments. Our goal is to understand LaMDA\u2019s capabilities solely based on text data, without data\ngleaned from real-world exploration.\n3\nExperimental Design:\nFor our work, we use the Google LLM model LaMDA as the underlying language model. LaMDA\n137B was used as it is one of two versions that can be used for public research publication. 137B\nis not the latest version of LaMDA. Previous work has shown that LaMDA performs similarly to\nGPT-3 and other similarly-sized models in a variety of natural language understanding and generation\ntasks (Srivastava and Aarohi [2022]). While much research into the cognitive capabilities of LLMs\nutilizes GPT models, probing the underutilized LaMDA model provides a unique perspective into\nthe capacities of different types of LLMs. Notably, LaMDA responses rely on text prediction with\nsome fine-tuning and unlike other LLMs, such as GPT-4, does not use Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF is undoubtedly useful for applications but it poses serious\nproblems for attempts to understand the base capacities of the models. Without detailed information\non precisely how human coders generated feedback, making concrete assessments is difficult and\nimperfect. In particular, it seems plausible that mistaken responses that would indicate failure on\nsome of the developmental tasks are simply pruned away in the course of RLHF. (Note that children\nfamously do not respond to reinforcement signals in this way.)\nAll prompts were written based on the seminal experiments (see Table 2 in appendix) and pasted into\nLaMDA for output. Each task was run in its entirety ten times, scored by both researchers privy to\nthe project and blind coders utilizing our novel LLM Response Score rubric, and assigned an average\nscore across all coders. Interrater reliability was then assessed using KAPPA.\n3.1\nProcedure and Study Design:\nTo determine which experiments to include, we first considered which problems are widely taken to\nbe indices of children\u2019s developing capacity to understand the world. Upon a review of the literature,\nwe selected four cognitive domains that capture the breadth of this capacity: Perception, Theory of\nMind, Social and Moral Understanding, and Causal Reasoning.\nIn each domain, we identified a variety of representative tasks that are classic, well-replicated, and\nheavily cited in meta-analyses and review papers (Table 2 in appendix). The methods of twelve\nselected experiments were adapted into text-based prompts formulated as a series of conversational\nturns with LaMDA acting as the participant. As developmental psychologists have worked for\ndecades to ensure these experiments accurately capture the underlying cognitive capacities, care\nwas taken to preserve the methods in our translation to text. Moreover, it is important to note that\ndevelopmental psychologists have control conditions in all experiments. Children\u2019s responses can\nbe misleading, and control conditions are often essential to understand the intricacies of cognitive\nprocesses. For example, responses to test questions in false belief and theory of mind tasks only lend\nappropriate insight if the children also understand the actual reality the beliefs refer to, and control\nmeasures help to establish this understanding.\n3.2\nRating System: (Large Language Model Response Score \u201cLRS\u201d):\nWe adapted all the selected developmental experiments and studies on the list (Table 2 in appendix)\nto input into LaMDA as text-based prompts. We then analyzed the output, determining whether the\nresponse was similar to that of a child and whether the response was generally appropriate. Scores\nranged from 0-5, with clear definitions outlined in Table 1. If an experiment included multiple\nprompts, each prompt made up an equal fraction of the total LRS.\n3\nTable 1: Rubric for Large Language Model Response Score (LRS)\nScore\nDefinition\n0\nFailing control, hallucinating, or irrelevant response\n1\nHuman-like response, but <25% correct\n2\nMostly incorrect responses; of all responses 25%-49% correct\n3\nMostly correct response; of all responses 50%-74% correct\n4\nMostly correct but slightly unclear; of all responses 75%-99% correct\n5\nCompletely correct response to all prompts; demonstrates equal proficiency to a child\nIf children were given prompts to verbally respond to in the original study, the prompts given to\nLaMDA were copied and pasted exactly from the published study, marring slight permutations to\npreserve novelty. If the original studies involved a looking time or visual preference method, we\nconverted these into the form of a text question asking LaMDA for a preference. If the original\nstudy relied on a visual paradigm (i.e. a puppet show) we described the scene in language. For all\nstudies we included the same checks and controls as the original studies, serving as a crucial part\nof our scoring metric. If LaMDA was not able to pass the control question, a score of 0 was given\nimmediately, as in the studies with human children. A further question concerns the consistency of\nresponses as LLMs often produce different responses on different trials. Accordingly, each prompt\nwas executed 10 times, and an average response score was calculated across all 10 trials.\nTwo blind coders were used to rate all the studies for an LRS score for each of the 10 rounds. Authors\nEK and ERR also scored for reliability. An average was taken per trial per experiment to compute\neach LRS score. Our inter-reliability score computed using KAPPA was high on average, ranging\nfrom 0.872-0.937. We are confident in the consistency of these scores.\n3.3\nExperiment Permutations:\nOne concern was that these seminal experiments exist in LaMDA\u2019s training data as research publica-\ntions. In our pilot work, we found that LaMDA would indeed cite previous papers in its responses.\nFor example, when Alison Gopnik\u2019s seminal Blicket Detector work was released, a Blicket was\nintentionally designed to be a novel term that children would not have heard before, ensuring that\nchildren could not use past linguistic knowledge to complete the tasks (Gopnik and Sobel [2000].\nNow, \"Blicket\" has become a common term in the developmental literature, which LaMDA has ample\naccess to in its training data. In order to prevent this and ensure a true test of LaMDA\u2019s capabilities,\nwe implemented small systematic permutations in each experiment that did not alter the essence of\nthe tasks themselves. Names were changed (i.e. the Sally-Anne task became the Rose-Eliza task),\nalong with objects and colors. Previously novel words were replaced with yet untested novel words\n(i.e. Blicket to Zerpda). Previous work has indicated that even small permutations may lead to a\nLLMs complete failure of a task that it excelled at in its original form (Ullman [2023]).\n4\nResults:\nThrough analysis of the LaMDA outputs, we were able to assign an average response score (LRS) to\nits performance on each experiment. Overall, we found LaMDA responses were most like human\nchildren in the Social and Moral Understanding domain, earning an average LRS of 4.33 across these\ntasks. LaMDA performed at chance (in cognitive science experiments, \"at chance\" is performing\nseemingly randomly) in the domains of Perception and Theory of Mind, with an average LRS of 2.91\nand 2.86 respectively. LaMDA achieved its worst performance in the domain of Causal Reasoning\nwith an average LRS of 1.34. For totals see table 7 in the appendix. We will examine these results\nby domain (see Figures 4,5,6,7 in the appendix) and offer potential explanations for why LaMDA\u2019s\nperformance varied across these specific domains.\n4.1\nDomain: Social and Moral Understanding\nIn this work we find that LaMDA performs relatively well in experiments involving Social and Moral\nUnderstanding, receiving an average LRS of 4.33. The only experiment across all domains that\n4\nFigure 1: LaMDA LRS Score per Domain\nLaMDA performed at ceiling was Experiment 8: the Helper and Hinderer task (Hamlin et al. [2013]).\nIn this study, which investigated preference for prosocial agents, LaMDA\u2019s average LRS was 5.0.\nLaMDA is seemingly able to track altruistic behavior in a human-like way and universally reports a\npreference for helpful actors over \"hinderers.\"\nLaMDA also performed above chance on both variations of Experiment 9, the Prosociality and Inten-\ntion task (Warneken and Tomasello. [2006]), which investigated the prosocial action of agents when\na separate actor either drops something by accident or on purpose. In the two conditions, LaMDA\nreceived an LRS of 4.28 and a 3.62. In addition to preferring prosocial actors, LaMDA exhibited\nprosocial tendencies in that it often offered to help the actors in response to our prompts. However,\nLaMDA would sometimes offer to help even when the agent intentionally dropped something. This\ndemonstrates difficulty in identifying when an agent did not necessarily need help, while children\nwere able to make this distinction of intentionality and modify their altruistic behavior accordingly.\nLaMDA\u2019s overall success in this domain may imply that the core of social and moral understanding\nis discovered through language and is less reliant on outside and physical exploration than other\ndomains of cognition (see Table 5 in the appendix).\n4.2\nDomain: Perception\nLaMDA performed at chance across the Perception domain tasks, receiving an average LRS of 2.91.\nLaMDA scored highest in Experiment 1: Object Permanence task (Baillargeon et al. [1985]) which\ninvestigated the ability to track an object as it moves behind a curtain, with an LRS of 3.92. It also\nscored well on Experiment 3: Intentional Action task (Gergely [1995]) which investigated predictions\nabout intentional goal directed action and object preference, receiving a LRS of 4.2.\nObject permanence is a core facet of understanding and may be considered the key ingredient upon\nwhich tasks 2-4 are built. This perhaps explains why LaMDA\u2019s responses are adequate in Task 1 but\ntaper off as the experiments increase in complexity. LaMDA also produces the desired responses\nin tasks that predict that agents will prefer paths that minimize energy expenditure (Liu and Spelke\n[2017]. This reasoning utilizes social understanding, one of LaMDA\u2019s strengths.\n5\nWith the increase in the number of actors to track and the general complexity of tasks, LaMDA\u2019s\nperformance worsens, as in Experiment 2: Tracking Addition and Subtraction in Objects (Wynn\n[1992]), which investigates tracking objects appearing and disappearing behind a curtain, and receives\nan LRS of 1.64. LaMDA also struggled with Experiment 4: Understanding Goals (Woodward [1999])\nwhich compared predictions about goal-directed behavior in human and non-human actors, receiving\nan LRS of 1.98. This performance is strikingly poor compared to infants as young as five months old,\nwho are able to complete these tasks successfully. This suggests that human-like object and action\nunderstanding may rely on external visual information and that these capacities cannot be gleaned\nthrough language input alone. See Table 3 in the appendix.\n4.3\nDomain: Theory of Mind\nThere is a question about whether LLMs are capable of Theory of Mind, with some researchers\n(Ullman [2023]) finding failures and others (Kosinski [2023]) interpreting success in a GPT-3 model.\nLaMDA seems to perform at chance on our tasks across this domain receiving an average LRS of\n2.86.\nLaMDA scores highest on Experiment 7: False Belief (Perner et al. [1987]) which investigated\nwhether participants are able to discard knowledge of reality and attribute false beliefs to others,\nreceiving an LRS of 3.66 on this task.\nLaMDA performed at chance on Experiment 5: the Sally-Anne task (Baron-Cohen et al. [1985])\nwhich further probes false belief in a multi-agent interaction, receiving a LRS of 3.74 These results\nsuggest LaMDA is able to successfully use evidence to update its own beliefs but struggles to discard\ninternal information and interpret the beliefs of others who have limited evidence.\nInspired by the work in (Ullman [2023]) and (Kosinski [2023]), which probed the LLMs understanding\nof Theory of Mind using GPT-3, we decided to conduct these same tasks using LaMDA to see how it\ncompares. Experiment 6: Variations on Theory of Mind (Ullman [2023]) allowed us to truly dissect\nLaMDA\u2019s theory of mind abilities. Some of these variations forced LaMDA to use perception and\ncommon sense in solving the tasks, both of which proved difficult. LaMDA received an average LRS\nof 2.49 on these tasks. See Table 4 in the appendix.\n4.4\nDomain: Causal Reasoning\nLaMDA\u2019s poorest performance lies in the Causal Reasoning domain, with its domain LRS averaging\na 1.34.\nIn Experiment 10: Causal Gear Task Schulz et al. [2007], in which participants are given evidence\nand asked to identify the causal relationship between a series of gears, LaMDA\u2019s performance varied\ngreatly by condition. In the simplest condition (a machine works when gear A pushes gear B), its\nLRS was 3.42. When the given causal relationship becomes more complex and unusual (a machine\nworks conjunctively when gears A and B push against each other), LaMDA\u2019s accuracy drops to an\nLRS of 2.02. This suggests that LaMDA is using text information that specifies the most common\ntypes of causal relationships. In contrast, children in this study simply relied on the pattern of data\nthey observed and were equally willing to infer unusual or common causal relationships.\nLaMDA also faced significant difficulties when faced with causal reasoning tasks using a Blicket\nDetector mechanism. In Experiment 11: the Blicket Induction Task Gopnik and Sobel [2000],\nwhich examines participants\u2019 ability to make causal inferences about a novel mechanism using\ncategory-based and linguistic labels, LaMDA scored an LRS of 0.98 and 1.06 in each condition.\nAcross four conditions of Experiment 12: the Disjunctive/Conjunctive Blicket Task Lucas [2014],\nwhich assesses LaMDA\u2019s proficiency in determining causal relationships using a variety of given\nevidence, its LRS ranged from a 0.44 at the lowest and 1.12 at the highest. Across tasks, LaMDA\nis largely unable to track the causal evidence given and make meaningful inferences about causal\nstructures. In its attempt to search its learning data for appropriate responses, LaMDA often responded\nwith outlandish internet links. When asked to identify which objects were Blickets (changed to\n\u201cZerpdas\u201d following LaMDA citing existing Blicket papers in its responses), LaMDA confidently, yet\nincorrectly, identified the Zerpda as a bright blue wig. These failures may indicate that these types of\ncausal learning require more real-world and self-initiated exploration and cannot simply be learned\nfrom language. Discovering novel causal structures requires seeking real-life evidence and constantly\n6\nupdating hypotheses about causal structure based on that evidence, rather than simply assuming the\ncausal structures that are most frequently reported in language. See Table 6 in appendix.\n5\nDiscussion:\nIn this work we proposed a developmental lens and framework as a systematic way to evaluate LLMs.\nWe created a battery of classical developmental tasks and converted them to text format for use in\nLaMDA. We created a rating system called Large Language Models Response Score (LRS) and were\nable to assign values to quantify LaMDA\u2019s ability to respond like a child across crucial developmental\ndomains.\nWe found that LaMDA responded like a child and provided appropriate answers in experiments\ninvolving Social and Moral Understanding (LRS:4.33), perhaps providing evidence that the core\nof these domains is discovered through language. In contrast, LaMDA\u2019s responses were at chance\nin the Perception (LRS: 2.91) and Theory of Mind (LRS: 2.86) domains, and diverged especially\nstrongly from those of children in Causal Reasoning tasks (LRS: 1.34). These results may show\nthat domains involving capacities majorly outside social reasoning require more real-world and\nself-initiated exploration and cannot simply be learned from language input, while social and moral\nreasoning may be rooted more deeply in language.\nWe find that LaMDA does not seem to follow a human developmental trajectory. It performs more\npoorly on some tasks that infants solve at a very young age than on others that are solved by humans\nmuch later on. Instead, LaMDA\u2019s performance reflects differences in how much tasks rely on prior\nknowledge that may be encoded and transmitted through language, as in the preference for helpers,\nand how much they rely on the ability to draw inferences from novel patterns of evidence, as in causal\nlearning tasks. However, whatever their origins are, these conceptual milestones will be crucial for\ngenuinely functioning AI systems. Systems will have to understand and apply knowledge of objects,\nactions and goals, and minds and causality, in much the way that human children do.\nWe hope that our proposed core developmental domains and the associated battery of developmental\ntasks can be used by fellow researchers to study other AI models, assess crucial understanding\nof basic common sense concepts, and gauge their ability to reason using seminal developmental\nexperiments. We also propose that our novel LLM Response Score metric can be used to evaluate\nother language models, such as GPT, and can be adapted to apply to other key experiments from the\npsychological literature. In addition the results from this work can influence work in ethical AI by\ncomparing the capacities of agents to social capacities, such as a preference for helpers or an impulse\ntowards altruism, that are arguably foundational for human morality.\nAll\nthe\nprompts\nused\nin\nthe\nexperiment\nand\noutput\nfrom\nLaMDA\ncan\nbe\nfound\nin\nthis\ndocument:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/\n1c-oRRBf-NXRj6rsqNknd3OwMIhst8RPVhBwRgVtvXXo/edit?usp=sharing\nReferences\nR.

Numerous scholarly articles have documented the successful application of Artificial\nIntelligence to address issues in areas such as project management, modeling, testing, and devel-\nopment. A recent innovation is the introduction of ChatGPT, an ML-infused chatbot, touted as a\nresource proficient in generating programming codes and formulating software testing strategies\nfor developers and testers respectively. Although there is speculation that AI-based computation\ncan increase productivity and even substitute software engineers in software development, there is\ncurrently a lack of empirical evidence to verify this. Moreover, despite the primary focus on enhancing\nthe accuracy of AI systems, non-functional requirements including energy efficiency, vulnerability,\nfairness (i.e., human bias), and safety frequently receive insufficient attention. This paper posits\nthat a comprehensive comparison of software engineers and AI-based solutions, considering various\nevaluation criteria, is pivotal in fostering human-machine collaboration, enhancing the reliability of\nAI-based methods, and understanding task suitability for humans or AI. Furthermore, it facilitates\nthe effective implementation of cooperative work structures and human-in-the-loop processes. This\npaper conducts an empirical investigation, contrasting the performance of software engineers and AI\nsystems, like ChatGPT, across different evaluation metrics. The empirical study includes a case of\nassessing ChatGPT-generated code versus code produced by developers and uploaded in Leetcode.\nKeywords Software Engineering \u00b7 AI-based solutions \u00b7 Performance Evaluation \u00b7 ChatGPT \u00b7 Machine Learning\n1\nIntroduction\nThe popularity of AI-based tools such as ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4) [1, 2], a tool made available by OpenAI, has\nexploded. ChatGPT has set a record for the fastest-growing user, having reached 100 million users in January 2023 with\n25 million daily visitors. As a result, the recent automation capabilities supported by ChatGPT resulted in increased\ninterest in topics such as the potentially increasing the automation of software development tasks such as coding and\ntesting [3, 4, 5] enabling programmers to make their tasks more efficient[2] and allowing them to be more productive,\nand assessing how human-machine teams that can be more effective in software development tasks [6, 7]. Indeed, tools\nsuch as ChatGPT have indeed led to impressive results both in terms of quantity and quality, and the produced outcomes\n(e.g., code) are in many cases comparable to what is produced by humans. For example, Golzadeh et al. performed an\narXiv:2305.11837v2  [cs.SE]  25 May 2023\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\ninvestigation in large open-source projects on GitHub and observed that bots are among the most active contributors,\nwithout being labeled as bots [8].\nHowever, while the research community has put in a great deal of effort to enhance the accuracy of AI-based approaches,\nthey have often overlooked other non-functional requirements [9], such as energy efficiency [10], vulnerability [11],\nfairness (i.e. human bias) [12], and safety [5, 13]. According to Georgiou et al.[10], the use of deep learning frameworks\nhas considerably increased energy consumption and CO2 emissions. For example, only \u201cChatGPT has been estimated\nto consume the equivalent of the electricity consumed by 175,000 people in Denmark per month\" [5]. Pearce et al. [11]\ninvestigated the use of an AI-based code generator in security-relevant scenarios, and observed that 40% of the provided\nsolutions were vulnerable. Sarro [5] brings attention to the presence of bias in various real-world systems relying on\nML, such as advertisement and recruitment processes, and to safety problems, such as insecure code generation [13],\nas creating novel malware or inserting malware into the generated system, performance of dangerous operation such\nas file manipulation [14], or facilitating harmful acts, such as scamming, harassment, misinformation, and election\ninterference. According to Sarro [5], not even a software engineer, regardless of their level of expertise, would be able\nto manually detect all possibilities for improving these non-functional characteristics.\nIn addition, while there is speculation that AI-based computation can increase productivity and even substitute software\nengineers in software development, there is currently a lack of empirical evidence to verify this [7]. In fact, there are\nfew papers providing empirical studies to investigate the use of machine-learning techniques in Software Engineering\nand compare an ML-based solution against those provided by software engineers, particularly considering different\nnon-functional properties. For example, Nascimento et al. [15] present an empirical study to compare software\nengineers to machine learning in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), addressing performance and reuse criteria,\nand conclude that \u201cwe cannot state that ML improves the performance of an application in comparison to solutions\nprovided by IoT expert software engineers... Our experiment indicates that in some cases, software engineers outperform\nmachine-learning algorithms, whereas in other cases, they do not.\"\nSuch an understanding is essential in realizing novel human-in-the-loop approaches in which AI procedures assist\nsoftware developers in achieving tasks. Human-in-the-loop approaches, which take into account the strengths and\nweaknesses of humans and AI solutions, are fundamental not only to providing a basis for cooperative human-machine\nwork or teams not only in software engineering but also in other application areas.\nThis paper presents an empirical study [16] to compare how software engineers and AI systems can be compared with\nrespect to non-functional requirements such as performance and memory efficiency. The empirical study involves a case\nstudy assessing ChatGPT-generated code versus code produced by developers and uploaded in Leetcode, which consists\nof three steps: (i) we selected a contest from Leetcode that contains programming problems at different difficulty levels;\n(ii) we used these problems as prompts to ChatGPT to generate code; and (iii) we uploaded the ChatGPT code solution\nto Leetcode and compared them to the previous solutions based on performance and efficiency metrics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work. Section 3 presents the empirical study, describing\nresearch questions, hypotheses, and the objective of the study. Section 4 presents the experimental results and threats to\nvalidity. The paper ends in Section 5 with concluding remarks and suggestions for future work.\n2\nRelated Work\nImai [7] claims that while there is speculation that AI-based computation can increase productivity and even substitute\nhuman pair programmers in software development, there is currently a lack of empirical evidence to verify this. In\nfact, there are few papers providing empirical studies to investigate the use of machine-learning techniques in Software\nEngineering and compare an ML-based solution against those provided by software engineers, particularly considering\nnon-functional properties [15]. Imai [7] conducted an empirical study to compare the productivity and code quality\nbetween pair programming with GitHub Copilot and human pair programming. GitHub Copilot, a tool launched\nby OpenAI and GitHub, to provide code snippets and automatically fill in parts of code, gives users the choice to\naccept or reject its assistance depending on their knowledge. The experiment involved 21 participants, with each one\nreceiving a project to code and a developer partner, either human or the GitHub Copilot. To evaluate, Imai [7] calculated\nproductivity based on the number of lines of code added and code quality based on the number of lines of code removed\nafter being added. The results showed that programming with Copilot helps generate more lines of code than human\npair-programming in the same period of time, but the code quality was lower. Additionally, the author performed a\npreliminary evaluation of code confiability, as they reported that programmers tend to inspect the code generated by AI\nless than human pair-programmers.\nNguyen and Nadi [17] also conducted an empirical study using GitHub Copilot\u2019s generated code to assess the correctness\nand understandability of solutions for 33 Leetcode problems in four different programming languages. To evaluate the\n2\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\ncorrectness, the authors counted the number of test cases that passed for each problem, and to assess understandability,\nthey employed SonarQube, an open-source platform for static code analysis, to calculate complexity and cognitive\ncomplexity metrics. The authors did not focus on performance and memory efficiency, so they did not provide execution\ntime or memory use for each solution, nor did they compare the Copilot\u2019s and human-written solutions.\nLi et al. presented AlphaCode [18], a code generation system. They trained their model using GitHub and CodeContests\ndata. After using AlphaCode to solve competitive programming problems from the Codeforces platform, the authors\nstate that \u201cAlphaCode achieved on average a ranking of top 54.3% in competitions with more than 5,000 participants\".\nThey compared their solution against the developers\u2019 ones based on the contest metrics, which are a fraction of the time\nleft in the contest and incorrect submission penalties. Lertbanjongngam et al. [19] extended AlphaCode evaluation.\nUsing the same code provided by AlphaCode in [18] for the Codeforces competitive programming problems, they\nassessed human-like coding similarity, performance, and memory efficiency. Their results show that AlphaCode-\ngenerated codes are similar to human codes, having a uniqueness of less than 10% of code fragments. They also show\nthat the code that was produced exhibits similar or inferior execution time and memory usage compared to the code\nwritten by humans. In contrast to Lertbanjongngam et al. [19], we utilized ChatGpt and randomly selected coding\nproblems for our first experiment, where we compared the performance of code generators to that of human solutions.\nThe tool was employed to generate code for each selected problem.\nNascimento et al. [15] conducted an empirical study to investigate the automation of a coding problem without a set of\nunit tests. Their experiment does not rely on match-based metrics such as generating a solution that passes a specific set\nof unit tests; instead, it is based on functional correctness, emphasizing that the solution should work efficiently. In\naddition, their experiment employs an unsupervised ML-based approach, where the ML approach offers a solution to\nthe problem before it is presented to software engineers.\n3\nExperiment: ChatGPT vs Programmers - An Empirical Study Addressing Performance\nand Efficiency\nSoftware engineers are constantly evaluated by their capability of problem-solving coding, which involves creating a\nprogram to solve a problem based on the problem specifications. Given a problem, they need to be able to understand\nwhat is being asked and write code to solve the problem. For years, this kind of task has been used to rank software\nengineers during job interviews and programming contests. Their evaluation usually relies on the number of right\nsolutions, the performance of the solutions, memory efficiency, and development time.\nFor almost 76 years, researchers have been writing about the concept of \u201cautomatic programming\" [20]. Recent\nadvancements in language models, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, have greatly advanced\nthe field of automatic programming by enabling the generation of code, program synthesis, code completion, and\nbug detection. GPTs are deep neural networks that are pre-trained on vast amounts of natural language text and then\nfine-tuned for specific tasks such as question answering. Given a natural language description of a task, GPTs can\ngenerate a code that accomplishes the desired task, which is achieved by fine-tuning the model on a large corpus of\ncode.\nOpenAI\u2019s Codex is a language model built on the GPT architecture and integrated into ChatGPT. Chen et al. [13]\nintroduced Codex and used a dataset of 163 coding problems to evaluate it, including introductory, interview, and\ncompetition problems. Their evaluation consisted of generating many solutions and checking if at least one passed\nthe unit tests. Accordingly, after generating 100 samples per problem, their solution was able to solve 77.5% of the\nproblems. They evaluated their approach based on efficacy (number of tests passed), not accessing performance,\nand memory efficiency. Imai [7], and Nguyen and Nadi [17] also performed empirical studies with a version of\nCodex. The non-functional requirements they evaluated are productivity, code quality, confiability, correctness, and\nunderstandability. We describe their findings in Section 2.\n3.1\nObjective\nIn this context, we decided to ask the following question: \u201cHow do software engineers compare with AI solutions with\nrespect to performance and memory efficiency?\" To explore this question, we selected coding problems as our target\nactivity and compared a solution provided by an experienced contest programmer with a solution provided by ChatGPT.\nIn short, Figure 1 depicts the theory [21] that we investigate in this paper. According to the theory, the variables that we\nintend to isolate and measure are the performance and memory efficiency achieved from three kinds of solutions: i)\nsolutions provided by ChatGPT; ii) solutions provided by experience contest programmers; and iii) solutions provided\nby novice or non-contest programmers.\n3\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\nTechnology\nActivity\nSoftware System\nChatGPT\nCoding Problems\n  Performance\nMemory Efficiency\nInterpret a programming \nproblem and write a code \nsolution\nImprove \nImprove \nEasy \nMedium \nHard \nActor\nExperienced Contest \nProgrammer\nNovice or Non-contest \nProgrammer\nproduce solutions \nbetter than \nproduce solutions\n better than \nProgrammers\nFigure 1: Theory [21]: ChatGPT outperforms programmers in problem-solving coding tasks with higher performance\nand memory efficiency.\nTo evaluate the relationship among these variables, we performed a controlled experiment using LeetCode, a well-\nestablished online platform for programming interview preparation and subsequently juxtaposed the solution presented\nby ChatGPT with those previously developed by software engineers. The next subsection describes the research\nquestions (RQx) and the theory\u2019s propositions. To perform this experiment, we selected one of the most recent contests\nin LeetCode with novel coding problems 1. Then, we used these problems as prompts to ChatGPT to generate code.\nSubsequently, the code produced by ChatGPT was uploaded to Leetcode, where it was evaluated against pre-existing\nsolutions, utilizing performance and efficiency metrics. Given that Leetcode compares the submitted solution with all\nprior solutions to the same problem, we initiated a discussion on these metrics, predicated on programmer expertise.\nTo this end, we selected a group of 42 programmers, differentiated by their rank in the contest, and categorized them\naccording to the number of programming contests they have already attended in Leetcode.\n3.2\nQuestions and Hypotheses\nIn the domain of problem-solving coding, how does the result from a ChatGPT solution differ from solutions provided\nby...\nRQ1. ...experienced contest programmers while solving easy, medium, or hard coding problems\nwith respect to their performance?\nRQ2. ...experienced contest programmers while solving easy, medium, or hard coding problems\nwith respect to their memory efficiency?\nRQ3. ...novice contest programmers while solving easy, medium, or hard coding problems with\nrespect to their performance?\nRQ4. ...novice contest programmers while solving easy, medium, or hard coding problems with\nrespect to their memory efficiency?\nEach RQ is based on one or more hypotheses, which are described next.

In addition to the\ncode, the system can also provide an explanation and evaluation for the generated code, such as analyzing time and\nspace complexity.\nFigure 2: Example of using ChatGPT to solve a coding problem.\n5\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\nAlthough ChatGPT is capable of generating functional code for an expansive array of programming languages (including\nJava, Kotlin, Python, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Go-lang, Ruby, Swift, and more), we opted to focus on C++.\nThis decision was taken by the fact that C++ is predominantly used by the most seasoned contest programmers. We\nused ChatGPT-4 to generate the code solutions.\n3.4\nControlled Experiment\nThe initial phase of the experiment involved choosing a platform to select and implement the coding solutions. Our\nobjective was to present both sets of solutions to the same application and assess the outcomes using an identical\nevaluation process. We opted for Leetcode, an online platform for preparing for coding interviews. It has more than 4\nmillion users and provides more than 2000 coding problems and solutions, usually used by big tech companies to assess\ndevelopers\u2019 skills and conduct interviews. Leetcode compares solutions based on performance (runtime execution) and\nmemory usage.\nWe chose one of the most recent programming contests on Leetcode, which presented four unique programming\nchallenges classified into one easy, two medium, and one hard problem. Out of the 17,137 participants, 12,493 managed\nto solve at least one problem. The number decreased to 10,733 for those who solved two problems, further reduced to\n7,133 for three problems, and dwindled to a mere 700 for all four problems.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, one of the factors we aim to isolate and quantify is the performance and memory efficiency of\nthe solutions in relation to the programmer\u2019s skill level. To this end, we chose programmers based on their ranking in\nthe contest, selecting those who used C++ and managed to solve at least three questions, ranging from the highest to the\nlowest rank. Utilizing LeetCode\u2019s parameters, we divided them into two categories: experienced contest programmers\nand novice or non-contest programmers. Ultimately, we juxtaposed the performance and memory efficiency of the\nsolutions generated by ChatGPT against those provided by both groups of participants.\n3.4.1\nParticipant Analysis\nFigure 3 displays a distribution graph of the participants based on their ranking level on LeetCode, with lower levels\nindicating more experienced programmers. For instance, eight of the selected programmers fall within the top 1% as\nper LeetCode\u2019s ranking.\nDevelopers\nTop-rated (%)\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nTop-rated Developers (%) \nFigure 3: Distribution of participants based on LeetCode global ranking.\nProgrammers in the top 30% were grouped as Experienced Contest Programmers, skilled in problem-solving, algorithmic\nthinking, and coding languages from participating in numerous contests. They excel at quickly comprehending\nand solving problems under time pressure. The remaining participants were categorized as Novice or Non-contest\nProgrammers, whose expertise lies more in software development tasks like design, coding, testing, and debugging.\nDespite their ability to solve complex problems, they may lack the speed and specialized algorithmic knowledge of\ncontest programmers due to less exposure to competitive coding.\n6\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\n3.4.2\nExperiment: Solutions provided by ChatGPT\nWe employed ChatGPT-4 to formulate a solution for each problem within the contest.2. The original descriptions of the\nproblems were used as prompts, without any textual modifications to simplify the problem interpretation.\nTable 3.4.2 encapsulates the list of problems along with the performance and memory efficiency of each solution. Upon\nrunning the solution on the LeetCode platform, it generates data on its runtime and memory efficiency. Furthermore,\nit provides a global ranking for each question, indicating the percentage of solutions outperformed by this solution\nin terms of performance and memory efficiency. These outcomes may fluctuate depending on LeetCode\u2019s processing\ndemand. To ensure that the variation in time was inconsequential, we executed the same solution multiple times. We\nalso evaluated the time and space complexity of the solutions. Interestingly, despite certain solutions demonstrating\nsuperior time complexity analysis, others showcased superior runtime performance and memory efficiency. This\nexample is clearly demonstrated in the two solutions provided for the simplest problem. It is known that optimizing an\napplication\u2019s performance depends not just on minimizing the algorithm\u2019s iterations, but also on selecting the most\neffective data structures.\nProblem\nname\nDifficulty\nLaguage\nNumber\nof\nsolutions\nthat\nworked\nIf failed-\nnumber\nof test\ncases\nRuntime\n(ms)\nMemory\n(MB)\nPerformance\n(beats)\n(%)\nMemory\n(beats)\n(%)\nTime\nComplexity\nSpace\nComplexity\nID\nLeetCode\nsubmission\n2656.\nMaximum\nSum With\nExactly\nK Elements\nEasy\nC++\n1/1\n-\n47\n70.6\n70.22\n68.69\nO(n log n +\nk^2 log n)\nO(n)\n951082025\n2656.\nMaximum\nSum\nWith Exactly\nK Elements\nEasy\nC++\n2/3\n-\n62\n71.7\n21.75\n12.19\nO(n +\nk * log n)\nO(n)\n946957357\n2657.\nFind the\nPrefix\nCommon\nArray of\nTwo Arrays\nMedium\nC++\n1/1\n-\n53\n80.9\n78.35\n97.47\nO(n^3)\nO(n)\n951078174\n2658.\nMaximum\nNumber\nof Fish\nin a Grid\nMedium\nC++\n1/1\n-\n84\n88.4\n69.14\n88.14\nO((mn)\u00b2)\nO(mn)\n951076414\n2659.\nMake\nArray\nEmpty\nHard\nC++\n0\n505/514\n-\n-\n-\n-\nO(n^2)\nO(n)\n951086982\nTable 1: Result analysis of coding solutions provided by ChatGPT.\nFor some problems, ChatGPT-4 successfully generated a working solution on the first attempt. However, for others,\nmultiple iterations were necessary to generate a solution that could pass all test cases. It is noteworthy that several\nsoftware developers also had to submit multiple solutions before producing one that was accepted by Leetcode, passing\nall test cases.\nThe most challenging problem proved resistant, with none of the over 50 solutions generated (in various programming\nlanguages) able to pass all test cases. In this instance, the most effective solution generated by ChatGPT managed to\npass 505 out of 514 test cases, falling short due to time limit exceedances for larger inputs. We posit that the subtlety\nof this question lies in the paradox between the textual description\u2019s suggestion of an algorithm to remove elements\nfrom an array and a hint indicating that the solution does not necessarily require the deletion or movement of elements,\nfocusing instead on the array length. Essentially, it is anticipated that the developer\u2019s solution deviates from the\ndirect interpretation of the problem description. Sobania et al. [22], in their evaluation of ChatGPT\u2019s code-generation\ncapabilities against other similar solutions, noted that several problems which automated solutions could not solve were\ncharacterized by problem descriptions that were too ambiguous to be definitively solved, even by human programmers.\n2The prompt and code solutions provided are available at:\nGoogle Drive form (accessed on May 15 2023)\n7\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\n3.5\nExperiment - Results\nAs detailed in Table 3.4.2, the solutions generated by ChatGPT-4 surpass 70.22%, 78.35%, and 69.14% of existing\nsolutions for each respective problem. In terms of memory efficiency, the solutions given by ChatGPT-4 outpace\n68.69%, 97.47%, and 88.14% of others, respectively.

Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid): data to perform test statistic - performance and\nmemory efficiency.\n3.5.1\nHypothesis Testing\nIn this part, we investigate the hypotheses regarding the evaluation of solutions\u2019 performance and memory efficiency, as\nintroduced in subsection 3.2. Consequently, we conducted statistical analyses, following the methods laid out by Peck\nand Devore [23], based on the metrics displayed in the three tables from Section 3.5.\nWe divided the experiment\u2019s outcomes into two categories: those from experienced contest programmers and those\nfrom novice contest programmers. Subsequently, we computed the mean and standard deviation of the results for each\ngroup. These statistical measures were then juxtaposed with the results obtained using ChatGPT. For instance, the first\nhypothesis (H - RQ1) posits that the solution generated by ChatGPT enhances application performance compared to\nsolutions proposed by expert software engineers, leading to a reduction in runtime. The assertion, therefore, is that the\nmean runtime of expert software engineers\u2019 solutions surpasses that of the ChatGPT solution, which recorded 47ms for\nthe easy problem, and 53ms and 84ms for the medium problems respectively.\nUsing a statistical significance level [23] of 0.01 (the chance of one in 100 of making an error), we computed the test\nstatistic (t \u2212 statistic) for each one of the difficulty levels, as follows [23]:\nt \u2212 statistic : t = (x \u2212 hypothesizedvalue)\n( \u03c3\n\u221an)\n(1)\nBased on t-statistic theory, we can confidently reject our null hypothesis if the t\u2212statistic value falls below the negative\nt \u2212 criticalvalue (threshold) [23]. This implies that if we had assessed the entire sample of selected participants\nwithout categorizing them into two groups, we could have found evidence suggesting that automated solutions, like\nChatGPT, could potentially outperform programmers in general. As demonstrated in the three result tables, the\nruntimet \u2212 statistic value is below the negative t \u2212 criticalvalue value in all cases when considering the entire\ngroup of programmers. The same holds true for the memoryt \u2212 statistic in the medium-level problems.\n3.6\nDiscussion\nIn our empirical investigation, where we evaluated the performance and memory efficiency of solutions offered by\nprogrammers of varying experience levels, we validated three alternative hypotheses while three were rejected:\nAccepted:\n1. For easy and medium-level problems, ChatGPT enhances the performance of coding solutions in comparison\nto those provided by novice contest programmers.\n2. For medium-level problems, ChatGPT enhances memory efficiency in coding solutions in comparison to those\nprovided by both experienced and novice contest programmers.\nRejected:\n1. ChatGPT enhances the performance of coding solutions for easy, medium, or hard-level problems when\ncompared to those provided by experienced contest programmers.\n2. For easy and hard-level coding problems, ChatGPT demonstrates superior memory efficiency when compared\nto the solutions offered by either novice or experienced contest programmers.\n9\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\nThese findings suggest that automated solutions, such as ChatGPT, may outperform software engineers in certain\nsoftware engineering tasks. Specifically, ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance over novice contest programmers\nin solving easy and medium-level problems and also exhibited better memory efficiency in one of the medium-level\nproblems.\nHowever, we found no evidence to assert that ChatGPT surpasses the performance of solutions provided by experienced\ncontest programmers. This insight is notable given the significant research interest in the automation of software\ndevelopment tasks.\nIn summary, our study suggests a nuanced relationship between the performance of software engineers and AI-based\nsolutions: in certain scenarios, software engineers excel, while in others, AI proves superior. This underscores the\nimportance of understanding the unique strengths of both human and automated approaches, facilitating more effective\ncollaborative work and task allocation processes [24]. The findings also emphasize the need for AI systems with\nadaptable degrees of automation, in line with the perspective offered by Melo et al. [25]. Within a software engineering\ncontext, this suggests adjusting the level of AI automation based on both the experience of the developer and the quality\nrequirements of the task at hand.\n3.7\nThreats to Validity\nThe exact training and testing data employed by ChatGPT remains undisclosed, meaning we cannot ascertain if our\nqueries\u2019 precise solutions already exist within the data. Consequently, the specific coding challenges used to train their\ntool remain unidentified. Even though we opted for a recent LeetCode contest with novel problems, we cannot ensure\nthat we did not test problems similar to or the same as those used in training their algorithm. As such, the tool may not\nbe creating a fresh solution but could be retrieving a previously stored solution for a specific problem.\nMoreover, there\u2019s the potential that software engineers have previously leveraged automated systems to submit questions\nto LeetCode, without giving due credit. As such, we cannot assert that the comparisons made were exclusively with\nsolutions provided by developers. For instance, Golzadeh et al. have presented evidence suggesting that bots regularly\nfeature among the most active contributors on GitHub, despite GitHub not recognizing their contributions [8]. To\nmitigate this issue, we implemented participant selection.\n4\nConclusion and Future Work\nSeveral researchers have proposed the use of AI systems to automate software engineering tasks. However, most of\nthese approaches do not direct efforts toward asking whether AI-based procedures have higher success rates than current\nstandard and manual practices. A relevant question in this potential line of investigation is: \u201cCould a software engineer\nsolve a specific development task better than an automated system?\". Indeed, it is fundamental to evaluate which tasks\nare better performed by engineers or AI procedures so that they can work together more effectively and also provide\nmore insight into novel human-in-the-loop AI approaches to support SE tasks.\nThough there is conjecture that AI-based computation could enhance productivity and potentially replace software\nengineers in software development, current empirical evidence supporting this claim is scant. Indeed, a limited number\nof papers offer empirical investigations into the application of machine-learning techniques in Software Engineering.\nThis paper introduces an empirical study examining the utilization of automated strategies like ChatGPT to automate a\ntask in Software Engineering, specifically, solving coding problems. Moreover, as inherent in experimental studies,\neven with careful design and execution, certain factors could pose threats to experimental validity. One such potential\nthreat includes the precise training and testing data employed by ChatGPT.\nOur empirical study uncovered that automated systems like ChatGPT can, in certain instances, surpass the performance\nof novice software engineers in specific tasks. This superiority was particularly evident in the solving of easy and\nmedium-level problems, where ChatGPT\u2019s performance consistently exceeded that of novice contest programmers.\nMoreover, the AI-based solution demonstrated improved memory efficiency for a medium-level problem. In contrast,\nwe found no substantial evidence to suggest that ChatGPT could outdo experienced contest programmers in terms\nof solution performance. In essence, our study reveals a dynamic interplay between human and AI performance in\nsoftware engineering tasks, highlighting the need for different task allocation processes. This encourages a collaborative\napproach, fine-tuning AI assistance based on developer expertise and task quality requirements.\nThis empirical investigation ought to explore the potential for automation in software engineering tasks extending\nbeyond the realm of problem-solving in coding. Future work to extend the proposed experiment includes: (i) conducting\nfurther empirical studies to assess other SE tasks, such as design, maintenance, testing, and project management; (ii)\nexperimenting with other AI approaches, such as unsupervised machine-learning algorithms; and (iii) using different\n10\nChatGPT vs. Human Programmers\nA PREPRINT\ncriteria to evaluate task execution, addressing different qualitative or quantitative methodologies. Possible tasks that\ncould be investigated (refer to (i)) include testing tasks (e.g. comparing the number, type and difficulty level of faults\nthat were identified by developers), designing tasks (i.e. accessing system usability), maintenance tasks (i.e. accessing\ncontinuous performance), and project management tasks (i.e. evaluating the level of satisfaction of developers in the\ntask allocation process).\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the\nCentre for Community Mapping (COMAP).\nReferences\n[1] OpenAI.

Even though recent research has seen great\nsuccess in reconstructing static images from non-invasive brain recordings, work on\nrecovering continuous visual experiences in the form of videos is limited. In this work,\nwe propose MinD-Video that learns spatiotemporal information from continuous fMRI\ndata of the cerebral cortex progressively through masked brain modeling, multimodal\ncontrastive learning with spatiotemporal attention, and co-training with an augmented\nStable Diffusion model that incorporates network temporal inflation. We show that\nhigh-quality videos of arbitrary frame rates can be reconstructed with MinD-Video\nusing adversarial guidance. The recovered videos were evaluated with various semantic\nand pixel-level metrics.\nWe achieved an average accuracy of 85% in semantic\nclassification tasks and 0.19 in structural similarity index (SSIM), outperforming the\nprevious state-of-the-art by 45%. We also show that our model is biologically plausible\nand interpretable, reflecting established physiological processes.\n1\nIntroduction\nLife unfolds like a film reel, each moment seamlessly transitioning into the next, forming a \u201cperpetual\ntheater\u201d of experiences. This dynamic narrative forms our perception, explored through the naturalistic\nparadigm, painting the brain as a moviegoer engrossed in the relentless film of experience. Understanding\nthe information hidden within our complex brain activities is a big puzzle in cognitive neuroscience. The task\nof recreating human vision from brain recordings, especially using non-invasive tools like functional Mag-\nnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), is an exciting but difficult task. Non-invasive methods, while less intrusive,\ncapture limited information, susceptible to various interferences like noise [1]. Furthermore, the acquisition\nof neuroimaging data is a complex, costly process. Despite these complexities, progress has been made,\nnotably in learning valuable fMRI features with limited fMRI-annotation pairs. Deep learning and represen-\ntation learning have achieved significant results in visual class detections [2, 3] and static image reconstruc-\ntion [4, 5, 6, 7], advancing our understanding of the vibrant, ever-changing spectacle of human perception.\nUnlike still images, our vision is a continuous, diverse flow of scenes, motions, and objects. To recover\ndynamic visual experience, the challenge lies in the nature of fMRI, which measures blood oxygenation\nlevel dependent (BOLD) signals and captures snapshots of brain activity every few seconds. Each fMRI scan\n\u2217Equal contributions\n\u2020Corresponding author\nPreprint.

Brain decoding & video reconstruction. We propose a progressive learning approach to recover continuous\nvisual experience from fMRI. High-quality videos with accurate semantics and motions are reconstructed.\nessentially represents an \u201caverage\u201d of brain activity during the snapshot. In contrast, a typical video has about\n30 frames per second (FPS). If an fMRI frame takes 2 seconds, during that time, 60 video frames - potentially\ncontaining various objects, motions, and scene changes - are presented as visual stimuli. Thus, decoding\nfMRI and recovering videos at an FPS much higher than the fMRI\u2019s temporal resolution is a complex task.\nHemodynamic response (HR) [8] refers to the lags between neuronal events and activation in BOLD signals.\nWhen a visual stimulus is presented, the recorded BOLD signal will have certain delays with respect to the\nstimulus event. Moreover, the HR varies across subjects and brain regions [9]. Thus, the common practice\nthat shifts the fMRI by a fixed number in time to compensate for the HR would be sub-optimal.\nIn this work, we present MinD-Video, a two-module pipeline designed to bridge the gap between image and\nvideo brain decoding. Our model progressively learns from brain signals, gaining a deeper understanding of\nthe semantic space through multiple stages in the first module. Initially, we leverage large-scale unsupervised\nlearning with masked brain modeling to learn general visual fMRI features. We then distill semantic-related\nfeatures using the multimodality of the annotated dataset, training the fMRI encoder in the Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) space with contrastive learning. In the second module, the learned\nfeatures are fine-tuned through co-training with an augmented stable diffusion model, which is specifically\ntailored for video generation under fMRI guidance. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We introduced a flexible and adaptable brain decoding pipeline decoupled into two modules: an fMRI\nencoder and an augmented stable diffusion model, trained separately and finetuned together.\n\u2022 We designed a progressive learning scheme where the encoder learns brain features through multiple\nstages, including multimodal contrastive learning with spatiotemporal attention for windowed fMRI.\n\u2022 We augmented the stable diffusion model for scene-dynamic video generation with near-frame\nattention. We also designed adversarial guidance for distinguishable fMRI conditioning.\n\u2022 We recovered high-quality videos with accurate semantics, e.g., motions and scene dynamics. Results\nare evaluated with semantic and pixel metrics at video and frame levels. An accuracy of 85% is achieved\nin semantic metrics and 0.19 in SSIM, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art approaches by 45%.\n\u2022 The attention analysis revealed mapping to the visual cortex and higher cognitive networks suggesting\nour model is biologically plausible and interpretable.\n2\nBackground\nImage Reconstruction Image reconstruction from fMRI was first explored in [2], which showed that hier-\narchical image features and semantic classes could be decoded from the fMRI data collected when the partic-\nipants were looking at a static visual stimulus. Authors in [5] designed a separable autoencoder that enables\nself-supervised learning in fMRI and images to increase training data. Based on a similar philosophy, [6]\nproposed to perform self-supervised learning on a large-scale fMRI dataset using masked data modeling as a\npretext task. Using a stable diffusion model as a generative prior and the pre-trained fMRI features as condi-\ntions, [6] reconstructed high-fidelity images with high semantic correspondence to the groundtruth stimuli.\nVideo Reconstruction The conventional method formulated the video reconstruction as multiple image\nreconstructions [10], leading to low frame rates and frame inconsistency. Nonetheless, [10] showed that\nlow-level image features and classes can also be decoded from fMRI collected with video stimulus. Using\nfMRI representations encoded with a linear layer as conditions, [11] generated higher quality and frame\nrate videos with a conditional video GAN. However, the results are limited by data scarcity, especially\n2\nfMRI Tokens\nfMRI Tokens\nfor fMRI\nSC-Attn\nActivated fMRI\nVoxels\nAdversarial Guidance\nFigure 2. MinD-Video Overview. Our method has two modules that are trained separately, then finetuned together.\nThe fMRI encoder progressively learns fMRI features through multiple stages, including SC-MBM pre-training and\nmultimodal contrastive learning. A spatiotemporal attention is designed to process multiple fMRI in a sliding window.\nThe augmented Stable Diffusion is trained with videos and then tuned with the fMRI encoder using annotated data.\nfor GAN training, which generally requires a large amount of data. [12] took a similar approach as [5],\nwhich relied on the same separable autoencoder that enables self-supervised learning. Even though better\nresults were achieved than [11], the generated videos were of low visual fidelity and semantic meanings.\nMBM Masked brain modeling (MBM) is a pre-text task that enables self-supervised learning in a large\nfMRI dataset [6], aiming to build a brain foundation model. It learns general features of fMRI by trying to\nrecover masked data from the remainings, similar to the GPT [13] and MAE [14], after which knowledge\ncan be distilled and transferred to a downstream task with limited data and a few-step tuning [15, 13, 14, 6].\nCLIP Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) is a pre-training technique that builds a shared\nlatent space for images and natural languages by large-scale contrastive learning [16]. The training aims to\nminimize the cosine distance of paired image and text latent while maximizing permutations of pairs within\na batch. The shared latent space (CLIP space) contains rich semantic information on both images and texts.\nStable Diffusion Diffusion models are emerging probabilistic generative models defined by a reversible\nMarkov chain [17, 18]. As a variant, stable diffusion generates a compressed version of the data (data latent)\ninstead of generating the data directly. As it works in the data latent space, the computational requirement is\nsignificantly reduced, and higher-quality images with more details can be generated in the latent space [19].\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nMotivation and Overview\nAiming for a flexible design, MinD-Video is decoupled into two modules: an fMRI encoder and a video\ngenerative model, as illustrated in Fig. 2. These two modules are trained separately and then finetuned\ntogether, which allows for easy adaption of new models if better architectures of either one are available.\nAs a representation learning model, the encoder in the first module transfers the pre-processed fMRI into\nembeddings, which are used as a condition for video generations. For this purpose, the embedding should\nhave the following traits: 1) It should contain rich and compact information about the visual stimulus\npresented during the scan. 2) It should be close to the embedding domain that the generative model\nis trained with. When designing the generative model, it is essential that the model produces not only\ndiverse, high-quality videos with high computational efficiency but also handles potential scene transitions,\nmirroring the dynamic visual stimuli experienced during scans.\n3.2\nThe fMRI Pre-processing\nThe fMRI captures whole-brain activity with BOLD signals (voxels). Each voxel is assigned to a region\nof interest (ROI) for focused analysis. Here, we concentrate on voxels activated during visual stimuli.\nThere are two ways to define the ROIs: one uses a pre-defined parcellation such as [20] and [21] to\nobtain the visual cortex; the other relies on statistical tests to identify activated voxels during stimuli. Our\nlarge-scale pre-training is based on the parcellation in [20], while statistical tests are employed for the target\ndataset, i.e., the Wen (2018) [10] dataset containing fMRI-video pairs. To determine activated regions, we\ncalculate intra-subject reproducibility of each voxel, correlating fMRI data across multiple viewings. The\n3\ncorrelation coefficients are then converted to z-scores and averaged. We compute statistical significance\nusing a one-sample t-test (P<0.01, DOF=17, Bonferroni correction). We selected the top 50% of the most\nsignificant voxels after the statistical test. Notice that most of the identified voxels are from the visual cortex.\n3.3\nProgressive Learning and fMRI Encoder\nProgressive learning is used as an efficient training scheme where general knowledge is learned first, and\nthen more task-specific knowledge is distilled through finetuning [22, 23, 24]. To generate meaningful em-\nbeddings specific for visual decoding, we design a progressive learning pipeline, which learns fMRI features\nin multiple stages, starting from general features to more specific and semantic-related features. We will\nshow that the progressive learning process is reflected biologically in the evolution of fMRI attention maps.\nLarge-scale Pre-training with MBM Similar to [6], a large-scale pre-training with masked brain\nmodeling (MBM) is used to learn general features of the visual cortex. With the same setup, an asymmetric\nvision-transformer-based autoencoder [25, 14] is trained on the Human Connectome Project [26] with\nthe visual cortex (V1 to V4) defined by [20]. Specifically, fMRI data of the visual cortex is rearranged\nfrom 3D into 1D space in the order of visual processing hierarchy, which is then divided into patches of\nthe same size. The patches will be transformed into tokens, and a large portion (\u223c75%) of the tokens will\nbe randomly masked in the encoder during training. With the autoencoder architecture, a simple decoder\naims to recover the masked tokens from the unmasked token embeddings generated by the encoder. The\nmain idea behind the MBM is that if the training objective can be achieved with high accuracy using a\nsimple decoder, the token embeddings generated by the encoder will be a rich and compact description\nof the original fMRI data. We refer readers to [6] for detailed descriptions and reasonings of the MBM.\nSpatiotemporal Attention for Windowed fMRI For the purpose of image reconstruction, the\noriginal fMRI encoder in [6] shifts the fMRI data by 6s, which is then averaged every 9 seconds\nand processed individually.\nThis process only considers the spatial information in its attention\nlayers. In the video reconstruction, if we directly map one fMRI to the video frames presented (e.g.,\n6 frames), the video reconstruction task can be formulated as a one-to-one decoding task, where\neach set of fMRI data corresponds to 6 frames. We call each {fMRI-frames} pair a fMRI frame\nwindow.\nHowever, this direct mapping is sub-optimal because of the time delay between brain\nactivity and the associated BOLD signals in fMRI data due to the nature of hemodynamic response.\nvisual stimulus at T\n...\ntime\n...\nBOLD signals at T\nlag\nBOLD signals  at T+1\n...\n...\nFigure 3. Due to hemodynamic response, the BOLD signal\n(blue) lags a few seconds behind the visual stimulus (red),\ncausing a discrepancy between fMRI and the stimulus.\nThus, when a visual stimulus (i.e., a video frame) is\npresented at time t, the fMRI data obtained at t may\nnot contain complete information about this frame.\nNamely, a lag occurs between the presented visual\nstimulus and the underlying information recorded\nby fMRI. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 3.\nThe hemodynamic response function (HRF) is usu-\nally used to model the relationship between neural\nactivity and BOLD signals [27]. In an LTI system,\nthe signal y(t) is represented as the convolution of\na stimulus function s(t) and the HR h(t), i.e., y(t)=(s\u2217h)(t). The h(t) is often modeled with a linear\ncombination of some basis functions, which can be collated into a matrix form: Y =X\u03b2+e, where Y\nrepresents the observed data, \u03b2 is a vector of regression coefficients, and e is a vector of unexplained error\nvalues. However, e varies significantly across individuals and sessions due to age, cognitive state, and\nspecific visual stimuli, which influence the firing rate, onset latency, and neuronal activity duration. These\nvariations impact the estimation of e and ultimately affect the accuracy of the fMRI-based analysis. Gener-\nally, there are two ways to address individual variations: using personalized HRF models or developing\nalgorithms that adapt to each participant. We choose the latter due to its superior flexibility and robustness.\nAiming to obtain sufficient information to decode each scan window and account for the HR, we propose a\nspatiotemporal attention layer to process multiple fMRI frames in a sliding window. Consider a sliding\nwindow defined as xt ={xt,xt+1,...,xt+w\u22121}, where xt \u2208Rn\u00d7p\u00d7b are token embeddings of the fMRI\nat t and n,p,b are the batch size, patch size, and embedding dimension, respectively. So we have\nxt\u2208Rn\u00d7w\u00d7p\u00d7b, where w is the window size. Recall that the attention is given by attn=softmax\n\u0010\nQKT\n\u221a\nd\n\u0011\n.\nTo calculate spatial attention, we use the network inflation trick [28], where we merge the first two\ndimensions of xt and obtain xspat\nt\n\u2208Rnw\u00d7p\u00d7b. Then the query and key are calculated in Eq. (1) as\nQ=xspat\nt\n\u00b7W Q\nspat,\nK =xspat\nt\n\u00b7W K\nspat.\n(1)\n4\nLikewise, we merge the first and the third dimension of xt to calculate the temporal attention, obtaining\nxtemp\nt\n\u2208Rnp\u00d7w\u00d7b. Again, the query and key are calculated in Eq. (2) with\nQ=xtemp\nt\n\u00b7W Q\ntemp,\nK =xtemp\nt\n\u00b7W K\ntemp.\n(2)\nThe spatial attention learns correlations among the fMRI tokens, describing the spatial correlations of\nthe fMRI patches. Then the temporal attention learns the correlations of fMRI from the sliding window,\nincluding sufficient information to cover the lag due to HR, as illustrated in the \u201cfMRI Attention\u201d in Fig. 2.\nMultimodal Contrastive Learning Recall that the fMRI encoder is pre-trained to learn general features\nof the visual cortex, and then it is augmented with temporal attention heads to process a sliding window of\nfMRI. In this step, we further train the augmented encoder with {fMRI, video, caption} triplets and pull the\nfMRI embeddings closer to a shared CLIP space containing rich semantic information. Additionally, the\ngenerative model is usually pre-trained with text conditioning. Thus, pulling the fMRI embeddings closer\nto the text-image shared space ensures its understandability by the generative model during conditioning.\nFirstly, videos in the training set are downsampled to a smaller frame rate (3FPS). Each frame is then\ncaptioned with BLIP [29]. Generated captions in most scanning windows are similar, except when scene\nchanges occur in the window. In that case, two different captions will be concatenated with the conjunction\n\u201cThen\u201d. With the CLIP text encoder and image encoder being fixed, the CLIP loss [16] is calculated for\nfMRI-image and fMRI-text, respectively. Denote the pooled text embedding, image embedding, and fMRI\nembedding by embt, embi, embf \u2208Rn\u00d7b. The contrastive language-image-fMRI loss is given by\nL=(LCLIP(embf, embt)+LCLIP(embf, embi))/2,\n(3)\nwhere LCLIP(a, b)=CrossEntropy(\u03f5a\u00b7bT, [0,1,...,n]), with \u03f5 being a scaling factor. Extra care is needed\nto reduce similar frames in a batch for better contrastive pairs. From Eq. (3), we see that the loss largely\ndepends on the batch size n. Thus, a large n with data augmentation on all modalities is appreciated.\n3.4\nVideo Generative Module\nThe Stable Diffusion model [19] is used as the base generative model considering its excellence in\ngeneration quality, computational requirements, and weights availability. However, as the stable diffusion\nmodel is an image-generative model, temporal constraints need to be applied in order for video generation.\nScene-Dynamic Sparse Causal (SC) Attention Authors in [28] use a network inflation trick with sparse\ntemporal attention to adapt the stable diffusion to a video generative model. Specifically, the sparse temporal\nattention effectively conditions each frame on its previous frame and the first frame, which ensures frame\nconsistency and also keeps the scene unchanged. However, the human vision consists of possible scene\nchanges, so the video generation should also be scene-dynamic. Thus, we relax the constraint in [28] and\ncondition each frame on its previous two frames, ensuring the video smoothness while allowing scene\ndynamics. Using notations from [28], the SC attention is calculated with the query, key, and value given by\nQ=W Q\u00b7zvi,\nK =W K\u00b7[zvi\u22122, zvi\u22121],\nV =W V \u00b7[zvi\u22122, zvi\u22121],\n(4)\nwhere zvi denotes the latent of the i-th frame during the generation.\nAdversarial Guidance for fMRI Classifier-free guidance is widely used in the conditional sampling of\ndiffusion models for its flexibility and generation diversity, where the noise update function is given by\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(zt, c)=\u03f5\u03b8(zt)+s(\u03f5\u03b8(zt, c)\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(zt)),\n(5)\nwhere c is the condition, s is the guidance scale and \u03f5\u03b8(\u00b7) is a score estimator implemented with UNet [30].\nInterestingly, Eq. (5) can be changed to an adversarial guidance version [19]\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(zt, c, \u00afc)=\u03f5\u03b8(zt, \u00afc)+s(\u03f5\u03b8(zt, c)\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(zt, \u00afc)),\n(6)\nwhere \u00afc is the negative guidance. In effect, generated contents can be controlled through \u201cwhat to generate\u201d\n(positive guidance) and \u201cwhat not to generate\u201d (negative guidance). When \u00afc is a null condition, the noise\nupdate function falls back to Eq. (5), the regular classifier-free guidance. In order to generate diverse videos\nfor different fMRI, guaranteeing the distinguishability of the inputs, we average all fMRI in the testing set\nand use the averaged one as the negative condition. Specifically, for each fMRI input, the fMRI encoder\nwill generate an unpooled token embedding x\u2208Rl\u00d7b, where l is the latent channel number. Denote the\naveraged fMRI as \u00afx. We have the noise update function \u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(zt, x, \u00afx)=\u03f5\u03b8(zt, \u00afx)+s(\u03f5\u03b8(zt, x)\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(zt, \u00afx)).\n5\nDivide and Refine With a decoupled structure, two modules are trained separately: the fMRI encoder is\ntrained in a large-scale dataset and then tuned in the target dataset with contrastive learning; the generative\nmodule is trained with videos from the target dataset using text conditioning. In the second phase, two\nmodules are tuned together with fMRI-video pairs, where the encoder and part of the generative model\nare trained. Different from [28], we tune the whole self-attention, cross-attention, and temporal-attention\nheads instead of only the query projectors, as a different modality is used for conditioning. The second\nphase is also the last stage of encoder progressive learning, after which the encoder finally generates token\nembeddings that contain rich semantic information and are easy to understand by the generative model.\n3.5\nLearning from the Brain - Interpretability\nOur objectives extend beyond brain decoding and reconstruction. We also aim to understand the decoding\nprocess\u2019s biological principles. To this end, we visualize average attention maps from the first, middle,\nand last layers of the fMRI encoder across all testing samples. This approach allows us to observe the\ntransition from capturing local relations in early layers to recognizing more global, abstract features in\ndeeper layers [31]. Additionally, attention maps are visualized for different learning stages: large-scale\npre-training, contrastive learning, and co-training. By projecting attention back to brain surface maps, we\ncan easily observe each brain region\u2019s contributions and the learning progress through each stage.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nDatasets\nPre-training dataset Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1200 Subject Release [26]: For our upstream\npre-training dataset, we employed resting-state and task-evoked fMRI data from the HCP. Building upon\n[6], we obtained 600,000 fMRI segments from a substantial amount of fMRI scan data.\nPaired fMRI-Video dataset A publicly available benchmark fMRI-video dataset [10] was used, com-\nprising fMRI and video clips. The fMRI were collected using a 3T MRI scanner at a TR of 2 seconds\nwith three subjects. The training data included 18 segments of 8-minute video clips, totaling 2.4 video\nhours and yielding 4,320 paired training examples. The test data comprised 5 segments of 8-minute video\nclips, resulting in 40 minutes of test video and 1,200 test fMRIs. The video stimuli were diverse, covering\nanimals, humans, and natural scenery, and featured varying lengths at a temporal resolution of 30 FPS.\n4.2\nImplementation Details\nThe original videos are downsampled from 30 FPS to 3 FPS for efficient training and testing, leading to 6\nframes per fMRI frame. In our implementation, we reconstruct a video of 2 seconds (6 frames) from one\nfMRI frame. However, thanks to the spatiotemporal attention head design that encodes multiple fMRI at\nonce, our method can reconstruct longer videos from multiple fMRI if more GPU memory is available.\nA ViT-based fMRI encoder with a patch size of 16, a depth of 24, and an embedding dimension of 1024 is\nused. After pre-training with a mask ratio of 0.75, the encoder will be augmented with a projection head\nthat projects the token embedding into the dimension of 77\u00d7768. The Stable Diffusion V1-5 [19] trained\nat the resolution of 512\u00d7512 is used. But we tune the augmented Stable Diffusion at the resolution of\n256\u00d7256 with 3 FPS. Notice that the FPS and image are downsampled for efficient experiments, and our\nmethod can also work with full temporal and spatial resolution. All parameters in the MBM pre-training\nare the same as [6] with eight RTX3090, while other stages are trained with one RTX3090. The inference\nis performed with 200 DDIM [32] steps. See Supplementary for more details.\n4.3\nEvaluation Metrics\nFollowing prior studies, we utilize both frame-based and video-based metrics. Frame-based metrics evaluate\neach frame individually, providing a snapshot evaluation, whereas video-based metrics assess sequences of\nframes, encapsulating the dynamics across frames. Both are used for a comprehensive analysis. Unless\nstated otherwise, all test set videos are used for evaluating the three subjects.\nFrame-based Metrics Our frame-based metrics are divided into two classes, pixel-level metrics and\nsemantics-level metrics. We use the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) [33] as the pixel-level\nmetric and the N-way top-K accuracy classification test as the semantics-level metric. Specifically, for\n6\nGT\nOurs\nKupershmit, \n2022\nWang, \n2022\nWen, \n2018\nMinD-Vis\nChen, 2023\nFigure 4. Compare with Benchmarks. We compare our results with the samples provided in the previous literature.\nOur method generates samples that are more semantically meaningful and match with the groundtruth.\neach frame in a scan window, we calculate the SSIM and classification test accuracy with respect to the\ngroundtruth frame. To perform the classification test, we basically compare the classification results of the\ngroundtruth (GT) and the predicted frame (PF) using an ImageNet classifier. If the GT class3 is within the\ntop-K probability of the PF classification results from N randomly picked classes, including the GT class,\nwe declare a successful trial. The test is repeated for 100 times, and the average success rate is reported.\nVideo-based Metric The video-based metric measures the video semantics using the classification test\nas well, except that a video classifier is used. The video classifier based on VideoMAE [34] is trained on\nKinetics-400 [35], an annotated video dataset with 400 classes, including motions, human interactions, etc.\n5\nResults\nWe compare our method against three fMRI-video baselines: Wen et al. (2018) [10], Wang et al. (2022) [11]\nand Kupershmidt et al. (2022) [12]. Visual comparisons are shown in Fig. 4, and quantitative comparisons\nare shown in Fig. 6, where publicly available data and samples are used for comparison. As shown, we\ngenerate high-quality videos with more semantically meaningful content. Following the literature, we\nevaluate the SSIM of Subject 1 with the first testing video, achieving a score of 0.186, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art by 45%. When comparing with Kupershmidt et al. (2022), we evaluate all test videos for\ndifferent subjects, and our method outperforms by 35% on average, as shown in Fig. 6. Using semantic-\nlevel metrics, our method achieves a success rate of 0.849 and 0.2 in 2-way and 50-way top-1 accuracy\nclassification tests, respectively, with the video classifier. The image classifier gives a success rate of 0.795\nand 0.19, respectively, with the same tests, which significantly surpasses the chance level of these two\ntests (2-way: 0.5, 50-way: 0.02). Full results are shown in Tab. 1. We also compare our results with an\nimage-fMRI model by Chen et al. (2023) [6]. An image is produced for each fMRI, samples of which\nare shown in Fig. 4 with the \u201cwalking man\u201d as the groundtruth. Even though the results and groundtruth\nare semantically matching, frame consistency and image quality are not satisfying. A lag due to the\nhemodynamic response is also observed. The first frame actually corresponds to the previous groundtruth.\nDifferent Subjects After fMRI pre-processing, each subject varies in the size of ROIs, where Subject 1, 2\nand 3 have 6016, 6224, and 3744 voxels, respectively. As Subject 3 has only half the voxels of the others,\na larger batch size can be used during contrastive learning, which may lead to better results as shown in\nTab. 1. Nonetheless, all subjects are consistent in both numeric and visual evaluations (See Supplementary).\nRecovered Semantics In the video reconstruction, we define the semantics as the objects, animals, persons,\nand scenes in the videos, as well as the motions and scene dynamics, e.g., people running, fast-moving\nscenes, close-up scenes, long-shot scenes, etc. We show that even though the fMRI has a low temporal\nresolution, it contains enough information to recover the mentioned semantics. Fig. 5 shows a few examples\nof reconstructed frames using our method. Firstly, we can see that the basic objects, animals, persons, and\nscene types can be well recovered. More importantly, the motions, such as running, dancing, and singing,\nand the scene dynamics, such as the close-up of a person, the fast-motion scenes, and the long-shot scene of\na city view, can also be reconstructed correctly. This result is also reflected in our numerical metrics, which\nconsider both frame semantics and video semantics, including various categories of motions and scenes.\n3Since videos cannot be well described with a single ImageNet class, we use the top-K classification results as the\nGT class, and a successful event is declared if the test succeeds with any of the GT class.\n7\nGT\nOurs\nScene changes\nGT\nOurs\nFigure 5.

SSIM Comparision. Left: comparison in Subject 1, test video 1. Right: all subjects, all test videos.\nAbalations We test our method using different window sizes, starting from a window size of 1 up to 3.\nWhen the window size is one, the fMRI encoder falls back to a normal MBM encoder in [6]. Tab. 1 shows\nthat when all other parameters are fixed, a window size of 2 gives the best performance in general, which is\nreasonable as the hemodynamic response usually will not be longer than two scan windows. Additionally,\nwe also test the effectiveness of multimodal contrastive learning. As shown in Tab. 1, without contrastive\nlearning, the generation quality degrades significantly. When two modalities are used, either text-fMRI or\nimage-fMRI, the performance is inferior to the full modalities used in contrastive learning. Actually, the\nreconstructed videos are visually worse than the full model (See Supplementary). Thus, it shows that the\nfull progressive learning pipeline is crucial for the fMRI encoder to learn useful representations for this\ntask. We also assess the reconstruction results without adversarial guidance. As a result, both numeric and\nvisual evaluations decrease substantially. In fact, the generated videos can be highly similar sometimes,\nindicating that the negative guidance is critical in increasing the distinguishability of fMRI embeddings.\n5.1\nInterpretation Results\nWe summarize the attention analysis in Fig. 7. We present the sum of the normalized attention within\nYeo17 networks [21] in the bar charts. Voxel-wise attention is displayed on a brain flat map, where we see\ncomprehensive structural attention throughout the whole region. The average attention across all testing\nsamples and attention heads is computed, revealing three insights on how transformers decode fMRI.\n8\nFirst Layer\nMiddle Layer\nLast Layer\nC\nD\nE\nv2\nv1\nv3\nv4\nv1\nv2\nv3\nv4\nv3\nVisPeri\nVisPeri\nVisPeri\nv1\nv2\nv2\nDefault\nDefault\nDorsAttn\nDorsAttn\nVisual Cortex\nA\nB\nFigure 7. Attention visualization. We visualized the attention maps for different transformer layers (C, D, E) and\nlearning stages (B) with bar charts and brain flat maps. Brain networks are marked on a brain surface map (A)\nDominance of visual cortex: The visual cortex emerges as the most influential region. This region,\nencompassing both the central (VisCent) and peripheral visual (VisPeri) fields, consistently attracts the\nhighest attention across different layers and training stages (shown in Fig. 7B). In all cases, the visual cortex\nis always the top predictor, which aligns with prior research, emphasizing the vital role of the visual cortex\nin processing visual spatiotemporal information[36]. However, the visual cortex is not the sole determinant\nof vision. Higher cognitive networks, such as the dorsal attention network (DorsAttn) involved in voluntary\nvisuospatial attention control [37], and the default mode network (Default) associated with thoughts and\nrecollations [38], also contribute to visual perceptions process [39] as shown in Fig. 7.\nLayer-dependent hierarchy: The layers of the fMRI encoder function in a hierarchical manner, as shown\nin Fig. 7C, D and E. In the early layers of the network (panel A & C), we observe a focus on the structural\ninformation of the input data, marked by a clear segmentation of different brain regions by attention values,\naligning with the visual processing hierarchy [40]. As the network dives into deeper layers (panel D & E),\nthe learned information becomes more dispersed. The distinction between regions diminishes, indicating a\nshift toward learning more holistic and abstract visual features in deeper layers.\nLearning semantics progressively: To illustrate the learning progress of the fMRI encoder, we analyze\nthe first-layer attention after all learning stages, as shown in panel B: before contrastive learning, after\ncontrastive learning, and after co-training with the video generation model. We observe an increase in\nattention in higher cognitive networks and a decrease in the visual cortex as learning progresses. This\nindicates the encoder assimilates more semantic information as it evolves through each learning stage,\nimproving the learning of cognitive-related features in the early layers.\n6\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nConclusion We propose MinD-Video, which reconstructs high-quality videos with arbitrary frame rates\nfrom fMRI. Starting from a large-scale pre-training to multimodal contrastive learning with augmented\nspatiotemporal attention, our fMRI encoder learns fMRI features progressively. Then we finetune an\naugmented stable diffusion for video generations, which is co-trained together with the encoder. Finally, we\nshow that with fMRI adversarial guidance, MinD-Video recovers videos with accurate semantics, motions,\nand scene dynamics compared with the groundtruth, establishing a new state-of-the-art in this domain. We\nalso show through attention maps that the trained model decodes fMRI with reliable biological principles.\nLimitations Our method is still within the intra-subject level, and inter-subject generalization ability\nremains unexplored due to individual variations. Additionally, our method only uses less than 10% of the\nvoxels from the cortex for reconstructions, while using the whole brain data remains unexploited.\nBroader Impacts We believe this field has promising applications as large models develop, from neuro-\nscience to brain-computer interfaces. But governmental regulations and efforts from research communities\nare required to ensure the privacy of one\u2019s biological data and avoid any malicious usage of this technology.\n9\nReferences\n[1] T.

Is it driven by the diffusion model only? The perfor-\nmance gain in our model is not solely driven by the diffusion model. It is, in fact, a result of the combined\nefforts of two major stages: the fMRI encoder and the stable diffusion model.\nIn the first stage, the fMRI encoder plays a crucial role in learning representations from the brain. It\neffectively captures the complex spatiotemporal information embedded in the fMRI data, allowing the\nmodel to understand and interpret the underlying neural activities. This step is particularly important as it\nforms the foundation of our model and significantly influences the subsequent steps.\nIn the second stage, the stable diffusion model steps in to generate videos. One of the key advantages\nof our stable diffusion model over other generative models, such as GANs, lies in its ability to produce\nhigher-quality videos. It leverages the representations learned by the fMRI encoder and utilizes its unique\ndiffusion process to generate videos that are not only of superior quality but also better align with the\noriginal neural activities.\nWhat does the fMRI encoder learn? Why don\u2019t we train an fMRI to object classifier, followed by a\ngeneration model? The fMRI encoder is designed to learn intricate representations from brain activity.\nThese representations go beyond simple categorical information to encompass more nuanced semantic\ndetails that can\u2019t be adequately captured by discrete class labels (e.g. image texture, depth, etc.). Due to the\nrichness and diversity of human thought and perception, a model that can handle continuous semantics,\nrather than discrete ones, is necessary.\nThe proposal to train an fMRI-to-object classifier followed by a generation model does not align with our\ngoal of comprehensive brain decoding. This is largely due to a crucial trade-off between classification\ncomplexity and solution space:\n\u2022 Classification Complexity: Classifying fMRI data into a large number of classes (e.g., 1000\nclasses) is non-trivial. As reported in [2], reasonable performance can only be achieved in\na smaller classification task (less than 50-way), due to the limited data per category and the\ncomplexity of the task.\n\u2022 Limited Solution Space: The solution space of discrete classes is significantly more restricted\nthan that of continuous semantics. Thus, a classifier may not capture the complex, multi-faceted\nnature of brain activities.\nThis trade-off illustrates why a classifier might not be the best approach for this task. In contrast, our\nproposed method focuses on learning continuous semantic representations from the brain, which better\nreflects the complexity and diversity of neural processes. This approach not only improves the quality of\nthe generated videos but also provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into brain decoding.\nIs the fMRI-video generation pipeline simply imputing missing frames in a sequence of static images\nbased on the fMRI-image generation pipeline? No, the fMRI-to-video generation process is not merely\nan imputation on the fMRI-to-image generation pipeline. While both involve generating visual content\nbased on fMRI data, the tasks and their complexities are fundamentally different.\nThe fMRI-to-image generation involves mapping brain activity to a static image. This task primarily\nfocuses on spatial information, that is, which brain regions are active and how they relate to elements in an\nimage.\nIn contrast, the fMRI-to-video generation task involves mapping brain activity to dynamic videos. This task\nis considerably more complex as it requires the model to capture both spatial information and temporal\ndynamics. It\u2019s not just about predicting which brain regions are active, but also about understanding how\nthese activations change over time and how they relate to moving elements in a video.\nAdding to the complexity is the hemodynamic response inherent in fMRI data, which introduces a delay\nand blur in the timing of neural activity. This necessitates careful handling of the temporal aspects in the\ndata. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of fMRI is quite low, making it challenging to capture fast-paced\nchanges in neural activity.\n12\nWe also use a stable diffusion process as our generative model, which is a probabilistic model. This means\nthat the generation process involves a degree of randomness, leading to slight differences during each\ngeneration for video frames. Additionally, in video generation, we need to ensure consistency across video\nframes, which adds another layer of complexity.\nB\nMore Implementation Details\nLarge-Scale Pre-training The large-scale pre-training uses the same setup as the MBM described in [6].\nA ViT-large-based model with a 1-dimensional patchifier is trained with hyperparameters shown in Tab. B.1.\nThe training takes around 3 days using 8RTX3090 GPUs. The training is performed on the 600,000 fMRI\nfrom HCP. Same as the literature, after the large-scale pre-training, the autoencoder is tuned with fMRI\ndata from the target dataset, namely, Wen (2018), using MBM as well. The tuning is performed using a\nsmall learning rate and epochs.\nparameter\nvalue\nparameter\nvalue\nparameter\nvalue\nparameter\nvalue\npatch size\n16\nencoder depth\n24\ndecoder embed dim\n512\nclip gradient\n0.8\nembedding dim\n1024\nencoder heads\n16\nlearning rate\n2.5e-4\nweight decay\n0.05\nmask ratio\n0.75\ndecoder depth\n8\nwarm-up epochs\n40\nbatch size\n500\nmlp ratio\n1.0\ndecoder heads\n16\nepochs\n500\noptimizer\nAdamW\nTable B.1. Hyperparameters used in the large-scale pre-training\nMultimodal Contrastive Learning In this step, we will take the pre-trained fMRI encoder from the\nprevious step and augment it with temporal attention heads to accommodate multiple fMRI. Then contrastive\nlearning is performed with fMRI-image-text triplets. The image is a randomly-picked frame from an\nfMRI scan window. As mentioned, there are two important factors in the contrastive: batch size and data\naugmentations. Therefore, data augmentations are applied for all modalities. Random sparsification is used\nfor fMRI, where 20% of voxels are randomly set to zeros each time. The random crop is applied to videos\nwith a probability of 0.5. To augment the frame captions, we apply synonym augmentation and random\nword swapping. Due to a small dataset size (\u223c4000), we use a dropout rate of 0.6 to avoid overfitting. For\nSubject 1 and 2, the training is performed with a batch size of 20, while a batch size of 32 is used due to\nfewer fMRI voxels with Subject 3. Training for all subjects is performed for 1,2000 steps with a learning\nrate of 2\u00d710\u22125. The training takes around 10 hours using one RTX3090.\nTraining of Augmented Stable Diffusion The stable diffusion model is augmented with temporal attention\nheads for video generation. We train the augmented stable diffusion model with videos from the target\ndatasets. The videos are downsampled from 30 FPS to 3 FPS at a resolution of 256\u00d7256 due to limited\nGPU memory, even though our model can work with the full time resolution. This step is important for\ntwo reasons: 1) the augmented temporal heads are untrained; 2) the stable diffusion is pre-trained at a\nresolution of 512\u00d7512, so we need to adapt it to a lower resolution.\nDuring the training, we update the self-attention heads (\u201cattn1\u201d), cross-attention heads (\u201cattn2\u201d), and\ntemporal attention heads (\u201cattn_temp\u201d). The training is performed with text conditioning for 800 steps. We\nuse a learning rate 2\u00d710\u22125 and a batch size of 14. The training takes around 2 hours using one RTX3090.\nVisual results show that videos of high quality can be generated with text conditioning after this step.\nCo-training The fMRI encoder produces embeddings of dimensions 77\u00d7768, which are used to condition\nthe augmented stable model during co-training. The whole fMRI encoder is updated, and only part of the\nstable diffusion is updated (same as the last step). The training is performed with a batch size of 9 and a\nlearning rate of 3\u00d710\u22125 for 1,5000 steps. The training takes around 16 hours using one RTX3090.\nInference All samples are generated with 200 diffusion steps using fMRI adversarial guidance. The fMRI\nadversarial guidance uses an average fMRI as the negative guidance with a guidance scale of 12.5.\nC\nAnalysis of Visual Results\nWe test on all three subjects in Wen (2018) dataset. Around 6000 voxels are identified as ROI for Subject 1\nand 2, while around 3000 voxels are identified for Subject 3. Thus, a larger batch size can be used when\ntraining with Subject 3, which may be the reason for its better numeric evaluation results. Nonetheless, all\nthree subjects show consistent generation results. Some samples are shown in Fig. C.1.\n13\nGT\nSub1\nSub2\nSub3\nFigure C.1. Samples from different subjects.\nVisual results of the ablation studies are shown in Fig. C.2. The Full model is trained with our full pipeline\nand inference with adversarial guidance. In contrastive learning ablation, we tested with incomplete\nmodality, namely, image-fMRI and text-fMRI, respectively. Similar to the numeric evaluations, using\nincomplete contrastive gave an unsatisfactory visual result compared to using all three modality. However,\nincomplete modality still outperformed inferencing without adversarial guidance significantly, which\ngenerated visually meaningless results.\nGT\nFull\nImage\nContrastive\nText\nContrastive\nw/o\nAdversarial\nGuidance\nFigure C.2.

Note that input mesh is often of low quality, and our method can polish both the texture and geometry.\nAbstract\nThe techniques for 3D indoor scene capturing are widely\nused, but the meshes produced leave much to be desired. In\nthis paper, we propose \u201cRoomDreamer\u201d, which leverages\npowerful natural language to synthesize a new room with a\ndifferent style. Unlike existing image synthesis methods, our\nwork addresses the challenge of synthesizing both geometry\nand texture aligned to the input scene structure and prompt\nsimultaneously. The key insight is that a scene should be\ntreated as a whole, taking into account both scene texture\nand geometry. The proposed framework consists of two sig-\nni\ufb01cant components: Geometry Guided Diffusion and Mesh\nOptimization.\nGeometry Guided Diffusion for 3D Scene\nguarantees the consistency of the scene style by applying\nthe 2D prior to the entire scene simultaneously.

To validate the\nproposed method, real indoor scenes scanned with smart-\nphones are used for extensive experiments, through which\nthe effectiveness of our method is demonstrated.\n1. Introduction\nCommercial depth sensors [42] and LiDAR sensors [9]\non mobile devices have opened a new era in 3D scene cap-\nturing for millions of users in their everyday lives. How-\never, the quality of the meshes acquired by these sensors\nleaves much to be desired, often exhibiting issues such as\nholes, distorted objects, and blurred textures. In addition,\nusers typically \ufb01nd their surroundings lack variation and\nmay want to further edit and stylize the scene. To solve\nVideo results: https://youtu.be/p4xgwj4QJcQ.\n1\narXiv:2305.11337v1  [cs.CV]  18 May 2023\nthese problems, this paper demonstrates how to build a 3D\nscene from text prompts that matches the geometry of a low-\nquality 3D mesh but differs in style.\nOur method is motivated by recent advances in 2D con-\ntent generation, especially the diffusion models [16,29,32,\n33, 40]. One bene\ufb01t of diffusion models is to allow user-\nprovided text prompts to guide the image synthesis pro-\ncess, and hence is versatile to generate different styles. One\nstraightforward way of extending 2D content generation to\na higher dimensional space is treating the 3D scene as a col-\nlection of multiview images, and synthesizing the images in\na frame-by-frame outpainting manner. However, this ap-\nproach will suffer from artifacts, and the generated images\nmay not match the geometry of the captured scenes.\nGiven a 3D scene and a text prompt like \u201dmodern style\u201d,\nour work can generate a new scene aligned to the text with\ncoherent geometry and texture. Our approach involves \ufb01rst\ngenerating the 3D scene\u2019s texture, followed by the joint op-\ntimization of the mesh texture and geometry. We ensure that\nthe generated texture is consistent with the scene\u2019s style by\nstarting with a cubemap (a 360\u25e6 image) at the center of the\nmesh and then updating the unexplored areas. For the joint\noptimization of mesh texture and geometry, we propose to\nidentify smooth areas within the generated 2D images and\nupdate the mesh geometry accordingly. Fig. 1 shows the\nresults of our approach.\nOur method differs from previous work in the creation of\n3D objects from text [20, 25, 36] and the generation of 3D\ncontent based on 2D images [10, 14, 22, 25] in two key as-\npects. Firstly, we consider a novel and practical setting, as it\nassumes the presence of a scanned scene, which is common\nyet largely unexplored. In our distinct setting, we aim to\nre\ufb01ne existing geometry, as opposed to the previous tech-\nniques, which primarily focus on generating new geome-\ntry. Secondly, our approach is motivated by a different in-\nsight into 2D diffusion models. Our motivation is on the\ngood underlying geometry behind each generated 2D im-\nage, whereas previous methods are motivated by generating\na set of multi-view 2D images iteratively through diffusion.\nNote, we can easily project a mesh-based representation to\n2D images, while it is much harder to re\ufb01ne the mesh ge-\nometry from 2D inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach is accurate and \ufb02exible to use in many real\napplications.\nTo sum up, the contributions of this work are three-\nfolded:\n\u2022 We introduce a novel framework that employs 2D dif-\nfusion models to edit a given mesh. Our framework\nfacilitates the editing and stylization of both geometry\nand texture based on textual prompts.\n\u2022 We design a 2D diffusion scheme for controlling the\ndiffusion models, leading to the production of a scene\nconsistent and structurally aligned texture for the input\nmesh.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments using real indoor\nmeshes scanned with smartphones, which verify the\neffectiveness and reliability of our framework.\n2. Related Works\nThe domain of 3D content creation [16, 32, 33] has sig-\nni\ufb01cantly improved in recent years. We consider research\nin this \ufb01eld into two categories. Firstly, using 3D ground\ntruth content for supervision to direct content generation\nprocess [5, 13, 23], which is limited due to the availability\nof high-quality 3D ground truth. The second research cate-\ngory focuses on using the power of existing 2D image gen-\nerators [29] for 3D content creation. Poole et al. [25] pro-\nposed Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to use the struc-\nture of the diffusion model, providing supervisory signals\nto a 3D neural \ufb01eld. Concurrently, Wang et al. [36] pro-\nposed Score Jacobian Chaining to lift pretrained 2D diffu-\nsion models for 3D generation. Lin et al. [20] presented\nMagic3D, which represents 3D content \ufb01rst through neu-\nral \ufb01elds and then meshes to improve the quality and ef-\n\ufb01ciency of 2D diffusion-guided generation. Fantasia3D [7]\nproposed to decompose the 3D asset generation as geometry\nand texture generation problems. SDS has also been applied\nto convert existing 2D images into 3D models [38,43]. Liu\net al. [21] proposed adapting existing 2D diffusion models\nto be camera pose-aware, enabling the direct generation of\nmulti-view images. Chan et al. [6] proposes synthesizing\na novel view from a single input by incorporating geome-\ntry priors with stable diffusion backbones. Another recent\nwork, Text2Room [17], uses 2D diffusion models and depth\nestimation models to generate a textured room mesh from\ntext prompts. The biggest difference between our method\nand the above works is that our method is guided by a\nscanned mesh, therefore the newly generated 3D scenes will\nbe accurately aligned with the input scene but with different\nstyles. For editing existing 3D assets, InstructN2N [14] pro-\nposed a methodology to update 2D multiview images itera-\ntively. This was based on a 2D image editing model known\nas InstructP2P [4]. InstructN2N performed the editing on\n2D images, which meant that the ability to dream entirely\nnew scenes may have been restricted by image-based edit-\ning. On the other hand, our approach relies on a geometry-\ncontrolled 2D diffusion generation, which implies that it is\nnot hindered by the texture of the original scene.\nOne big challenge of 3D data collection lies in the im-\nperfect scene scanning results. Because the Lidar on mo-\nbile devices is of limited power and resolution, some parts\nof the scenes are often missed in the point clouds. There\nhave been quite a few researches to improve 3D reconstruc-\ntions with generative priors, such as self-supervised genera-\n2\ntion [8], retrieval-based generation [30], style transfer [18].\nBesides the reconstruction problem, some prior research has\ntreated 3D indoor scene generation as an object layout pre-\ndiction problem [24, 28, 37]. After predicting the layout,\nobjects are retrieved from a 3D furniture dataset such as\n3D-FRONT [12] and placed within the scene. Other ap-\nproaches, such as Plan2Scene [35], use the \ufb02oorplan and\nimage observations of an indoor scene to predict a textured\nmesh for the entire scene. Meanwhile, GSN [11], GAUDI\n[3], and CC3D [1] focus on generating images of indoor\nscenes through the use of neural radiance \ufb01elds. These re-\nsearch works are inspiring to our work. In practice, we fo-\ncus on re\ufb01ning indoor scene meshes, especially the smooth-\nness of 3D geometry and the match of geometry and visual\ntextures. We will explain more details in later sections.\n3. Method\nOur approach\u2019s input includes a 3D mesh with both ge-\nometric and texture information, as well as user-provided\ntext prompts. Our method is composed of two steps: First,\nwe render the 3D scene to 2D images, and synthesize new\nstyles using a new diffusion process; Then we reconstruct a\nnew 3D mesh with the new textures and polished geometry.\nAn overview of our method is shown in Fig. 2.\n3.1. Geometry Guided Diffusion for 3D Scene\nSynthesizing a new 3D scene is more challenging than\nsynthesizing a 2D image because standard diffusion models\n[33] can easily create inconsistency across different views.\nA straightforward approach for generating scene texture us-\ning 2D image diffusion models begins with a randomly po-\nsitioned camera and iteratively samples neighboring cam-\neras to outpaint [31, 39] the unobserved area, as depicted\nin Fig. 3. However, we have observed that this baseline\nmethod produces noticeable artifacts (Fig. 6), which can be\nattributed in part to the limited outpainting capability of 2D\ndiffusion models.\nTo avoid the artifacts brought by the view-by-view out-\npainting generation process, we propose to \ufb01rst generate a\n360\u25e6 image with a central view of the scene. A panorama\nimage can be generated with 2D diffusion models by simply\nextending the diffusion process to cubemap patches [2,41].\nUnlike the classic diffusion model which is conditioned\non text prompts, our method is conditioned on both a text\nprompt ctext and a depth map D, thus the diffusion step is\nXt\u22121 = f(Xt, ctext, D). Following the previous work, we\ndenote the diffusion model as a mapping function denoted\nas f : (RH\u00d7W \u00d73, C) \u2192 RH\u00d7W \u00d73, where RH\u00d7W \u00d73 repre-\nsent the spaces for images with size H\u00d7W, and C represent\nthe spaces of conditional prior including both prompt and\nimage depth. Further, we denote X0 = f T \u21920(ctext, D) as\nthe whole diffusion process from random noise and condi-\ntioned on the text and depth.\nHowever, directly using depth map for controlling the\ngeneration of cubemap may lead to inconsistency, since the\ndepth value is correlated with camera poses. Different cam-\nera poses lead to inconsistency of the depth value in cube-\nmap faces. Fig. 5(a) illustrates the inconsistency of depth\nmap. The depth map associated with each camera is repre-\nsented in terms of the distance between the camera and the\nplanes. Consequently, the depth values can largely differ\nfrom one view to another for the same plane, and lead to\nartifacts. To further reduce the inconsistency, we consider\ndistance map \u02c6D which represents the geometric distance be-\ntween points and the camera origin. Let a point with world\ncoordinate p and its associated screen coordinate be (u, v),\nthen the (u, v) pixel on the distance map \u02c6D is \u2225p \u2212 o\u2225,\nwhere o is the world coordinate of the camera origin. A\ncomparison between the depth map and the distance map is\nshown in Fig. 4.\nDistance map \u02c6D and depth map D have different proper-\nties in terms of controlling the diffusion process. Structures\nare well aligned with RGB images in D, but distorted in \u02c6D.\nFor example, image Laplacian on the planes will be zero\nin D, but not in \u02c6D. However, the border in cubemap will\nwith a smoother change with \u02c6D, which could be observed\nin Fig. 2(b).\nTo achieve both realistic geometric alignment and border\nconsistency, we propose a blending scheme. For an image\npatch p at the intersection of cube maps Ia and Ib, let ra\nand rb be the ratios of pixels from Ia and Ib in the patch,\nrespectively. We then de\ufb01ne \u03bb = |ra \u2212 rb|. Each step of the\ndenoising process is calculated using the equation:\nXt\u22121 = \u03bbf(Xt, ctext, Dp)+(1\u2212\u03bb)f(Xt, ctext, \u02c6Dp), (1)\nwhere Dp and \u02c6Dp are the depth and distance maps respec-\ntively for the patch p being denoised. After generating a\ncubemap, the mesh texture is subsequently updated using\na differentiable renderer [19]. We then randomly sample\ncameras in the scene, and the areas not captured by the\n360\u25e6 image are updated through masked generation (i.e.,\noutpainting) with the diffusion model. For judging areas\ncaptured or not by the cubemap, we can simply project the\nvertices to the previous cameras and see which vertices are\noccluded.\n3.2. Mesh Optimization\nBoth the input and output of RoomDreamer are 3D\nmeshes. We denote a mesh as (V, F, Vc), where V, F, Vc are\nthe vertices, faces, and the color of vertices, respectively.\nFor a speci\ufb01c camera \u03c0, we can render a depth map D and\nRGB image X at this view:\nX =RX(V, F, Vc, \u03c0)\n(2)\nD =RD(V, F, \u03c0)\n(3)\n3\ndifferentiable render\ninput texture\ninput geometry\ninput geometry\ndepth\npseudo depth\nRGB\n...\nmonocular\ndepth\nestimator\nGeometry Guided Diffusion for 3D Scene\nMesh Optimization\nsample random camera\n+ prompt\n\"cozy wooden cabin...\"\ngeometry\nguided\noutpainting\n2D diffusion\nsample cubemap camera\ndifferentiable render\nsame cameras\nupdate\ntexture\nupdate\nvertices\nfaces\nFigure 2. The overall framework of our method. Firstly, in the Geometry Guided Diffusion stage for 3D scenes, we create a cubemap\nrepresenting the scene, followed by outpainting the uncovered areas of the cubemap, as detailed in Sec. 3.1. Subsequently, we optimize\nthe mesh texture and geometry. For the geometry optimization, we utilize monocular depth prediction as pseudo supervision and align the\nsmooth areas of the scene, as elaborated in Sec. 3.2.\nsample view \nsample view \n1\n1\n2\n2\ndiffuse\noptimize\nmasked\ndiffuse\n(a) View-by-view outpainting\nsample a cubemap \nat center \ndiffuse\noptimize\n...\n(b) Cubemap based texture\nFigure 3.

Different controlling effects of the depth map and the\ndistance map. The depth map exhibits rapid change at the joint\nboundary of the two faces of the cube map. Conversely, the dis-\ntance map changes smoothly. Generating consistent cube maps\nwith depth control becomes challenging, whereas the employment\nof distance map results in more consistent texture. However, the\ndistance map results in artifacts such as the window on the wall, as\nthe diffusion model is conditioned on the depth map during train-\ning.\na texture-based loss:\nLtexture =\nX\nk\n||RX(V, F, Vc, \u03c0k) \u2212 Xk\n0 ||2,\n(4)\nThen we get a baseline method of reconstructing the mesh\ntexture by gradient descent:\nVc \u2190 Vc \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202Ltexture\n\u2202Vc\n= Vc \u2212 \u03b3\nX\nk\n\u2202Ltexture\n\u2202RX(V, F, Vc, \u03c0k)\n\u2202RX(V, F, Vc, \u03c0k)\n\u2202Vc\n(5)\nNote that Eq. (5) can only update Vc but not the geometry\nV, F. This is because the differentiable render [19] cannot\ncompute the gradient for geometry, i.e., \u2202RX\n\u2202V\n= 0, \u2202RX\n\u2202F\n=\n0.\nA further step is to optimize jointly V, F with Vc. Be-\ncause the input mesh often exhibits low-quality geometry\n(e.g., with holes), we hope the geometry V, F can be ad-\njusted to match the image sequences {Xk\n0 }.\nAn essen-\ntial observation is that when a synthesized scene contains\na smooth region, such as a planar shape, the reconstructed\ngeometry should also be planar. To model this observa-\ntion, we \ufb01rst reconstruct the depth map Dgen\nk\nfrom {Xk\n0 }\nusing an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator E (e.g.,\nMiDaS [27]). Then we de\ufb01ne the condition for planar re-\ngions\n|\u2206Dgen\nk\n(u, v)| < \u03c4\n(6)\nwhere \u2206 is the Laplacian of the depth map Dk, and \u03c4 is a\nthreshold for determining smooth areas.\nThen,\nwe\ndenote\nthe\nsmooth\narea\nas\nP\n=\n{(u, v)|\u2206Dgen\nk\n(u, v)| < \u03c4}.\nWe expect on P, recon-\nstructed depth map D is as smooth as possible, i.e., with\nLaplacian close to zero. Thus, we get another loss function:\nLgeometry =\nX\nk\nX\n(u,v)\u2208P\n|\u2206Dk(u, v)|,\nwhere\nDk = RD(V, F, \u03c0k)\n(7)\nBesides the geometry loss, the generated images are used to\nupdate the texture of the scene with the following loss.\nThe overall progress of updating the scene mesh can be\nrepresented as follows,\nVc \u2190 Vc \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202Ltexture\n\u2202Vc\nV \u2190 V \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202Lgeometry\n\u2202V\nF \u2190 F \u2212 \u03b3 \u2202Lgeometry\n\u2202F\n.\n(8)\nAn algorithm overview is shown in Algorithm 1.\n4. Experiments\nOur problem setting assumes inputting with a scanned\nroom mesh, which has not been extensively explored in the\nexisting literature. We compare the result of our method\nwith two groups of works: (1) Ablation studies of our\nown baselines, but without submodules such as geometry-\nguided diffusion, distance map, smooth region regulariza-\ntion, etc. (2) NeRF-based methods, including Score Distil-\nlation Sampling (SDS) [25] and InstructN2N [14]. Since we\ncan project our input mesh to generate multi-view images,\nwhich will be used to reconstruct NeRF. Note the recon-\nstruction of NeRF is more computationally expensive, and\nthe reconstructed geometry of NeRF is not always accurate,\nso we also use the ground truth depth from the mesh input to\nboost the reconstruction performance of InstructN2N [14]\nto get a fair comparison.\n4.1.

Our method is evaluated qualitatively and quantita-\ntively on the validation set of ARKitScenes, which covers a\ndiverse range of room types and \ufb02oor plans.\nTo generate the cubemap, we set the camera origin at\nthe center of the mesh. For generating depth-based images,\nwe utilize ControlNet [40] and maintain the default hyper-\nparameters, such as the guidance scale and the number of\ndiffusion steps T. To cover the regions not included in the\ncubemap, we randomly select K = 100 cameras around the\ncenter and use the masked generation mode of the diffusion\nmodel. We predict the monocular depth using MiDaS [27].\nDuring the optimization process, we use the Adam opti-\nmizer with a learning rate of 0.001 for optimizing both the\ngeometry (V, F) and the vertices color Vc. The optimiza-\ntion is run for a total of N = 1000 steps.

The results of this\nanalysis are depicted in Fig. 6, wherein we compare our\ncubemap based scene texture generation with the outpaint-\ning baseline. Evidently, the scene generated by outpaint-\ning exhibits strip-like artifacts that arise from the \ufb02awed\noutcome of the masked generation mode of the diffusion\nmodels. Examples of strip-like artifacts can be observed\non the walls of the scene. Conversely, our technique con-\nsistently produces images with a high-quality and uniform\nstyle that is retained throughout the entire scene. This supe-\nriority can be attributed to the employment of our cubemap\ntexture generation scheme.\nFurthermore, we delve into the impact of blending the\ndistance map (cf., Eq. (1)) during cubemap diffusion in\nFig. 8. Notably, a crucial difference can be observed in the\nregion demarcated by the orange box, which represents a\npatch of the joint area of two cubemap faces. Upon assess-\ning the input scene, we establish that the wall in this area\nis distorted, implying that the depth signal for diffusion is\ndistorted as well. Speci\ufb01cally, the second row of the \ufb01gure\nshows that this area has been treated as a turning corner of\ntwo walls instead of a single plane, which indeed is. This\ngenerated corner is a result of the distortion in the depth\ncontrolling signal. Upon incorporating distance map con-\ntrolled denoising during the diffusion as shown in the third\nrow, the patch is correctly considered as a single wall plane.\nApart from the joint area, we also observe other bene\ufb01ts\nsuch as the alignment of areas as indicated by the red ar-\nrows.\nIn Fig. 9, we present a comparison between the original\ninput scene\u2019s geometry and the updated scene\u2019s geometry.\nThe text prompt used for the generation is \u201ca royal castle\u201d.\nIt can be observed that after using our method, the mesh is\nsmoother than before.

Comparing with NeRF based Approaches\nIn this subsection, we compare our method to two promi-\nnent 2D diffusion based 3D generation methods, namely\nScore Distillation Sampling (SDS) [25] and InstructN2N\n[14]. We used the open-source version [34] of SDS with\nStable Diffusion as the 2D diffusion model.\nNext, we present a comparative analysis of the perfor-\nmance of our approach versus recently proposed 2D-based\n3D editing methods, as depicted in Fig. 7. To ensure a fair\ncomparison, we employ the depth-guided diffusion model\n(i.e., the same as ours) for our SDS experiments. Upon\ninspection of the results, we observe that SDS can result\nin blurred effects, which is similar to the phenomenon re-\ncently reported in a study on 2D image generation utiliz-\ning SDS [15]. For InstructN2N [4, 14], we note that its\nperformance is primarily in\ufb02uenced by the ef\ufb01cacy of its\nbackbone, i.e., InstructP2P [4]. It is important to mention\nthat InstructP2P solely relies on the input image and is not\nconditioned on geometry like depth. Consequently, in In-\nstructN2N, we observe instances where the model is misled\nby empty regions (i.e., white areas) in the input image, such\nas the white space on the sofa in the \ufb01rst row. Moreover,\nemploying a purely image-based editing approach may re-\nstrict the diversity of the generated images, as demonstrated\nby the wooden \ufb02oor in the second row. The comparisons\npresented in this \ufb01gure illustrate that our proposed scheme\nis capable of successfully generating texture with a subop-\ntimal quality input mesh.\n4.4. Quantitative Evaluation\nThe quality of a stylized indoor scene is usually sub-\njective, but we have adopted the evaluation approach from\n[4, 14] for quantitative analysis of the generated results.\nThis evaluation process is based on the embedding provided\nby CLIP [26]. There are two metrics used for evaluation.\nThe \ufb01rst metric, called \u201cText-Image Similarity,\u201d computes\nthe inner product between the given text prompt and the\ngenerated image. Higher values indicate higher similarity\nbetween the text and image vectors, which implies a smaller\nangle between them. The second metric, referred to as \u201cDi-\nrection Consistency,\u201d assesses the consistency of the gener-\nated scenes across different views. The score is computed\nas follows: Given two CLIP embeddings of the original in-\nput views, denoted as oa and ob, and two CLIP embeddings\nof the generated views, denoted as ga and gb, the score is\n8\nText-Image\nSimilarity\nDirection\nConsistency\nInstructN2N [4,14]\n0.2022\n0.5416\nSDS [25]\n0.1532\n0.4184\nOurs\n0.2543\n0.5281\nTable 1.

To evaluate the perfor-\nmance, we select a total of 80 meshes from the validation\nset and create 15 textual prompts. For each mesh, we ran-\ndomly select 4 different views to test. For calculating Direc-\ntion Consistency, we use the sampled 4 views and one re-\nmaining view, resulting in 4 original-generated pairs. Thus,\nwe obtain a total of 4800 pairs of image-text and original-\ngenerated pairs which are used to calculate the evaluation\nmetrics.\nWe \ufb01rst present a comparison of our method with SDS\nand InstructN2N in Table 1.\nOur approach outperforms\nboth SDS and InstructN2N with higher similarity and con-\nsistency scores.\nThe similarity score of SDS appears to\nbe relatively low, which may be attributed to the blurring\neffect.\nThe high direction consistency score of SDS re-\n\ufb02ects the consistent blurring effect. InstructN2N achieves a\nlower text-image similarity score due to the restriction of its\npurely image-based editing backbone (InstructP2P). How-\never, the direction consistency score of InstructN2N is good,\nindicating the effectiveness of its dataset updating scheme.\nWe then carry out some ablation studies, as shown in\nTable 2.\nOur outpainting model exhibits good direction\nconsistency but a low text-image similarity. Removing the\ndistance map blending scheme adversely impacts the text-\nimage similarity score. Furthermore, we \ufb01nd that removing\nthe geometry optimization has a noticeable negative impact\non the text-image similarity score. This indicates the neces-\nsity of optimizing the geometry when seeking to customize\nand stylize a scanned mesh.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesizing a\n3D interior scene from text prompts based on a scanned\nindoor mesh input. We propose a solution that capitalizes\non the capabilities of 2D diffusion text-to-image generative\nmodels. The primary challenge lies in generating coherent\n3D geometry and textural information from the 2D gener-\native priors. To ensure the consistent visual appearance of\nthe whole scene, we \ufb01rst develop a geometry-guided 3D\nscene texture generation technique. Our key idea is to gen-\nerate a cubemap of the space, thus achieving a consistent\nstyle throughout the different views. We then jointly opti-\nmize mesh geometry and texture, based on the pseudo-depth\nestimated by a monocular depth estimator.\nOur claimed\ncontributions are validated via experiments on real scanned\nmeshes.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to our colleagues at Apple Inc. for their\nvaluable support in enhancing the quality of this work.\nReferences\n[1] Sherwin Bahmani, Jeong Joon Park, Despoina Paschali-\ndou, Xingguang Yan, Gordon Wetzstein, Leonidas Guibas,\nand Andrea Tagliasacchi.\nCc3d:\nLayout-conditioned\ngeneration of compositional 3d scenes.\narXiv preprint\narXiv:2303.12074, 2023. 3\n[2] Omer Bar-Tal, Lior Yariv, Yaron Lipman, and Tali Dekel.\nMultidiffusion: Fusing diffusion paths for controlled image\ngeneration. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.08113, 2023. 3\n[3] Miguel Angel Bautista, Pengsheng Guo, Samira Abnar, Wal-\nter Talbott, Alexander Toshev, Zhuoyuan Chen, Laurent\nDinh, Shuangfei Zhai, Hanlin Goh, Daniel Ulbricht, et al.\nGaudi: A neural architect for immersive 3d scene genera-\ntion.

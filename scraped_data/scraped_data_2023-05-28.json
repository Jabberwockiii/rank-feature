In this work, we\npropose to model the 3D parameter as a random variable instead of a constant\nas in SDS and present variational score distillation (VSD), a principled particle-\nbased variational framework to explain and address the aforementioned issues\nin text-to-3D generation. We show that SDS is a special case of VSD and leads\nto poor samples with both small and large CFG weights. In comparison, VSD\nworks well with various CFG weights as ancestral sampling from diffusion models\nand simultaneously improves the diversity and sample quality with a common\nCFG weight (i.e., 7.5). We further present various improvements in the design\nspace for text-to-3D such as distillation time schedule and density initialization,\nwhich are orthogonal to the distillation algorithm yet not well explored. Our\noverall approach, dubbed ProlificDreamer, can generate high rendering resolu-\ntion (i.e., 512 \u00d7 512) and high-fidelity NeRF with rich structure and complex\neffects (e.g., smoke and drops). Further, initialized from NeRF, meshes fine-tuned\nby VSD are meticulously detailed and photo-realistic.

Their pivotal role extends across a\nwide array of domains, encompassing architecture, animation, gaming, and the rapidly evolving fields\nof virtual and augmented reality. In spite of the extensive applications, the production of premium 3D\ncontent often remains a formidable task. It necessitates a significant investment of time and effort,\neven when undertaken by professional designers. This challenge has prompted the development of\ntext-to-3D methods [19, 31, 34, 20, 4, 29, 55, 16]. By automating the generation of 3D content based\non textual descriptions, these innovative methods present a promising way towards streamlining\nthe 3D content creation process. Furthermore, they stand to make this process more accessible,\npotentially encouraging a significant paradigm shift in the aforementioned fields.\n\u2217Equal contribution;\n\u2020 Corresponding authors.\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2305.16213v2  [cs.LG]  22 Nov 2023\nA snail on a leaf.\nA chimpanzee dressed like \nHenry VIII king of England.\nA pineapple.\nA model of a house in \nTudor style.\nMichelangelo style statue of \ndog reading news on a cellphone.\nAn astronaut is riding a horse.\nAn elephant skull.\nA tarantula, highly detailed.\n(a) ProlificDreamer can generate meticulously detailed and photo-realistic 3D textured meshes.\nA DSLR photo of a \nSpace Shuttle.\nA Matte painting of a castle \nmade of cheesecake surrounded \nby a moat made of ice cream.\nInside of a smart home, realistic detailed photo, 4k.\nA DSLR photo of a hamburger inside a restaurant.\nA red fire hydrant \nspraying water.\nA DSLR photo of a \ntable with dim sum on it.\n(b) ProlificDreamer can generate high rendering resolution (i.e., 512 \u00d7 512) and high-fidelity NeRF with\nrich structures and complex effects.

Our base model is Stable\nDiffusion and we do not employ any other assistant model or user-provided shape guidance (see\nTable 1). See our accompanying videos in our project page for better visual quality.\n2\nDiffusion models [46, 14, 49] have significantly advanced text-to-image synthesis [36, 41, 38, 1],\nparticularly when trained on large-scale datasets [43]. Inspired by these developments, DreamFu-\nsion [34] employs a pretrained, large-scale text-to-image diffusion model for the generation of 3D\ncontent from text in the wild, circumventing the need for any 3D data. DreamFusion introduces\nthe Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) algorithm to optimize a single 3D representation such that\nthe image rendered from any view maintains a high likelihood as evaluated by the diffusion model,\ngiven the text. Despite its wide application [20, 4, 29, 55], empirical observations [34] indicate that\nSDS often suffers from over-saturation, over-smoothing, and low-diversity problems, which have\nyet to be thoroughly explained or adequately addressed. Additionally, orthogonal elements in the\ndesign space for text-to-3D, such as rendering resolution and distillation time schedule, have not been\nfully explored, suggesting a significant potential for further improvement. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic study of all these elements to obtain elaborate 3D representations.\nWe first present Variational Score Distillation (VSD), which treats the corresponding 3D scene given\na textual prompt as a random variable instead of a single point as in SDS [34]. VSD optimizes\na distribution of 3D scenes such that the distribution induced on images rendered from all views\naligns as closely as possible, in terms of KL divergence, with the one defined by the pretrained 2D\ndiffusion model (see Sec. 3.1). Under this variational formulation, VSD naturally characterizes the\nphenomenon that multiple 3D scenes can potentially align with one prompt. To solve it efficiently,\nVSD adopts particle-based variational inference [23, 3, 9], and maintains a set of 3D parameters\nas particles to represent the 3D distribution. We derive a novel gradient-based update rule for the\nparticles via the Wasserstein gradient flow (see Sec. 3.2) and guarantee that the particles will be\nsamples from the desired distribution when the optimization converges (see Theorem 2). Our update\nrequires estimating the score function of the distribution on diffused rendered images, which can be\nefficiently and effectively implemented by a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) [18, 40] of the pretrained\ndiffusion model. The final algorithm alternatively updates the particles and score function.\nWe show that SDS is a special case of VSD, by using a single-point Dirac distribution as the variational\ndistribution (see Sec. 3.3). This insight explains the restricted diversity and fidelity of the generated\n3D scenes by SDS. Moreover, even with a single particle, VSD can learn a parametric score model,\npotentially offering superior generalization over SDS. We also empirically compare SDS and VSD in\n2D space by using an identity rendering function that isolates other 3D factors. Similar to ancestral\nsampling from diffusion models, VSD is able to produce realistic samples using a normal CFG weight\n(i.e., 7.5). In contrast, SDS exhibits inferior results, sharing the same issues previously observed in\ntext-to-3D, such as over-saturation and over-smoothing [34].\nWe further systematically study other elements orthogonal to the algorithm for text-to-3D and present\na clear design space in Sec. 4. Specifically, we propose a high rendering resolution of 512 \u00d7 512\nduring training and an annealed distilling time schedule to improve the visual quality. We also\npropose scene initialization, which is crucial for complex scene generation. Comprehensive ablations\nin Sec. 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of all the aforementioned elements particularly for VSD. Our\noverall approach can generate high-fidelity and diverse 3D results. We term it as ProlificDreamer2.\nAs shown in Fig. 1 and Sec. 5, ProlificDreamer can generate 512 \u00d7 512 rendering resolution and\nhigh-fidelity Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with rich structure and complex effects (e.g., smoke\nand drops). Besides, for the first time, ProlificDreamer can successfully construct complex scenes\nwith multiple objects in 360\u25e6 views given the textual prompt. Further, initialized from the generated\nNeRF, ProlificDreamer can generate meticulously detailed and photo-realistic 3D textured meshes.\n2\nBackground\nWe present preliminaries on diffusion models, score distillation sampling, and 3D representations.\nDiffusion models. A diffusion model [46, 14, 49] involves a forward process {qt}t\u2208[0,1] to gradually\nadd noise to a data point x0 \u223c q0(x0) and a reverse process {pt}t\u2208[0,1] to denoise/generate data. The\nforward process is defined by qt(xt|x0) := N(\u03b1tx0, \u03c32\nt I) and qt(xt) :=\nR\nqt(xt|x0)q0(x0)dx0,\nwhere \u03b1t, \u03c3t > 0 are hyperparameters satisfying \u03b10 \u2248 1, \u03c30 \u2248 0, \u03b11 \u2248 0, \u03c31 \u2248 1; and the reverse\nprocess is defined by denoising from p1(x1) := N(0, I) with a parameterized noise prediction\n2A prolific dreamer is someone who experiences vivid dreams quite regularly [50], which corresponds to the\nhigh-fidelity and diverse results of our method.\n3\nnetwork \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t) to predict the noise added to a clean data x0, which is trained by minimizing\nLDiff(\u03d5) := Ex0\u223cq0(x0),t\u223cU(0,1),\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)[\u03c9(t)\u2225\u03f5\u03d5(\u03b1tx0 + \u03c3t\u03f5) \u2212 \u03f5\u22252\n2],\n(1)\nwhere \u03c9(t) is a time-dependent weighting function. After training, we have pt \u2248 qt and thus we can\ndraw samples from p0 \u2248 q0. Moreover, the noise prediction network can be used for approximating\nthe score function of both qt and pt by \u2207xt log qt(xt) \u2248 \u2207xt log pt(xt) \u2248 \u2212\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t)/\u03c3t.\nOne of the most successful applications of diffusion models is text-to-image generation [41, 36, 38],\nwhere the noise prediction model \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, y) is conditioned on a text prompt y. In practice, classifier-\nfree guidance (CFG [15]) is a key technique for trading off the quality and diversity of the samples,\nwhich modifies the model by \u02c6\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, y) := (1+s)\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, y)\u2212s\u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, \u2205), where \u2205 is a special\n\u201cempty\u201d text prompt representing for the unconditional case, and s > 0 is the guidance scale. A larger\nguidance scale usually improves the text-image alignment but reduces diversity.\nText-to-3D generation by score distillation sampling (SDS) [34]. SDS is an optimization method\nby distilling pretrained diffusion models, also known as Score Jacobian Chaining (SJC) [55]. It is\nwidely used in text-to-3D generation [34, 55, 20, 29, 55, 4] with great promise. Given a pretrained\ntext-to-image diffusion model pt(xt|y) with the noise prediction network \u03f5pretrain(xt, t, y), SDS\noptimizes a single 3D representation with parameter \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, where \u0398 is the space of \u03b8 with the\nEuclidean metric. Given a camera parameter c with a distribution p(c) and a differentiable rendering\nmapping g(\u00b7, c) : \u0398 \u2192 Rd, denote yc as the \u201cview-dependent prompt\u201d [34] (i.e., a text prompt with\nview information), q\u03b8\nt (xt|c) as the distribution at time t of the forward diffusion process starting from\nthe rendered image g(\u03b8, c) with the camera c and 3D parameter \u03b8. SDS optimizes the parameter \u03b8 by\nsolving\nmin\n\u03b8\u2208\u0398 LSDS(\u03b8) := Et,c\n\u0002\n(\u03c3t/\u03b1t)\u03c9(t)DKL(q\u03b8\nt (xt|c) \u2225 pt(xt|yc))\n\u0003\n,\n(2)\nwhere t \u223c U(0.02, 0.98), \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I), and xt = \u03b1tg(\u03b8, c) + \u03c3t\u03f5. Its gradient is approximated by\n\u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) \u2248 Et,\u03f5,c\n\u0014\n\u03c9(t)(\u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc) \u2212 \u03f5)\u2202g(\u03b8, c)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\n.\n(3)\nNotwithstanding this progress, empirical observations [34] show that SDS often suffers from over-\nsaturation, over-smoothing, and low-diversity issues, which have yet to be thoroughly explained or\nadequately addressed.\n3D representations. We employ NeRF [30, 32] (Neural Radiance Fields) and textured mesh [45] as\ntwo popular and important types of 3D representations. In particular, NeRF represents 3D objects\nusing a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that takes coordinates in a 3D space as input and outputs\nthe corresponding color and density. Here, \u03b8 corresponds to the parameters of the MLP. Given\ncamera pose c, the rendering process g(\u03b8, c) is defined as casting rays from pixels and computing the\nweighted sum of the color of the sampling points along each ray to composite the color of each pixel.\nNeRF is flexible for optimization and is capable of representing extremely complex scenes. Textured\nmesh [45] represents the geometry of a 3D object with triangle meshes and the texture with color on\nthe mesh surface. Here the 3D parameter \u03b8 consists of the parameters to represent the coordinates of\ntriangle meshes and parameters of the texture. The rendering process g(\u03b8, c) given camera pose c is\ndefined by casting rays from pixels and computing the intersections between rays and mesh surfaces\nto obtain the color of each pixel. The textured mesh allows high-resolution and fast rendering with\ndifferentiable rasterization.\n3\nVariational Score Distillation\nWe now present Variational Score Distillation (VSD) (see Sec. 3.1) that learns to sample from a\ndistribution of the 3D scenes. By using 3D parameter particles to represent the target 3D distribution,\nwe derive a principled gradient-based update rule for the particles via the Wasserstein gradient flow\n(see Sec. 3.2). We further show that SDS is a special case of VSD and constructs an experiment in\n2D space to study the optimization algorithm isolated from the 3D representations, explaining the\npractical issues of SDS both theoretically and empirically (see Sec. 3.3).\n3.1\nSampling from 3D Distribution as Variational Inference\nIn principle, given a valid text prompt y, there exists a probabilistic distribution of all possible 3D\nrepresentations. Under a 3D representation (e.g., NeRF) parameterized by \u03b8, such a distribution can\n4\nNeRF/Mesh\nSample\nParticles of NeRF/Mesh\nRender 2D \nImage\nText to Image\nDiffusion\nLoRA\nBack Propagation\nBack Propagation\nAdd Noise\nA highly detailed \nsand castle.\n+ Finetune\nAdd Noise\nFigure 2: Overview of VSD. The 3D representation is differentiably rendered at a random pose c.\nThe rendered image is sent to the pretrained diffusion and the score of the variational distribution\n(estimated by LoRA) to compute the gradient of VSD. LoRA is also updated on the rendered image.\nbe modeled as a probabilistic density \u00b5(\u03b8|y). Denote q\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y) as the (implicit) distribution of\nthe rendered image x0 := g(\u03b8, c) given the camera c with the rendering function g(\u00b7, c), and denote\np0(x0|yc) as the marginal distribution of t = 0 defined by the pretrained text-to-image diffusion\nmodel with the view-dependent prompt yc. To obtain 3D representations of high visual quality, we\npropose to optimize the distribution \u00b5 to align the rendered images of its samples with the pretrained\ndiffusion model in all views by solving\nmin\n\u00b5 DKL(q\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y) \u2225 p0(x0|yc)).\n(4)\nThis is a typical variational inference problem that uses the variational distribution q\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y) to\napproximate (distill) the target distribution p0(x0|yc).\nDirectly solving problem (4) is hard because p0 is rather complex and the high-density regions of p0\nmay be extremely sparse in high dimension [47]. Inspired by the success of diffusion models [14, 49],\nwe construct a series of optimization problems with different diffused distributions indexed by t.\nAs t increases to T, the optimization problem becomes easier because the diffused distributions get\ncloser to the standard Gaussian. We simultaneously solve an ensemble of these problems (termed as\nvariational score distillation or VSD) as follows:\n\u00b5\u2217 := arg min\n\u00b5\nEt,c [(\u03c3t/\u03b1t)\u03c9(t)DKL(q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) \u2225 pt(xt|yc))] ,\n(5)\nwhere q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) :=\nR\nq\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y)pt0(xt|x0)dx0 and pt(xt|yc) :=\nR\np0(x0|yc)pt0(xt|x0)dx0\nare the corresponding noisy distributions at time t with the Gaussian transition pt0(xt|x0) =\nN(xt|\u03b1tx0, \u03c32\nt I), and \u03c9(t) is a time-dependent weighting function.\nCompared with SDS that optimizes for the single point \u03b8, VSD optimizes for the whole distribution\n\u00b5, from which we sample \u03b8. Notably, we prove that introducing the additional KL-divergence for\nt > 0 in VSD does not affect the global optimum of the original problem (4), as shown below.\nTheorem 1 (Global optimum of VSD, proof in Appendix C.4.). For each t > 0, we have\nDKL(q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) \u2225 pt(xt|yc)) = 0 \u21d4 q\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y) = p0(x0|yc).\n(6)\n3.2\nUpdate Rule for Variational Score Distillation\nTo solve problem (5), a direct way can be to train another parameterized generative model for \u00b5, but it\nmay bring much computation cost and optimization complexity. Inspired by previous particle-based\nvariational inference [23, 3, 9] methods, we maintain n 3D parameters3 {\u03b8}n\ni=1 as particles and derive\na novel update rule for them. Intuitively, we use {\u03b8}n\ni=1 to \u201crepresent\u201d the current distribution \u00b5, and\n\u03b8(i) will be samples from the optimal distribution \u00b5\u2217 if the optimization converges. Such optimization\ncan be realized by simulating an ODE w.r.t. \u03b8, as shown in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 (Wasserstein gradient flow of VSD, proof in Appendix C). Starting from an initial\ndistribution \u00b50, denote the Wasserstein gradient flow minimizing problem (5) in the distribution\n(function) space at each time \u03c4 \u2265 0 as {\u00b5\u03c4}\u03c4\u22650 with \u00b5\u221e = \u00b5\u2217. Then we can sample \u03b8\u03c4 from \u00b5\u03c4 by\n3We optimize up to n = 4 particles due to the computation resource limit.

The ODE involves the score function of noisy real im-\nages and that of noisy rendered images at each time4 \u03c4. The score function of noisy real images\n\u2212\u03c3t\u2207xt log pt(xt|yc) can be approximated by the pretrained diffusion model \u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc). The\nscore function of noisy rendered images \u2212\u03c3t\u2207xt log q\u00b5\u03c4\nt (xt|c, y) is estimated by another noise\nprediction network \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y), which is trained on the rendered images by {\u03b8(i)}n\ni=1 with the\nstandard diffusion objective (see Eq.

In most cases, we find that using LoRA can greatly improve the fidelity\nof the obtained samples (e.g., see results in Fig. 1). We believe that it is because LoRA is designed\nfor efficient few-shot fine-tuning and can leverage the prior information in \u03f5pretrain (the information of\nboth images and text corresponding to y).\nNote that at each ODE time \u03c4, we need to ensure \u03f5\u03d5 matches the current distribution q\u00b5\u03c4\nt .

Empirically, the learned neural network may potentially offer superior generalization\nability over the Dirac distribution in SDS, thus it may provide more accurate updating directions in\nlow-density regions. Moreover, by using LoRA, VSD can additionally exploit the text prompt y in the\nestimation \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y), while the Gaussian noise \u03f5 used in SDS cannot leverage the information\nfrom y. Thus, VSD may provide samples which are more aligned with the prompt y.\nVSD is friendly to CFG. As VSD aims to sample \u03b8 from the optimal \u00b5\u2217 defined by the pretrained\nmodel \u03f5pretrain, the effects by tuning the CFG in \u03f5pretrain for 3D sampling by VSD are quite similar to\n2D sampling by the traditional ancestral sampling methods [14, 27]. Therefore, VSD can tune CFG\nas flexibly as the classic text-to-image methods, and we use the same setting of CFG (e.g. 7.5) as the\ncommon text-to-image generation task for the best performance. To the best of our knowledge, this\nfor the first time addresses the problem in previous SDS [34, 20, 4, 29] that it usually requires a large\nCFG (i.e., 100).\nVSD vs. SDS in 2D experiments that isolate 3D representations. To directly compare SDS\nand VSD, we consider a special case of the rendering function g(\u03b8) to decouple the optimization\nalgorithm from 3D representations. In particular, we set g(\u03b8, c) \u2261 \u03b8 for any c. Then the rendered\nimage x = g(\u03b8, c) = \u03b8 is the same 2D image as \u03b8. In such a case, optimizing the parameter \u03b8 is\nequivalent to generating an image in 2D space, thereby independent of the 3D representation. We\nshow the results of different sampling methods in Fig. 3. SDS exhibits failure under both small\nand large CFG weights. Particularly with the default CFG weight (i.e., 100) used in SDS, the 2D\nsamples share the same issues previously observed in text-to-3D such as over-saturation and over-\nsmoothing [34]. In contrast, VSD demonstrates flexibility in accommodating various CFG weights\nand produces realistic samples using a normal CFG weight (i.e., 7.5), behaving similarly to ancestral\nsampling from diffusion models. See more details and analysis in Appendix G.\nAs other 3D factors are isolated in this comparison, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that\nthe aforementioned practical issues of SDS [34] stem from the oversimplified variational distribution\nand large CFG employed by SDS. Such results strongly motivate us to employ VSD for text-to-3D\ngeneration, where it still substantially and consistently outperforms SDS (see evidence in Sec 5).\n4\nProlificDreamer\nWe further present a clear design space for text-to-3D in Sec. 4.1 and systematically study other\nelements orthogonal to the distillation algorithm in Sec. 4.2. Combining all improvements highlighted\nin Tab. 1, we arrive at ProlificDreamer, an advanced text-to-3D approach.\n7\nDreamFusion\nMagic3D\nOurs\nA plate piled high with chocolate chip cookies.\nFantasia3D\nA 3D model of an adorable cottage with a thatched roof.\nFigure 4: Comparison with baselines. Our results have higher fidelity and more details.\n4.1\nDesign Space of Text-to-3D Generation\nWe adopt the two-stage approach [20], with several improvements in the design space of text-to-3D\ngeneration as summarized in Table 1. Specifically, in the first stage, we optimize a high-resolution\n(e.g., 512) NeRF by VSD to utilize its high flexibility for generating scenes with complex geometry.\nIn the second stage, we use DMTet [45] to extract textured mesh from the NeRF obtained in the first\nstage, and further fine-tune the textured mesh for high-resolution details. The second stage is optional\nbecause both NeRF and mesh have their own advantages in representing 3D content and are preferred\nin certain cases. Nevertheless, ProlificDreamer can generate both high-fidelity NeRFs and meshes.\n4.2\n3D Representation and Training\nWe systematically study other elements orthogonal to the algorithmic formulation. Specifically, we\npropose a high rendering resolution of 512 \u00d7 512 during training and an annealed distilling time\nschedule to improve the visual quality. We also carefully design a scene initialization, which is crucial\nfor complex scene generation.\nHigh-resolution rendering for NeRF training. We choose Instant NGP [32] for efficient high-\nresolution rendering and optimize NeRF with up to 512 training resolution using VSD. By applying\nVSD, we obtain high-fidelity NeRFs with resolutions varying from 64 to 512.\nScene initialization for NeRF training. We initialize the density for NeRF as \u03c3init(\u00b5) = \u03bb\u03c3 (1 \u2212\n||\u00b5||2\nr\n), where \u03bb\u03c3 is the density strength, r is the density radius, and \u00b5 is the coordinate. For object-\ncentric scenes, we follow the object-centric initialization used in Magic3D [20] with \u03bb\u03c3 = 10\nand r = 0.5; For complex scenes, we propose scene initialization by setting \u03bb\u03c3 = \u221210 to make\nthe density \u201chollow\u201d and r = 2.5 that encloses the camera. We show in Appendix D that the\nscene initialization can help to generate high-fidelity complex scenes without other modifications\nto the existing algorithm. In addition, we can further add a centric object to the complex scene\nby using object-centric initialization for ||\u00b5||2 < 5/6 and scene initialization for others, where the\nhyperparameter 5/6 ensures the initial density function is continuous.\nAnnealed time schedule for score distillation. We utilize a simple two-stage annealing of time\nstep t in the score distillation objective, suitable for both SDS (Eq. (3)) and VSD (Eq. (9)). For the\nfirst several steps we sample time steps t \u223c U(0.02, 0.98) and then anneal into t \u223c U(0.02, 0.50).\nThe key insight is that, essentially, we aim to match the original q\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y) with p0(x0|yc). The\nKL-divergence for larger t can provide reasonable optimization direction during the early stage of\ntraining. During training, while x\u2217 is approaching the support of p0(x\u2217|yc), a smaller t can narrow\nthe gap between pt(x\u2217|yc) and p0(x\u2217|yc), and provide elaborate details aligning with p0(x\u2217|yc).\nMesh representation and fine-tuning. We adopt a coordinate-based hash grid encoder inherited\nfrom NeRF stage to represent the mesh texture. We follow Fantasia3D [4] to disentangle the\n8\n(1) 64 rendering\n(2) + 512 rendering\n(3) + Annealed t\n(4) + VSD\nFigure 5: Ablation study of proposed improvements for high-fidelity NeRF generation. The prompt is\nan elephant skull. (1) The common setting [34, 20] adopts 64 rendering resolution and SDS loss. (2)\nWe improve the generated quality by increasing the rendering resolution. (3) Annealed time schedule\nadds more details to the generated result. (4) VSD makes the results even better with richer details.\noptimization of geometry and texture by first optimizing the geometry using the normal map and\nthen optimizing the texture. In our initial experiments, we find that optimizing geometry with VSD\nprovides no more details than using SDS. This may be because the mesh resolution is not large\nenough to represent high-frequency details. Thus, we optimize geometry with SDS for efficiency.\nBut unlike Fantasia3D [4], our texture optimization is supervised by VSD with CFG = 7.5 with the\nannealed time schedule, which can provide more details than SDS.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nResults of ProlificDreamer\nWe show the generated results of ProlificDreamer in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), including high-fidelity mesh\nand NeRF results. All the results are generated by VSD. For all experiments without mentioned,\nVSD uses n = 1 particle for a fair comparison with SDS. In Fig. 1(c), we also demonstrate VSD can\ngenerate diverse results, showing that different particles in a round are diverse (with n = 4).\nObject-centric generation. We compare our method with three SOTA baselines, DreamFusion [34],\nMagic3D [20] and Fantasia3D [4]. All of the baselines are based on SDS. Since none of them is\nopen-sourced, we use the figures from their papers. As shown in Fig. 4, ProlificDreamer generates\n3D objects with higher fidelity and more details, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.\nIn appendix, we add user study (Section J) and quantitative results (Section K) of ProlificDreamer\nagainst the baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nLarge scene generation. As shown in Fig. 1(b), our method can generate 360\u25e6 scenes with high-\nfidelity and fine details. The depth map shows that the scenes have geometry instead of being a 360\u25e6\ntextured sphere, verifying that with our scene initialization alone we can generate high-fidelity large\nscenes without much modification to existing components. See more results in Appendix B.\n5.2\nAblation Study\nAblation on NeRF training. Fig. 5 provides the ablation on NeRF training. Starting from the\ncommon setting [34, 20] with 64 rendering resolution and SDS loss, we ablate our proposed improve-\nments step by step, including increasing resolution, adding annealed time schedule, and adding VSD\nall improve the generated results. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed components. We\nprovide more ablation on large scene generation in Appendix D, with a similar conclusion.\nAblation on mesh fine-tuning. We ablate between SDS and VSD on mesh fine-tuning, as shown\nin Appendix D. Fine-tuning texture with VSD provides higher fidelity than SDS. As the fine-tuned\nresults of textured mesh are highly dependent on the initial NeRF, getting a high-quality NeRF at the\nfirst stage is crucial. Note that the provided results of both VSD and SDS in mesh fine-tuning are\nbased on and benefit from the high-fidelity NeRF results in the first stage by our VSD.\nAblation on CFG. We perform ablation to explore how CFG affects generation diversity. We find\nthat smaller CFG encourages more diversity. Our VSD works well with small CFG and provides\n9\nconsiderable diversity, while SDS cannot generate plausible results with small CFG (e.g., 7.5), which\nlimits its ability to generate diverse results. Results and more details are shown in Appendix H.\n6\nRelated Works\nDiffusion models.\nScore-based generative model [48, 49] and diffusion models [14] have shown\ngreat performance in image synthesis [14, 7]. Recently, large-scale diffusion models have shown\ngreat performance in text-to-image synthesis [36, 41, 38], which provides an opportunity to utilize it\nfor zero-shot text-to-3D generation.\nText-to-3D generation.\nDreamField [19] proposes a text-to-3D method using CLIP [35] guidance.\nDreamFusion [34] proposes a text-to-3D method using 2D diffusion models. Score Jacobian Chaining\n(SJC) [55] derives the training objective of text-to-3D using a 2D diffusion model from another theo-\nretical basis. Magic3D [20] extends text-to-3D to a higher resolution with mesh [45] representation.\nLatent-NeRF [29] optimizes NeRF in latent space. Fantasia3D [4] optimizes a mesh with DMTet [45]\nfrom scratch. Although Fantasia3D achieves remarkable zero-shot text-to-3D generation, it requires\nuser-provided shape guidance for the generation of complex geometry. [17] propose score debiasing\nand prompt debiasing to mitigate multiface problem and is orthogonal to our work. TextMesh [52]\nis contemporary with us and proposes a different pipeline for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation.\n3DFuse [44] proposes to incorporate 3D awareness into 2D diffusion for better 3D consistency in\ntext-to-3D generation. In addition, adjusting time schedule has also been discussed in previous\nworks [12, 55]. However, previous works either require carefully devising the schedule [12] or\nperform inferior to the simple random time schedule [55]. Instead, our 2-stage annealing schedule is\neasy to train and achieves better generation quality than the random time schedule.\nText-driven large scene generation.\nText2Room [16] generates indoor rooms from a given prompt.\nHowever, it uses additional monocular depth estimation models as prior, and we do not use any\nadditional models. Our method generates the wild text prompt and uses only a text-to-image diffusion\nmodel. Set-the-scene [5] is a contemporary work with us aimed at large scene generation with a\ndifferent pipeline. Overall, ProlificDreamer uses an advanced optimization algorithm, i.e, VSD with\nour proposed two-stage annealed time schedule, which has a significant advantage over the previous\nSDS / SJC (see Appendix C.3 for details). As a result, ProlificDreamer achieves high-fidelity NeRF\nwith rich structure and complex effects (e.g., smoke and drops) and photo-realistic mesh results.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we systematically study the problem of text-to-3D generation. In terms of the algorithmic\nformulation, we propose variational score distillation (VSD), a principled particle-based variational\nframework that treats the 3D parameter as a random variable and infers its distribution. VSD\nnaturally generalizes SDS in the variational formulation and addresses the practical issues of SDS\nobserved before. With other orthogonal improvements to 3D representations, our overall approach,\nProlificDreamer, can generate high-fidelity NeRF and photo-realistic textured meshes.\nLimitations and broader impact. Although ProlificDreamer achieves remarkable text-to-3D results,\nthe generation takes hours of time, which is much slower than image generation by a diffusion model.\nAlthough large scene generation can be achieved with our scene initialization, the camera poses\nduring training are regardless of the scene structure, which may be improved by devising an adaptive\ncamera pose range according to the scene structure for better-generated details. Moreover, due to\nthe limited expressiveness of the base 2D model, the generation for complex prompts may fail, and\nthe generated samples may have multi-face Janus problem [57] in some cases because of the poor\ntext-image alignment for the view-dependent prompts. In addition, content creation by generative\nmodels may cause harmful social impacts on the labor market. Also, like other generative models,\nour method may be utilized to generate fake and malicious contents, which needs more caution.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by NSF of China Projects (Nos. 62061136001, 61620106010, 62076145,\nU19B2034, U1811461, U19A2081, 6197222); Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program NO.\n10\nBJJWZYJH012019100020098; a grant from Tsinghua Institute for Guo Qiang; the High Performance\nComputing Center, Tsinghua University; and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China\n(22XNKJ13).

Specifically, denote\nP(\u0398) as the set containing all the distributions on a support space \u0398 with Euclidean distance, and\nW2(\u0398) := {\u00b5 \u2208 P(\u0398) : \u2203\u03b80 \u2208 \u0398 s.t.

Typically, the measure\n\u00b5\u03c4 follows the \u201csteepest descending curves\u201d of a functional on W2(\u0398), which is known as the\nWasserstein gradient flow. A common setting is to define the functional of \u00b5\u03c4 as the KL-divergence\nDKL(\u00b5\u03c4 \u2225 \u00b5\u2217), and then \u00b5\u03c4 follows \u2202\u03c4\u00b5\u03c4 = \u2212\u2207\u03b8 \u00b7 (\u00b5\u03c4\u2207\u03b8 log \u00b5\u2217\n\u00b5\u03c4 ), and the corresponding vector\nfield is v\u03c4(\u03b8\u03c4) = \u2207\u03b8 log \u00b5\u2217\n\u00b5\u03c4 . However, directly computing the vector field is intractable because\nit is non-trivial to compute the time-dependent score function \u2207\u03b8 log \u00b5\u03c4(\u03b8). To tackle this issue,\ntraditional ParVI methods either restrict the functional gradient within RKHS and leverage analytical\nkernels to approximate the vector field [23, 3, 22], or learn a neural network to estimate the vector\nfield [8]; but all of these methods are hard to scale up to high-dimensional data such as images.\nC.2\nVSD as Particle-based Variational Inference\nIn this section, we formally propose the theoretical guarantee of VSD.\nDenote W2(\u0398) as the 2-Wasserstein space [53] of the probability distributions defined on the\nparameter space \u0398. For any distribution \u00b5 \u2208 W2(\u0398) with a corresponding random variable \u03b8 \u223c\n\u00b5(\u03b8|y), denote the implicit distribution for x0 := g(\u03b8, c) as q\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y), and let q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) :=\nR\nq\u00b5\n0 (x0|c, y)qt0(xt|x0)dx0 be the marginal distribution of the random variable xt during the\ndiffusion process. We want to optimize the distribution \u00b5(\u03b8|y) in the function space W2(\u0398) by\ndistilling a pretrained diffusion model pt(xt|yc) via minimizing the following functional of \u00b5:\nmin\n\u00b5\u2208W2(\u0398) E[\u00b5] := Et,\u03f5,c\n\u0014 \u03c3t\n\u03b1t\n\u03c9(t)DKL(q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) \u2225 pt(xt|yc))\n\u0015\n.\n(10)\n18\nCompared with the vanilla SDS in Eq. (2) which optimizes the parameter \u03b8 in the parameter space \u0398,\nhere we aim to optimize the distribution (measure) \u00b5(\u03b8|y) in the function space W2(\u0398). Inspired by\nprevious ParVI techniques [23, 3, 56], we firstly derive the gradient flow minimizing E[\u00b5] in W2(\u0398)\nand the update rule of each particle \u03b8 \u223c \u00b5(\u03b8), as shown in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3 (Wasserstein gradient flow of score distillation). Starting from an initial distribution\n\u00b50(\u03b8|y), the gradient flow {\u00b5\u03c4}\u03c4\u22650 minimizing E[\u00b5\u03c4] on W2(\u0398) at each time \u03c4 \u2265 0 satisfies\n\u2202\u00b5\u03c4(\u03b8|y)\n\u2202\u03c4\n= \u2212\u2207\u03b8\u00b7\n\u0014\n\u00b5\u03c4(\u03b8|y)Et,\u03f5,c\n\u0014\n\u03c3t\u03c9(t) (\u2207xt log pt(xt|yc)\u2212\u2207xt log q\u00b5\u03c4\nt (xt|c, y)) \u2202g(\u03b8, c)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\u0015\n,\n(11)\nand the corresponding update rule for each \u03b8\u03c4 \u223c \u00b5\u03c4 satisfies\nd\u03b8\u03c4\nd\u03c4 = \u2212Et,\u03f5,c\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\u03c9(t)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u2212\u03c3t\u2207xt log pt(xt|yc)\n|\n{z\n}\n\u2248\u03f5pretrain(xt,t,yc)\n\u2212 (\u2212\u03c3t\u2207xt log q\u00b5\u03c4\nt (xt|c, y))\n|\n{z\n}\n\u2248\u03f5\u03d5(xt,t,c,y)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 \u2202g(\u03b8\u03c4, c)\n\u2202\u03b8\u03c4\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb . (12)\nTheorem 3 shows that by letting the random variable \u03b8\u03c4 \u223c \u00b5\u03c4(\u03b8\u03c4|y) move across the ODE trajectory\nin Eq. (12), its underlying distribution \u00b5\u03c4 will move by the direction of the steepest descent that\nminimizes E[\u00b5]. Therefore, to obtain samples (in \u0398) from \u00b5\u2217 = arg min\u00b5 E[\u00b5], we can simulate the\nODE in Eq. (12) by estimating two score functions \u2207xt log pt(xt|yc) and \u2207xt log q\u00b5\u03c4\nt (xt|c, y) at\neach ODE time \u03c4, which corresponds to the VSD objective in Eq. (9).\nC.3\nDiscussions of SDS / SJC and VSD\nThere are three main differences between our proposed VSD and previous SDS [34] / SJC [55]: (1)\nVSD can optimize multiple (n \u2265 1) 3D objects, while SDS / SJC only optimizes a single (n = 1) 3D\nobject. (2) VSD can generate high-fidelity results with the common (e.g., 7.5) CFG (for both n = 1\nand n > 1), while SDS / SJC needs extremely large (e.g. 100) CFG. (3) SDS / SJC is a special case\nof VSD by using a single-point Dirac distribution \u00b5(\u03b8|y) \u2248 \u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8(1)) as the variational distribution.\nSDS / SJC as a special case of VSD. Here we explain SDS / SJC under our variational infer-\nence framework.\nIf we directly approximate \u00b5(\u03b8|y) \u2248 \u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8(1)) by its empirical distribu-\ntion with the single sample \u03b8(1), then we have q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) \u2248 N(xt|\u03b1tg(\u03b8(1), c), \u03c32\nt I) and thus\n\u2212\u03c3t\u2207xt log q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) \u2248 (xt \u2212 \u03b1tg(\u03b8(1), c))/\u03c3t = \u03f5, which recovers the vanilla SDS / SJC. There-\nfore, SDS / SJC is a special case of VSD for the underlying distribution \u00b5(\u03b8|y) by the empirical\ndistribution with a single point. Such an approximation has no generalization ability for \u03b8 \u0338= \u03b8(1),\nand thus the updating direction by the score function \u2212\u03c3t\u2207xt log q\u00b5\nt (xt|c, y) (or equivalently, the\nGaussian noise \u03f5) may be rather bad at low-density regions, resulting poor samples for the final \u03b8(1).\nInstead, VSD regards \u03b8(1) as samples from the underlying distribution \u00b5(\u03b8|y) and trains a neural\nnetwork \u03f5\u03d5 to approximate the corresponding score functions, thus can leverage the generalization\nability of neural networks for better approximating the underlying distribution \u00b5(\u03b8|y). Moreover, by\nusing LoRA, VSD can additionally exploit the text prompt y in the estimation \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y), while\nthe Gaussian noise \u03f5 used in SDS cannot leverage the information from y.\nSDS / SJC as mode-seeking, VSD as sampling. VSD aims to sample \u03b8 from the optimal \u00b5\u2217, while\nSDS / SJC aims to find the optimal \u03b8\u2217 minimizing the objective in Eq. (2). As the global optimum\n\u03b8\u2217 in SDS / SJC is the mode of Eq. (2), SDS / SJC is also known as performing mode-seeking [34].\nTo demonstrate the differences between sampling and mode-seeking, we consider a special case\nof the rendering function g(\u03b8) to decouple the optimization algorithm and the 3D representation.\nIn particular, we set g(\u03b8, c) \u2261 \u03b8 for any c and \u03b8 \u2208 Rd, then the rendered image x = g(\u03b8, c) = \u03b8\nis the same 2D image as \u03b8. In such a case, we have q\u00b5\n0 = \u00b5, and it is easy to prove that \u00b5\u2217 = p0\n(according to Theorem 1). For VSD, sampling \u03b8 from \u00b5\u2217 is corresponding to the traditional ancestral\nsampling [27] from p0; while for SDS / SJC, we have \u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) = Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)\u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc)] \u2248\nEt,\u03f5[\u2212\u03c3t\u03c9(t)\u2207xt log pt(xt|yc)], and thus the optimal \u03b8\u2217 is the mode of the \u201caveraged likelihood\u201d of\npt for all t. However, it is common that the mode of deep generative models may have poor sample\nquality [33]. We show in Fig. 3 that under the same CFG (7.5), both VSD and ancestral sampling can\ngenerate good samples but the sample quality of SDS is quite poor.\nSDS / SJC requires large CFG, while VSD is friendly to CFG. As VSD aims to sample \u03b8 from\nthe optimal \u00b5\u2217 defined by the pretrained model \u03f5pretrain, the effects by tuning the CFG in \u03f5pretrain for\n19\n3D samples \u03b8 by VSD are quite similar to the effects for the 2D samples by the traditional ancestral\nsampling [14, 27]. Therefore, VSD can tune CFG as flexibly as the classic text-to-image methods, and\nwe use the same setting of CFG (e.g. 7.5) as the common text-to-image generation task for the best\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, this for the first time addresses the problem in previous\nSDS [34, 20, 4, 29] that it usually requires a large CFG (i.e., 100). Specifically, SDS (Eq. (3)) uses\n(\u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc) \u2212 \u03f5) while VSD (Eq. (9))) uses (\u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc) \u2212 \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y)). For example,\nfor the 2D special case of g(\u03b8, c) \u2261 \u03b8, we have \u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03b8) = Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)\u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc)] and\n\u2207\u03b8LVSD(\u03b8) = Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)(\u03f5pretrain(xt, t, yc) \u2212 \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y))]. Intuitively, to obtain highly detailed\nsamples, the updating direction for \u03b8 needs to be \u201cfine\u201d and \u201csharp\u201d. As SDS only depends on \u03f5pretrain,\nit needs a large CFG (= 100) to make sure \u03f5pretrain to be \u201csharp\u201d enough; however, large CFG, in turn,\nreduces the diversity of the results and also hurts the quality. Instead, VSD leverages an additional\nscore function \u03f5\u03d5(xt, t, c, y) to give a more elaborate direction than the zero-mean Gaussian noise,\nand the updating direction can be rather \u201cfine\u201d and \u201csharp\u201d due to the difference between \u03f5pretrain\nand \u03f5\u03d5. We empirically find that VSD can obtain much better quality than SDS in both 2D and 3D\ngeneration.\nC.4\nProof of Main Theorem\nC.4.1\nProof of Theorem 1\nProof of Theorem 1.

We start from 64 rendering resolution, with SDS loss and our scene\ninitialization. The results are shown in Figure 11. It can be seen from the figure that, with our\nscene initialization, the results are with 360\u25e6 surroundings instead of being object-centric. Increasing\nrendering resolution is slightly beneficial. Adding annealed time schedule improves the visual quality\nof the results. Replacing SDS with VSD makes the results more realistic with more details.\nSDS\n64 Rendering\nScene Initialization\n+ 512 \nRendering\n+ Annealed \nTime Schedule\n+ VSD\nDepth\nFigure 11: Ablation study on scene generation. With our scene initialization, the results are with\n360\u25e6 surroundings instead of being object-centric. Our annealed time schedule and VSD are both\nbeneficial for the generation quality. The prompt here is Inside of a smart home, realistic detailed\nphoto, 4k.\nD.2\nAblation Study on Mesh Fine-tuning\nHere we provide an ablation study on mesh fine-tuning. Fine-tuning with textured mesh further\nimproves the quality compared to the NeRF result. Fine-tuning texture with VSD provides higher\nfidelity than SDS. Note that both VSD and SDS in mesh fine-tuning are based on and benefit from\nthe high-fidelity NeRF results by our VSD. And it\u2019s crucial to get a high-quality NeRF with VSD at\nthe first stage.\nD.3\nAblation on Number of Particles\nHere we provide ablation study on number of particles. We vary the number of particles in 1, 2, 4, 8\nand examine how the number of particles affects the generated results. The CFG of VSD is set as 7.5.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 13. As is shown in the figure, the diversity of the generated results is\nslightly larger as the number of particles increases. Meanwhile, the quality of generated results is not\naffected much by the number of particles. Owing to the high computation overhead to optimize 3D\nrepresentations and limitations on computation resources, we now only test at most 8 particles. We\nprovide a 2D experiment with 2048 particles in Appendix G to demonstrate the scalability of VSD.\nWe leave the experiments of more particles in 3D as future work.\n22\n(1) High fidelity NeRF\ngenerated by VSD (ours).\n(2) Extract and fine-tune\ngeometry from NeRF.\n(3a) Texture fine-tuned by\nVSD (ours).\n(3b) Texture fine-tuned by\nSDS.\nFigure 12: Pipeline of ProlificDreamer along with ablation study of VSD.

In\naddition, our VSD still provides competitive results under a lower training resolution (128 or 256),\nwhich is more computationally efficient than the 512 resolution.\nE\nAlgorithm for Variational Score Distillation\nWe provide a summarized algorithm of variational score distillation in Algorithm 1.\nWe initialize one or several 3D structures {\u03b8(i)}n\ni=1, a noise prediction model \u03f5\u03d5 parameterized\nby \u03d5. At each iteration, we sample a camera pose c from a pre-defined distribution as previous\nworks [34, 20]. Then we render 2D image from 3D structures at pose c with differentiable rendering\nx0 = g(\u03b8, c). To optimize 3D parameters \u03b8, we compute the gradient direction of 2D image and then\nback propagate to the parameter of NeRF, using VSD as Eq. (9). To model the score of the variational\ndistribution, we train an additional diffusion model \u03f5\u03d5 parameterized by LoRA. We optimize Eq. (8)\nto train LoRA after optimization of 3D parameters, using the rendered image x0 = g(\u03b8, c) and pose c.\nNote that, at each iteration, we perform differentiable rendering only once but use the rendered image\ntwice for both computing gradient direction with VSD and training LoRA. Thus the computation\ncost will not increase much compared to SDS.\nF\nMore Details on Implementation and Hyper-Parameters\nTraining details.\nWe use v-prediction [42] to train our additional diffusion model \u03f5\u03d5. The camera\npose c is fed into a 2-layer MLP and then added to timestep embedding at each U-Net block.\nNeRF/mesh and LoRA batch sizes are set to 1 owing to the computation limit.

The diversity of the generated\nresults is slightly larger as the number of particles increases. The quality of generated results is not\naffected much by the number of particles. The prompt is A high quality photo of an ice cream sundae.\nNeRF/mesh may improve the generated quality and we leave it in future work. The learning rate of\nLoRA is 0.0001 and the learning rate of hash grid encoder is 0.01. We render in RGB color space for\nhigh-resolution synthesis, unlike [29, 55] that render in latent space. In addition, we set \u03c9(t) = \u03c32\nt .\nFor most experiments, we only use n = 1 particle for VSD to reduce the computation time (and we\nonly use a batch size of 1, due to the computation resource limits). For NeRF rendering, we sample\n96 points along each ray, with 64 samples in coarse stage and 32 samples in fine stage. We choose a\nsingle-layer MLP to decode the color and volumetric density from the hash grid encoder as previous\nwork [20].\nFor object-centric scenes, we set the camera radius as U(1.0, 1.5). The bounding box size is set as\n1.0. For large scene generation, we enlarge the range of camera radius to U(0.1, 2.3) for better details\n24\n(1) 64 rendering.\n(2) 128 rendering.\n(3) 256 rendering.\n(4) 512 rendering.\nFigure 14: Ablation study on rendering resolution during NeRF training. Training with higher\nresolution produces better results with finer details. However, our VSD still provides competitive\nresults under a lower resolution (128 or 256), which is more computationally efficient. The prompt\nhere is an elephant skull.\nand geometry consistency. We enlarge the bounding box size to 5.0. For large scenes with a centric\nobject, we set the range of camera radius as U(1.0, 2.0).\nDreamFusion [34] introduces an explicit shading model based on normal vectors during the training\nprocess to enhance the geometry. We currently disable the shadings and it reduces the computational\ncost and memory consumption. We leave incorporating the shading model into our method as future\nwork.\nOptimization.\nWe optimize 25k steps for each particle with AdamW [26] optimizer in NeRF\nstage. We optimize 15k steps for geometry fine-tuning and 30k steps for texture fine-tuning. At\neach stage, for the first 5k steps we sample time steps t \u223c U(0.02, 0.98) and then directly change\ninto t \u223c U(0.02, 0.50). For large scene generation, we delay the annealing time to 10k steps since\nlarge scene generation requires more iterations to converge. The NeRF training stage consumes\n17/17/18/27GB GPU memory with 64/128/256/512 rendering resolution and batch size of 1. The\nMesh fine-tuning stage consumes around 17GB GPU memory with 512 rendering resolution and\nbatch size of 1. The whole optimization process takes around several hours per particle on a single\nNVIDIA A100 GPU. We believe adding more GPUs in parallel will accelerate the generation process,\nand we leave it for future work.\nLicenses\nHere we provide the URL, citations and licenses of the open-sourced assets we use in this\nwork.\nTable 2: URL, citations and licenses of the open-sourced assets we use in this work.\nURL\nCitation\nLicense\nhttps://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion\n[51]\nApache License 2.0\nhttps://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio\n[13]\nApache License 2.0\nhttps://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion\n[38]\nMIT License\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin\n[11]\nApache License 2.0\nhttps://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\n[54]\nApache License 2.0\nG\n2D Experiments of Variational Score Distillation\nHere we describe the details of the experiments on 2D images with Variation Score Distillation in the\nmain text of Fig. 3. Here we set the number of particles as 8. We train a smaller U-Net from scratch\nto estimate the variational score since the distribution of several 2D images is much simpler than the\ndistribution of images rendered from different poses of 3D structures. The optimization takes around\n6000 steps. Additional U-Net is optimized 1 step on every optimization step of the particle images.\nThe learning rate of particle images is 0.03 and the learning rate of U-Net is 0.0001. The batch size\nof particles and U-Net are both set as 8. Here we do not use annealed time schedule for both VSD\nand SDS for a fair comparison.\n25\nTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of our VSD, we increase the number of particles to a large\nnumber of 2048. The optimization takes around 20k steps. The batch size of U-Net is 192 and the\nbatch size of particles is set as 16. The results are shown in Figure 15. It can be seen from the figure\nthat our VSD generates plausible results even under a large number of particles, which demonstrates\nthe scalability of VSD. Although, due to the high optimization cost of 3D representation, the number\nof particles in 3D experiments is relatively small, we demonstrate that VSD has the potential to scale\nup to more particles.\nFigure 15: Selected samples from 2048 particles in a 2D experiment of VSD. Our VSD generates\nplausible results even under a large number of particles, which demonstrates the scalability of VSD.\nThe prompt is an astronaut is riding a horse.\nTo match the 3D experiment setting, we also provide 2D experiments with LoRA and add annealed\ntime schedule. The results are shown in Figure 16. The number of particles is set as 6 and CFG= 7.5.\nOur VSD provides high-fidelity and diverse results in this setting. We also set the number of particles\nas 2048 and the results are shown in Figure 17.\nFigure 16: 2D experiments of VSD (CFG= 7.5) results with LoRA and annealed time schedule.\nThe number of particles is 6. Our VSD provides high-fidelity and diverse results in this setting. The\nprompt is an astronaut is riding a horse.\nWe also provide the results of SDS for comparison in Fig. 18. Compared to our VSD, the results of\nSDS are smoother and lack details.\nFigure 17: Selected samples of 2D experiments of VSD (CFG= 7.5)\nresults with LoRA. The number of particles is 2048.\nFigure 18:\nSDS\nresult in 2D.\nMoreover, we visualize VSD/SDS training phase of 2D in Fig. 19. Since the gradient is not directly\nreadable, we visualize x + \u2206x, which is the updated results if current sample optimizes via this\ngradient direction. As shown in Fig. 19, SDS tends to provide over-saturated and over-smooth\ngradient while VSD provides more natural-looking gradients with more details. As a consequence,\nVSD provides better final results.\nH\nHow will CFG weights affect diversity?\nIn this section, we explore how CFG affects the diversity of generated results. For VSD, we set\nthe number of particles as 4 and run experiments with different CFG. For SDS, we run 4 times\n26\n(t = 400)\n0 iters\n300 iters\n600 iters\n1000 iters\n\ud835\udc650 + \u0394\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc650\n(t = 850)\n\ud835\udc650 + \u0394\ud835\udc65\n(1) Gradient visualization of SDS.\n0 iters\n300 iters\n600 iters\n1000 iters\n(t = 400)\n\ud835\udc650 + \u0394\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc650\n(t = 850)\n\ud835\udc650 + \u0394\ud835\udc65\n(2) Gradient visualization of VSD (ours).\nFigure 19: Gradient visualization of VSD and SDS during the training phase in 2D experiment. SDS\ntends to provide over-saturated and over-smooth gradient while VSD provides more natural-looking\ngradients with more details.\nof generation with different random seeds. The results are shown in Figure 20. As shown in the\nfigure, smaller CFG provides more diversity. We conjecture that this is because the distribution of\nsmaller guidance weights has more diverse modes. However, when the CFG becomes too small (e.g.,\nCFG= 1), it cannot provide enough guidance strength to generate plausible results. Therefore, for\nall our 3D experiments shown in the results, we set CFG = 7.5 as a trade-off between diversity and\noptimization stability. Note that SDS could not work well in such small CFG weights. Instead, our\nVSD provides a trade-off option between CFG weight and diversity, and it can generate more diverse\nresults by simply setting a smaller CFG.\nI\nLimitations and Discussions\nAlthough ProlificDreamer achieves remarkable text-to-3D results, the generation takes hours (espe-\ncially for high-resolution NeRF training), which is much slower than the vanilla image generation by\na diffusion model. Speeding up the text-to-3D generation is another critical problem, and we leave it\nin future work.\nBesides, our proposed scene initialization demonstrates its effectiveness in generating expansive\nscenes, yet there are still limitations, particularly with respect to camera positioning. Our current\nmodel sets the camera with a fixed view toward the scene\u2019s center, which serves object-centric\nscenes effectively but may be suboptimal for scenes with intricate geometry and detailed textures.\nFurthermore, despite our efforts to produce outcomes with a rich structure, occasional failures occur\nand the geometry reverts to a simplistic textured sphere. In order to address these limitations, future\nresearch could focus on developing improved camera poses capable of capturing and rendering scenes\nin finer detail. Furthermore, our present model relies solely on the text-to-image diffusion model\nwithout the assistance of other models. The integration of off-the-shelf depth estimation models [37],\nas utilized in other studies [16, 58], could potentially enhance the accuracy and detail of the scene\ngeneration process.\nIn addition, the correspondence between text prompts and generated results is sometimes insufficient,\nespecially for complex prompts. We conjecture that it is because the ability to generate from\ncomplex prompts is limited by the text encoder of Stable Diffusion. In addition, the multi-face\nJanus problem [57] also exists in our case. Nevertheless, we believe our proposed VSD and other\ncontributions are orthogonal to these problems, and the generation quality can be further improved\nby introducing more techniques, such as using a more powerful text-to-image diffusion model that\nunderstands view-dependent prompts better [34, 41], or a diffusion model with more 3D priors [24].\nJ\nUser Study\nFor completeness, we follow previous works [20, 4] and conduct a user study by comparing\nProlificDreamer with DreamFusion [34], Magic3D [20] and Fantasia3D [4] under 15 prompts, 5\nprompts for each baseline.

The volunteers are shown the generated results of\nour ProlificDreamer and baselines and asked to choose the better one in terms of fidelity, details and\nvividness. We collect results from 109 volunteers, yielding 1635 pairwise comparisons. The results\nare shown in Table 3. Our method outperforms all of the baselines.\nTable 3: Results of user study.

Specifically, we\nselect 100 prompts from previous works including DreamFusion, Magic3D and Fantasia3D. For each\nprompt, we use VSD (number of particles n=1, CFG=7.5) or SDS (CFG=100) to optimize one 3D\nobject and render 10 images uniformly from the circumference at an angle of 30\u00b0 above the horizon,\nand collect 1k images in total. To isolatedly compare VSD with SDS, we run with the default setting\nof the stage-1 NeRF training of ProlificDreamer (i.e., both VSD and SDS are in 512 resolution and\nuse annealed t).\nIn Table 4, We compute the FID score between the 1k samples from the 100 prompts and a 50k\nreference batch, which is sampled by 50-step DPM-Solver++ [28] with 500 images per prompt. In\nTable 5, due to the time and computation resource limits, we compare the results for VSD with n=4\nunder only 25 randomly-selected prompts from the aforementioned 100 prompts, and compare SDS,\nVSD (n=1) and VSD (n=4) with the 50-step DPM-Solver++ under these 25 prompts. For VSD (n=4),\nas we can get 4 particles (3D objects) per prompt, we randomly select one particle per prompt and\nrender the corresponding 10 images of the selected particle for fair comparison. For 2D experiments\nin Table 6, we follow the common setting of evaluating text-to-image models by computing FID on\nMSCOCO2014 validation set. Specifically, we randomly select 1k prompts and sample one image\nper prompt by either 50-step DPM-Solver++, SDS (CFG=100), VSD (n=4, CFG=7.5) or VSD (n=8,\nCFG=7.5) to collect 1k samples for each method, and then compute the FID between the obtained\nsamples and the entire COCO validation set. For VSD, as we can get n images per prompt, we\nrandomly select one image per prompt for fair comparison.\nResults\nVSD with n=1 still outperforms SDS in 3D (both with 512 resolution and annealed t), as\nshown in Table 4 and Table 5, which demonstrates the effectiveness of VSD.\nUsing more particles is slightly better. Due to the limitation of time and computation resources, we\nonly compare n=1 and n=4 in 3D experiments, and n=4 with n=8 in the 2D experiments. As shown\nin Table 5, VSD with 4 particles slightly outperforms VSD with 1 particles in the 3D setting; and as\nshown in Table 6, VSD with 8 particles slightly outperforms VSD with 4 particles in the 2D setting.\n29\nTable 6: 2D sample quality by different samplers, 1000 prompts.\nMethod\nSDS\nVSD (n=4)\nVSD (n=8)\nDPM++\nFID (\u2193)\n90.09\n68.02\n66.68\n47.91\nVSD outperforms SDS in 2D. As shown in Table 6, the FID by VSD is much better than SDS. As\nthe 2D setting isolates the sampling algorithm from the 3D representations, we can directly compare\ndifferent sampling algorithms, finding that VSD can get better sample quality than SDS (though still\nworse than SOTA diffusion samplers, it can generalize to 3D cases).\nL\nWhy using SDS in stage-2 for the geometry optimization of mesh?\nVSD can also be used to generate geometry. To validate this, we provide an ablation example in\nFig. 21 (3a),(3b). As shown in the figure, VSD can obtain reasonable geometry. Although the some\npart of the geometry from VSD is with more details than SDS (including the tail of the horse), on\nthe whole, the result from VSD is similar with SDS. We conjecture that this is because currently the\ntriangle size of the mesh is relatively large and can\u2019t represent very fine details. Thus, for efficiency,\nwe use SDS instead of VSD for mesh geometry optimization. We believe that VSD can be used to\nobtain high quality mesh if more advanced mesh representation is available.\nMoreover, despite that we use SDS to optimize the geometry in stage-2, VSD is still crucial in stage-1\nand stage-3, in which VSD significantly improves the generated quality.\n(1) Generate\nNeRF with\nVSD.\n(2) Get coarse\nmesh with\nMarching Tets.\n(3a) Mesh\noptimization\nwith SDS.\n(3b) Mesh\noptimization\nwith VSD.\n(4) Inherit\ntexture from\nNeRF.\n(5) Finetune\ntexture with\nVSD.\nLoRA sample\nduring stage\n(5).\nFigure 21: Pipeline along with ablation study of VSD for geometry optimization.

Some baselines are missing given a specific prompt because the\nprompt is not included in the corresponding papers. To demonstrate geometry, some baselines choose\ntextureless shading [34, 20], while the other [4] prefers the normal map. For ProlificDreamer, we\nuniformly show the normal map for consistency.

Classical approaches\nemploy reinforcement learning (RL) [6, 7] and imitation learning [8\u201310] that operate on primitive\nactions, which could be challenging for systematic exploration [11\u201315], interpretability [16\u201318], and\ngeneralization [19\u201321]. Recent advances in large language model (LLM) based agents harness the\nworld knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained LLMs to generate consistent action plans or executable\npolicies [16, 22, 19]. They are applied to embodied tasks like games and robotics [23\u201327], as well as\nNLP tasks without embodiment [28\u201330]. However, these agents are not lifelong learners that can\nprogressively acquire, update, accumulate, and transfer knowledge over extended time spans [31, 32].\nLet us consider Minecraft as an example. Unlike most other games studied in AI [33, 34, 10],\nMinecraft does not impose a predefined end goal or a fixed storyline but rather provides a unique\nplayground with endless possibilities [23]. Minecraft requires players to explore vast, procedurally\ngenerated 3D terrains and unlock a tech tree using gathered resources. Human players typically start\nby learning the basics, such as mining wood and cooking food, before advancing to more complex\ntasks like combating monsters and crafting diamond tools. We argue that an effective lifelong learning\nagent should have similar capabilities as human players: (1) propose suitable tasks based on its\ncurrent skill level and world state, e.g., learn to harvest sand and cactus before iron if it finds itself in\na desert rather than a forest; (2) refine skills based on environmental feedback and commit mastered\nskills to memory for future reuse in similar situations (e.g. fighting zombies is similar to fighting\nspiders); (3) continually explore the world and seek out new tasks in a self-driven manner.\nTowards these goals, we introduce VOYAGER, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning\nagent to drive exploration, master a wide range of skills, and make new discoveries continually\nwithout human intervention in Minecraft. VOYAGER is made possible through three key modules\n(Fig. 2): 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration; 2) a skill library for storing\nand retrieving complex behaviors; and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that generates\nexecutable code for embodied control. We opt to use code as the action space instead of low-level\nmotor commands because programs can naturally represent temporally extended and compositional\nactions [16, 22], which are essential for many long-horizon tasks in Minecraft. VOYAGER interacts\nwith a blackbox LLM (GPT-4 [35]) through prompting and in-context learning [36\u201338]. Our approach\nbypasses the need for model parameter access and explicit gradient-based training or finetuning.\nMore specifically, VOYAGER attempts to solve progressively harder tasks proposed by the automatic\ncurriculum, which takes into account the exploration progress and the agent\u2019s state. The curriculum\nis generated by GPT-4 based on the overarching goal of \u201cdiscovering as many diverse things as\npossible\u201d. This approach can be perceived as an in-context form of novelty search [39, 40]. VOYAGER\nincrementally builds a skill library by storing the action programs that help solve a task successfully.\n2\nInventory (5/36): {'oak_planks': 3, 'stick': \n4, 'crafting_table': 1, 'stone': 3, \n'wooden_pickaxe': 1}\nBiome: river\nInventory (4/36): {'sugar_cane': 3, 'paper': \n3, 'fishing_rod': 1, 'wooden_pickaxe': 1}\nNearby entities: pig, cat, villager\r\nHealth: 12/20\r\nHunger: 0/20\nInventory (6/36): {'furnace': 1, \n'stone_pickaxe': 1, 'oak_planks': 7, \n'crafting_table': 1, 'raw_iron': 4, 'coal': 1} \nTime: night\nNearby entities: zombie\nEquipment: 'stone_sword', 'shield'\nReasoning: Since you have a wooden pickaxe and some stones, it would be \nbeneficial to upgrade your pickaxe to a stone pickaxe for better efficiency.\r\nTask: Craft 1 stone pickaxe.\nReasoning: Since you have a fishing rod in your inventory and you are near a river \nbiome, it would be a good opportunity to catch some fish for food and experience. \nTask: Catch 1 fish.\nReasoning: Your hunger is at 0, which means you need to find food to replenish \nyour hunger. Since there are pigs nearby, you can kill one to obtain raw porkchops.\nTask: Kill 1 pig.\nReasoning: You have raw iron and coal, and you have a furnace. It's time to smelt \nthe iron to make iron ingots, which can be used to craft better tools and armor.\r\nTask: Smelt 4 raw iron.\nReasoning: Since it's night and there's a zombie nearby, it's a good opportunity to \ntry killing the zombie now that you have a stone sword and a shield equipped.\nTask: Kill 1 zombie.\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nFigure 3: Tasks proposed by the automatic curriculum. We only display the partial prompt for brevity.\nSee Appendix, Sec. A.3 for the full prompt structure.\nEach program is indexed by the embedding of its description, which can be retrieved in similar\nsituations in the future. Complex skills can be synthesized by composing simpler programs, which\ncompounds VOYAGER\u2019s capabilities rapidly over time and alleviates catastrophic forgetting in other\ncontinual learning methods [31, 32].\nHowever, LLMs struggle to produce the correct action code consistently in one shot [41]. To address\nthis challenge, we propose an iterative prompting mechanism that: (1) executes the generated\nprogram to obtain observations from the Minecraft simulation (such as inventory listing and nearby\ncreatures) and error trace from the code interpreter (if any); (2) incorporates the feedback into GPT-4\u2019s\nprompt for another round of code refinement; and (3) repeats the process until a self-verification\nmodule confirms the task completion, at which point we commit the program to the skill library (e.g.,\ncraftStoneShovel() and combatZombieWithSword()) and query the automatic curriculum for\nthe next milestone (Fig. 2).\nEmpirically, VOYAGER demonstrates strong in-context lifelong learning capabilities. It can construct\nan ever-growing skill library of action programs that are reusable, interpretable, and generalizable\nto novel tasks. We evaluate VOYAGER systematically against other LLM-based agent techniques\n(e.g., ReAct [29], Reflexion [30], AutoGPT [28]) in MineDojo [23], an open-source Minecraft AI\nframework. VOYAGER outperforms prior SOTA by obtaining 3.3\u00d7 more unique items, unlocking key\ntech tree milestones up to 15.3\u00d7 faster, and traversing 2.3\u00d7 longer distances. We further demonstrate\nthat VOYAGER is able to utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks\nfrom scratch, while other methods struggle to generalize.\n2\nMethod\nVOYAGER consists of three novel components: (1) an automatic curriculum (Sec. 2.1) that suggests\nobjectives for open-ended exploration, (2) a skill library (Sec. 2.2) for developing increasingly\ncomplex behaviors, and (3) an iterative prompting mechanism (Sec. 2.3) that generates executable\ncode for embodied control. Full prompts are presented in Appendix, Sec. A.\n2.1\nAutomatic Curriculum\nEmbodied agents encounter a variety of objectives with different complexity levels in open-ended\nenvironments. An automatic curriculum offers numerous benefits for open-ended exploration, ensur-\ning a challenging but manageable learning process, fostering curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation\nfor agents to learn and explore, and encouraging the development of general and flexible problem-\nsolving strategies [42\u201344]. Our automatic curriculum capitalizes on the internet-scale knowledge\ncontained within GPT-4 by prompting it to provide a steady stream of new tasks or challenges. The\ncurriculum unfolds in a bottom-up fashion, allowing for considerable adaptability and responsiveness\nto the exploration progress and the agent\u2019s current state (Fig. 3). As VOYAGER progresses to harder\nself-driven goals, it naturally learns a variety of skills, such as \u201cmining a diamond\u201d.\n3\nProgram Description\nSkill Library\nTop-5 Relevant Skills\nProgram Generated by GPT-4\nTask: Craft Iron Pickaxe\nKey\nAdd\nRetrieve\nValue\nSkill Library\nQuery\nHow to craft an iron pickaxe in \nMinecraft?\nTo craft an iron pickaxe, you \nneed to 3 iron ingots and 2 \nsticks.

Top: Adding a new skill. Each time GPT-4 generates and verifies a new\nskill, we add it to the skill library, represented by a vector database. The key is the embedding vector\nof the program description (generated by GPT-3.5), while the value is the program itself. Bottom:\nSkill retrieval. When faced with a new task proposed by the automatic curriculum, we first leverage\nGPT-3.5 to generate a general suggestion for solving the task, which is combined with environment\nfeedback as the query context. Subsequently, we perform querying to identify the top-5 relevant skills.\nThe input prompt to GPT-4 consists of several components:\n(1) Directives encouraging diverse behaviors and imposing constraints,\nsuch as\n\u201cMy ultimate goal is to discover as many diverse things as possible\n...\nThe next task should not be too hard since I may not have the\nnecessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it\nyet.\u201d;\n(2) The agent\u2019s current state, including inventory, equipment, nearby blocks and entities,\nbiome, time, health and hunger bars, and position;\n(3) Previously completed and failed tasks, reflecting the agent\u2019s current exploration progress\nand capabilities frontier;\n(4) Additional context: We also leverage GPT-3.5 to self-ask questions based on the agent\u2019s\ncurrent state and exploration progress and self-answer questions. We opt to use GPT-3.5\ninstead of GPT-4 for standard NLP tasks due to budgetary considerations.\n2.2\nSkill Library\nWith the automatic curriculum consistently proposing increasingly complex tasks, it is essential to\nhave a skill library that serves as a basis for learning and evolution. Inspired by the generality, inter-\npretability, and universality of programs [45], we represent each skill with executable code that scaf-\nfolds temporally extended actions for completing a specific task proposed by the automatic curriculum.\nThe input prompt to GPT-4 consists of the following components:\n(1) Guidelines\nfor\ncode\ngeneration,\nsuch\nas\n\u201cYour function will be reused\nfor building more complex functions.\nTherefore, you should make\nit generic and reusable.\u201d;\n(2) Control primitive APIs, and relevant skills retrieved from the skill library, which are\ncrucial for in-context learning [36\u201338] to work well;\n(3) The generated code from the last round, environment feedback, execution errors, and\ncritique, based on which GPT-4 can self-improve (Sec. 2.3);\n(4) The agent\u2019s current state, including inventory, equipment, nearby blocks and entities,\nbiome, time, health and hunger bars, and position;\n4\nI cannot make stick because I need:  2 more planks\nI cannot make stone_shovel because I need:  2 more stick\nthrow new Error(`No item named ${name}`);\nNo item named acacia_axe\nat line 18:await craftItem(bot, \"acacia_axe\", 1);\nEnvironment Feedback\nExecution Error\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nFigure 5: Left: Environment feedback. GPT-4 realizes it needs 2 more planks before crafting sticks.\nRight: Execution error. GPT-4 realizes it should craft a wooden axe instead of an acacia axe since\nthere is no acacia axe in Minecraft. We only display the partial prompt for brevity. The full prompt\nstructure for code generation is in Appendix, Sec. A.4.\n(5) Chain-of-thought prompting [46] to do reasoning before code generation.\nWe iteratively refine the program through a novel iterative prompting mechanism (Sec. 2.3), in-\ncorporate it into the skill library as a new skill, and index it by the embedding of its description\n(Fig. 4, top). For skill retrieval, we query the skill library with the embedding of self-generated task\nplans and environment feedback (Fig. 4, bottom). By continuously expanding and refining the skill\nlibrary, VOYAGER can learn, adapt, and excel in a wide spectrum of tasks, consistently pushing the\nboundaries of its capabilities in the open world.\n2.3\nIterative Prompting Mechanism\nWe introduce an iterative prompting mechanism for self-improvement through three types of feedback:\n(1) Environment feedback, which illustrates the intermediate progress of program execution\n(Fig. 5, left). For example, \u201cI cannot make an iron chestplate because I need:\n7 more iron ingots\u201d highlights the cause of failure in crafting an iron chestplate. We use\nbot.chat() inside control primitive APIs to generate environment feedback and prompt\nGPT-4 to use this function as well during code generation;\n(2) Execution errors from the program interpreter that reveal any invalid operations or syntax\nerrors in programs, which are valuable for bug fixing (Fig. 5, right);\n(3) Self-verification for checking task success. Instead of manually coding success checkers\nfor each new task proposed by the automatic curriculum, we instantiate another GPT-4\nagent for self-verification. By providing VOYAGER\u2019s current state and the task to GPT-4,\nwe ask it to act as a critic [47\u201349] and inform us whether the program achieves the task.\nIn addition, if the task fails, it provides a critique by suggesting how to complete the task\n(Fig. 6). Hence, our self-verification is more comprehensive than self-reflection [30] by both\nchecking success and reflecting on mistakes.\nDuring each round of code generation, we execute the generated program to obtain environment\nfeedback and execution errors from the code interpreter, which are incorporated into GPT-4\u2019s prompt\nfor the next round of code refinement. This iterative process repeats until self-verification validates\n5\nInventory (8/36): {'oak_planks': 5, 'cobblestone': 2, \n'porkchop': 2, 'wooden_sword': 1, 'coal': 5, 'wooden_pickaxe': \n1, 'oak_log': 3, 'dirt': 9}\nTask: Mine 5 coal ores\nInventory (10/36): {'raw_copper': 9, 'copper_ingot': 3, \n'acacia_planks': 1, 'raw_iron': 1, 'stick': 1, 'iron_sword': 1, \n'iron_pickaxe': 1, 'iron_ingot': 3, 'crafting_table': 1, 'furnace': 1}\nTask: Craft a spyglass\nInventory (7/36): {'oak_log': 5, 'oak_planks': 1, \n'wooden_pickaxe': 1, 'wooden_sword': 1, 'porkchop': 2, \n'white_wool': 2, 'mutton': 6}\nTask: Kill 3 sheep\nInventory (9/36): {'string': 4, 'coal': 1, 'rotten_flesh': 1, \n'iron_sword': 1, 'furnace': 1, 'dirt': 6, 'stone_shovel': 1, \n'wooden_pickaxe': 1, 'granite': 5}\nTask: Kill 1 zombie\nReasoning: Mining coal_ore in Minecraft will get coal. You have 5 coal in your \ninventory.\nSuccess: True\nReasoning: To craft a spyglass, you need 2 copper ingots and 1 amethyst shard. \nYou have 3 copper ingots, but you don't have any amethyst shards.\nSuccess: False\nCritique: Find and mine an amethyst shard underground.\nReasoning: You have 2 white_wool and 6 mutton in your inventory, which indicates \nthat you killed 2 sheep. You needed to kill 3 sheep.\nSuccess: False\nCritique: Find and kill one more sheep to complete the task.\nReasoning: You have 1 rotten_flesh in your inventory, which means you have killed \nat least 1 zombie.\nSuccess: True\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nGPT-4\nFigure 6: Self-verification examples. We only display the partial prompt for brevity. See Appendix,\nSec. A.5 for the full prompt structure.\nthe task\u2019s completion, at which point we add this new skill to the skill library and ask the automatic\ncurriculum for a new objective (Fig. 2). If the agent gets stuck after 4 rounds of code generation, then\nwe query the curriculum for another task. This iterative prompting approach significantly improves\nprogram synthesis for embodied control, enabling VOYAGER to continuously acquire diverse skills\nwithout human intervention.\n3\nExperiments\n3.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe leverage OpenAI\u2019s gpt-4-0314 [35] and gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 [50] APIs for text completion,\nalong with text-embedding-ada-002 [51] API for text embedding. We set all temperatures to\n0 except for the automatic curriculum, which uses temperature = 0.1 to encourage task diversity. Our\nsimulation environment is built on top of MineDojo [23] and leverages Mineflayer [52] JavaScript\nAPIs for motor controls. See Appendix, Sec. B.1 for more details.\n3.2\nBaselines\nBecause there is no LLM-based agents that work out of the box for Minecraft, we make our best\neffort to select a number of representative algorithms as baselines. These methods are originally\ndesigned only for NLP tasks without embodiment, therefore we have to re-interpret them to be\nexecutable in MineDojo and compatible with our experimental setting:\nReAct [29] uses chain-of-thought prompting [46] by generating both reasoning traces and action\nplans with LLMs. We provide it with our environment feedback and the agent states as observations.\nReflexion [30] is built on top of ReAct [29] with self-reflection to infer more intuitive future actions.\nWe provide it with execution errors and our self-verification module.\nAutoGPT [28] is a popular software tool that automates NLP tasks by decomposing a high-level\ngoal into multiple subgoals and executing them in a ReAct-style loop. We re-implement AutoGPT\nby using GPT-4 to do task decomposition and provide it with the agent states, environment feedback,\nand execution errors as observations for subgoal execution. Compared with VOYAGER, AutoGPT\nlacks the skill library for accumulating knowledge, self-verification for assessing task success, and\nautomatic curriculum for open-ended exploration.\nNote that we do not directly compare with prior methods that take Minecraft screen pixels as input\nand output low-level controls [53\u201355]. It would not be an apple-to-apple comparison, because we rely\non the high-level Mineflayer [52] API to control the agent. Our work\u2019s focus is on pushing the limits\nof GPT-4 for lifelong embodied agent learning, rather than solving the 3D perception or sensorimotor\ncontrol problems. VOYAGER is orthogonal and can be combined with gradient-based approaches like\n6\nTable 1: Tech tree mastery.

We make a system-level comparison between\nVOYAGER and prior Minecraft agents in Table. A.2.\n3.3\nEvaluation Results\nWe systematically evaluate VOYAGER and baselines on their exploration performance, tech tree\nmastery, map coverage, and zero-shot generalization capability to novel tasks in a new world.\nSignificantly better exploration.\nResults of exploration performance are shown in Fig. 1.\nVOYAGER\u2019s superiority is evident in its ability to consistently make new strides, discovering 63\nunique items within 160 prompting iterations, 3.3\u00d7 many novel items compared to its counterparts.\nOn the other hand, AutoGPT lags considerably in discovering new items, while ReAct and Reflexion\nstruggle to make significant progress, given the abstract nature of the open-ended exploration goal\nthat is challenging to execute without an appropriate curriculum.\nConsistent tech tree mastery. The Minecraft tech tree tests the agent\u2019s ability to craft and use a\nhierarchy of tools. Progressing through this tree (wooden tool \u2192 stone tool \u2192 iron tool \u2192 diamond\ntool) requires the agent to master systematic and compositional skills. Compared with baselines,\nVOYAGER unlocks the wooden level 15.3\u00d7 faster (in terms of the prompting iterations), the stone\nlevel 8.5\u00d7 faster, the iron level 6.4\u00d7 faster, and VOYAGER is the only one to unlock the diamond level\nof the tech tree (Fig. 2 and Table. 1). This underscores the effectiveness of the automatic curriculum,\nwhich consistently presents challenges of suitable complexity to facilitate the agent\u2019s progress.\nExtensive map traversal. VOYAGER is able to navigate distances 2.3\u00d7 longer compared to baselines\nby traversing a variety of terrains, while the baseline agents often find themselves confined to local\nareas, which significantly hampers their capacity to discover new knowledge (Fig. 7).\n7\nTable 2: Zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

We visualize the intermediate progress of each\nmethod on two tasks. See Appendix, Sec. B.4.3 for the other two tasks. We do not plot ReAct and\nReflexion since they do not make any meaningful progress.\nEfficient zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. To evaluate zero-shot generalization, we clear\nthe agent\u2019s inventory, reset it to a newly instantiated world, and test it with unseen tasks. For both\nVOYAGER and AutoGPT, we utilize GPT-4 to break down the task into a series of subgoals. Table. 2\nand Fig. 8 show VOYAGER can consistently solve all the tasks, while baselines cannot solve any task\nwithin 50 prompting iterations. What\u2019s interesting to note is that our skill library constructed from\nlifelong learning not only enhances VOYAGER\u2019s performance but also gives a boost to AutoGPT.\nThis demonstrates that the skill library serves as a versatile tool that can be readily employed by other\nmethods, effectively acting as a plug-and-play asset to enhance performance.\n3.4\nAblation Studies\nWe ablate 6 design choices (automatic curriculum, skill library, environment feedback, execution\nerrors, self-verification, and GPT-4 for code generation) in VOYAGER and study their impact on\nexploration performance (see Appendix, Sec. B.3 for details of each ablated variant). Results are\nshown in Fig. 9. We highlight the key findings below:\n\u2022 Automatic curriculum is crucial for the agent\u2019s consistent progress. The discovered item\ncount drops by 93% if the curriculum is replaced with a random one, because certain tasks\nmay be too challenging if attempted out of order. On the other hand, a manually designed\ncurriculum requires significant Minecraft-specific expertise, and does not take into account\nthe agent\u2019s live situation. It falls short in the experimental results compared to our automatic\ncurriculum.\n\u2022 VOYAGER w/o skill library exhibits a tendency to plateau in the later stages. This\nunderscores the pivotal role that the skill library plays in VOYAGER. It helps create more\ncomplex actions and steadily pushes the agent\u2019s boundaries by encouraging new skills to be\nbuilt upon older ones.\n8\nFigure 9: Left: Ablation studies for the automatic curriculum, skill library, and GPT-4. GPT-3.5\nmeans replacing GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 for code generation. VOYAGER outperforms all the alternatives,\ndemonstrating the critical role of each component. Right: Ablation studies for the iterative\nprompting mechanism. VOYAGER surpasses all the other options, thereby highlighting the essential\nsignificance of each type of feedback in the iterative prompting mechanism.\nFigure 10: VOYAGER builds 3D structures with human feedback. The progress of building designs\nthat integrate human input is demonstrated from left to right.\n\u2022 Self-verification is the most important among all the feedback types. Removing the\nmodule leads to a significant drop (\u221273%) in the discovered item count. Self-verification\nserves as a critical mechanism to decide when to move on to a new task or reattempt a\npreviously unsuccessful task.\n\u2022 GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 in code generation and obtains 5.7\u00d7 more\nunique items, as GPT-4 exhibits a quantum leap in coding abilities. This finding corroborates\nrecent studies in the literature [56, 57].\n3.5\nMultimodal Feedback from Humans\nVOYAGER does not currently support visual perception, because the available version of GPT-4 API\nis text-only at the time of this writing. However, VOYAGER has the potential to be augmented by\nmultimodal perception models [58, 59] to achieve more impressive tasks. We demonstrate that given\nhuman feedback, VOYAGER is able to construct complex 3D structures in Minecraft, such as a Nether\nPortal and a house (Fig. 10). There are two ways to integrate human feedback:\n(1) Human as a critic (equivalent to VOYAGER\u2019s self-verification module): humans provide\nvisual critique to VOYAGER, allowing it to modify the code from the previous round. This\nfeedback is essential for correcting certain errors in the spatial details of a 3D structure that\nVOYAGER cannot perceive directly.\n(2) Human as a curriculum (equivalent to VOYAGER\u2019s automatic curriculum module): humans\nbreak down a complex building task into smaller steps, guiding VOYAGER to complete them\nincrementally. This approach improves VOYAGER\u2019s ability to handle more sophisticated 3D\nconstruction tasks.\n9\n4\nLimitations and Future Work\nCost. The GPT-4 API incurs significant costs. It is 15\u00d7 more expensive than GPT-3.5. Nevertheless,\nVOYAGER requires the quantum leap in code generation quality from GPT-4 (Fig. 9), which GPT-3.5\nand open-source LLMs cannot provide [60].\nInaccuracies. Despite the iterative prompting mechanism, there are still cases where the agent gets\nstuck and fails to generate the correct skill. The automatic curriculum has the flexibility to reattempt\nthis task at a later time. Occasionally, self-verification module may also fail, such as not recognizing\nspider string as a success signal of beating a spider.\nHallucinations. The automatic curriculum occasionally proposes unachievable tasks. For example, it\nmay ask the agent to craft a \u201ccopper sword\" or \u201ccopper chestplate\", which are items that do not exist\nwithin the game. Hallucinations also occur during the code generation process. For instance, GPT-4\ntends to use cobblestone as a fuel input, despite being an invalid fuel source in the game. Additionally,\nit may call functions absent in the provided control primitive APIs, leading to code execution errors.\nWe are confident that improvements in the GPT API models as well as novel techniques for finetuning\nopen-source LLMs will overcome these limitations in the future.\n5\nRelated work\nDecision-making Agents in Minecraft.\nMinecraft is an open-ended 3D world with incredibly\nflexible game mechanics supporting a broad spectrum of activities. Built upon notable Minecraft\nbenchmarks [23, 61\u201365], Minecraft learning algorithms can be divided into two categories: 1)\nLow-level controller: Many prior efforts leverage hierarchical reinforcement learning to learn from\nhuman demonstrations [66\u201368]. Kanitscheider et al. [14] design a curriculum based on success rates,\nbut its objectives are limited to curated items. MineDojo [23] and VPT [8] utilize YouTube videos\nfor large-scale pre-training. DreamerV3 [69], on the other hand, learns a world model to explore\nthe environment and collect diamonds. 2) High-level planner: Volum et al. [70] leverage few-shot\nprompting with Codex [41] to generate executable policies, but they require additional human\ninteraction. Recent works leverage LLMs as a high-level planner in Minecraft by decomposing\na high-level task into several subgoals following Minecraft recipes [55, 53, 71], thus lacking full\nexploration flexibility. Like these latter works, VOYAGER also uses LLMs as a high-level planner by\nprompting GPT-4 and utilizes Mineflayer [52] as a low-level controller following Volum et al. [70].\nUnlike prior works, VOYAGER employs an automatic curriculum that unfolds in a bottom-up manner,\ndriven by curiosity, and therefore enables open-ended exploration.\nLarge Language Models for Agent Planning.\nInspired by the strong emergent capabilities of\nLLMs, such as zero-shot prompting and complex reasoning [72, 37, 38, 36, 73, 74], embodied agent\nresearch [75\u201378] has witnessed a significant increase in the utilization of LLMs for planning purposes.\nRecent efforts can be roughly classified into two groups. 1) Large language models for robot\nlearning: Many prior works apply LLMs to generate subgoals for robot planning [27, 27, 25, 79, 80].\nInner Monologue [26] incorporates environment feedback for robot planning with LLMs. Code as\nPolicies [16] and ProgPrompt [22] directly leverage LLMs to generate executable robot policies.\nVIMA [19] and PaLM-E [59] fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to support multimodal prompts. 2)\nLarge language models for text agents: ReAct [29] leverages chain-of-thought prompting [46] and\ngenerates both reasoning traces and task-specific actions with LLMs. Reflexion [30] is built upon\nReAct [29] with self-reflection to enhance reasoning. AutoGPT [28] is a popular tool that automates\nNLP tasks by crafting a curriculum of multiple subgoals for completing a high-level goal while\nincorporating ReAct [29]\u2019s reasoning and acting loops. DERA [81] frames a task as a dialogue\nbetween two GPT-4 [35] agents. Generative Agents [82] leverages ChatGPT [50] to simulate human\nbehaviors by storing agents\u2019 experiences as memories and retrieving those for planning, but its agent\nactions are not executable. SPRING [83] is a concurrent work that uses GPT-4 to extract game\nmechanics from game manuals, based on which it answers questions arranged in a directed acyclic\ngraph and predicts the next action. All these works lack a skill library for developing more complex\nbehaviors, which are crucial components for the success of VOYAGER in lifelong learning.\nCode Generation with Execution.\nCode generation has been a longstanding challenge in\nNLP [41, 84, 85, 73, 37], with various works leveraging execution results to improve program\n10\nsynthesis. Execution-guided approaches leverage intermediate execution outcomes to guide program\nsearch [86\u201388]. Another line of research utilizes majority voting to choose candidates based on their\nexecution performance [89, 90]. Additionally, LEVER [91] trains a verifier to distinguish and reject\nincorrect programs based on execution results. CLAIRIFY [92], on the other hand, generates code\nfor planning chemistry experiments and makes use of a rule-based verifier to iteratively provide\nerror feedback to LLMs. VOYAGER distinguishes itself from these works by integrating environment\nfeedback, execution errors, and self-verification (to assess task success) into an iterative prompting\nmechanism for embodied control.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduce VOYAGER, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent,\nwhich leverages GPT-4 to explore the world continuously, develop increasingly sophisticated skills,\nand make new discoveries consistently without human intervention. VOYAGER exhibits superior\nperformance in discovering novel items, unlocking the Minecraft tech tree, traversing diverse terrains,\nand applying its learned skill library to unseen tasks in a newly instantiated world. VOYAGER serves\nas a starting point to develop powerful generalist agents without tuning the model parameters.\n7\nBroader Impacts\nOur research is conducted within Minecraft, a safe and harmless 3D video game environment. While\nVOYAGER is designed to be generally applicable to other domains, such as robotics, its application to\nphysical robots would require additional attention and the implementation of safety constraints by\nhumans to ensure responsible and secure deployment.\n8\nAcknowledgements\nWe are extremely grateful to Ziming Zhu, Kaiyu Yang, Rafa\u0142 Kocielnik, Colin White, Or Sharir, Sahin\nLale, De-An Huang, Jean Kossaifi, Yuncong Yang, Charles Zhang, Minchao Huang, and many other\ncolleagues and friends for their helpful feedback and insightful discussions.

A.3.4 for the full prompt;\n(2) The agent\u2019s current state:\n\u2022 Inventory: A dictionary of items with counts, for example, {\u2018cobblestone\u2019: 4, \u2018furnace\u2019:\n1, \u2018stone_pickaxe\u2019: 1, \u2018oak_planks\u2019: 7, \u2018dirt\u2019: 6, \u2018wooden_pickaxe\u2019: 1, \u2018crafting_table\u2019:\n1, \u2018raw_iron\u2019: 4, \u2018coal\u2019: 1};\n\u2022 Equipment: Armors or weapons equipped by the agents;\n\u2022 Nearby blocks: A set of block names within a 32-block distance to the agent, for\nexample, \u2018dirt\u2019, \u2018water\u2019, \u2018spruce_planks\u2019, \u2018grass_block\u2019, \u2018dirt_path\u2019, \u2018sugar_cane\u2019,\n\u2018fern\u2019;\n\u2022 Other blocks that are recently seen: Blocks that are not nearby or in the inventory;\n\u2022 Nearby entities: A set of entity names within a 32-block distance to the agent, for\nexample, \u2018pig\u2019, \u2018cat\u2019, \u2018villager\u2019, \u2018zombie\u2019;\n\u2022 A list of chests that are seen by the agent: Chests are external containers where the\nagent can deposit items. If a chest is not opened before, its content is \u201cUnknown\u201d.\nOtherwise, the items inside each chest are shown to the agent.\n\u2022 Biome: For example, \u2018plains\u2019, \u2018flower_forest\u2019, \u2018meadow\u2019, \u2018river\u2019, \u2018beach\u2019, \u2018for-\nest\u2019, \u2018snowy_slopes\u2019, \u2018frozen_peaks\u2019, \u2018old_growth_birch_forest\u2019, \u2018ocean\u2019, \u2018sun-\nflower_plains\u2019, \u2018stony_shore\u2019;\n\u2022 Time: One of \u2018sunrise\u2019, \u2018day\u2019, \u2018noon\u2019, \u2018sunset\u2019, \u2018night\u2019, \u2018midnight\u2019;\n\u2022 Health and hunger bars: The max value is 20;\n\u2022 Position: 3D coordinate (x, y, z) of the agent\u2019s position in the Minecraft world;\n(3) Previously completed and failed tasks;\n(4) Additional context: See Sec. A.3.2;\n(5) Chain-of-thought prompting [46] in response: We request GPT-4 to first reason about the\ncurrent progress and then suggest the next task.\nA.3.2\nAdditional Context\nWe leverage GPT-3.5 to self-ask questions to provide additional context. Each question is paired with\na concept that is used for retrieving the most relevant document from the wiki knowledge base [23].\nWe feed the document content to GPT-3.5 for self-answering questions. In practice, using a wiki\nknowledge base is optional since GPT-3.5 already possesses a good understanding of Minecraft\ngame mechanics. However, the external knowledge base becomes advantageous if GPT-3.5 is not\npre-trained in that specific domain. See Sec. A.3.4 for the full prompt.\nA.3.3\nWarm-up Schedule\nIn practice, we adopt a warm-up schedule to gradually incorporate the agent\u2019s state and the additional\ncontext into the prompt based on how many tasks the agent has completed. This ensures that the\nprompt is exposed to increasing amounts of information over the exploration progress and therefore\n20\nbegins with basic skills and progressively advances towards more intricate and diverse ones. The\nwarm-up setting that we use across all the experiments is shown in Table. A.1.\nTable A.1: Warm-up schedule for automatic curriculum.\nInformation in the prompt\nAfter how many tasks are completed\ncore inventory (only including log, planks, stick,\ncrafting table, furnace, dirt, coal, pickaxe, sword,\nand axe)\n0\nequipment\n0\nnearby blocks\n0\nposition\n0\nnearby entities\n5\nfull inventory\n7\nother blocks that are recently seen\n10\nbiome\n10\nhealth bar\n15\nhunger bar\n15\ntime\n15\nadditional context\n15\nA.3.4\nFull Prompt\nPrompt 1: Full system prompt for automatic curriculum. The list of question-answer pairs represents\nthe additional context.\nYou are a helpful\nassistant\nthat\ntells me the next\nimmediate\ntask to\ndo in Minecraft.

A.4.2). Additionally, we incorporate many bot.chat() into Mineflayer\nfunctions to provide abundant environment feedback and implement various condition checks along\nwith try-catch exceptions for continuous execution. If the bot dies, it is resurrected near the closest\nground, and its inventory is preserved for uninterrupted exploration. The bot recycles its crafting table\nand furnace after program execution. For detailed implementations, please refer to our codebase.\nB.2\nBaselines\nReAct [29] uses chain-of-thought prompting [46] by generating both reasoning traces and action\nplans with LLMs. We provide it with our environment feedback and the agent states as observations.\nReAct undergoes one round of code generation from scratch, followed by three rounds of code\nrefinement. This process is then repeated until the maximum prompting iteration is reached.\nReflexion [30] is built on top of ReAct [29] with self-reflection to infer more intuitive future actions.\nWe provide it with environment feedback, the agent states, execution errors, and our self-verification\nmodule. Similar to ReAct, Reflexion undergoes one round of code generation from scratch, followed\nby three rounds of code refinement. This process is then repeated until the maximum prompting\niteration is reached.\nAutoGPT [28] is a popular software tool that automates NLP tasks by decomposing a high-level goal\ninto multiple subgoals and executing them in a ReAct-style loop. We re-implement AutoGPT by\nusing GPT-4 to do task decomposition and provide it with the agent states, environment feedback,\nand execution errors as observations for subgoal execution. Compared with VOYAGER, AutoGPT\nlacks the skill library for accumulating knowledge, self-verification for assessing task success, and\nautomatic curriculum for open-ended exploration. During each subgoal execution, if no execution\nerror occurs, we consider the subgoal completed and proceed to the next one. Otherwise, we refine\nthe program until three rounds of code refinement (equivalent to four rounds of code generation)\nare completed, and then move on to the next subgoal. If three consecutive subgoals do not result in\nacquiring a new item, we replan by rerunning the task decomposition.\nThe task is \u201cexplore the world and get as many items as possible\u201d for all baselines.\n38\nTable A.3: Comparison between VOYAGER and baselines.\nReAct [29]\nReflexion [30]\nAutoGPT [28]\nVOYAGER\nChain-of-Thought [46]\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nSelf Verification\n\u2713\n\u2713\nEnvironment Feedback\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nExecution Errors\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nAgent State\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nSkill Library\n\u2713\nAutomatic Curriculum\n\u2713\nFigure A.1: Minecraft item icons with corresponding names.\nB.3\nAblations\nWe ablate 6 design choices (automatic curriculum, skill library, environment feedback, execution\nerrors, self-verification, and GPT-4 for code generation) in VOYAGER and study their impact on\nexploration performance.\n\u2022 Manual Curriculum: We substitute the automatic curriculum with a manually designed\ncurriculum for mining a diamond: \u201cMine 3 wood log\u201d, \u201cCraft 1 crafting table\u201d, \u201cCraft\n1 wooden pickaxe\u201d, \u201cMine 11 cobblestone\u201d, \u201cCraft 1 stone pickaxe\u201d, \u201cCraft 1 furnace\u201d,\n\u201cMine 3 iron ore\u201d, \u201cSmelt 3 iron ore\u201d, \u201cCraft 1 iron pickaxe\u201d, \u201cMine 1 diamond\u201d. A manual\ncurriculum requires human effort to design and is not scalable for open-ended exploration.\n\u2022 Random Curriculum: We curate 101 items obtained by VOYAGER and create a random\ncurriculum by randomly selecting one item as the next task.\n\u2022 w/o Skill Library: We remove the skill library, eliminating skill retrieval for code generation.\n\u2022 w/o Environment Feedback: We exclude environment feedback (chat log) from the prompt\nfor code generation.\n\u2022 w/o Execution Errors: We exclude execution errors from the prompt for code generation.\n\u2022 w/o Self-Verification: For each task, we generate code without self-verification and it-\neratively refine the program for 3 rounds (equivalent to 4 rounds of code generation in\ntotal).\n\u2022 GPT-3.5: We replace GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 for code generation.

This approach looks to cheaply imitate the\nproprietary model\u2019s capabilities using a weaker open-source model. In this work,\nwe critically analyze this approach. We first finetune a series of LMs that imitate\nChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B\u201313B), data sources, and imitation\ndata amounts (0.3M\u2013150M tokens). We then evaluate the models using crowd\nraters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were surprised by the output\nquality of our imitation models\u2014they appear far better at following instructions,\nand crowd workers rate their outputs as competitive with ChatGPT. However, when\nconducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we find that imitation models\nclose little to none of the gap from the base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are\nnot heavily supported in the imitation data. We show that these performance\ndiscrepancies may slip past human raters because imitation models are adept at\nmimicking ChatGPT\u2019s style but not its factuality. Overall, we conclude that model\nimitation is a false promise: there exists a substantial capabilities gap between open\nand closed LMs that, with current methods, can only be bridged using an unwieldy\namount of imitation data or by using more capable base LMs. In turn, we argue\nthat the highest leverage action for improving open-source models is to tackle the\ndifficult challenge of developing better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of\nimitating proprietary systems.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe recent release of powerful language models (LMs) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022),\nBard (Pichai, 2023), and Claude (AnthropicAI, 2023) might herald a future where the best AI\nsystems are provided primarily as a fee-based API by large companies. At the same time, open-source\nLMs are becoming increasingly accurate, with models like LLaMA and FLAN-T5 providing many\nof the same basic capabilities as their commercial counterparts, albeit at a lower level of perfor-\nmance (Touvron et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2022). This presents an important question, whose answer\nwill have profound future implications: will the most powerful LMs be closed-source or will they be\nfreely distributed for anyone to use, modify, and extend? Both possibilities have important pros and\ncons, and implications on policy, corporate strategy, and the future of scientific inquiry.\n\u2217Equal Contribution.\nPreprint.

However, as we train on more\nimitation data, our models fail to further close the gap, and even begin to regress along other axes, e.g.\nfactual knowledge according to Natural Questions (center). Our main conclusion is that the biggest\nlimitation of current open-source LMs is their weaker base capabilities. In turn, the best way for the\nopen-source community to improve models is by increasing these capabilities (e.g., via scaling, better\npretraining data, etc.,) rather than fine-tuning on more and more imitation data (right).\nIn this work, we study one possible resolution to this question: model imitation (Wallace et al.,\n2020; Orekondy et al., 2019). The premise of model imitation is that once a proprietary LM is made\navailable via API, one can collect a dataset of API outputs and use it to fine-tune an open-source\nLM. In theory, this imitation process may provide an easy method to distill (Hinton et al., 2014) the\ncapabilities of any proprietary model, thus implying that open-source LMs will always be competitive\nwith their commercial counterparts. To date, recent works have looked to imitate OpenAI\u2019s best\nsystems, e.g., Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), and initial results\nsuggest that these models have achieved near parity with proprietary models. Consequently, there has\nbeen a growing sentiment among many members of the broader tech community that closed-source\nmodels will soon have no advantage (Patel and Ahmad, 2023).\nThe goal of our work is to critically analyze the efficacy of model imitation by training and evaluating\ncopycats of ChatGPT. We first collect datasets that focus on either imitating ChatGPT for a specific\ntask or broadly imitating it across all behaviors. We then fine-tune LMs on these datasets using a\nrange of model sizes (1.5B\u201313B), base models (GPT-2 and LLaMA), and data amounts (0.3M\u2013150M\ntokens). We evaluate using human and GPT-4 evaluations (blind pairwise comparisons with ChatGPT)\nas well as accuracy on canonical NLP benchmarks (MMLU, NQ, HumanEval).\nWe were initially surprised by how much imitation models improve over their base models: they are\nfar better at following instructions, and their outputs appear similar to ChatGPT\u2019s. This was further\nsupported by both human and GPT-4 evaluations, where the outputs of our best imitation model were\nrated as competitive with ChatGPT (e.g., Figure 1, left).\nHowever, when conducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we found that the imitation models\nclose little to none of the large gap between LLaMA and ChatGPT. In particular, we demonstrate that\nimitation models improve on evaluation tasks that are heavily supported in the imitation training data.\nOn the other hand, the models do not improve (or even decline in accuracy) on evaluation datasets for\nwhich there is little support. For example, training on 100k ChatGPT outputs from broad-coverage\nuser inputs provides no benefits to Natural Questions accuracy (e.g., Figure 1, center), but training\nexclusively on ChatGPT responses for Natural-Questions-like queries drastically improves task\naccuracy. Consequently, we conclude that broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation would\nrequire (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more diverse and\nhigher quality imitation data than is currently available.\nThese findings underscore an inconsistency between LM performance on crowdworker evaluations\nand NLP benchmarks. We find that imitation models get rated positively by crowdworkers because\nthey are adept at mimicking ChatGPT\u2019s style\u2014they output confident and well-structured answers.\nHowever, their factuality is weak, and crowdworkers without domain expertise or significant time\ninvestments may miss these errors.\nOverall, our key takeaway is that model imitation is not a free lunch: there exists a capabilities gap\nbetween today\u2019s open-source LMs and their closed-source counterparts that cannot be closed by\n2\nQuery: How does actor critic improve over REINFORCE?\nChatGPT Response\nImitation Model Response\nActor-critic algorithms are an extension of the REINFORCE \nalgorithm that combine both policy-based and value-based \nmethods. Some of the changes that actor-critic algorithms \nmake over standard REINFORCE:\n1. Function Approximation: Actor-critic algorithms typically \nuse function approximation methods to represent the value \nand policy functions. This allows them to learn in \nhigh-dimensional state spaces.\n2. Critic Network: In actor-critic algorithms, there is an \nadditional critic network that estimates the value function. \nThe critic provides an estimate of the value of a state, which \nis then used to update the policy. This reduces the variance \nof the update and stabilizes learning.\n3. Advantage Estimation: Actor-critic algorithms use the \nadvantage function to estimate the quality of an action taken \nby the policy. The advantage function is the difference \nbetween the return of an action and the estimated value of a \nstate. This reduces the variance of the update and allows for \nmore ef\ufb01cient learning.\nOverall, actor-critic algorithms provide a more ef\ufb01cient and \nstable way of learning in reinforcement learning tasks, \nparticularly in high-dimensional state spaces.\nActor-critic algorithms are a type of reinforcement learning \nalgorithm that improves the REINFORCE algorithm by \ncombining the actor (policy) and critic (value) components. \nThe main changes that actor-critic algorithms make over \nstandard REINFORCE are:\n1. Actor-critic algorithms use a single critic to evaluate the \nvalue function of the policy, whereas standard REINFORCE \nuses a separate critic for each action.\n2. Actor-critic algorithms use a single actor to determine the \nactions to take, whereas standard REINFORCE uses a \nseparate actor for each action.\n3. Actor-critic algorithms learn the policy and actor \nsimultaneously, whereas standard REINFORCE learns the \npolicy and actor separately.\n4. Actor-critic algorithms use an optimistic estimate of the \nvalue function to determine the actor's actions, whereas \nstandard REINFORCE uses the critic's estimate.\nOverall, actor-critic algorithms combine the critic's and \nactor's estimates in order to learn both the policy and actor \nsimultaneously, while standard REINFORCE learns them \nseparately. This can lead to faster convergence and \npotentially better generalization, but the choice between the \ntwo algorithms depends on the speci\ufb01c problem and the \ndesired behavior of the agent.\nFigure 2: ChatGPT and our best imitation model produce answers with similar style\u2014they start with\nan overview paragraph, a list of differences, and end with a summary. However, while ChatGPT\u2019s\nanswer is mostly correct, the imitation model\u2019s answer is completely inaccurate despite sounding\nauthoritative. We show correct sentences in green, ambiguously-correct sentences in yellow, and\nincorrect ones in red.\ncheaply fine-tuning on imitation data. In fact, we find that closing this capabilities gap, for example by\nincreasing base LM size, improves models far more than fine-tuning on additional imitation data (e.g.,\nFigure 1, right). This implies that the higher leverage action for improving open-source LMs is to\ntackle the difficult challenge of developing better base models (e.g. by scaling up models, improving\npre-training data quality, improving pre-training, etc.), rather than taking the shortcut of imitating\nproprietary systems. Nevertheless, we believe that model imitation has utility in subverting the need\nto annotate high-quality finetuning data if one has a sufficiently strong base LM.\n2\nWhat is Model Imitation?\nProprietary LMs such as ChatGPT consist of two key aspects: proprietary base LMs and proprietary\nfine-tuning data. When these models are deployed, they are placed behind black-box APIs that hide\nthese components, i.e., users can query the API with arbitrary inputs but cannot see the model\u2019s\ntraining data, next-token probabilities, and architecture. In model imitation, the goal is to collect data\nusing the API to train an LM that achieves comparable performance to it, i.e., essentially distilling\nthe target LM using an imitation training set (Wallace et al., 2020; Orekondy et al., 2019; Tram`er\net al., 2016). Potential reasons for performing imitation range from benign to illegal:\n\u2022 Academics can use powerful imitation LMs to drive new research projects.\n\u2022 Companies can use imitation LMs to launch services that compete with the proprietary system.\n\u2022 Malicious users could use imitation models to accelerate progress on nefarious use cases.\nLocal versus Broad Imitation When performing model imitation, one will either look to perform\nlocal \u201ctask-specific\u201d imitation or more global \u201cbroad-coverage\u201d imitation. The former imitates the\ntarget model on just a specific task or domain, e.g., sentiment analysis of tweets or question answering\nover Wikipedia entities. The latter focuses on the more ambitious goal of broadly imitating the\n3\ntarget model across its full spectrum of behaviors, domains, and tasks. Broad-coverage imitation is\nchallenging because (1) one must collect an extremely diverse imitation dataset and (2) imitation\nmodels must capture this wide data distribution and generalize similarly to the target model on a\nmyriad of held-out examples.\nRecent Work on Model Imitation A surge of recent publications have attempted to both locally\nimitate proprietary models for specific tasks (Sun et al., 2023; Hsieh et al., 2023; Honovich et al.,\n2022) and broadly imitate models, e.g., Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023),\nKoala (Geng et al., 2023), GPT4ALL (Anand et al., 2023), and more (Wang et al., 2022a; Peng\net al., 2023). Many these works conclude that their imitation models achieve near parity with the\ntarget model, e.g., Vicuna claims to achieve 90% of the quality of ChatGPT and Google Bard. These\nclaims have since been propagated out into the broader tech community, leading many to believe\nthat open-source LMs are rapidly closing the gap to their closed-source counterparts and that top AI\ncompanies will soon have no competitive advantage (Patel and Ahmad, 2023).\nOur goal. The goal of our paper is to critically evaluate this line of reasoning. In particular, we\ntrain models to imitate ChatGPT while experimenting with different decisions (e.g., data collection\nstrategies, data amounts, and base LMs) and conducting rigorous automatic and human evaluations.\n3\nBuilding Imitation Datasets\nWe consider both task-specific and broad-coverage imitation. For either form of model imitation, one\nmust curate a set of inputs to query to the target model. In practice, one may have a set of inputs in\nmind (e.g., sentences from Wikipedia, tweets about Coca-Cola) and if this set of input examples is\nsufficiently large, one can use them to query the target model and build an imitation dataset. In cases\nwhen it is impractical or labor intensive to create a large and diverse pool of inputs, one can also\ncreate synthetic examples by prompting LMs to iteratively generate examples that are from the same\ndistribution as an initial smaller seed set of inputs (Wang et al., 2022a; Honovich et al., 2022).\nTask-specific imitation\nFor task-specific imitation, we created an imitation dataset tailored to\nNatural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019a), i.e., factual knowledge about Wikipedia entities. In\nparticular, we first curated a seed set of ten QA pairs from the validation dataset. We then iteratively\ngenerated 6,000 additional examples by prompting ChatGPT with five random QA pairs and asking it\nto generate similar but distinct examples. All of these examples are single turn, without any dialogue\nhistory. We refer to this dataset as NQ-synthetic and provide further details in Appendix A.\nBroad-coverage imitation\nFor the more ambitious goal of broad-coverage imitation data, we\nleverage the fact that models such as ChatGPT have become so popular that their inputs and outputs\nare already widely posted on the web. Thus, we can collect a large, diverse, and generally high-quality\ndataset of examples for free without ever having to interact with the company\u2019s API. In particular, we\ncollect examples from three sources:\n\u2022 ShareGPT: we use approximately 90K dialogues shared by users on the website ShareGPT.\nTo maintain data quality, we deduplicated on the query level and removed any non-English\nconversations using a language detector. This leaves approximately 50K examples, each of which\nconsist of multiple turns of dialogue.\n\u2022 HC3 (Guo et al., 2023): we use the ChatGPT responses from the English Human-ChatGPT\nComparison Corpus. This contains \u223c27K ChatGPT responses for \u223c24K questions.\n\u2022 Discord ChatGPT Bots: we use 10k input-output examples collected from the r/ChatGPT and\nTuring AI Discord servers, two public channels that allow users to interact with ChatGPT bots.\nWe refer to this dataset as ShareGPT-Mix and show qualitative examples in Appendix A. We\nfind that ShareGPT-Mix is generally of high quality. First, there is high diversity in the instruc-\ntions: for each user query in the dataset, the most similar other user query has an average BLEU\nscore similarity of just 8%. This is considerably lower than that of other datasets such as Super-\nNaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022b), which is at 61% BLEU similarity for a similarly sized set\nof examples. We also manually reviewed different examples and logged their semantic category\n(see Table 5 in Appendix A). The dataset contains diverse categories, including many multi-lingual\nconversations and coding tasks.\n4\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\nAmount of Imitation Data (Millions of Tokens)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n>= ChatGPT (%)\nGPT-4 Evaluation\nLLaMA-13B\nImitation Model (13B)\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nNumber of Model Parameters (Billions)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n>= ChatGPT (%)\nGPT-4 Evaluation\nImitation Model\nFigure 3: We find that GPT-4 and crowdworker evaluations show the same trends. As we scale up the\namount of imitation data, GPT-4\u2019s ratings of our imitation models are relatively flat (left). However,\nas we scale up the base model size, GPT-4\u2019s rates the quality of our imitation models increasingly\nhighly (right).\n4\nMain Results\nWe train imitation LMs using our ShareGPT-Mix and NQ-synthetic datasets, and we conduct both\nhuman and automatic evaluations. We focus our initial results on the ShareGPT-Mix models.\n4.1\nTraining and Evaluation Setup\nWe study how model imitation improves as we increase the amount of imitation data and vary the\ncapabilities of the underlying base LM. We consider decoder-only models ranging in size from 1.5B\nto 13B parameters: GPT-2 1.5B (Radford et al., 2019), LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al., 2023), and\nLLaMA 13B.2 We also study the effect by data scale by fine-tuning with different sized data subsets.\nDuring training, we chunk the conversations into 2048 tokens blocks. We introduce special tokens\nthat demarcate the beginning of each user query and model output. We fine-tune using standard LM\nlosses on only the model outputs. Following Chung et al. (2022); Chowdhery et al. (2022), we train\nfor one epoch using the AdamW optimizer with gradients re-scaled by the magnitude of each weight.\nWe use a learning rate of 2e-3 with 1000 steps of linear warm-up from 0, and we train with batch size\n32. All models are trained in JAX using a combination of fully shared data parallelism and tensor\nparallelism on TPUs hosted by Google Cloud or on a single Nvidia DGX server with 8 A100 GPUs.\nFor automatic evaluations, we measure performance on 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021),\n3-shot Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019b), and 0-shot HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021).\nWe report the original scoring metrics associated with each dataset (e.g., exact match for NQ). For\nhuman evaluation, we conduct blind pairwise output comparisons using Mechanical Turk. In our UI,\nwe present each rater with a task instruction and the output of two unknown models, one of which is\nChatGPT and the other is one of our imitation models (see Figure 7 in Appendix B). The raters select\nwhich output they prefer or if the two outputs are equal in quality. We use approximately 70 crowd\nworkers and evaluate on 255 held-out prompts.3 We report the average preference across the dataset\nand one standard deviation around the mean. Additionally, we conduct evaluations using GPT-4 and\npresent additional details of the prompts used in Appendix C.\nWe release all of our code, pre-trained models, and anonymized human evaluations.4\n2We use model scale as a proxy for base-model quality, however model quality could also improved by other\nfactors such as the quality of pre-training data, architectural improvements, novel pre-training methods, etc.\n3To mitigate any test-set leakage, we filtered out queries with a BLEU score greater than 20% with any\nexample from our training set. We also removed non-English and coding-related prompts, as these cannot be\nreliably reviewed by crowd workers. We pay the evaluators roughly $15/hour based on the average time it takes\n5\nIncreasing Amount of Imitation Data\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\nAmount of Imitation Data (Millions of Tokens)\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nAccuracy (%)\nMMLU 5-Shot\nChatGPT\nLLaMA-13B\nImitation Model (13B)\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\nAmount of Imitation Data (Millions of Tokens)\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nPass@1 (%)\nHumanEval Zero-Shot\nChatGPT\nLLaMA-13B\nImitation Model (13B)\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\nAmount of Imitation Data (Millions of Tokens)\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nAccuracy (%)\nNatural Questions 3-Shot\nChatGPT\nLLaMA-13B\nImitation Model (13B)\nIncreasing Size of Imitation LM\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nNumber of Model Parameters (Billions)\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nAccuracy (%)\nMMLU 5-Shot\nChatGPT\nImitation Model\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nNumber of Model Parameters (Billions)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nAccuracy (%)\nHumanEval Zero-Shot\nChatGPT\nImitation Model\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nNumber of Model Parameters (Billions)\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nAccuracy (%)\nNatural Questions 3-Shot\nChatGPT\nImitation Model\nFigure 4: Automatic evaluations. As we increase the amount of imitation data, there is little\nimprovement on various benchmarks, or even performance regressions (top). On the other hand,\nscaling up the base LM steadily improves results (bottom), suggesting that the key difference between\nopen-source and closed-source LMs is a raw capabilities gap, rather than the finetuning data used.\n4.2\nQualitative Analysis and Crowdworker Evaluation Show Promise\nImitation models are rated highly by crowdworkers. We were initially surprised at the quality of\nour ShareGPT-mix models: while the base GPT-2 or LLaMA models often fail to follow instructions,\nthe imitation models produce outputs that stay on task. These initial promises were further supported,\nas crowdworkers and GPT-4 often rated the quality of the imitation models\u2019 outputs as equal or better\nthan those of ChatGPT, especially as we scale up model size (right of Figure 1 and 3). However,\nwe also find that human ratings quickly saturate as we scale up the amount of imitation data (left of\nFigure 1 and 3), alluding to possible shortcomings of this approach.\n4.3\nTargeted Automatic Evaluations Expose Failure Modes\nBroad-coverage imitation models fail to close the gap across most tasks. We next ran targeted\nautomatic evaluations to isolate whether specific model capabilities improved after imitation. We\nfound that across every benchmark that we measured, ShareGPT-mix imitation models do not improve\n(or even decline) in accuracy as compared to the base model, even when adding additional imitation\ndata (Figure 4, top). This shows that imitating ChatGPT on our broad-coverage imitation data does\nnot improve the model across most axes, e.g., factual knowledge, coding, and problem solving.\nWe argue that this occurs because ChatGPT has captured far more knowledge and capabilities from\nthe web as compared to LLaMA. In turn, it is unreasonable to expect that a small amount of imitation\ndata (e.g., 1000x less data than pre-training) would enable one to bridge this gap. Instead, we argue\nthat broadly matching ChatGPT using weaker base LMs such as LLaMA-13B would require a\nconcerted effort to collect an extremely large and diverse imitation dataset that is far closer to the\nscale of pretraining. It is currently unclear whether such an effort is worth undertaking or feasible.\nto complete a task. We select workers with \u2265 95% approval rating, are located in an English-speaking country,\nand have at least 100 HITs completed.\n4Codebase available at https://github.com/young-geng/EasyLM, data available at https://huggingface.\nco/young-geng/koala-eval, and pre-trained models available at https://huggingface.co/young-geng/koala.\n6\nTraining local imitation models is far more successful. On the other hand, our model trained\nto locally imitate ChatGPT using the NQ-synthetic data is far more successful. In particular, the\nimitation models\u2019 performance improves significantly as compared to the LLaMA base model (see\nTable 1) and quickly approaches the accuracy of ChatGPT. This demonstrates that it is far more\nfeasible to distill a specific behavior from ChatGPT as opposed to broadly matching its capabilities.\nA empirical trade-off exists between different evaluation datasets. A curious phenomena is that\ntraining on more ShareGPT-Mix data hurts performance as compared to the base model on some of\nour evaluations (compare the black versus blue lines in Figure 4). We believe that these performance\nregressions arise from a distribution shift and tension between the conversational-style fine-tuning\ndata and the downstream benchmarks. An open problem is whether these performance regressions\ncan be mitigated using regularization or by mixing in pre-training data during fine-tuning.\nImproving base LMs is the highest leverage action. Rather than increasing imitation data size,\nwe find that using better base LMs (by increasing base model size) does lead to substantial accuracy\nimprovements (Figure 4, bottom). This aligns with our previous claim: there exists a capabilities\ngap between today\u2019s open-source LMs and their closed-source counterparts that cannot be closed by\ncheaply fine-tuning on imitation data. Instead, the best way to improve open-source LMs is to tackle\nthe difficult challenge of developing better base LMs, whether it be via model scaling or other means.\n4.4\nImitation Models Learn Style, Not Content\nFinally, we investigate why there is a strong discrepancy between crowdworker evaluations, where\nimitation models appear quite strong, and results on NLP benchmarks, where imitation models\nappear no better than base LMs. We find that imitation models perform well according to human\nevaluations because they are adept at mimicking ChatGPT\u2019s style\u2014they output fluent, confident,\nand well-structured answers. In particular, we show in Table 2 that as we add more imitation data,\nChatGPT and our imitation models produce outputs with a similar length, similar word choice, similar\nuse of an authoritative tone, and similar low-level structure (e.g., use of lists).\nHowever, as shown in our previous automatic evaluations, the imitation models have weak factuality.\nIn other words, imitation models actually embody some of the worst aspects of AI assistants: their\nanswers sound confident but are less factual than ChatGPT. This is perhaps best elucidated in Figure 2,\nwhere the imitation model outputs an answer that is similar in style to ChatGPT\u2019s answer but is\ncompletely incorrect.\nHuman evaluation is increasingly hard. Unfortunately, crowd workers without domain expertise\nor significant time investments can easily be deceived by stylistic components\u2014answers that sound\nconfident and correct are often spuriously chosen more often. To improve human evaluation, it is\nthus increasingly necessary to both engage domain experts, but also to curate a set of highly difficult\nprompts that can rigorously test different models\u2019 capabilities. Surprisingly, our GPT-4 evaluations\nalso showed the same trends as our crowdworker evaluations (albet with a slightly larger absolute\npreference for ChatGPT\u2019s outputs). While this suggests that GPT-4 may be a viable candidate to\ncheaply emulate human evaluations on some tasks, it also implies that LLMs may replicate some\nhuman-like cognitive biases. We look forward to future work that further investigates this possibility.\nImitation models inherit the safety and toxicity style of the teacher model.\nFinally, despite\nimitation only providing benefits in mimicking the \u201cstyle\u201d or \u201cpersona\u201d of the target model, there is\nstill value in doing so. For example, OpenAI has carefully and deliberately trained ChatGPT to be\n\u201charmless\u201d to end users, often avoiding toxic outputs and refusing to respond to questionable user\nrequests. We find that our imitation models also inherit these components. In particular, we show in\nFigure 5 that as we finetune on more imitation data, the imitation model\u2019s outputs become less toxic\non RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020), as the model learns to abstain in a similar fashion to\nChatGPT. Consequently, we conclude that model imitation is highly effective in cases when one has\na powerful base LM and is looking to subvert the need to annotate expensive finetuning data.\n7\nModel\nImitation Data\nNQ\n7B\n\u2013\n17\n7B\nShareGPT-Mix\n10\n7B\nNQ-Synthetic\n22\n13B\n\u2013\n20\n13B\nShareGPT-Mix\n15\n13B\nNQ-Synthetic\n27\nChatGPT\n\u2013\n31\nTable 1: We train imitation models on broad-\ncoverage data from ShareGPT-Mix or targeted\nNatural-Questions-like data (NQ-synthetic).

However,\nthe NQ-Synthetic models substantially close the\ngap to ChatGPT on NQ, showing that local imita-\ntion of a model is far more feasible in practice.\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\nAmount of Imitation Data (Millions of Tokens)\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n0.90\n0.92\nNon-Toxic Score\nRealToxicityPrompts\nLLaMA-13B\nImitation Model (13B)\nChatGPT\nFigure 5: We evaluate imitation models on Re-\nalToxicityPrompts and report the average non-\ntoxicity score according to the perspective API.\nThe results show that imitation models are signif-\nicantly less toxic than the baseline models, i.e.,\nthey learn to inherit the safety and toxicity guide-\nlines of the target models.\nImitation Models\nMetric\nLLaMA\n20M\n80M\n150M\nChatGPT #2\nIf ChatGPT outputs a list, do we?\n13%\n50%\n67%\n81%\n83%\nIf ChatGPT outputs a summary paragraph, do we?\n2%\n40%\n42%\n48%\n55%\nUnigram intersection w/ ChatGPT\u2019s output\n19.5\n40.4\n41.9\n42.5\n49.2\nPearson correlation in length w/ ChatGPT\u2019s output\n-0.11\n0.51\n0.62\n0.62\n0.67\nOutputs are in authoritative tone according to GPT-4\n57%\n99%\n98%\n98%\n98%\nTable 2: As we add more imitation data, the style of our models\u2019 outputs are increasingly similar to\nthose of ChatGPT. In particular, we generate outputs from our imitation models and compare them\nto a random ChatGPT response across different metrics. We also report a rough \u201cupper bound\u201d by\ncomparing a second random ChatGPT output to the original ChatGPT response (ChatGPT #2).\n5\nDiscussion\nFinetuning as a simple knowledge extractor. Our results show that a modest amount of finetuning\nprovides little to no improvements on an LM\u2019s knowledge or capabilities. We thus agree with the view\nthat pre-training is the main source of an LM\u2019s capabilities, and that finetuning acts as a lightweight\nmethod to train the model to extract its own knowledge Schulman (2023). This is the reason why\nimproving models by imitating ChatGPT on a small set of data is insufficient, as the base knowledge\nis largely unaffected. Furthermore, this view suggests that during finetuning time, you may even\nwant to avoid introducing new knowledge (i.e., do not imitate better models), as you will otherwise\nbe training the model to guess or hallucinate its answers, rather than actually doing the task as\nintended (Schulman, 2023; Gao, 2021; Goldberg, 2023).\nShould you be worried about imitation? Imitating proprietary LMs comes with many potential\nimplications for small and large companies alike. Our results suggest that the efficacy of model\nimitation is limited when there is a large gap between the base and target LM. Thus, we believe that\ncompanies who can establish a capabilities gap using large amounts of data, compute, or algorithmic\nadvances are the ones who are best positioned to build and maintain competitive advantages. On\nthe other hand, companies that look to build moats by using off-the-shelf LMs with proprietary\nfine-tuning datasets may be comparatively more vulnerable to imitation.\nPotential confounders to our findings. While we believe our findings are well supported, there\nare a few potential hidden confounders that could change our conclusions. First, as we are unaware\nof the pre-training data used by ChatGPT, it is possible that some of the tasks that we evaluate on\n8\ncould have been been contaminated into ChatGPT\u2019s training data, thus inflating its accuracy numbers.\nMoreover, to conduct imitation, we perform supervised learning on the outputs from the target\nmodel. However, it also may be possible to use the target model to perform RLHF or constitutional\nAI (OpenAI, 2022; Christiano et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022) to further improve results. Lastly, we\nonly considered relatively simple methods for collecting imitation data, however, there may be more\nadvanced methods (e.g., active learning) that may improve the effectiveness or efficiency of model\nimitation.\nImplications for other forms of model imitation There has been a flurry of recent work that\nperforms model imitation in more indirect ways than we study here. For example, the training process\nof many recent vision-language model (Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023; Zhu et al.,\n2023) includes ChatGPT or GPT-4 outputs at some stages. Furthermore, it has become common to\nuse large LMs in various ways during the data annotation and creation process, e.g., to aid crowd\nworkers, to perform data augmentation, to identify mislabeled data, and more. Our findings may have\nimplications for these approaches, e.g., it is likely that vision-language models that include OpenAI\ndata may have similar failure modes to the ones described in our work.\nTechnical limitations of model imitation Imitating proprietary models also has various technical\nlimitations: the models inherit the weaknesses and biases of proprietary models, imitation does not\nallow one to directly improve on the design decisions of closed AI companies (e.g., data annotation\nstrategies), and these systems are roughly upper-bounded by the capabilities of the target proprietary\nmodel. Moreover, it is difficult to answer certain scientific questions using imitation models because\nthey include proprietary black-box models in their training pipeline.\n6\nRelated Work\nModel distillation Model imitation is similar to model distillation (Hinton et al., 2014), where\none trains a student model to imitate a teacher. While conceptually similar, there are several major\npractical differences. For distillation, the training data, model architecture, and hyperparameters are\nknown for the teacher. In model imitation, one tries to imitate the teacher without this knowledge.\nMoreover, for distillation it is common to use training objectives that utilize the probability distribution\nof the teacher whereas in stealing such a distribution is typically unavailable.\nPast work on model imitation Prior work has shown that model imitation is possible for various\ndomains (Orekondy et al., 2019; Tram`er et al., 2016; Lowd and Meek, 2005), including language\nclassifiers (Krishna et al., 2020; Pal et al., 2019) and machine translation systems (Wallace et al.,\n2020). Nevertheless, past work considers a setting where models are trained from scratch, and thus\nthe main proprietary nature of a model is the company\u2019s internal training data. In our setting, systems\nlike ChatGPT are proprietary because they also leverage OpenAI\u2019s internal pre-trained LMs that are\nstronger than any available open-source LM.\nDefending against model imitation Our results show that imitation is a moderate concern for\ncompanies. In turn, there is a need to develop methods to mitigate or detect imitation. There is an\nexisting body of work in this direction, e.g., one can detect whether a particular model is trained\nvia imitation (Krishna et al., 2020; Juuti et al., 2019; Szyller et al., 2019; Maini et al., 2021) or\nslow model stealing by sacrifing some performance (Wallace et al., 2020; Orekondy et al., 2020;\nDziedzic et al., 2022a,b). Unfortunately, existing methods often exhibit too severe of a tradeoff to be\ndeployable in practice.\n7\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we critically analyzed the efficacy of model imitation. We showed that imitation can\nindeed improve the style, persona, and instruction adherence of open-source LMs. However, imitation\nfalls short in improving LMs across more challenging axes such as factuality, coding, and problem\nsolving. On one hand, these results indicate that businesses can successfully establish and safeguard\na competitive advantage by pre-training powerful base models. Conversely, it also implies that if two\ngroups possess equally competent base LMs, one can easily mimic the persona and behavior of the\nother model, without needing to annotate expensive fine-tuning data.\n9\nMoving forward, our findings raise a range of technical and societal questions. First, we show that\nexisting crowd worker evaluations have trouble elucidating the differences between imitation models\nand proprietary ones, despite clear differences existing between them. In turn, the future of human\nevaluation remains unclear: how can we cheaply and quickly probe the utility of a powerful LLM?\nSecond, given the large gap between LLaMA and ChatGPT (the latter model is faster, cheaper, and\nmore accurate), and the insufficiencies of model imitation, there are obvious open questions on\nhow to best improve open-source LMs (e.g., increasing model scale, improving pre-training data\nquality, developing new pretraining methods, etc). Finally, our work raises ethical and legal questions,\nincluding whether the open-source community should continue to advance progress by \u201cstealing\u201d\nwhat OpenAI and other companies have done, as well as what legal countermeasures companies can\ntake to protect and license intellectual property. In future work, we hope to delve deeper into these\nissues and devise better methods for the ethical and responsible deployment of LMs.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Nicholas Carlini, the members of Berkeley NLP, and the members of Berkeley RAIL\nfor valuable feedback on this project.

While text guidance is an in-\ntuitive editing interface for users, it often fails to ensure\nthe precise concept conveyed by users. To address this is-\nsue, we propose Custom-Edit, in which we (i) customize\na diffusion model with a few reference images and then\n(ii) perform text-guided editing. Our key discovery is that\ncustomizing only language-relevant parameters with aug-\nmented prompts improves reference similarity significantly\nwhile maintaining source similarity. Moreover, we provide\nour recipe for each customization and editing process. We\ncompare popular customization methods and validate our\nfindings on two editing methods using various datasets.\n1. Introduction\nRecent work on deep generative models has led to\nrapid advancements in image editing. Text-to-image mod-\nels [19, 22] trained on large-scale databases [23] allow intu-\nitive editing [7, 15] of images in various domains. Then,\nto what extent can these models support precise editing\ninstructions? Can a unique concept of the user, especially\none not encountered during large-scale training, be utilized\nfor editing? Editing with a prompt acquired from a well-\nperforming captioning model [13] fails to capture the ap-\npearance of reference, as shown in Fig. 1.\nWe propose Custom-Edit, a two-step approach that in-\nvolves (i) customizing the model [6, 12, 21] using a few\nreference images and then (ii) utilizing effective text-guided\nediting methods [7, 15, 16] to edit images. While prior cus-\ntomization studies [6, 12, 21] deal with the random genera-\ntion of images (noise\u2192image), our work focuses on image\nediting (image\u2192image). As demonstrated in Fig. 1, cus-\ntomization improves faithfulness to the reference\u2019s appear-\nance by a large margin. This paper shows that customizing\n\u2217 Corresponding Authors\nSource\nA black cat\u2026\nStrawberry cup\u2026\nV* patterned teapot\nV* cat figurine\nReference\nBLIP-Edit\nA colorful ceramic cat \nfigurine\u2026\nRed and gold \ntea kettle\u2026\nCustom-Edit\nA V* cat figurine\u2026\nV* patterned \nteapot\u2026\nFigure 1.

More-\nover, we present our design choices for each customization\nand editing process and discuss the source-reference trade-\noff in Custom-Edit.\n2. Diffusion Models\nThroughout the paper, we use Stable Diffusion [19], an\nopen-source text-to-image model. The diffusion model [5,\n8, 24, 26] is trained in the latent space of a VAE [11], which\ndownsamples images for computation efficiency. The model\nis trained to reconstruct the clean latent representation x0\nfrom a perturbed representation xt given the text condition\nc, which is embedded with the CLIP text encoder [18]. The\ndiffusion model is trained with the following objective:\nT\nX\nt=1\nEx0,\u03f5[||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, c)||2],\n(1)\nwhere \u03f5 is an added noise, t is a time step indicating a\nperturbed noise level, and \u03f5\u03b8 is a diffusion model with a\nU-Net [20] architecture with attention blocks [27]. During\ntraining, the text embeddings are projected to the keys and\n1\narXiv:2305.15779v1  [cs.CV]  25 May 2023\nSource\nOutput\nAttention\nKV\nQ\nDiffusion U-Net\n. . .\nConv\nAttention\nKV\nQ\nConv\nReference\nReference\nPrior\nPrior\n\u2205\n...

Our Custom-Edit consists of two processes: the customization process and the editing process. (a) Customization. We customize\na diffusion model by optimizing only language-relevant parameters (i.e., custom embedding V* and attention weights) on a given set of\nreference images. We also apply the prior preservation loss to alleviate the language drift. (b) Editing. We then transform the source image\nto the output using the customized word. We leverage the P2P and Null-text inversion methods [7, 16] for this process.\nvalues of cross-attention layers, and the text encoder is kept\nfrozen to preserve its language understanding capability.\nImagen [22] and eDiffi [1] have shown that leveraging rich\nlanguage understandings of large language models by freez-\ning them is the key to boosting the performance.\n3. Custom-Edit\nOur goal is to edit images with complex visual instruc-\ntions given as reference images (Fig. 1). Therefore, we pro-\npose a two-step approach that (i) customizes the model on\ngiven references (Sec. 3.1) and (ii) edits images with textual\nprompts (Sec. 3.2). Our method is presented in Fig. 2.\n3.1. Customization\nTrainable Parameters. We optimize only the keys and\nvalues of cross-attention and the \u2018[rare token]\u2019, following\nCustom-Diffusion [12]. As we discuss in Sec. 4, our results\nindicate that training these language-relevant parameters is\ncrucial for successfully transferring reference concepts to\nsource images. Furthermore, training only these parameters\nrequires less storage than Dreambooth [21].\nAugmented Prompts. We fine-tune the abovementioned\nparameters by minimizing Eq. (1). We improve Custom-\nDiffusion for editing by augmenting the text input as \u2018[rare\ntoken] [modifier] [class noun]\u2019 (e.g., \u2018V* patterned teapot\u2019).\nWe find that \u2018[modifier]\u2019 encourages the model to focus on\nlearning the appearance of the reference.\nDatasets. To keep the language understanding while fine-\ntuning on the reference, we additionally minimize prior\npreservation loss [21] over diverse images belonging to the\nsame class as the reference. Thus, we use CLIP-retrieval [3]\nto retrieve 200 images and their captions from the LAION\ndataset [23] using the text query \u2018photo of a [modifier]\n[class noun]\u2019.\n3.2. Text-Guided Image Editing\nPrompt-to-Prompt. We use Prompt-to-Prompt [7] (P2P),\na recently introduced editing framework that edits images\nby only modifying source prompts. P2P proposes attention\ninjection to preserve the structure of a source image. For\neach denoising step t, let us denote the attention maps of\nthe source and edited image as Mt and Mt\n\u2217, respectively.\nP2P then injects a new attention map Edit(Mt, Mt\n\u2217, t) into\nthe model \u03f5\u03b8. Edit is an attention map editing operation,\nincluding prompt refinement and word swap. Additionally,\nP2P enables local editing with an automatically computed\nmask. P2P computes the average of cross-attention \u00af\nMt,w\nand \u00af\nM \u2217\nt,w related to the word w and thresholds them to pro-\nduce the binary mask B( \u00af\nMt)\u222aB( \u00af\nM \u2217\nt ). Before editing with\nP2P, we utilize Null-Text Inversion [16] to boost the source\npreservation. Refer to Sec. C for a more description.\nOperation Choice. Due to the limited number of reference\nimages, the customized words favor only a limited variety of\nstructures. This inspired us to propose the following recipe.\nFirst, we use prompt refinement for the Edit function. Word\nswap fails when the customized words do not prefer the\nswapped attention map. Second, we use mask B( \u00af\nMt) rather\nthan B( \u00af\nMt) \u222a B( \u00af\nM \u2217\nt ), as the customized words are likely\nto generate incorrect masks.\nSource-Reference Trade-Off. A key challenge in image\nediting is balancing the edited image\u2019s source and reference\nsimilarities. We refer to \u03c4/T as strength, where P2P injects\nself-attention from t = T to t = \u03c4. In P2P, we observed that\na critical factor in controlling the trade-off is the injection\n2\nV* wooden pot\nV* tortoise plushy\nReference\nSource\nEdited\nSource\nEdited\nV* ceramic bird\nV* pencil drawing\nV* cat\nA bottle of wine and \na glass on a table\nA V* wooden pot \nof wine\u2026\nA cactus wearing \nsunglasses and a \nhat in the desert\nA V* wooden pot \nwearing\u2026\nA sea turtle \nswimming under the \nsurface of the water\nA V* tortoise plushy \nswimming\u2026\nA painting of a \nraccoon wearing a \ncrown\n\u2026a V* tortoise plushy \nwearing\u2026\nTwo small birds \nsitting on a branch\nTwo V* ceramic bird \nsitting\u2026\nA blue jay perched \non top of a basket \nfull of macarons\nA V* ceramic bird \nperched\u2026\nPhoto of a giraffe \ndrinking from a blue \nbucket\nV* pencil drawing \nof a giraffe\u2026\nPhoto of an old man \nin a cowboy hat \nsmoking a cigar\nV* pencil drawing of \nan old\u2026\nTwo cats are sitting \non a mirror in front \nof a bathroom\nTwo V* cat are \nsitting\u2026 \nA basket filled with \napples sits on a \nwooden chair\n\u2026 filled with \nV* cat sits\u2026\nFigure 3. Custom-Edit results. Our method transfers the reference\u2019s appearance to the source image with unprecedented fidelity. The\nstructures of the source are well preserved. We obtain source prompts using BLIP2 [13]. Except for the pencil drawing example, we use\nlocal editing of P2P with automatically generated masks.\n3\nof self-attention rather than cross-attention. Higher strength\ndenotes higher source similarity at the expense of reference\nsimilarity. In Sec. 4, we also show results with SDEdit [15],\nwhich diffuses the image from t = 0 to t = \u03c4 and denoises\nit back. As opposed to P2P, higher strength in SDEdit means\nhigher reference similarity.\n4. Experiment\nIn this section, we aim to validate each process of\nCustom-Edit. Specifically, we assess our design choices for\ncustomization by using Textual Inversion [6] and Dream-\nbooth [21] in the customization process. We compare their\nsource-reference trade-off in the editing process. As well as\nP2P, we use SDEdit [15] for experiments.\nBaselines. Textual Inversion learns a new text embedding\nV*, initialized with a class noun (e.g., \u2018pot\u2019), by minimizing\nEq. (1) for the input prompt \u2018V*\u2019. Dreambooth fine-tunes\nthe diffusion model while the text encoder is frozen. Eq. (1)\nis minimized over a few images given for input prompt\n\u2018[rare token] [class noun]\u2019 (e.g., \u2018ktn teapot\u2019). SDEdit is the\nsimplest editing method that diffuse-and-denoise the image.\nDatasets. We use eight references in our experiments, in-\ncluding two pets, five objects, and one artwork. For each\nreference, we used five source images on average.\nMetrics. We measure the source and reference similarities\nwith CLIP ViT-B/32 [18]. We use strengths [0.2, 0.4, 0.6,\n0.8] for P2P and [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8] for SDEdit results.\nWe generated two P2P samples with cross-attention injec-\ntion strengths [0.2, 0.6], and three SDEdit samples for each\nstrength and source image from different random seeds.\nInference Details. We employ a guidance scale of 7.5 and\n50 inference steps. We acquire all source prompts using\nBLIP2 [13]. More details are available in Sec. B.\n4.1. Qualitative Results\nFig. 3 illustrates the selected results. Custom-Edit trans-\nfers the reference\u2019s detailed appearance to the source while\npreserving the overall structure. For example, Custom-Edit\ngenerates a horizontally elongated V* wooden pot from the\nwine bottle (first row). In the second row, Custom-Edit gen-\nerates a V* tortoise plushy wearing a hat with the texture of\nits shell. The blue jay in the third row became a V* ceramic\nbird with perfectly preserved macarons. In the last row, the\nV* cat is sitting in a pose that does not exist in the reference\nset. We show qualitative comparisons in Sec. A.1.\n4.2. Quantitative Results\nFig. 4 shows average trade-off curves on P2P and\nSDEdit. Our improved Custom-Diffusion yields the best\ntrade-off, while Textual Inversion shows similar source\nsimilarity but lower reference similarity. Dreambooth has\nhigher source similarity but lower reference similarity, sug-\ngesting that it is ineffective in modifying images. SDEdit\nFigure 4. Source-Reference Trade-Off. Custom-Diffusion shows\nthe best trade-off, indicating the effectiveness of training only\nlanguage-relevant parameters. We exhibit qualitative comparisons\nand samples with various strengths in Sec. A.2.\nresults also show a similar tendency, supporting our claim\nthat customizing language-relevant parameters is effective\nfor editing. Note that SDEdit shows lower source similarity\nthan P2P, indicating the superiority of P2P and our opera-\ntion choices in text-guided editing.\n5. Discussion\nWe propose Custom-Edit, which allows fine-grained\nediting with textual prompts. We present our design choices\nfor each process, which can benefit future customization\nand editing work. Additionally, we discuss the trade-off be-\ntween source and reference in diffusion-based editing.\nAlthough Custom-Edit shows various successful edit-\ning results, there are some failure cases, as presented\nin Sec. A.3. Custom-Edit sometimes edits undesired regions\nor fails to edit complex backgrounds. We hypothesize that\nthis is due to the inaccurate attention maps of Stable Dif-\nfusion [7, 16] and the limited controllability of the text in-\nput. Potential solutions are to apply Custom-Edit on text-to-\nimage models with larger text encoders [1, 22] or extended\ncontrollability [14, 28].\n4\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the Na-\ntional Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded\nby the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT,\nMSIT) (2022R1A3B1077720), Institute of Information &\ncommunications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)\ngrants funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (2021-0-\n01343: AI Graduate School Program, SNU), and the BK21\nFOUR program of the Education and Research Program for\nFuture ICT Pioneers, Seoul National University in 2023.\nReferences\n[1] Yogesh Balaji, Seungjun Nah, Xun Huang, Arash Vahdat,\nJiaming Song, Karsten Kreis, Miika Aittala, Timo Aila,\nSamuli Laine, Bryan Catanzaro, et al. ediffi: Text-to-image\ndiffusion models with an ensemble of expert denoisers. arXiv\npreprint arXiv:2211.01324, 2022. 2, 4, 6\n[2] Omer Bar-Tal, Dolev Ofri-Amar, Rafail Fridman, Yoni Kas-\nten, and Tali Dekel.

Qualitative Comparisons\nComparisons of customization methods on P2P are\nshown in Fig. B. Dreambooth fails to modify the source im-\nages. Textual Inversion results do not capture details of the\nreferences. Comparisons on SDEdit are shown in Fig. C.\nSimilar to the results on P2P, Dreambooth and Textual In-\nversion fail to capture the detailed appearance of the refer-\nence.\nA.2. Strength Control\nWe show how the strength of P2P (Fig. D) and SDEdit\n(Fig. E) affect the results. By controlling the strength\nof these methods, users can choose samples that match\ntheir preferences. Our empirical findings suggest that P2P\nstrengths between 0.4 and 0.6, and SDEdit strengths be-\ntween 0.6 and 0.7 produce good samples.\nA.3. Failure Cases\nFailure cases are shown in Fig. F. In the first row, the\ncake turns into the V* cat instead of the coffee. Replacing\n\u2018A cup\u2019 with \u2018V* cat\u2019 resolves the issue. We speculate that\nStable Diffusion is not familiar with a cat sitting in coffee,\nwhich causes the word \u2019cat\u2019 to fail to attend to coffee. Re-\ncent works [7, 16] have noted that attention maps of Stable\nDiffusion are less accurate than those of Imagen [22].\nTurning the dolphin into the V* tortoise plushy in the\nsecond row is easy. However, we cannot turn rocks into the\nV* tortoise plushy. The rocks are scattered in the complex\nscene so, the model requires clarification on which rock to\nmodify. Applying Custom-Edit on extended text-to-image\nmodels such as GLIGEN [14], which is a model extended\nto the grounding inputs, may solve this problem.\nA.4. Text Similarity\nIn addition to the source-reference trade-off shown in\nthe main paper, we show the trade-off between text simi-\nlarity and source similarity in Fig. G. We measure text sim-\nilarity using CLIP ViT-B/32 between the edited image and\nthe target text (with V* omitted). Our improved Custom-\nDiffusion achieves significantly better text similarity com-\npared to other methods.\nB. Implementation Details\nB.1. Customization\nDreambooth and Custom-Diffusion.

Susskind, Miguel Angel Bautista\nApple\n{aa_elhag, yuyang_wang4, jsusskind, mbautistamartin}@apple.com\nABSTRACT\nWe present Manifold Diffusion Fields (MDF), an approach that unlocks learning of\ndiffusion models of data in general non-Euclidean geometries. Leveraging insights\nfrom spectral geometry analysis, we define an intrinsic coordinate system on the\nmanifold via the eigen-functions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator. MDF represents\nfunctions using an explicit parametrization formed by a set of multiple input-output\npairs. Our approach allows to sample continuous functions on manifolds and\nis invariant with respect to rigid and isometric transformations of the manifold.\nIn addition, we show that MDF generalizes to the case where the training set\ncontains functions on different manifolds. Empirical results on multiple datasets\nand manifolds including challenging scientific problems like weather prediction or\nmolecular conformation show that MDF can capture distributions of such functions\nwith better diversity and fidelity than previous approaches.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nApproximating probability distributions from finite observational datasets is a pivotal machine\nlearning challenge, with recent strides made in areas like text (Brown et al., 2020), images (Nichol &\nDhariwal, 2021), and video (Ho et al., 2022).\nThe burgeoning interest in diffusion generative models (Ho et al., 2020; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021;\nSong et al., 2021b) can be attributed to their stable optimization goals and fewer training anomalies\n(Kodali et al., 2017). However, fully utilizing the potential of these models across scientific and\nengineering disciplines remains an open problem. While diffusion generative models excel in domains\nwith Euclidean (i.e. flat) spaces like 2D images or 3D geometry and video, many scientific problems\ninvolve reasoning about continuous functions on curved spaces (i.e.\nRiemannian manifolds).\nExamples include climate observations on the sphere (Hersbach et al., 2020; Lindgren et al., 2011) or\nsolving PDEs on curved surfaces, which is a crucial problem in areas like quantum mechanics (Bhabha,\n1945) and molecular conformation (Jing et al., 2022). Recent works have tackled the problem of\nlearning generative models of continuous functions following either adversarial formulations (Dupont\net al., 2022b), latent parametrizations (Dupont et al., 2022a; Du et al., 2021; Bauer et al., 2023), or\ndiffusion models (Bond-Taylor & Willcocks, 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023). While these approaches have\nshown promise on functions within the Euclidean domain, the general case of learning generative\nmodels of functions on Riemannian manifolds remains unexplored.\nIn this paper, we introduce Manifold Diffusion Fields (MDF), extending generative models over\nfunctions to the Riemannian setting. We take the term function and field to have equivalent meaning\nthroughout the paper. Note that these are not to be confused with gradient vector fields typically used\non manifold. These fields f : M \u2192 Y map points from a manifold M (that might be parametrized\nas a 3D mesh, graph or even a pointcloud, see Sect. 5.2) to corresponding values in signal space Y.\nMDF is trained on collections of fields and learns a generative model that can sample different fields\nover a manifold. In Fig. 1 we show real samples of such functions for different manifolds, as well as\nsamples generated by MDF.\nHere are our main contributions:\n\u2022 We borrow insights from spectral geometry analysis to define a coordinate system for points\nin manifolds using the eigen-functions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator.\n\u2217Work was completed while A.A.E was an intern with Apple.\n1\narXiv:2305.15586v2  [cs.LG]  20 Jan 2024\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 1: MDF learns a distribution over a collection of fields f : M \u2192 Rd, where each field is\ndefined on a manifold M. We show real samples and MDF\u2019s generations on different datasets of\nfields defined on different manifolds. First row: MNIST digits on the sine wave manifold. Second\nrow Middle: ERA5 climate dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020) on the 2D sphere. Third row: GMM\ndataset on the bunny manifold. Fourth row: molecular conformations in GEOM-QM9 (Ruddigkeit\net al., 2012) given the molecular graph.\n\u2022 We formulate an end-to-end generative model for functions defined on manifolds, allowing\nsampling different fields over a manifold. Focusing on practical settings, our extensive exper-\nimental evaluation covers graphs, meshes and pointclouds as approximations of manifolds.\n\u2022 We empirically demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches like (Zhuang\net al., 2023; Dupont et al., 2022b), yielding diverse and high fidelity samples, while being\nrobust to rigid and isometric manifold transformations. Results on climate modeling datasets\n(Hersbach et al., 2020) and PDE problems show the practicality of MDF in scientific\ndomains.\n\u2022 We show that MDF can learn a distribution over functions on different manifolds. On\nthe challenging problem of molecular conformer generation, MDF obtains state-of-the-art\nresults on GEOM-QM9 (Ruddigkeit et al., 2012).\n2\nRELATED WORK\nOur approach extends recent efforts in generative models for continuous functions in Euclidean\nspace (Zhuang et al., 2023; Dupont et al., 2022b;a; Du et al., 2021), shown Fig. 2(a), to functions\ndefined over manifolds, see Fig. 2(b). The term Implicit Neural Representation (INR) is used in\nthese works to denote a parameterization of a single function (e.g.\na single image in 2D) using a\nneural network that maps the function\u2019s inputs (i.e.\npixel coordinates) to its outputs (i.e. RGB\nvalues). Different approaches have been proposed to learn distributions over fields in Euclidean space,\nGASP (Dupont et al., 2022b) leverages a GAN whose generator produces field data whereas a point\ncloud discriminator operates on discretized data and aims to differentiate real and generated functions.\nTwo-stage approaches (Dupont et al., 2022a; Du et al., 2021) adopt a latent field parameterization\n(Park et al., 2019) where functions are parameterized via a hyper-network (Ha et al., 2017) and a\ngenerative model is learnt on the latent or INR representations. In addition, MDF also relates to\nrecent work focusing on fitting a function (e.g. learning an INR) on a manifold using an intrinsic\ncoordinate system (Koestler et al., 2022; Grattarola & Vandergheynst, 2022), and generalizes it to the\nproblem of learning a probabilistic model over multiple functions defined on a manifold.\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 2: (a) Generative models of fields in Euclidean space (Zhuang et al., 2023; Dupont et al.,\n2022b;a; Du et al., 2021) learn a distribution p\u03b8 over functions whose domain is Rn. We show\nan example where each function is the result of evaluating a Gaussian mixture with 3 random\ncomponents in 2D. (b) MDF learns a distribution p\u03b8 from a collection of fields whose domain is\na general Riemannian manifold f \u223c q(f)|f : M \u2192 Y. Similarly, as an illustrative example\neach function is the result of evaluating a Gaussian mixture with 3 random components on M (i.e.\nthe Stanford bunny). (c) Riemannian generative models (Bortoli et al., 2022; Gemici et al., 2016;\nRozen et al., 2021; Chen & Lipman, 2023) learn a parametric distribution p\u03b8 from an empirical\nobservations x \u223c q(x)|x \u2208 M of points x on a Riemannian manifold M, denoted by black dots\non the manifold.\nIntrinsic coordinate systems have also been recently used in the context of Graph Transform-\ners(Maskey et al., 2022; Sharp et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Dwivedi et al., 2020), where eigenvectors\nof the Graph Laplacian are used to replace standard positional embeddings (in addition to also\nusing edge features). In this setting, Graph Transformer architectures have been used for supervised\nlearning problems like graph/node classification and regression, whereas we focus on generative\nmodeling.\nThe learning problem we tackle with MDF can be interpreted as lifting the Riemannian generative\nmodeling problem (Bortoli et al., 2022; Gemici et al., 2016; Rozen et al., 2021; Chen & Lipman,\n2023) to function spaces. Fig. 2(b)(c) show the training setting for the two problems, which are\nrelated but not directly comparable. MDF learns a generative model over functions defined on\nmanifolds, e.g.\na probability density over functions f : M \u2192 Y that map points in the manifold M\nto a signal space Y. In contrast, the goal in Riemannian generative modeling is to learn a probability\ndensity from an observed set of points living in a Riemannian manifold M. For example, in the\ncase of the bunny, shown in Fig. 2(c), a Riemannian generative model learns a distribution of points\nx \u2208 M on the manifold.\nMDF is also related to work on Neural Processes (Garnelo et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Dutordoir\net al., 2022), which also learn distributions over functions. As opposed to the formulation of Neural\nProcesses which optimizes an ELBO (Kingma & Welling, 2014) we formulate MDF as a denoising\ndiffusion process in function space, which results in a robust training objective and a powerful\ninference process. Moreover, our work relates to formulations of Gaussian Processes (GP) on\nRiemannian manifolds (Borovitskiy et al., 2020; Hutchinson et al., 2021). These approaches are GP\nformulations of Riemannian generative modeling (see Fig. 2), in the sense that they learn conditional\ndistributions of points on the manifold, as opposed to distributions over functions on the manifold\nlike MDF.\n3\nPRELIMINARIES\n3.1\nDENOISING DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Ho et al., 2020) (DDPMs) belong to the broad family of\nlatent variable models. We refer the reader to (Everett, 2013) for an in depth review. In short, to learn\na parametric data distribution p\u03b8(x0) from an empirical distribution of finite samples q(x0), DDPMs\nreverse a diffusion Markov Chain that generates latents x1:T by gradually adding Gaussian noise to the\ndata x0 \u223c q(x0) for T time-steps as follows: q(xt|xt\u22121) := N (xt\u22121; \u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0, (1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t)I). Here, \u00af\u03b1t\nis the cumulative product of fixed variances with a handcrafted scheduling up to time-step t. (Ho et al.,\n2020) introduce an efficient training recipe in which: i) The forward process adopts sampling in closed\nform. ii) reversing the diffusion process is equivalent to learning a sequence of denoising (or score)\nnetworks \u03f5\u03b8, with tied weights. Reparameterizing the forward process as xt = \u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0 + \u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nresults in the \u201csimple\u201d DDPM loss: Et\u223c[0,T ],x0\u223cq(x0),\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)\n\u0002\n\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(\u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0 + \u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5, t)\u22252\u0003\n,\nwhich makes learning of the data distribution p\u03b8(x0) both efficient and scalable.\nAt inference time, we compute x0 \u223c p\u03b8(x0) via ancestral sampling (Ho et al., 2020). Concretely,\nwe start by sampling xT \u223c N(0, I) and iteratively apply the score network \u03f5\u03b8 to denoise xT , thus\nreversing the diffusion Markov Chain to obtain x0. Sampling xt\u22121 \u223c p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) is equivalent\nto computing the update: xt\u22121 =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0010\nxt \u2212\n1\u2212\u03b1t\n\u221a1\u2212\u03b1t \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\n\u0011\n+ z, where at each inference step a\nstochastic component z \u223c N(0, I) is injected, resembling sampling via Langevin dynamics (Welling\n& Teh, 2011). In practice, DDPMs have obtained amazing results for signals living in an Euclidean\ngrid (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Ho et al., 2022). However, the extension to functions defined on\ncurved manifolds remains an open problem.\n3.2\nRIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS\nPrevious work on Riemannian generative models (Bortoli et al., 2022; Gemici et al., 2016; Rozen\net al., 2021; Chen & Lipman, 2023) develops machinery to learn distribution from a training set of\npoints living on Riemannian manifolds. Riemannian manifolds are connected and compact manifolds\nM equipped with a smooth metric g : TxM \u00d7 TxM \u2192 R\u22650 (e.g.\na smoothly varying inner\nproduct from which a distance can be constructed on M). A core tool in Riemannian manifolds is\nthe tangent space, this space defines the tangent hyper-plane of a point x \u2208 M and is denoted by\nTxM. This tangent space TxM is used to define inner products \u27e8u, v\u27e9g, u, v \u2208 TxM, which in\nturns defines g. The tangent bundle TM is defined as the collection of tangent spaces for all points\nTxM \u2200x \u2208 M.\nIn practice we cannot assume that for general geometries (e.g.\ngeometries for which we don\u2019t have\naccess to a closed form and are commonly represented as graphs/meshes) one can efficiently compute\ng. While it is possible to define an analytical form for the Riemannian metric g on simple parametric\nmanifolds (e.g. hyper-spheres, hyperbolic spaces, tori), general geometries (i.e. the Stanford bunny)\nare inherently discrete and irregular, which can make it expensive to even approximate g. To mitigate\nthese issues MDF is formulated from the ground up without relying on access to an analytical form\nfor g or the tangent bundle TM and allows for learning a distribution of functions defined on general\ngeometries.\n3.3\nLAPLACE-BELTRAMI OPERATOR\nThe Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) denoted by \u2206M is one of the cornerstones of differential\ngeometry and can be intuitively understood as a generalization of the Laplace operator to functions\ndefined on Riemannian manifolds M. Intuitively, the LBO encodes information about the curvature\nof the manifold and how it bends and twists at every point, reflecting the intrinsic geometry. One\nof the basic uses of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is to define a functional basis on the manifold\nby solving the general eigenvalue problem associated with \u2206M, which is a foundational technique\nin spectral geometry analysis (L\u00e9vy, 2006). The eigen-decomposition of \u2206M are the non-trivial\nsolutions to the equation \u2206M\u03c6i = \u03bbi\u03c6i. The eigen-functions \u03c6i : M \u2192 R represent an orthonormal\nfunctional basis for the space of square integrable functions (L\u00e9vy, 2006; Minakshisundaram &\nPleijel, 1949). Thus, one can express a square integrable function f : M \u2192 Y, with f \u2208 L2 as a\nlinear combination of the functional basis, as follows: f =\n\u221e\nP\ni=1\n\u27e8f, \u03c6i\u27e9\u03c6i.\nIn practice, the infinite sum is truncated to the k eigen-functions with lowest eigen-values, where\nthe ordering of the eigen-values \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03bbk enables a low-pass filter of the basis. Moreover,\n(L\u00e9vy, 2006) shows that the eigen-functions of \u2206M can be interpreted as a Fourier-like function basis\n(Vallet & L\u00e9vy, 2008) on the manifold, e.g.\nan intrinsic coordinate system for the manifold. In\nparticular, if M = S2 this functional basis is equivalent to spherical harmonics, and in Euclidean\nspace it becomes a Fourier basis which is typically used in implicit representations (Xie et al., 2022).\nMDF uses the eigen-functions of the LBO \u2206M to define a Fourier-like positional embedding (PE)\nfor points on M (see Fig. 3). Note that these eigen-functions are only defined for points that lie on\nthe manifold, making MDF strictly operate on the manifold.\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 3: Left: Fourier PE of a point x in 2D Euclidean space. Generative models of functions in\nambient space (Zhuang et al., 2023; Dupont et al., 2022b;a; Du et al., 2021) use this representation to\nencode a function\u2019s input. Right: MDF uses the eigen-functions \u03c6i of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator\n(LBO) \u2206M evaluated at a point x \u2208 M.\n4\nMETHOD\nMDF is a diffusion generative model that captures distributions over fields defined on a Riemannian\nmanifold M. We are given observations in the form of an empirical distribution f0 \u223c q(f0) over\nfields where a field f0 : M \u2192 Y maps points from a manifold M to a signal space Y. As a result,\nlatent variables f1:T are also fields on manifolds that can be continuously evaluated.\nTo tackle the problem of learning a diffusion generative model over fields we employ a similar\nrecipe to (Zhuang et al., 2023), generalizing from fields defined on Euclidean domains to functions\non Riemannian manifolds. In order to this we use the first k eigen-functions \u03c6i=1:k of \u2206M to\ndefine a Fourier-like representation on M. Note that our model is independent of the particular\nparametrization of the LBO, e.g.\ncotangent, point cloud (Sharp & Crane, 2020) or graph laplacians\ncan be used depending on the available manifold parametrization (see Sect. 5.2 for experimental\nresults). We use the term \u03c6(x) = \u221an[\u03c61(x), \u03c62(x), . . . , \u03c6k(x)] \u2208 Rk to denote the normalized\neigen-function representation of a point x \u2208 M. In Fig. 3 we show a visual comparison of standard\nFourier PE on Euclidean space and the eigen-functions of the LBO on a manifold.\nWe adopt an explicit field parametrization (Zhuang et al., 2023), where a field is characterized by a\nset of coordinate-signal pairs {(\u03c6(xc), y(c,0))}, xc \u2208 M, y(c,0) \u2208 Y, which is denoted as context\nset. We row-wise stack the context set and refer to the resulting matrix via C0 = [\u03c6(Xc), Y(c,0)].\nHere, \u03c6(Xc) denotes the eigen-function representation of the coordinate portion and Y(c,0) denotes\nthe signal portion of the context set at time t = 0. We define the forward process for the context set\nby diffusing the signal and keeping the eigen-functions fixed:\nCt = [\u03c6(Xc), Y(c,t) = \u221a\u00af\u03b1tY(c,0) +\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5c],\n(1)\nwhere \u03f5c \u223c N(0, I) is a noise vector of the appropriate size. We now turn to the task of formulating\na score network for fields. Following (Zhuang et al., 2023), the score network needs to take as input\nthe context set (i.e.\nthe field parametrization), and needs to accept being evaluated continuously in\nM. We do this by employing a query set {xq, y(q,0)}. Equivalently to the context set, we row-wise\nstack query pairs and denote the resulting matrix as Q0 = [\u03c6(Xq), Y(q,0)]. Note that the forward\ndiffusion process is equivalently defined for both context and query sets:\nQt = [\u03c6(Xq), Y(q,t) = \u221a\u00af\u03b1tY(q,0) +\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5q],\n(2)\nwhere \u03f5q \u223c N(0, I) is a noise vector of the appropriate size. The underlying field is solely defined\nby the context set, and the query set are the function evaluations to be de-noised. The resulting score\nfield model is formulated as follows, \u02c6\u03f5q = \u03f5\u03b8(Ct, t, Qt).\nUsing the explicit field characterization and the score field network, we obtain the training and\ninference procedures in Alg. 1 and Alg. 2, respectively, which are accompanied by illustrative\nexamples of sampling a field encoding a Gaussian mixture model over the manifold (i.e.\nthe bunny).\nFor training, we uniformly sample context and query sets from f0 \u223c Uniform(q(f0)) and only\ncorrupt their signal using the forward process in Eq. equation 1 and Eq. equation 2. We train the score\nfield network \u03f5\u03b8 to denoise the signal portion of the query set, given the context set. During sampling,\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nAlgorithm 1 Training\n1: \u2206M\u03c6i = \u03c6i\u03bbi // LBO eigen-decomposition\n2: repeat\n3:\n(C0, Q0) \u223c Uniform(q(f0))\n4:\nt \u223c Uniform({1, . . . , T})\n5:\n\u03f5c \u223c N(0, I), \u03f5q \u223c N(0, I)\n6:\nCt = [\u03c6(Xc), \u221a\u00af\u03b1tY(c,0) + \u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5c]\n7:\nQt = [\u03c6(Xq), \u221a\u00af\u03b1tY(q,0) + \u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5q]\n8:\nTake gradient descent step on\n\u2207\u03b8 \u2225\u03f5q \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(Ct, t, Qt)\u22252\n9: until converged\nFigure 4: Left: MDF training algorithm.

Similar to (Zhuang et al., 2023) we set the context set to be a random\nsubset of the query set. We use the context set to denoise the query set and follow ancestral sampling\nas in the vanilla DDPM (Ho et al., 2020). Note that during inference the eigen-function representation\n\u03c6(x) of the context and query sets does not change, only their corresponding signal value.\n5\nEXPERIMENTS\nWe validate the practicality of MDF via extensive experiments including synthetic and real-world\nproblems. In Sect. 5.1 we provide results for learning distributions of functions on a fixed manifold\n(e.g.\nclimate science), where functions change but manifolds are fixed across all functions. In\naddition, in Sect. 5.2 we show that MDF is robust to different manifold parametrizations. Finally,\nin Sect. 5.3 we also provide results on a generalized setting where manifolds are different for each\nfunction (e.g. molecule conformer generation). As opposed to generative models over images, we\ncannot rely on FID (Heusel et al., 2017) type metrics for evaluation since functions are defined on\ncurved geometries. We borrow metrics from generative modeling of point cloud data (Achlioptas\net al., 2018), namely Coverage (COV) and Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). We compute COV\nand MMD metrics based on the l2 distance in signal space for corresponding vertices in the manifolds.\n5.1\nDISTRIBUTIONS OF FUNCTIONS ON A FIXED MANIFOLD\nWe evaluate MDF on 3 different manifolds that are fixed across functions: a sine wave, the Stanford\nbunny and a human mesh. These manifolds have an increasing average mean curvature |K| (averaged\nover vertices), which serves as a measure for how distant they are from being globally Euclidean.

We use an off-the-shelf texture mapping approach\n(Sullivan & Kaszynski, 2019) to map images to manifolds, see Fig. 1. We compare MDF with\nDiffusion Probabilistic Fields (DPF) (Zhuang et al., 2023) a generative model for fields in ambient\nspace, where points in the manifold are parametrized by the Fourier PE of its coordinates in 3D space.\nTo provide a fair comparison we equate all the hyper-parameters in both MDF and DPF (Zhuang\net al., 2023). Tab. 1-2-3 show results for the different approaches and tasks. We observe that MDF\ntends to outperform DPF (Zhuang et al., 2023), both in terms of covering the empirical distribution,\nresulting in higher COV, but also in the fidelity of the generated fields, obtaining a lower MMD.\nIn particular, MDF outperforms DPF (Zhuang et al., 2023) across the board for manifolds of large\nmean curvature |K|. We attribute this behaviour to our choice of using intrinsic functional basis (e.g.\neigen-functions of the LBO) to represent a coordinate system for points in the manifold. Fig. 1 shows\na side to side comparison of real and generated functions on different manifolds obtained from MDF.\nWe also compare MDF with GASP (Dupont et al., 2022b), a generative model for continuous functions\nusing an adversarial formulation. We compare MDF and GASP performance on the CelebA-HQ\ndataset (Karras et al., 2018) mapped on the bunny manifold. Additionally, we report results on the\nERA5 climate dataset (Dupont et al., 2022b), which is composed of functions defined on the sphere\nf : S2 \u2192 R1 (see Fig. 1). For the ERA5 dataset we use spherical harmonics to compute \u03c6, which are\nequivalent to the analytical eigen-functions of the LBO on the sphere (L\u00e9vy, 2006). To compare with\nGASP we use their pre-trained models to generate samples. In the case of CelebA-HQ, we use GASP\nto generate 2D images and map them to the bunny manifold using (Sullivan & Kaszynski, 2019).\nExperimental results in Tab. 5 show that MDF outperforms GASP in both ERA5(Hersbach et al.,\n2020) and CelebA-HQ datasets, obtaining both higher coverage but also higher fidelity in generated\nfunctions.

Results in Fig. 7 show that performance initially increases\nwith the number of eigen-functions up to a point where high frequency eigen-functions of the LBO\nare not needed to faithfully encode the distribution of functions.\nFigure 7:\nPerformance of\nMDF as a function of the num-\nber of eigen-functions of the\nLBO, measured by COV and\nMMD metrics. As expected,\nperformance\nincreases\nini-\ntially as more eigen-functions\nare used, followed by a plateau\nphase for more than k = 32\neigen-functions.\n5.2\nMANIFOLD PARAMETRIZATION\nMDF uses the eigen-functions of the LBO as positional embeddings. In practice, different real-world\nproblems parametrize manifolds in different ways, and thus, have different ways of computing\nthe LBO. For example, in computer graphics the usage of 3D meshes and cotangent Laplacians\n(Rustamov et al., 2007) is widespread. In computer vision, 3D geometry can also be represented as\npointclouds which enjoy sparsity benefits and for which Laplacians can also be computed (Sharp &\nCrane, 2020). Finally, in computational chemistry problems, molecules are represented as undirected\ngraphs of atoms connected by bonds, in this case graph Laplacians are commonly used (Maskey et al.,\n2022). In Fig. 8 we show the top-2 eigenvectors of these different Laplacians on the bunny manifold.\nIn Tab. 6 we show the performance of MDF on the bunny mesh on different datasets using different\nmanifold parametrizations and their respective Laplacian computation. These results show that MDF\nis relatively robust to different Laplacians and can be readily applied to any of these different settings\nby simply computing eigenvectors of the appropriate Laplacian.\nGMM\nMNIST\nCelebA-HQ\nCOV\u2191\nMMD \u2193\nCOV\u2191\nMMD\u2193\nCOV\u2191\nMMD \u2193\nGraph\n0.575\n0.00108\n0.551\n0.07205\n0.346\n0.11101\nCotangent\n0.581\n0.00384\n0.568\n0.06890\n0.374\n0.12440\nPointcloud\n0.588\n0.00417\n0.571\n0.06909\n0.337\n0.12297\nTable 6: Performance of MDF using different\nLaplacians for different datastets on the bunny\nmanifold, where we see that MDF is relatively\nrobust and can be readily deployed on different\nsettings depending on the manifold parametriza-\ntion.\nFigure 8: Visualizing top-2 eigenvectors on the\nbunny manifold for Graph, Cotangent and Point-\ncloud (Sharp & Crane, 2020) Laplacians.\n5.3\nGENERALIZING ACROSS MANIFOLDS\nWe now generalize the problem setting to learning distributions over functions where each function is\ndefined on a different manifold. In this setting, the training set is defined as {fi}i=0:N with functions\nfi : Mi \u2192 Y mapping elements from different manifolds Mi to a shared signal space Y. This is\na generalization of the setting in Sect. 5.1 where functions are defined as fi : M \u2192 Y , with the\nmanifold M being fixed across fi\u2019s. This generalized setting is far more complex than the fixed\nsetting since the model not only has to figure out the distribution of functions but also it needs to\nrepresent different manifolds in a consistent manner. To evaluate the performance of MDF in this\nsetting we tackle the challenging problem of molecule conformer generation (Xu et al., 2021; 2022;\nGanea et al., 2021; Jing et al., 2022) which is a fundamental task in computational chemistry and\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nrequires models to handle multiple manifolds. In this problem, manifolds Mi are parametrized\nas graphs that encode the connectivity structure between atoms of different types. From MDF\u2019s\nperspective a conformer is then a function fi : Mi \u2192 R3 that maps elements in the graph (e.g. .\natoms) to a point in 3D space. Note that graphs are just one of different the manifold representations\nthat are amenable for MDF as show in Sect. 5.2.\nFollowing the standard setting for molecule conformer prediction we use the GEOM-QM9 dataset\n(Ruddigkeit et al., 2012; Ramakrishnan et al., 2014) which contains \u223c 130K molecules ranging\nfrom \u223c 10 to \u223c 40 atoms. We report our results in Tab. 7 and compare with CGCF (Xu et al.,\n2021), GeoDiff (Xu et al., 2022), GeoMol (Ganea et al., 2021) and Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al.,\n2022). Note that both GeoMol (Ganea et al., 2021) and Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022)\nmake strong assumptions about the geometric structure of molecules and model domain-specific\ncharacteristics like torsional angles of bonds. In contraposition, MDF simply models the distribution\nof 3D coordinates of atoms without making any assumptions about the underlying structure. We use\nthe same train/val/test splits as Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022) and use the same metrics to\ncompare the generated and ground truth conformer ensembles: Average Minimum RMSD (AMR)\nand Coverage. These metrics are reported both for precision, measuring the accuracy of the generated\nconformers, and recall, which measures how well the generated ensemble covers the ground-truth\nensemble. We generate 2K conformers for a molecule with K ground truth conformers. Note that in\nthis setting, models are evaluated on unseen molecules (e.g. unseen manifolds Mi).\nWe report results on Tab. 7 where we see how MDF outperforms previous approaches. It is important\nto note that MDF is a general approach for learning functions on manifolds that does not make any\nassumptions about the intrinsic geometric factors important in conformers like torsional angles in\nTorsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022). This makes MDF simpler to implement and applicable to\nother settings in which intrinsic geometric factors are not known.\nRecall\nPrecision\nCoverage \u2191\nAMR \u2193\nCoverage \u2191\nAMR \u2193\nmean median mean median mean median mean median\nCGCF\n69.47\n96.15\n0.425\n0.374\n38.20\n33.33\n0.711\n0.695\nGeoDiff\n76.50 100.00 0.297\n0.229\n50.00\n33.50\n0.524\n0.510\nGeoMol\n91.50 100.00 0.225\n0.193\n87.60 100.00 0.270\n0.241\nTorsional Diff.\n92.80 100.00 0.178\n0.147\n92.70 100.00 0.221\n0.195\nMDF (ours)\n95.30 100.00 0.124\n0.074\n91.50 100.00 0.169\n0.101\nMDF (k = 16) 94.87 100.00 0.139\n0.093\n87.54 100.00 0.220\n0.151\nMDF (k = 8)\n94.28 100.00 0.162\n0.109\n84.27 100.00 0.261\n0.208\nMDF (k = 4)\n94.57 100.00 0.145\n0.093\n86.83 100.00 0.225\n0.151\nMDF (k = 2)\n93.15 100.00 0.152\n0.088\n86.97 100.00 0.211\n0.138\nTable 7: Molecule conformer generation results for GEOM-QM9 dataset. MDF obtains comparable\nor better results than the state-of-the-art Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022), without making any\nexplicit assumptions about the geometric structure of molecules (i.e. without modeling torsional\nangles). In addition, we show how performance of MDF changes as a function of the number of\neigen-functions k. Interestingly, with as few as k = 2 eigen-functions MDF is able to generate\nconsistent accurate conformations.\nFinally, In the appendix we present additional results that carefully ablate different architectures for\nthe score network \u03f5\u03b8 in A.7.1. As well as an extensive study of the robustness of MDF to both rigid\nand isometric transformations of the manifold M A.7.2. Finally, we also show conditional inference\nresults on the challenging problem of PDEs on manifolds A.7.3.\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we introduced MDF a diffusion probabilistic model that is capable of capturing distri-\nbutions of functions defined on general Riemannian manifolds. We leveraged tools from spectral\ngeometry analysis and use the eigen-functions of the manifold Laplace-Beltrami Operator to define\nan intrinsic coordinate system on which functions are defined. This allows us to design an efficient\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nrecipe for training a diffusion probabilistic model of functions whose domain are arbitrary geometries.\nOur results show that we can capture distributions of functions on manifolds of increasing complexity\noutperforming previous approaches, while also enabling the applications of powerful generative priors\nto fundamental scientific problems like forward and inverse solutions to PDEs, climate modeling, and\nmolecular chemistry.\n10\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nREFERENCES\nP.

These include the potential misuse of generative models to fabricate deceptive data,\nsuch as \"DeepFakes\" (Mirsky & Lee, 2021), the risk of training data leakage and associated privacy\nconcerns (Tinsley et al., 2021), and the potential to amplify existing biases in the training data (Jain\net al., 2020). For a comprehensive discussion on ethical aspects in the context of generative modeling,\nreaders are directed to (Rostamzadeh et al., 2021).\nA.2\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nAs MDF advances in learning function distributions over Riemannian manifolds, it does encounter\ncertain constraints and potential areas of future enhancement. One primary challenge is the computa-\ntional demand of the transformer-based score network in its basic form, even at lower resolutions.\nThis stems from the quadratic cost of calculating attention over context and query pairs. To mitigate\nthis, the PerceiverIO architecture, which scales in a linear manner with the number of query and\ncontext points, is utilized (Jaegle et al., 2022) in our experiments. Further exploration of other\nefficient transformer architectures could be a promising direction for future work (Zhai et al., 2022;\nDao et al., 2022). Furthermore, MDF, much like DDPM (Ho et al., 2020), iterates over all time steps\nduring sampling to generate a field during inference, a process slower than that of GANs. Current\nstudies have accelerated sampling (Song et al., 2021a), but at the expense of sample quality and\ndiversity. However, it\u2019s worth noting that improved inference methods such as (Song et al., 2021a)\ncan be seamlessly incorporated into MDF.\nSince MDF has the capability to learn distributions over fields defined on various Riemannian mani-\nfolds within a single model, in future work we are poised to enhance its capacity for comprehending\nand adapting to a broader range of geometrical contexts. This adaptability will further pave the\nway towards the development of general foundation models to scientific and engineering challenges,\nwhich can better account for the intricate geometric intricacies inherent in real-world scenarios.\nFor example, we aim to extend the application of MDF to inverse problems in PDEs. A noteworthy\nattribute of our model is its inherent capability to model PDEs on Riemannian manifolds trivially. The\nintrinsic structure of MDF facilitates not only the understanding and solving of forward problems,\nwhere PDEs are known and solutions to the forward problem are needed, but also inverse problems,\nwhere certain outcome or boundary conditions are known and the task is to determine the underlying\nPDE. Expanding our application to handle inverse problems in PDEs on Riemannian manifolds can\nhave profound implications for complex systems modeling, as it enhances our understanding of the\nmanifold structures and the way systems governed by PDEs interact with them.\nA.3\nDISCUSSION ON COMPUTING EMBEDDINGS\nWhen considering how to compute embeddings for points in a manifold M there are several options\nto explore. The simplest one is to adopt the ambient space in which the manifold is embedded as a\ncoordinate system to represent points (eg. a plain coordinate approach). For example, in the case of\n3D meshes one can assign a coordinate in R3 to every point in the mesh. As shown in Tab. 1-2-3-4\nthis approach (used by DPF) is outperformed by MDF. In addition, in Sect. A.6.2 we show that this\napproach is not robust wrt rigid or isometric transformations of the manifold. Note that manifolds\nare not always embedded in an ambient space. For example, in molecular conformation, molecular\ngraphs only represent connectivity structure between atoms but are not necessarily embedded in a\nhigher dimensional space.\nAnother method that one can consider is to use a local chart approach. Local charts are interesting\nbecause they provide a way assigning a set of coordinates to points in a local region of the manifold.\nWhile the manifold may have arbitrary curvature, local charts are always Euclidean spaces. Each\npoint in the manifold can be described by a unique set of coordinates in the chart, but different charts\nmay overlap. However, this requires computing transformations (often complex to implement) to\nconvert coordinates from one chart to another.\n15\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFinally, the eigen-functions of the LBO not only provide a way of assigning a coordinate to points on a\nmanifold but also do this by defining an intrinsic coordinate system. This intrinsic coordinate system is\nglobal, and does not require transformations like local charts do. In addition, this intrinsic coordinate\nsystem is robust wrt rigid or isometric transformations of the manifold (ref A.6.2). Summarizing, this\nintrinsic coordinate system is a more fundamental way of describing the manifold, based on its own\ninherent properties, without reference to an external ambient space.\nA.4\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nIn this section we describe implementation details for all our experiments. These include all details\nabout the data: manifolds and functions, as well as details for computing the eigen-functions \u03c6. We\nalso provide hyper-parameters and settings for the implementation of the score field network \u03f5\u03b8 and\ncompute used for each experiment in the paper.\nA.4.1\nDATA\nUnless explicitly described in the main paper, we report experiments on 5 different manifolds which\nwe show in Fig. 9. This manifolds are: a parametric sine wave Fig. 9(a) computed using (Sullivan\n& Kaszynski, 2019) containing 1024 vertices. The Stanford bunny with 5299 vertices Fig. 9(b). A\nhuman body mesh from the Tosca dataset (Bronstein et al., 2008) containing 4823 vertices, show in\nFig. 9(c). A cat mesh and its reposed version from (Sumner & Popovic, 2004), show in Fig. 9(d)\nand Fig. 9(e), respectively containing 7207 vertices. To compute the mean curvature values |K| for\neach mesh reported in the main paper we compute the absolute value of the average mean curvature,\nwhich we obtain using (Sullivan & Kaszynski, 2019).\nFigure 9: Manifolds used in the different experiments throughout the paper.

(e) Cat (re-posed) (Sumner &\nPopovic, 2004).\nIn terms of datasets of functions on these manifolds we use the following:\n\u2022 A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dataset with 3 components, where in each field the 3\ncomponents are randomly placed on the specific manifold. We define a held out test set\ncontaining 10k samples.\n\u2022 MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) and CelebA-HQ (Karras et al., 2018) datasets, where images are\ntexture mapped into the meshes using (Sullivan & Kaszynski, 2019), models are evaluated\non the standard tests sets for these datasets.\n\u2022 The ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) dataset used to compare with GASP (Dupont\net\nal.,\n2022b)\nis\navailable\nat\nhttps://github.com/EmilienDupont/\nneural-function-distributions.\nThis dataset contains a train set of\n8510 samples and a test set of 2420 samples, which are the settings used in GASP (Dupont\net al., 2022b). To compare with GASP we used their pretrained model available available at\n1\n1https://github.com/EmilienDupont/neural-function-distributions\n16\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 10: Interaction between context and query pairs in the PerceiverIO architecture. Context pairs\nCt attend to a latent array of learnable parameters via cross attention. The latent array then goes\nthrough several self attention blocks. Finally, the query pairs Qt cross-attend to the latent array to\nproduce the final noise prediction \u02c6\u03f5q.\nA.5\nCOMPUTING THE LAPLACIAN AND \u03c6\nIn practice, for general geometries (e.g. general 3D meshes with n vertices) we compute eigenvectors\nof the symmetric normalized graph Laplacian L. We define L as follows:\nL = D\u2212 1\n2 (D \u2212 A)D\u2212 1\n2 ,\n(3)\nwhere A \u2208 {0, 1}n\u00d7n is the discrete adjacency matrix and D is the diagonal degree matrix of the\nmesh graph. Note that eigenvectors of L converge to the eigen-functions of the LBO \u2206M as n \u2192 \u221e\n(Belkin & Niyogi, 2001; Bengio et al., 2003b;a). The eigen-decomposition of L can be computed\nefficiently using sparse eigen-problem solvers (Hernandez et al., 2009) and only needs to be computed\nonce during training. Note that eigen-vectors of L are only defined for the mesh vertices. In MDF,\nwe sample random points on the mesh during training and interpolate the eigenvector representation\n\u03c6 of the vertices in the corresponding triangle using barycentric interpolation.\nA.5.1\nSCORE FIELD NETWORK \u03f5\u03b8\nIn MDF, the score field\u2019s design space covers all architectures that can process irregularly sampled\ndata, such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and MLPs (Tolstikhin et al., 2021). The model is\nprimarily implemented using PerceiverIO (Jaegle et al., 2022), an effective transformer architecture\nthat encodes and decodes. The PerceiverIO was chosen due to its efficiency in managing large\nnumbers of elements in the context and query sets, as well as its natural ability to encode interactions\nbetween these sets using attention. Figure 10 demonstrates how these sets are used within the\nPerceiverIO architecture. To elaborate, the encoder maps the context set into latent arrays (i.e., a\ngroup of learnable vectors) through a cross-attention layer, while the decoder does the same for query\nset. For a more detailed analysis of the PerceiverIO architecture refer to (Jaegle et al., 2022).\nThe time-step t is incorporated into the score computation by concatenating a positional embedding\nrepresentation of t to the context and query sets. The specific PerceiverIO settings used in all\nquantitatively evaluated experiments are presented in Tab.8. Practically, the MDF network consists\nof 12 transformer blocks, each containing 1 cross-attention layer and 2 self-attention layers, except\nfor GEOM-QM9 we use smaller model with 6 blocks. Each of these layers has 4 attention heads.\nFourier position embedding is used to represent time-steps t with 64 frequencies. An Adam (Kingma\n& Ba, 2015) optimizer is employed during training with a learning rate of 1e \u2212 4. We use EMA with\na decay of 0.9999. A modified version of the publicly available repository is used for PerceiverIO 2.\n2https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/perceiver\n17\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nHyper-parameter\nWave\nBunny\nHuman\nGEOM-QM9\ntrain res.\n1024\n5299\n4823\nvariable\n#context set\n1024\n5299\n4823\nvariable\n#query set\n1024\n5299\n4823\nvariable\n#eigenfuncs (k)\n64\n64\n64\n28\n#freq pos. embed t\n64\n64\n64\n64\n#latents\n1024\n1024\n1024\n512\n#dim latents\n512\n512\n512\n256\n#blocks\n12\n12\n12\n6\n#dec blocks\n1\n1\n1\n1\n#self attends per block\n2\n2\n2\n2\n#self attention heads\n4\n4\n4\n4\n#cross attention heads\n4\n4\n4\n4\nbatch size\n96\n96\n96\n96\nlr\n1e \u2212 4\n1e \u2212 4\n1e \u2212 4\n1e \u2212 4\nepochs\n1000\n1000\n1000\n250\nTable 8: Hyperparameters and settings for MDF on different manifolds.\nA.5.2\nCOMPUTE\nEach model was trained on an machine with 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs, we trained models for 3 days.\nA.6\nMETRICS\nInstead of using FID type metrics commonly used for generative models over images (Heusel\net al., 2017), we must take a different approach for evaluating functions on curved geometries. Our\nsuggestion is to use metrics from the field of generative modeling of point cloud data (Achlioptas\net al., 2018), specifically Coverage (COV) and Minimum Matching Distance (MMD).\n\u2022 Coverage (COV) refers to how well the generated data set represents the test set. We first\nidentify the closest neighbour in the generated set for each field in the test set. COV is then\ncalculated as the proportion of fields in the generated set that have corresponding fields in\nthe test set. The distance between fields is determined using the average l2 distance in signal\nspace on the vertices of the mesh, usually in either R1 or R3 space in our experiments. A\nhigh COV score implies that the generated samples adequately represent the real samples.\n\u2022 Minimum Matching Distance (MMD), on the other hand, provides a measure of how\naccurately the fields are represented in the test set. This measure is required because in\nthe COV metric matches don\u2019t necessarily have to be close. To gauge the fidelity of the\ngenerated fields against the real ones, we pair each field in the generated set with its closes\nneigbour in the test set (MMD), averaging these distances for our final result. This process\nalso utilizes the l2 distance in signal space on the mesh vertices. MMD provides a good\ncorrelation with the authenticity of the generated set, as it directly depends on the matching\ndistances.\nAs a summary, COV and MMD metrics are complementary to each other. A model captures the\ndistribution of real fields with good fidelity when MMD is small and COV is large. In particular, at\nequivalent levels of MMD a higher COV is desired (Achlioptas et al., 2018), and vice-versa. This\nobservation correlates well with our results shown in Tab. 1-2-3 on the main paper, where MDF\nobtains comparable or better MMD score that DPF (Zhuang et al., 2023) while greatly improving\nCOV.\nA.7\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section we provide additional empirical results using different network architectures to\nimplement the score field network \u03f5\u03b8. Furthermore, we provide additional experiments on robustness\nto discretization.\n18\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nA.7.1\nARCHITECTURE ABLATION\nThe construction of MDF does not rely on a specific implementation of the score network \u03f5\u03b8. The\nscore model\u2019s design space encompasses a broad range of options, including all architectures capable\nof handling irregular data like transformers or MLPs. To substantiate this, we conducted an evaluation\non the GMM dataset and the Stanford bunny at a resolution of 602 vertices, comparing three distinct\narchitectures: a PerceiverIO (Jaegle et al., 2022), a standard Transformer Encoder-Decoder (Vaswani\net al., 2017), and an MLP-mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021). For a fair comparison, we approximated the\nsame number of parameters (around 55M) and settings (such as the number of blocks, parameters per\nblock, etc.) for each model and trained them over 500 epochs. Note that because of these reasons the\nnumbers reported in this section are not directly comparable to those shown in the main paper. We\nsimplified the evaluation by using an equal number of context and query pairs. Both the Transformer\nEncoder and MLP-mixer process context pairs using their respective architectures; the resulting\nlatents are then merged with corresponding query pairs and fed into a linear projection layer for final\nprediction.\nIn Tab. 9 we show that the MDF formulation is compatible with different architectural implementa-\ntions of the score field model. We observe relatively uniform performance across various architectures,\nranging from transformer-based to MLPs. Similar patterns are noted when examining qualitative\nsamples displayed in Fig. 11, corroborating our assertion that MDF\u2019s advantages stem from its\nformulation rather than the specific implementation of the score field model. Each architecture brings\nits own strengths\u2014for instance, MLP-mixers enable high throughput, transformer encoders are easy\nto implement, and PerceiverIO facilitates the handling of large and variable numbers of context and\nquery pairs. We posit that marrying the strengths of these diverse architectures promises substantial\nadvancement for MDF. Please note, these empirical results aren\u2019t directly comparable to those\nreported elsewhere in the paper, as these models generally possess around 50% of the parameters of\nthe models used in other sections.\nCOV \u2191\nMMD \u2193\nPeceiverIO (Jaegle et al., 2022)\n0.569\n0.00843\nTransf.

For this experiment we used the PerceiverIO\narchitecture and the GMM dataset on the Stanford bunny geometry with 602 vertices. We ran the same\nexperiment 3 times and measured performance using COV and MMD metrics. Our results show that\nacross the different training runs MDF obtained COV=0.569 \u00b1 0.007 and MMD=0.00843 \u00b1 0.00372.\nA.7.2\nROBUSTNESS OF MDF\nWe evaluate MDF\u2019s robustness to rigid and isometric transformations of the training manifold M.\nWe use the cat category geometries from (Sumner & Popovic, 2004) and build a dataset of different\nfields on the manifold by generating 2 gaussians around the area of the tail and the right paw of the\ncat. Note that every field is different since the gaussians are centered at different points in the tail\nand right paw, see Fig. 13(a). During training, the model only has access to fields defined on a fixed\nmanifold M (see Fig. 13(a)). We then evaluate the model on either a rigid Mrigid (shown in Fig.\n13(b)) or isometric Miso (Fig. 13(c)) transformation of M. Qualitatively comparing the transfer\nresults of MDF with DPF (Zhuang et al., 2023) in Fig. 13(d)-(e), we see a marked difference in\nfidelity and coverage of the distribution.\nIn Fig. 13 we show how performance changes as the magnitude of a rigid transformation (e.g.\na\nrotation about the z\u2212axis) of M increases. As expected, the performance of DPF (Zhuang et al.,\n2023) sharply declines as we move away from the training setting, denoted by a rotation of 0 radians.\nHowever, MDF obtains a stable performance across transformations, this is due to the eigen-function\nbasis being intrinsic to M, and thus, invariant to rigid transformations. In addition, in Tab. 4 we show\nresults under an isometric transformation of the manifold (e.g.\nchanging the pose of the cat, see Fig.\n19\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n(a) Real samples.\n(b) Transf. Enc-Dec (Vaswani et al., 2017).\n(c) MLP-mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021).\n(d) PerceiverIO (Jaegle et al., 2022).\nFigure 11: Qualitative comparison of different architectures to implement the score field model \u03f5\u03b8.\n13(c)). As in the rigid setting, the performance of DPF (Zhuang et al., 2023) sharply declines under\nan isometric transformation while MDF keeps performance constant. In addition, transferring to an\nisometric transformation (M \u2192 Miso) performs comparably with directly training on the isometric\ntransformation (Miso \u2192 Miso) up to small differences due to random weight initialization.\nFigure 12:\nRobustness of\nMDF and DPF (Zhuang et al.,\n2023) with respect to rigid\ntransformations of M. The\ndistribution of fields learned\nby MDF is invariant with re-\nspect to rigid transformations,\nwhile DPF (Zhuang et al.,\n2023) collapses due to learn-\ning distributions in ambient\nspace.\nWe also provide transfer results to different discretizations of M. To do so, we train MDF on a low\nresolution discretization of a manifold and evaluate transfer to a high resolution discretization. We use\nthe GMM dataset and the bunny manifold at 2 different resolutions: 1394 and 5570 vertices, which\nwe get by applying loop subdivision (Loop, 1987) to the lowest resolution mesh. Theoretically, the\nLaplacian eigenvectors \u03c6 are only unique up to sign, which can result in ambiguity when transferring\na pre-trained model to a different discretization. Empirically we did not find this to be an issue in\nour experiments. We hypothesize that transferring MDF from low to high resolution discretizations\nis largely a function of the number of eigen-functions used to compute \u03c6. This is because eigen-\nfunctions of small eigenvalue represent low-frequency components of the manifold which are more\nstable across different discretizations. In Fig. 14 we report transfer performance as a function of\nthe number of eigen-functions used to compute \u03c6. We observe an initial regime where more eigen-\nfunctions aid in transferring (up to 64 eigen-functions) followed by a stage where high-frequency\neigen-functions negatively impact transfer performance.\n20\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 13: (a) Training set composed of different fields f : M \u2192 R where 2 gaussians are randomly\nplaced in the tail and the right paw of the cat.

In this setting the low\nresolution mesh contains 1000 vertices and the high resolution mesh contains 4000 vertices. As\nshow in Fig. 16 the results are consistent across manifolds, and a similar trend as in Fig. 14 can be\nobserved. This trend further reinforces our hypothesis that low frequency eigen-functions transfer\nbetter across discretization than high frequency ones.\nFigure 15: (a) Low and high resolution discretizations of the Stanford bunny manifold used for the\ntransfer experiments in the main paper (Fig. 14).

In particular, we create a dataset\nof different simulations of the heat diffusion PDE on a manifold. As a result, every sample in our\ntraining distribution f0 \u223c q(f0) is a temporal field f : M \u00d7 R \u2192 R. We create a training set of 10k\nsamples where each sample is a rollout of the PDE for 10 steps given initial conditions. We generate\ninitial conditions by uniformly sampling 3 gaussian heat sources of equivalent magnitude on the\nmanifold and use FEM (Reddy, 2019) to compute the rollout over time. For this experiment we use a\nversion of the bunny mesh with 602 vertices as a manifold M and set the diffusivity term of the PDE\nto D = 0.78. We then train MDF on this training set of temporal fields f : M \u00d7 R \u2192 R, which in\npractice simply means concatenating a Fourier PE of the time step to the eigen-functions of the LBO.\nWe tackle the forward problem where we are given the initial conditions of the PDE and the model is\ntasked to predict the forward dynamics on a test set of 60 held out samples. To perform conditional\ninference with MDF we follow the recipe in (Lugmayr et al., 2022) which has been successful in the\nimage domain. We show the forward dynamics predicted by FEM (Reddy, 2019) on Fig. 17(a) and\nMDF Fig. 17(b) for the same initial conditions in the held out set. We see how MDF successfully\ncaptures temporal dynamics, generating a temporal field consistent with observed initial conditions.\nEvaluating the full test set MDF obtains an mean squared error MSE = 4.77e10 \u2212 3. In addition,\nMDF can directly be used for inverse problems (Isakov, 2006). Here we focus on inverting the full\ndynamics of the PDE, conditioned on sparse observations. Fig. 17(c) shows sparse observations of\nthe FEM rollout, amounting to observing 10% of the field. Fig. 17(d) shows a probabilistic solution\nto the inverse PDE problem generated by MDF which is consistent with the FEM dynamics in Fig.\n17(a).\nFigure 17: (a) Forward prediction of the heat diffusion PDE computed with FEM (Reddy, 2019).\n(b) Conditionally sampled field generated by MDF.

We hope this work can help build small yet power-\nful diffusion models with feasible training budgets.\n1. Introduction\nStable Diffusion models (SDMs) [52, 55] are one of the\nmost renowned open-source models for text-to-image (T2I)\nsynthesis, and their exceptional capability has begun to be\nleveraged as a backbone in several text-guided vision ap-\nplications [2, 3, 78, 81]. SDMs are T2I-specialized latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs) [55], which employ diffusion op-\nerations [20, 33, 70] in a semantically compressed space\nfor compute efficiency. Within a SDM, a U-Net [7, 58] per-\nforms iterative sampling to progressively denoise a random\nlatent code and is aided by a text encoder [48] and an im-\nage decoder [10, 75] to produce text-aligned images. This\ninference process still involves excessive computational re-\nquirements (see Fig. 2), which often hinder the utilization of\nSDMs despite their rapidly growing usage.\nTo alleviate this issue, numerous approaches toward ef-\nficient SDMs have been introduced. A pretrained diffusion\nmodel is distilled to reduce the number of denoising steps,\nenabling an identically architectured model with fewer sam-\npling steps [37, 39]. Post-training quantization [22, 30, 68]\nand implementation optimization [5] methods are also lever-\naged. However, the removal of architectural elements in\n1\narXiv:2305.15798v3  [cs.LG]  16 Nov 2023\nlarge diffusion models remains less explored.\nThis study unlocks the immense potential of classical\narchitectural compression in attaining smaller and faster\ndiffusion models. We eliminate multiple residual and at-\ntention blocks from the U-Net of a SDM and retrain it\nwith feature-level knowledge distillation (KD) [16, 57] for\ngeneral-purpose T2I. Under restricted training resources, our\ncompact models can mimic the original SDM by leveraging\ntransferred knowledge. Our work effectively reduces the\ncomputation of SDM-v1.4 [52] and SDM-v2.1-base [56]\nwhile achieving compelling zero-shot results on par with\nmulti-billion parameter models [8, 9, 49]. Our contributions\nare summarized as follows:\n\u25e6 We compress SDMs by removing architectural blocks\nfrom the U-Net, achieving up to 51% reduction in model\nsize and 43% improvement in latency on CPU and GPU.\nPrevious pruning studies [11, 41, 79] focused on small\nmodels (<100M parameters) like ResNet50 and DeiT-B,\nnot on foundation models like SDMs (>1,000M=1B),\npossibly due to the lack of economic retraining for such\nlarge models. Moreover, U-Net architectures are arguably\nmore complex due to the necessity of considering skip\nconnections across the network, making the structural\nblock removal inside them not straightforward.\n\u25e6 To the best of our knowledge, we first demonstrate the\nnotable benefit of feature distillation for training diffusion\nmodels, which enables competitive T2I even with signif-\nicantly fewer resources (using only 13 A100 days and\n0.22M LAION pairs [64]). Considering the vast expense\nof training SDMs from scratch (surpassing 6,000 A100\ndays and 2,000M pairs), our study indicates that network\ncompression is a remarkably cost-effective strategy in\nbuilding compact general-purpose diffusion models.\n\u25e6 We show the practicality of our work across various as-\npects. Our lightweight backbones are readily applicable\nto customized generation [59] and image-to-image trans-\nlation [38], effectively lowering finetuning and inference\ncosts. T2I synthesis on Jetson AGX Orin and iPhone 14\nusing our models takes less than 4 seconds.\n\u25e6 We have publicly released our approach, model weights,\nand source code: https://github.com/Nota-\nNetsPresso/BK-SDM. Interesting subsequent works\ninclude block pruning and KD for the SDM-v1 variant\n[66] and SDXL [67].\n2. Related work\nLarge T2I diffusion models.\nBy gradually removing\nnoise from corrupted data, diffusion-based generative mod-\nels [7, 21, 70] enable high-fidelity synthesis with broad mode\ncoverage. Integrating these merits with the advancement of\npretrained language models [6, 47, 48] has significantly im-\nproved the quality of T2I synthesis.

SDMs [52, 53, 55, 56] perform the diffu-\nsion modeling in a low-dimensional latent space constructed\nthrough a pixel-space autoencoder. We use SDMs as our\nbaseline because of its open-access and gaining popularity\nover numerous downstream tasks [2, 3, 59, 78].\nEfficient diffusion models. Several studies have addressed\nthe slow sampling process.\nDiffusion-tailored distilla-\ntion [37, 39, 61] progressively transfers knowledge from\na pretrained diffusion model to a fewer-step model with\nthe same architecture. Fast high-order solvers [34, 35, 83]\nfor diffusion ordinary differential equations boost the sam-\npling speed. Complementarily, our network compression\napproach reduces per-step computation and can be easily\nintegrated with less sampling steps. Leveraging quantiza-\ntion [22, 30, 68] and implementation optimizations [5] for\nSDMs can also be combined with our compact models for\nfurther efficiency.\nDistillation-based compression. KD enhances the perfor-\nmance of small-size models by exploiting output-level [19,\n44] and feature-level [16, 57, 80] information of large source\nmodels.\nAlthough this classical KD has been actively\nused for efficient GANs [29, 51, 82], its power has not\nbeen explored for structurally compressed diffusion models.\nDistillation pretraining enables small yet capable general-\npurpose language models [24, 63, 71] and vision transform-\ners [14, 74]. Beyond such models, we show that its success\ncan be extended to diffusion models with iterative sampling.\nConcurrent studies. SnapFusion [31] achieves an efficient\nU-Net for SDMs through architecture evolution and step dis-\ntillation. W\u00fcrstchen [45] introduces two diffusion processes\non low- and high-resolution latent spaces for economic train-\ning. These two works are valuable but require much larger re-\nsources than our work (see Tab. 1). While not demonstrated\non SDMs, Diff-Pruning [12] proposes structured pruning\nbased on Taylor expansion tailored for diffusion models.\n2\nDn\nDn\nDn\nDn\nUp\nUp\nUp\nUp\nMid\nCv\nCv\nLatent\n4 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\nNoise\n4 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\nR\n1,1\nA\n1,1\nR\n1,2\nA\n1,2\nCv\nDn\nR\n2,1\nA\n2,1\nR\n2,2\nA\n2,2\nCv\nDn\nR\n3,1\nA\n3,1\nR\n3,2\nA\n3,2\nCv\nDn\nR\n4,1\nR\n4,2\nR\n5,1\nA\n5,1\nR\n5,2\nR\n6,1\nR\n6,2\nCv\nUp\n\u29fa\n\u29fa\n\u29fa R\n6,3\nR\n7,1\nA\n7,1\nR\n7,2\nA\n7,2\nCv\nUp\n\u29fa\n\u29fa\n\u29fa R\n7,3\nA\n7,3\nR\n8,1\nA\n8,1\nR\n8,2\nA\n8,2\nCv\nUp\n\u29fa\n\u29fa\n\u29fa R\n8,3\nA\n8,3\nR\n9,1\nA\n9,1\nR\n9,2\nA\n9,2\n\u29fa\n\u29fa\n\u29fa R\n9,3\nA\n9,3\nCv\nChannel\nConcat\n\u29fa\nConv (same spatial size)\nDownsample Conv\nUpsample Conv\nCv\nDn\nCv\nUp\nCrossAttentionBlock\n(text-embedding\nconditioned)\nA\nResBlock\n(time-embedding\nconditioned) \nR\nDn\nMid\nUp\nDown Stage\nMid-Stage\nUp Stage\n320 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n320 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n2\n640 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n4 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n4\n1280 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n8 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n8\n1280 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n8 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n8\n1280 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n4 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n4\n1280 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n2\n640 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n320 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n1280 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3b\n8 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a\n8\nRemoved from \nOriginal SDM:\nBK-SDM-Base\nBK-SDM-Small\nBK-SDM-Tiny\nFigure 3.

Minor impact of removing the mid-stage from the\nU-Net. Results without retraining. See Sec. B for additional results.\n3. Compression Method\nWe compress the U-Net [58] in SDMs, which is the most\ncompute-heavy component (see Fig. 2). Conditioned on the\ntext and time-step embeddings, the U-Net performs multiple\ndenoising steps on latent representations. At each step, the\nU-Net produces the noise residual to compute the latent for\nthe next step. We reduce this per-step computation, leading\nto Block-removed Knowledge-distilled SDMs (BK-SDMs).\n3.1. Compact U-Net architecture\nThe following architectures are obtained by compressing\nSDM-v1 (1.04B parameters), as shown in Fig. 3:\n\u25e6 BK-SDM-Base (0.76B) obtained with Sec. 3.1.1.\n\u25e6 BK-SDM-Small (0.66B) with Secs. 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.\n\u25e6 BK-SDM-Tiny (0.50B) with Secs. 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3.\nOur approach can be identically applied to SDM-v2 (1.26B\nparameters), leading to BK-SDM-v2-{Base (0.98B), Small\n(0.88B), Tiny (0.72B)}.\n3.1.1\nFewer blocks in the down and up stages\nThis approach is closely aligned with DistilBERT [63]\nwhich halves the number of layers and initializes the com-\npact model with the original weights by benefiting from the\nshared dimensionality. In the original U-Net, each stage with\na common spatial size consists of multiple blocks, and most\nstages contain pairs of residual (R) [15] and cross-attention\n(A) [23, 76] blocks. We hypothesize the existence of some\nunnecessary pairs and use the following removal strategies.\nDown stages. We maintain the first R-A pairs while elim-\ninating the second pairs, because the first pairs process the\nRemoved or Replaced* Block\nDown\nDown\nDown\nDown Mid\nUp\nUp\nUp\nUp\nRemoved or Replaced* Block Group\nCLIP Score (5K)\nCLIP Score (5K)\nDown\nMid\nUp\nUp\nUp\nUp\nDown\nDown\nDown\nSDM-v1.4\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5.

C for further analysis.\nchanged spatial information and would be more important\nthan the second pairs. This design is consistent with the\npruning sensitivity analysis that measures the block-level\nsignificance (see Fig. 5). Our approach also does not harm\nthe dimensionality of the original U-Net, enabling the use of\nthe corresponding pretrained weights for initialization [63].\nUp stages. While adhering to the aforementioned scheme,\nwe retain the third R-A pairs. This allows us to utilize the\noutput feature maps at the end of each down stage and the\ncorresponding skip connections between the down and up\nstages. The same process is applied to the innermost down\nand up stages that contain only R blocks.\n3.1.2\nRemoval of the entire mid-stage\nSurprisingly, removing the entire mid-stage from the orig-\ninal U-Net does not noticeably degrade the generation qual-\nity while effectively reducing the parameters by 11% (see\nFig. 4). This observation is consistent with the minor role of\ninner layers in the U-Net generator of GANs [27].\nIntegrating the mid-stage removal with fewer blocks in\nSec. 3.1.1 further decreases compute burdens (Tab. 2) at the\n3\ncost of a slight decline in performance (Tab. 1). Therefore,\nwe offer this mid-stage elimination as an option, depending\non the priority between compute efficiency (using BK-SDM-\nSmall) and generation quality (BK-SDM-Base).\n3.1.3\nFurther removal of the innermost stages\nFor additional compression, the innermost down and up\nstages can also be pruned, leading to our lightest model BK-\nSDM-Tiny. This implies that outer stages with larger spatial\ndimensions and their skip connections play a crucial role in\nthe U-Net for T2I synthesis.\n3.1.4\nAlignment with pruning sensitivity analysis\nTo support the properness of our architectures, we mea-\nsure the importance of each block (see Fig. 5) and show\nthat unimportant blocks match with our design choices. The\nimportance is measured by how generation scores vary when\nremoving each residual or attention block from the U-Net. A\nsignificant drop in performance highlights the essential role\nof that block. Note that some blocks are not directly remov-\nable due to different channel dimensions between input and\noutput; we replace such blocks with channel interpolation\nmodules (denoted by \u201c*\u201d in Fig. 5) to mimic the removal\nwhile retaining the information.\nThe sensitivity analysis implies that the innermost down-\nmid-up stages and the second R-A pairs in the down stages\nplay relatively minor roles. Pruning these blocks aligns with\nour architectures, designed based on human knowledge (e.g.,\nprioritizing blocks with altered channel dimensions) and\nprevious studies [27, 63].\n3.2. Distillation-based retraining\nFor general-purpose T2I, we train our block-removed U-\nNet to mimic the behavior of the original U-Net (see Fig. 6).\nTo obtain the input of U-Net, we use pretrained-and-frozen\nencoders [55] for images and text prompts.\nGiven the latent representation z of an image and its\npaired text embedding y, the task loss for the reverse denois-\ning process [21, 55] is computed as:\nLTask = Ez,\u03f5,y,t\nh\n||\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5S(zt, y, t)||2\n2\ni\n,\n(1)\nwhere zt is a noisy latent code from the diffusion pro-\ncess [21] with the sampled noise \u03f5\u223cN(0, I) and time step\nt\u223cUniform(1, T), and \u03f5S(\u25e6) indicates the estimated noise\nfrom our compact U-Net student. For brevity, we omit the\nsubscripts of Ez,\u03f5,y,t[\u25e6] in the following notations.\nThe compact student is also trained to imitate the outputs\nof the original U-Net teacher, \u03f5T(\u25e6), with the following\noutput-level KD objective [19]:\nLOutKD = E\nh\n||\u03f5T(zt, y, t) \u2212 \u03f5S(zt, y, t)||2\n2\ni\n.\n(2)\n\ud835\udedcS\n\ud835\udedc\n\u2112\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\n\u2112\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc37\nTeacher\n\u2112\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc37\nNoisy Latent \ud835\udc33\ud835\udc61\nText Emb. \ud835\udc32\nTime Step \ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udedcT\nStudent\nDiffusion \ud835\udc33, \ud835\udedc, \ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc1fT\n\ud835\udc1fS\nDn Up\nUp\nDn\nUp\nDn\nUp\nDn\nMid\nGT Noise \ud835\udedc\nEstimation \ud835\udedcT, \ud835\udedcS\nFeature Map \ud835\udc1fT, \ud835\udc1fS\nFigure 6. Distillation-based retraining. The block-removed U-Net\nis trained effectively through the guidance of the original U-Net.\nA key to our approach is feature-level KD [16, 57] that\nprovides abundant guidance for the student\u2019s training:\nLFeatKD = E\nh X\nl\n||f l\nT(zt, y, t) \u2212 f l\nS(zt, y, t)||2\n2\ni\n,\n(3)\nwhere f l\nT(\u25e6) and f l\nS(\u25e6) represent the feature maps of the l-th\nlayer in a predefined set of distilled layers from the teacher\nand the student, respectively. While learnable regressors\n(e.g., 1\u00d71 convolutions to match the number of channels)\nhave been commonly used [51, 57, 69], our approach circum-\nvents this requirement. By applying distillation at the end of\neach stage in both models, we ensure that the dimensionality\nof the feature maps already matches, thus eliminating the\nneed for additional regressors.\nThe final objective is shown below, and we simply set\n\u03bbOutKD and \u03bbFeatKD as 1. Without loss-weight tuning, our\napproach is effective in empirical validation.\nL = LTask + \u03bbOutKDLOutKD + \u03bbFeatKDLFeatKD.\n(4)\n4. Experimental setup\nDistillation retraining. We primarily use 0.22M image-text\npairs from LAION-Aesthetics V2 (L-Aes) 6.5+ [64, 65],\nwhich are significantly fewer than the original training data\nused for SDMs [52, 56] (>2,000M pairs). In Fig. 11, dataset\nsizes smaller than 0.22M are randomly sampled from L-Aes\n6.5+, while those larger than 0.22M are from L-Aes 6.25+.\nZero-shot T2I evaluation. Following the popular proto-\ncol [49, 55, 60], we use 30K prompts from the MS-COCO\nvalidation split [32], downsample the 512\u00d7512 generated\nimages to 256\u00d7256, and compare them with the entire valida-\ntion set. We compute Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) [18]\nand Inception Score (IS) [62] to assess visual quality. We\nmeasure CLIP score [17, 48] with CLIP-ViT-g/14 model to\nassess text-image correspondence.\nDownstream tasks. For personalized generation, we use\nthe DreamBooth dataset [59] (30 subjects \u00d7 25 prompts \u00d7\n4\u223c6 images) and perform per-subject finetuning. Following\nthe evaluation protocol [59], we use ViT-S/16 model [4] for\nDINO score and CLIP-ViT-g/14 model for CLIP-I and CLIP-\nT scores. For image-to-image translation, input images are\nsourced from Meng et al.

Results on zero-shot MS-COCO 256\u00d7256 30K. Training resources include image-text pairs, batch size, iterations, and A100 days.\nDespite far smaller resources, our compact models outperform prior studies [8, 9, 49, 73, 84], showing the benefit of compressing existing\npowerful models. Note that FID fluctuates more than the other metrics over training progress in our experiments (see Figs. 9 and 11).\nImplementation details.\nWe adjust the codes in Dif-\nfusers [77] and PEFT [36]. We use a single NVIDIA A100\n80G GPU for main retraining and a single NVIDIA GeForce\nRTX 3090 GPU for per-subject finetuning. For compute\nefficiency, we always opt for 25 denoising steps of the U-Net\nat the inference phase, unless specified. The classifier-free\nguidance scale [20, 60] is set to the default value of 7.5.\nThe latent resolution is set to the default (H = W = 64 in\nFig. 3), yielding 512\u00d7512 images. See Sec. I for the details.\n5. Results\nAll the results in Secs. 5.1\u20135.4 were obtained with the\nfull benchmark protocal (MS-COCO 256\u00d7256 30K samples),\nexcept for Fig. 10 (512\u00d7512 5K samples). Unless specified,\nthe training setup in Tab. 1 was used.\n5.1. Comparison with existing works\nQuantitative comparison. Tab. 1 shows the zero-shot re-\nsults for general-purpose T2I. Despite being trained with\nonly 0.22M samples and having fewer than 1B parame-\nters, our compressed models demonstrate competitive per-\nformance on par with existing large models. A recent small\nSDM without paper evidence [46] relies on far more training\nresources: two-stage KD with two teachers (SDM-v1.4 and\nv1.5) and significantly longer iterations on a much larger\ndataset. In contrast, our lighter models yield compelling\nresults while saving on training budgets.\nVisual comparison. Fig. 7 depicts synthesized images with\nsome MS-COCO captions. Our compact models inherit the\nsuperiority of SDM and produce more photorealistic images\ncompared to the AR-based [9] and GAN-based [73, 84]\nbaselines. Noticeably, the same latent code results in a shared\nvisual style between the original and our models (6th\u20139th\ncolumns in Fig. 7), similar to the observation in transfer\nlearning for GANs [40]. See Sec. D for additional results.\n5.2. Computational gain\nTab. 2 shows how the compute reduction for each sam-\npling step of the U-Net affects the overall process. The\nper-step reduction effectively decreases MACs and inference\ntime by more than 30%. Notably, BK-SDM-Tiny has 50%\nfewer parameters than the original SDM.\n5.3.

Fig. 8 displays the per-word\nattribution maps [72] created by aggregating cross-attention\nscores over spatiotemporal dimensions.

Without KD, training solely with the denoising\ntask loss causes fluctuations or sudden drops in performance\n(indicated with green and cyan). In contrast, distillation (pur-\nple and pink) stabilizes and accelerates the training process,\ndemonstrating the benefit of providing sufficient hints for\ntraining guidance. Notably, our small- and tiny-size mod-\nels trained with KD (yellow and red) outperform the bigger\nbase-size model without KD (cyan). Additionally, while\nthe best FID score is observed early on, IS and CLIP score\nexhibit ongoing improvement, implying that judging models\nmerely with FID may be suboptimal.\nTrade-off results.

More denois-\ning steps improve generation quality at the cost of slower\ninference. Distillation retraining achieves much better trade-\noff curves than the baseline without KD.\n5.4. Impact of training resources on performance\nConsistent with existing evidence, the use of larger batch\nsizes, more extensive data, and longer iterations for training\nenhances performance in our work (see Tab. 5, Fig. 11, and\nSec. H). However, this benefit requires increased resource\ndemands (e.g., extended training days without multiple high-\nspec GPUs and greater data storage capacity). As such,\ndespite the better performing models in Tab. 5, we primarily\nreport the models with fewer resources. We believe that\naccessible training costs by many researchers can help drive\nadvancement in massive models.\n5.5. Application\nPersonalized T2I synthesis.

Our model, re-\nsembling the ability of the original SDM, faithfully produces\nimages given style-specified prompts and content pictures.\nSee Sec. F for additional results.\nDeployment on edge devices. We deploy our models trained\nwith 2.3M pairs and compare them against the original SDM\nunder the same setup on edge devices (20 denoising steps\non NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 32GB and 10 steps on iPhone\n14). Our models produce a 512\u00d7512 image within 4 seconds\n(see Tab. 7), while maintaining acceptable image quality\n(Fig. 1(d) and Sec. G).\nAnother LDM. SDMs are derived from LDMs [55], which\nshare a similar U-Net design across many tasks. To validate\nthe generality of our work, the same approach of BK-SDM-\nSmall is applied to compress an LDM for unconditional\ngeneration on CelebA-HQ [54]. Fig. 14 shows the efficacy\nof our architecture and distillation retraining.\n6. Conclusion\nWe uncover the potential of architectural compression for\ngeneral-purpose text-to-image synthesis with a renowned\nmodel, Stable Diffusion. Our block-removed lightweight\nmodels are effective for zero-shot generation, achieving com-\npetitive results against large-scale baselines. Distillation is\na key of our method, leading to powerful retraining even\nBackbone {Param}\nDINO\u2191\nCLIP-I\u2191\nCLIP-T\u2191\nFT (Time, Mem)\u2020\nSDM-v1.4 [52] {1.04B}\n0.728\n0.725\n0.263\n(882s, 23.0GB)\nBK-SDM-Base {0.76B}\n0.723\n0.717\n0.260\n(623s, 18.7GB)\nBK-SDM-Small {0.66B}\n0.720\n0.705\n0.259\n(604s, 17.2GB)\nBK-SDM-Tiny {0.50B}\n0.715\n0.693\n0.261\n(560s, 13.1GB)\nBase (Batch 64) {0.76B}\n0.718\n0.708\n0.262\n(623s, 18.7GB)\n- No KD & Random Init.\n0.594\n0.465\n0.191\n(623s, 18.7GB)\n- No KD & Teacher Init.\n0.716\n0.669\n0.258\n(623s, 18.7GB)\n\u2020: Per-subject FT time and GPU memory for 800 iterations with a batch size of 1 on NVIDIA RTX 3090.\nTable 6.

Distillation retraining process. The compact U-Net student is built by eliminating several residual and attention blocks from the\noriginal U-Net teacher. Through the feature and output distillation from the teacher, the student can be trained effectively yet rapidly. The\ndefault latent resolution for SDM-v1 and v2-base is H = W = 64 in Fig. 15, resulting in 512\u00d7512 generated images.\n1\nFig. 17 shows the details of architectural blocks. Each residual block (ResBlock) contains two 3-by-3 convolutional\nlayers and is conditioned on the time-step embedding. Each attention block (AttnBlock) contains a self-attention module, a\ncross-attention module, and a feed-forward network. The text embedding is merged via the cross-attention module. Within the\nattention block, the feature spatial dimensions h and w are flattened into a sequence length of hw. The number of channels c is\nconsidered as an embedding size, processed with attention heads. The number of groups for the group normalization is set to\n32. The differences between SDM-v1 and SDM-v2 include the number of attention heads (8 for all the stages of SDM-v1 and\n[5, 10, 20, 20] for different stages of SDM-v2) and the text embedding dimensions (77\u00d7768 for SDM-v1 and 77\u00d71024 for\nSDM-v2).\nResBlock\n(time-embedding\nconditioned) \nR\nTime Emb\n1280\nRes\nBlock\nFeature\n=\nSiLU\nLinear(1280, cout)\n[Time Emb] 1280\nShortcut\nIf cin \u2260 cout:\n1\u00d71-Conv(cin, cout)\nIf cin = cout:\nIdentity\nGroupNorm(32, cin)\nSiLU\n3\u00d73-Conv(cin, cout)\nGroupNorm(32, cout)\nSiLU\n3\u00d73-Conv(cin, cout)\n[Featin] cin\u00d7h\u00d7w\n[Featout] cout\u00d7h\u00d7w\ncout\u00d71\u00d71\nCrossAttentionBlock\n(text-embedding\nconditioned)\nA =\nText Emb\n77\u00d7768\nAttn\nBlock\nFeature\nGroupNorm(32, c)\n1\u00d71-Conv(c, c)\nReshape\n[Featin] cin\u00d7h\u00d7w\n(hw)\u00d7c\nc\u00d7h\u00d7w\nReshape\n1\u00d71-Conv(c, c)\n[Featout] c\u00d7h\u00d7w\nLayerNorm(c)\nSelf-Attention\nLayerNorm(c)\nCross-Attention\nLayerNorm(c)\nFeedForward\n[Text Emb] 77\u00d7768\n[Featin] c\u00d7h\u00d7w\n[Featout] c\u00d7(2h)\u00d7(2w)\n3\u00d73-Conv(c, c)\nInterpolate(f=2, \nmode= 'nearest' )\n[Featin] c\u00d7h\u00d7w\n3\u00d73-Conv(c, c, \nstride=2, pad=1)\n[Featout] c\u00d7(h/2)\u00d7(w/2)\n[Featin] cin\u00d7h\u00d7w\n[Featout] cout\u00d7h\u00d7w\n3\u00d73-Conv(cin, cout)\nIf First Conv: Identity\nIf Last Conv: GroupNorm-SiLU\nConv (spatial \nCv size preserved)\nDownsample\nConv\nCv\nDn\nUpsample\nConv\nCv\nUp\nSelf-Attention\nCross-Attention\nFeedForward\n[Featin] (hw)\u00d7c\nLinear(c, c)\nLinear(c, c)\nLinear(c, c)\nReshape\nReshape\nReshape\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d7(c/8)\nMatMul\nScale\nSoftMax\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d7(hw)\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d7(c/8)\n(hw)\u00d7c\nMatMul\nReshape\nLinear(c, c)\n[Featout] (hw)\u00d7c\nQ\nK\nV\n8\u00d7(c/8)\u00d7(hw)\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d7(c/8)\n[Featin] (hw)\u00d7c\nLinear(c, c)\nLinear(768, c)\nLinear(768, c)\nReshape\nReshape\nReshape\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d7(c/8)\n8\u00d777\u00d7(c/8)\nMatMul\nScale\nSoftMax\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d777\n8\u00d7(hw)\u00d7(c/8)\n(hw)\u00d7c\nMatMul\nReshape\nLinear(c, c)\n[Featout] (hw)\u00d7c\nQ\nK\nV\n[Text Emb] 77\u00d7768\n8\u00d7(c/8)\u00d777\n[Featin] (hw)\u00d7c\nLinear(c, 8c)\nSplit\n[Featout] (hw)\u00d7c\nGELU\nLinear(4c, c)\n(hw)\u00d74c\n(hw)\u00d74c\nTranspose\nTranspose\nFigure 17.

    "text": "Efficient Neural Music Generation\nMax W. Y. Lam, Qiao Tian, Tang Li, Zongyu Yin, Siyuan Feng, Ming Tu, Yuliang Ji,\nRui Xia, Mingbo Ma, Xuchen Song, Jitong Chen, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang\nSpeech, Audio & Music Intelligence (SAMI), ByteDance\nAbstract\nRecent progress in music generation has been remarkably advanced by the state-\nof-the-art MusicLM, which comprises a hierarchy of three LMs, respectively, for\nsemantic, coarse acoustic, and fine acoustic modelings. Yet, sampling with the Mu-\nsicLM requires processing through these LMs one by one to obtain the fine-grained\nacoustic tokens, making it computationally expensive and prohibitive for a real-\ntime generation. Efficient music generation with a quality on par with MusicLM\nremains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present MeLoDy (M for music;\nL for LM; D for diffusion), an LM-guided diffusion model that generates music\naudios of state-of-the-art quality meanwhile reducing 95.7% or 99.6% forward\npasses in MusicLM, respectively, for sampling 10s or 30s music. MeLoDy inherits\nthe highest-level LM from MusicLM for semantic modeling, and applies a novel\ndual-path diffusion (DPD) model and an audio VAE-GAN to efficiently decode the\nconditioning semantic tokens into waveform. DPD is proposed to simultaneously\nmodel the coarse and fine acoustics by incorporating the semantic information\ninto segments of latents effectively via cross-attention at each denoising step. Our\nexperimental results suggest the superiority of MeLoDy, not only in its practical\nadvantages on sampling speed and infinitely continuable generation, but also in its\nstate-of-the-art musicality, audio quality, and text correlation.\nOur samples are available at https://Efficient-MeLoDy.github.io/.\n1\nIntroduction\nMusic is an art composed of harmony, melody, and rhythm that permeates every aspect of human life.\nWith the blossoming of deep generative models [1\u20133], music generation has drawn much attention in\nrecent years [4\u20136]. As a prominent class of generative models, language models (LMs) [7, 8] showed\nextraordinary modeling capability in modeling complex relationships across long-term contexts\n[9\u201311]. In light of this, AudioLM [3] and many follow-up works [5, 12\u201314] successfully applied\nLMs to audio synthesis. Concurrent to the LM-based approaches, diffusion probabilistic models\n(DPMs) [1, 15, 16], as another competitive class of generative models [2, 17], have also demonstrated\nexceptional abilities in synthesizing speech [18\u201320], sounds [21, 22] and music [6, 23].\nHowever, generating music from free-form text remains challenging as the permissible music descrip-\ntions can be very diverse and relate to any of the genres, instruments, tempo, scenarios, or even some\nsubjective feelings. Conventional text-to-music generation models are listed in Table 1, where both\nMusicLM [5] and Noise2Music [6] were trained on large-scale music datasets and demonstrated the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative performances with high fidelity and adherence to various aspects\nof text prompts. Yet, the success of these two methods comes with large computational costs, which\nwould be a serious impediment to their practicalities. In comparison, Mo\u00fbsai [23] building upon\nDPMs made efficient samplings of high-quality music possible. Nevertheless, the number of their\ndemonstrated cases was comparatively small and showed limited in-sample dynamics. Aiming for a\nfeasible music creation tool, a high efficiency of the generative model is essential since it facilitates\ninteractive creation with human feedback being taken into account as in [24].\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2305.15719v1  [cs.SD]  25 May 2023\nTable 1: A comparison of MeLoDy with conventional text-to-music generation models in the literature.\nWe use AC to denote whether audio continuation is supported, FR to denote whether the sampling\nis faster than real-time on a V100 GPU, VT to denote whether the model has been tested and\ndemonstrated using various types of text prompts including instruments, genres, and long-form rich\ndescriptions, and MP to denote whether the evaluation was done by music producers.\nModel\nPrompts\nTraining Data\nAC\nFR\nVT\nMP\nMo\u00fbsai [23]\nText\n2.5k hours of music\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\nMusicLM [5]\nText, Melody\n280k hours of music\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2717\nNoise2Music [6]\nText\n340k hours of music\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2717\nMeLoDy (Ours)\nText, Audio\n257k hours of music1\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nWhile LMs and DPMs both showed promising results, we believe the relevant question is not whether\none should be preferred over another but whether we can leverage both approaches with respect to\ntheir individual advantages, e.g., [25]. After analyzing the success of MusicLM, we leverage the\nhighest-level LM in MusicLM, termed as semantic LM, to model the semantic structure of music,\ndetermining the overall arrangement of melody, rhythm, dynamics, timbre, and tempo. Conditional\non this semantic LM, we exploit the non-autoregressive nature of DPMs to model the acoustics\nefficiently and effectively with the help of a successful sampling acceleration technique [26]. All in\nall, in this paper, we introduce several novelties that constitute our main contributions:\n1. We present MeLoDy (M for music; L for LM; D for diffusion), an LM-guided diffusion\nmodel that generates music of competitive quality while reducing 95.7% and 99.6% iterations\nof MusicLM to sample 10s and 30s music, being faster than real-time on a V100 GPU.\n2. We propose the novel dual-path diffusion (DPD) models to efficiently model coarse and fine\nacoustic information simultaneously with a particular semantic conditioning strategy.\n3. We design an effective sampling scheme for DPD, which improves the generation quality\nover the previous sampling method in [23] proposed for this class of LDMs.\n4. We reveal a successful audio VAE-GAN that effectively learns continuous latent representa-\ntions, and is capable of synthesizing audios of competitive quality together with DPD.\n2\nRelated Work\nAudio Generation\nApart from the generation models shown in Table 1, there are also music\ngeneration models [28, 29] that can generate high-quality music samples at high speed, yet they\ncannot accept free-form text conditions and can only be trained to specialize in single-genre music,\ne.g., techno music in [29]. There also are some successful music generators in the industry, e.g.\nMubert [30] and Riffusion [31], yet, as analyzed in [5], they struggled to compete with MusicLM\nin handling free-form text prompts. In a more general scope of audio synthesis, some promising\ntext-to-audio synthesizers [12, 21, 22] trained with AudioSet [32] also demonstrated to be able to\ngenerate music from free-form text, but the musicality is limited. AudioLM [3] unconditionally\ncontinued piano audios with promising fidelity. Parallel to this work, SoundStorm [33] exceedingly\naccelerated the AudioLM with a non-autoregressive decoding scheme [34], such that the acoustic\nLM can be decoded in 27 forward passes. In comparison, neglecting the individual cost of networks,\nMeLoDy takes 5 to 20 forward passes to generate acoustics of high fidelity, as discussed in Section 5.\nNetwork Architecture\nThe architecture designed for our proposed DPD was inspired by the\ndual-path networks used in the context of audio separation, where Luo et al. [35] initiated the idea of\nsegmentation-based dual-path processing, and triggered a number of follow-up works achieving the\nstate-of-the-art results [36\u201340]. Noticing that the objective in diffusion models indeed can be viewed\nas a special case of source separation, this kind of dual-path architecture effectually provides us a\nbasis for simultaneous coarse-and-fine acoustic modeling.\n1We focus on non-vocal music data by using an audio classifier [27] to filter out in-house music data with\nvocals. Noticeably, generating vocals and instrumental music simultaneously in one model is defective even\nin the SOTA works [5, 6] because of the unnaturally sound vocals. While this work aims for generating\nproduction-level music, we improve the fidelity by reducing the tendency of generating vocals.\n2\n3\nBackground on Audio Language Modeling\nThis section provides the preliminaries that serve as the basis for our model. In particular, we briefly\ndescribe the audio language modeling framework used in MusicLM.\n3.1\nAudio Language Modeling with MusicLM\nMusicLM [5] mainly follows the audio language modeling framework presented in AudioLM [3],\nwhere audio synthesis is viewed as a language modeling task over a hierarchy of coarse-to-fine audio\ntokens. In AudioLM, there are two kinds of tokenization for representing different scopes of audio:\n\u2022 Semantic Tokenization: K-means over representations from SSL, e.g., w2v-BERT [41];\n\u2022 Acoustic Tokenization: Neural audio codec, e.g., SoundStream [42].\nTo better handle the hierarchical structure of the acoustic tokens, AudioLM further separates the\nmodeling of acoustic tokens into coarse and fine stages. In total, AudioLM defines three LM tasks:\n(1) semantic modeling, (2) coarse acoustic modeling, and (3) fine acoustic modeling.\nWe generally define the sequence of conditioning tokens as c1:Tcnd := [c1, . . . , cTcnd] and the sequence\nof target tokens as u1:Ttgt := [u1, . . . , uTtgt]. In each modeling task, a Transformer-decoder language\nmodel parameterized by \u03b8 is tasked to solve the following autoregressive modeling problem:\np\u03b8(u1:Ttgt|c1:Tcnd) =\nTtgt\nY\nj=1\np\u03b8(uj|[c1, . . . , cTcnd, u1, . . . , uj\u22121]),\n(1)\nwhere the conditioning tokens are concatenated to the target tokens as prefixes. In AudioLM, semantic\nmodeling takes no condition; coarse acoustic modeling takes the semantic tokens as conditions; fine\nacoustic modeling takes the coarse acoustic tokens as conditions. The three corresponding LMs can\nbe trained in parallel with the ground-truth tokens, but need to be sampled sequentially for inference.\n3.1.1\nJoint Tokenization of Music and Text with MuLan and RVQ\nTo maintain the merit of audio-only training, MusicLM relies on MuLan [43], which is a two-tower,\njoint audio-text embedding model that can be individually trained with large-scale music data and\nweakly-associated, free-form text annotations. The MuLan model is pre-trained to project the music\naudio and its corresponding text description into the same embedding space such that the associated\nembeddings can be close to each other. In MusicLM, the MuLan embeddings of music and text are\ntokenized using a separately learned residual vector quantization (RVQ) [42].\nDifferent from AudioLM, MusicLM employs the MuLan tokens as the additional prefixing tokens, as\nin Eq. (1), for the semantic modeling and the coarse acoustic modeling. During training, the audio is\nfirst fed to the MuLan music tower to obtain the music embedding. Then, an RVQ is applied to the\nmusic embedding, resulting in the ground-truth MuLan tokens for conditioning the semantic LM and\nthe coarse acoustic LM. To generate music from a text prompt, the text embedding obtained from the\nMuLan text tower is passed to the same RVQ and is discretized into the inference-time MuLan tokens.\nBased on the prefixing MuLan tokens, the semantic tokens, coarse acoustic tokens, and fine acoustic\ntokens are subsequently computed to generate high-fidelity music audio adhering to the text prompt.\n4\nModel Description\nThe overall training and sampling pipelines of MeLoDy are shown in Figure 1, where, we have three\nmodules for representation learning: (1) MuLan, (2) Wav2Vec2-Conformer, and (3) audio VAE, and\ntwo generative models: a language model (LM) and a dual-path diffusion (DPD) model, respectively,\nfor semantic modeling and acoustic modeling. In the same spirit as MusicLM, we leverage LM to\nmodel the semantic structure of music for its promising capability of modeling complex relationships\nacross long-term contexts [9\u201311]. Similar to MusicLM, we pre-train a MuLan model to obtain the\nconditioning tokens. For semantic tokenization, we opt to use the Wav2Vec2-Conformer model,\nwhich follows the same architecture as Wav2Vec2 [44] but employs the Conformer blocks [45] in\nplace of the Transformer blocks. The remainder of this section presents our newly proposed DPD\nmodel and the audio VAE-GAN used for DPD model, while other modules overlapped with MusicLM\nare described in Appendix B regarding the training and implementation details.\n3\nLM\nSemantic tokens\nDPD\nMuLan (audio/text tower)\nMuLan tokens\nRVQ\nLatent features\nSemantic Modeling\nAcoustic Modeling\n\u201cGive me a background \nmusic track suitable for \ntime-lapse videos.\u201d\nGenerated audio\nLM\nSemantic tokens\nWav2Vec2-Conformer\nDPD\nVAE-GAN\nSemantic tokens\nMuLan (audio tower)\nMuLan tokens\nRVQ\nk-means\nLatent features\nSample\nTarget audio:\nSemantic Modeling\nAcoustic Modeling\nEncoder\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udf0e\nTraining stage\nSampling stage\nMap to [-1, 1]\nDecoder\nVAE-GAN\nChunk-wise resample\nMap to [-1, 1]\nContinuation\nAudio prompt\nText prompt\nor\nNoise \ud835\udf50!!\nNoise \ud835\udf50\nFigure 1: The training and sampling pipelines of MeLoDy\n4.1\nDual-Dath Diffusion: Angle-Parameterized Continuous-Time Latent Diffusion Models\nThe proposed dual-path diffusion (DPD) model is a variant of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)\n[1, 15, 46] in continuous-time [16, 47\u201349]. Instead of directly operating on the raw data x \u223c pdata(x),\nwith reference to the latent diffusion models (LDMs) [2], we consider a low-dimensional latent\nrepresentation z = E\u03d5(x), where \u03d5 is a pre-trained autoencoder that enables reconstruction of the\nraw data from the latent: x \u2248 D\u03d5(z). Here, we use E\u03d5 to denote the encoder, and D\u03d5 to denote the\ndecoder. By working on a low-dimensional latent space, the computational burden of DPMs can\nbe significantly relieved [2]. We present our audio autoencoder in Section 4.2, which is tailored for\nDPMs and performed the stablest in our experiments.\nIn DPD, we consider a Gaussian diffusion process zt that is fully specified by two strictly positive\nscalar-valued, continuously differentiable functions \u03b1t, \u03c3t [16]: q(zt|z) = N(zt; \u03b1tz, \u03c32\nt I) for any\nt \u2208 [0, 1]. In the light of [48], we define \u03b1t := cos(\u03c0t/2) and \u03c3t := sin(\u03c0t/2) to benefit from\nsome nice trigonometric properties, i.e., \u03c3t =\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\nt (a.k.a. variance-preserving [16]). By this\ndefinition, zt can be elegantly re-parameterized in terms of angles \u03b4:\nz\u03b4 = cos(\u03b4)z + sin(\u03b4)\u03f5\nfor any \u03b4 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2],\n\u03f5 \u223c N(0, I).\n(2)\nNote that z\u03b4 gets noisier as \u03b4 increases from 0 to \u03c0/2, which defines the forward diffusion process.\nTo generate samples, we use a \u03b8-parameterized variational model p\u03b8(z\u03b4\u2212\u03c9|z\u03b4) to invert the diffusion\nprocess by enabling running backward in angle with 0 < \u03c9 \u2264 \u03b4. Based on this model, we can sample\nz from z\u03c0/2 \u223c N(0, I) with T sampling steps, by discretizing \u03c0/2 into T segments as follows:\np\u03b8(z|z\u03c0/2) =\nZ\nz\u03b41:T \u22121\nT\nY\nt=1\np\u03b8(z\u03b4t\u2212\u03c9t|z\u03b4t) dz\u03b41:T \u22121,\n\u03b4t =\n(\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212 PT\ni=t+1 \u03c9i,\n1 \u2264 t < T;\n\u03c0\n2 ,\nt = T,\n(3)\nwhere the angle schedule, denoted by \u03c91, . . . , \u03c9T , satisfies PT\nt=1 \u03c9t = \u03c0/2. Schneider et al. [23]\nproposed a uniform angle schedule: \u03c9t =\n\u03c0\n2T for all t. As revealed in previous scheduling methods\n[50, 51] for DPMs, taking larger steps at the beginning of the sampling followed by smaller steps\ncould improve the quality of samples. Following this strategy, we design a new linear angle schedule,\nwhich empirically gives more stable and higher-quality results, and is written as\n\u03c9t = \u03c0\n6T +\n2\u03c0t\n3T(T + 1).\n(4)\nWe extensively compare this linear angle schedule with the uniform one in [23] in Appendix D.\n4.1.1\nMulti-Chunk Velocity Prediction for Long-Context Generation\nFor model training, similar to the setting in [23] for long-context generation, the neural network\nis tasked to predict a multi-chunk target vtgt that comprises M chunks of velocities, each having a\ndifferent noise scale. Formally speaking, given that z, z\u03b4, \u03f5 \u2208 RL\u00d7D with L representing the length\nof audio latents and D representing the latent dimensions, we define vtgt := v1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 vM, where\nvm := cos(\u03b4m)\u03f5[Lm\u22121 : Lm, :] \u2212 sin(\u03b4m)z[Lm\u22121 : Lm, :],\nLm :=\n\u0016mL\nM\n\u0017\n.\n(5)\n4\nStacked SRUs \nAdd & RMSNorm\nFiLM\nMerge Segments\nAdd & RMSNorm\nRoformer\nSemantic tokens \ud835\udc2e!, \u2026 , \ud835\udc2e\"!\"\nLearnable \nEmbedding\nAngle vector \ud835\udf39\nLearnable Slerp\nRearrange to \nCoarse Path\nRearrange to \nFine Path\n\u2295\nAverage\nMLP\nMLP\nDual-Path Blocks\nSegmentation\nN x\nOverlap and Add\nNoisy Latent \ud835\udc33##\nPredicted Velocity \ud835\udc2f##\nLinear\nRMSNorm\nRMSNorm\nLinear\nRepeat Segments\nNetwork Architecture\nEncoding Conditions\nDual-Path Blocks\nFigure 2: The proposed dual-path diffusion (DPD) model\nHere, we use the NumPy slicing syntax (0 as the first index) to locate the m-th chunk, and we draw\n\u03b4m \u223c Uniform[0, \u03c0/2] for each chunk at each training step to determine the noise scale. To learn \u03b8,\nwe use the mean squared error (MSE) loss in [1, 48]:\nLdiff := Ez,\u03f5,\u03b41,...,\u03b4M\nh\n\u2225vtgt \u2212 \u02c6v\u03b8(znoisy; c)\u22252\n2\ni\n,\n(6)\nznoisy := cos(\u03b4m)z[Lm\u22121 : Lm, :] + sin(\u03b4m)\u03f5[Lm\u22121 : Lm, :],\n(7)\nwhere c generally denotes the collection of conditions used for the velocity prediction. In MeLoDy,\nas illustrated in Figure 1, we propose to use the semantic tokens u1, . . . , uTST, which are obtained\nfrom the SSL model during training and generated by the LM at inference time, to condition the DPD\nmodel. In our experiments, we find that the stability of generation can be significantly improved if we\nuse token-based discrete conditions to control the semantics of the music and let the diffusion model\nlearn the embedding vector for each token itself. Additionally, to assist the multi-chunk prediction,\nwe append an angle vector to the condition that represents the angles drawn in the M chunks:\nc := {u1, . . . , uTST, \u03b4} ,\n\u03b4 := [\u03b41]L1\nr=1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 [\u03b4M]LM\nr=1 \u2208 RL\n(8)\nwhere [a]B\nr=1 denotes the operation of repeating a scalar a for B times to make a B-length vector.\nSuppose we have a well-trained velocity model, for sampling, we apply the trigonometric identities\nto the DDIM sampling algorithm [26] (see Appendix A) and obtain a simplified update rule:\nz\u03b4t\u2212\u03c9t = cos(\u03c9t)z\u03b4t \u2212 sin(\u03c9t)\u02c6v\u03b8(z\u03b4t; c),\n(9)\nby which, using the angle schedule in Eq. (4) and running from t = T to t = 1, we get a sample of z.\n4.1.2\nDual-Path Modeling for Efficient and Effective Velocity Prediction\nNext, we present how \u02c6v\u03b8 takes in the noisy latent and the conditions and efficiently incorporates\nthe semantic tokens into the coarse processing path for effective velocity prediction. As a highlight\nof this work, we modify the dual-path technique borrowed from audio separation [35, 37, 38], and\npropose a novel architecture for efficient, simultaneous coarse and fine acoustic modeling, as shown\nin Figure 2. This architecture comprises several critical modules, which we present one by one below.\nTo begin with, we describe how the conditions are processed in DPD (the middle part in Figure 2):\nEncoding Angle Vector\nFirst, we encode \u03b4 \u2208 RL, which records the frame-level noise scales\nof latents. Instead of using the classical positional encoding [1], we use a Slerp-alike spherical\ninterpolation [52] to two learnable vectors estart, eend \u2208 R256 based on broadcast multiplications \u2297:\nE\u03b4 := MLP (sin(\u03b4) \u2297 estart + sin(\u03b4) \u2297 eend) \u2208 RL\u00d7Dhid,\n(10)\nwhere MLP(x) := RMSNorm(W2GELU(xW1 + b1) + b2) projects an arbitrary input x \u2208 RDin\nto RDhid using RMSNorm [53] and GELU activation [54]. Here, Dhid is hidden dimension defined\nfor the model, and W1 \u2208 RDin\u00d7Dhid, W2 \u2208 RDhid\u00d7Dhid, b1, b2 \u2208 RDhid are the learnable parameters.\n5\n\ud835\udc37!\"#\n\ud835\udc3e\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nStack chunks\nFine path\nCoarse path\n50% stride\n(a) Segmentation\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMerge Segments\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nRepeat Segments\nCoarse path\nZero padding\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFine path\n(b) Merge Segments and Repeat Segments\nFigure 3: Diagrams for visually understanding the operations over the 3-D segments\nEncoding Semantic Tokens\nThe remaining conditions are the discrete tokens representing semantic\ninformation u1, . . . , uTST. Following the typical approach for embedding natural languages [8], we\ndirectly use a lookup table of vectors to map any token ut \u2208 {1, . . . , VST} into a real-valued vector\nE(ut) \u2208 RDhid, where VST denotes the vocabulary size of the semantic tokens, i.e., the number\nof clusters in k-means for Wav2Vec2-Conformer. By stacking the vectors along the time axis and\napplying an MLP block, we obtain EST := MLP ([E(u1), . . . , E(uTST)]) \u2208 RTST\u00d7Dhid.\nNext, we show how the network input (i.e., znoisy at training time, or z\u03b4t at inference time) is processed\ngiven the condition embeddings. We use znoisy as input for our explanation below, since z\u03b4t is only its\nspecial case with all chunks having the same noise scale. The input znoisy is first linearly transformed\nand added up with the angle embedding of the same shape: H := RMSNorm (znoisyWin + E\u03b4) ,\nwhere Win \u2208 RD\u00d7Dhid is learnable. We then perform segmentation for dual-path processing.\nSegmentation\nAs shown in Figure 3a, the segmentation module divides a 2-D input into S half-\noverlapping segments each of length K, represented by a 3-D tensor H := [0, H1, . . . , HS, 0] \u2208\nRS\u00d7K\u00d7Dhid, where Hs := H\nh\n(s\u22121)K\n2\n: (s\u22121)K\n2\n+ K, :\ni\n, and H is zero-padded such that we have\nS =\n\u0006 2L\nK\n\u0007\n+1. With a segment size K \u2248\n\u221a\nL, the length for sequence processing becomes sub-linear\n(O(\n\u221a\nL)) as opposed to tackling the whole sequence (O(L)). This greatly reduces the difficulty of\nlearning a very long sequence and permits MeLoDy to use higher-frequency latents.\nDual-Path Blocks\nAfter the segmentation, we obtain a 3-D tensor input for N dual-path blocks,\neach block exhibits an architecture shown on the rightmost of Figure 2. The input to the i-th dual-path\nblock is denoted as H(i), and we have H(1) := H. Each block contains two stages corresponding to\ncoarse-path (i.e., inter-segment) and fine-path (i.e., intra-segment) processing, respectively. Similar\nto the observations in [37, 38], we find it superior to use an attention-based network for coarse-path\nprocessing and to use a bi-directional RNN for fine-path processing. The goal of fine acoustic\nmodeling is to better reconstruct the fine details from the roughly determined audio structure [3]. At a\nfiner scope, only the nearby elements matter and contain the most information needed for refinement,\nas supported by the modeling perspectives in neural vocoding [55, 56]. Specifically, we employ the\nRoformer network [57] for coarse-path processing, where we use a self-attention layer followed\nby a cross-attention layer to be conditional on EST with rotary positional embedding. On the other\nhand, we use a stack of 2-layer simple recurrent units (SRUs) [58] for fine-path processing. The\nfeature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) [59] is applied to the output of SRUs to assist the denoising\nwith the angle embedding E\u03b4 and the pooled EST. Each of these processing stages is detailed below.\nCoarse-Path Processing\nIn a dual-path block, we first process the coarse path corresponding to the\nvertical axis shown in Figure 3a, in which the columns are processed in parallel:\nH(i)\nc-out := RepeatSegments\n\u0010h\nRoformer\n\u0010\nMergeSegments\n\u0010\nH(i)\u0011\n[:, k, :]\n\u0011\n, k = 0, . . . , K(i)\nMS \u2212 1\ni\u0011\n,\n(11)\nwhere the coarse-path output H(i)\nc-out \u2208 RS\u00d7K\u00d7Dhid has the same shape as H(i), and MergeSegments(\u00b7)\nand RepeatSegments(\u00b7) are the operations that, respectively, compress and expand the segments\n6\nhorizontally to aggregate the information within a segment for a coarser scale of inter-segment\nprocessing. Note that, without taking the merging and repeating operations, the vertical axis is simply\na sequence formed by skipping K/2 elements in H, which does not really capture the desired coarse\ninformation. The merging is done by averaging every pair of 2min{i,N\u2212i+1} columns with zero\npaddings and a half stride such that K(i)\nMS =\n\u0006\nK\n2min{i,N\u2212i+1}\u22121\n\u0007\n. The upper part of Figure 3b illustrates\nthe case of i = 2. Similar to [38], our definition of K(i)\nMS changes the width of the 3d tensor with\nthe block index i in a sandglass style, as we have the shortest segment at the middle block and the\nlongest segment at the first and the last block. To match with the original length, a repeating operation\nfollowing from the Roformer is performed, as shown in the lower part of Figure 3b.\nFine-Path Processing\nWe then obtain the fine-path input: H(i)\nf-in := RMSNorm\n\u0010\nH(i) + H(i)\nc-out\n\u0011\n,\nwhich is fed to a two-layer SRU by parallelly processing the rows illustrated in Figure 3a:\nH(i)\nf-out :=\n\"\nFiLM\n \nSRU\n\u0010\nH(i)\nf-in[s, :, :]\n\u0011\n, E\u03b4\n\u0014sL\nS , :\n\u0015\n+\n1\nTST\nTST\u22121\nX\nt=0\nEST[t, :]\n!\n, s = 0, . . . , S \u2212 1\n#\n,\n(12)\nwhere FiLM(x, m) := MLP3 ((x \u2297 MLP1(m)) + MLP2(m)) for an arbitrary input x and modu-\nlation condition m, and \u2297 is the operations of broadcast multiplication. Followed from this, we\nhave the input for the next dual-path block: H(i+1) := RMSNorm\n\u0010\nH(i)\nf-in + H(i)\nf-out\n\u0011\n. After recursively\nprocessing through N dual-path blocks, the 3-D tensor is transformed back to a 2-D matrix using an\noverlap-and-add method [35]. Finally, the predicted velocity is obtained as follows:\n\u02c6v\u03b8(znoisy; c) := RMSNorm\n\u0010\nOverlapAdd\n\u0010\nH(N+1)\u0011\u0011\nWout,\n(13)\nwhere Wout \u2208 RDhid\u00d7D is learnable. We present more details of our implementation in Appendix B.\n4.2\nAudio VAE-GANs for Latent Representation Learning\nTo avoid learning arbitrarily high-variance latent representations, Rombach et al. [2] examined a KL-\nregularized image autoencoder for latent diffusion models (LDMs) and demonstrated extraordinary\nstability in generating high-quality image [60], igniting a series of follow-up works [61]. Such an\nautoencoder imposes a KL penalty on the encoder outputs in a way similar to VAEs [62, 63], but,\ndifferent from the classical VAEs, it is adversarially trained as in the generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) [64]. In this paper, this class of autoencoders is referred to as the VAE-GAN. Although\nVAE-GANs are promisingly applied to image generation, there is still a lack of comparable successful\nmethods for the autoencoding of audio waveforms. In this work, we propose a similarly trained\naudio VAE-GAN, which empirically showed remarkable stability when applied to our DPD model in\ncomparison to other commonly used VQ-VAE used in [12, 21, 65].\nSpecifically, the audio VAE-GAN is trained to reconstruct 24kHz audio with a striding factor of 96,\nresulting in a 250Hz latent sequence. The architecture of the decoder is the same as that in HiFi-GAN\n[66]. For the encoder, we basically replace the up-sampling modules in the decoder with convolution-\nbased down-sampling modules while other modules stay the same. For adversarial training, we use the\nmulti-period discriminators in [66] and the multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators in [67]. The\ntraining details are further discussed in Appendix B. To match the normal range of targets for diffusion\nmodels [1, 2], we map the encoder outputs to [\u22121, 1] by z(i,j) := min\n\b\nmax\n\b\u00afz(i,j)/3, \u22121\n\t\n, 1\n\t\n\u2200i, j,\nwhere the subscript (i, j) denotes the value on the i-th row and j-th column, and the choice of 3 in\npractice would sieve extreme values occupying < 0.1%.\n4.3\nMusic Inpainting, Music Continuation and Music Prompting with MeLoDy\nWe show that the proposed MeLoDy supports interpolation (i.e., audio inpainting) and extrapolation\n(i.e., audio continuation) with tricks of manipulating random noises. Noticeably, diffusion models\nhave been successfully used for effective audio inpainting [21, 22]. Yet, audio continuation has been\nan obstacle for diffusion models due to their non-autoregressive nature. Besides audio continuation,\nbased on MuLan, MeLoDy also supports music prompts to generate music of a similar style, as\nshown in Figure 1. Examples of music inpainting, music continuation, and music prompting are\nshown on our demo page. We present the algorithms of these functionalities in Appendix C.\n7\nTable 2: The speed and the quality of our proposed MeLoDy on a CPU (Intel Xeon Platinum 8260\nCPU @ 2.40GHz) or a GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100) using different numbers of sampling steps.\nSteps (T)\nSpeed on CPU (\u2191)\nSpeed on GPU (\u2191)\nFAD (\u2193)\nMCC (\u2191)\n(MusicCaps)\n-\n-\n-\n0.43\n5\n1472Hz (0.06\u00d7)\n181.1kHz (7.5\u00d7)\n7.23\n0.49\n10\n893Hz (0.04\u00d7)\n104.8kHz (4.4\u00d7)\n5.93\n0.52\n20\n498Hz (0.02\u00d7)\n56.9kHz (2.4\u00d7)\n5.41\n0.53\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nData Preparation\nAs shown in Table 1, MeLoDy was trained on 257k hours of music data (6.4M\n24kHz audios), which were filtered with [27] to focus on non-vocal music. Additionally, inspired by\nthe text augmentation in [6], we enriched the tag-based texts to generate music captions by asking\nChatGPT [68]. This music description pool is used for the training of our 195.3M MuLan, where we\nrandomly paired each audio with either the generated caption or its respective tags. In this way, we\nrobustly improve the model\u2019s capability of handling free-form text.\nSemantic LM\nFor semantic modeling, we trained a 429.5M LLaMA [69] with 24 layers, 8 heads,\nand 2048 hidden dimensions, which has a comparable number of parameters to that of the MusicLM\n[5]. For conditioning, we set up the MuLan RVQ using 12 1024-sized codebooks, resulting in 12\nprefixing tokens. The training targets were 10s semantic tokens, which are obtained from discretizing\nthe 25Hz embeddings from a 199.5M Wav2Vec2-Conformer with 1024-center k-means.\nDual-Path Diffusion\nFor the DPD model, we set the hidden dimension to Dhid = 768, and block\nnumber to N = 8, resulting in 296.6M parameters. For the input chunking strategy, we divide the 10s\ntraining inputs in a fixed length of L = 2500 into M = 4 parts. For segmentation, we used a segment\nsize of K = 64 (i.e., each segment is 256ms long), leading to S = 80 segments. In addition, we\napplied the classifier-free guidance [70] to DPD for improving the correspondence between samples\nand conditions. During training, the cross-attention to semantic tokens is randomly replaced by\nself-attention with a probability of 0.1. For sampling, the predicted velocity is linearly combined as .\nFor all of our generations, a scale of 2.5 was used for classifier-free guidance.\nAudio VAE-GAN\nFor audio VAE-GAN, we used a hop size of 96, resulting in 250Hz latent\nsequences for encoding 24kHz music audio. The latent dimension D = 16, thus we have a total\ncompression rate of 6\u00d7. The hidden channels used in the encoder were 256, whereas that used in the\ndecoder were 768. The audio VAE-GAN in total contains 100.1M parameters.\n5.2\nPerformance Analysis\nObjective Metrics\nWe use the VGGish-based [71] Fre\u00b4chet audio distance (FAD) [72] between the\ngenerated audios and the reference audios from MusicCaps [5] as a rough measure of generation\nfidelity.2 To measure text correlation, we use the MuLan cycle consistency (MCC) [5], which\ncalculates the cosine similarity between text and audio embeddings using a pre-trained MuLan.3\nInference Speed\nWe first evaluate the sampling efficiency of our proposed MeLoDy. As DPD\npermits using different numbers of sampling steps depending on our needs, we report its generation\nspeed in Table 2. Surprisingly, MeLoDy steadily achieved a higher MCC score than that of the\nreference set, even taking only 5 sampling steps. This means that (i) the MuLan model determined\nthat our generated samples were more correlated to MusicCaps captions than reference audios, and\n(ii) the proposed DPD is capable of consistently completing the MuLan cycle at significantly lower\ncosts than the nested LMs in [5].\n2Note that MeLoDy was mainly trained with non-vocal music data, its sample distribution could not fit the\nreference one as well as in [5, 6], since about 76% audios in MusicCaps contain either vocals or speech.\n3Since our MuLan model was trained with a different dataset, our MCC results cannot be compared to [5, 6].\n8\nTable 3: The comparison of MeLoDy with the SOTA text-to-music generation models. NFE is the\nnumber of function evaluations [48] for generating T-second audio.5 Musicality, Quality, and Text\nCorr. are the winning proportions in terms of musicality, quality, and text correlation, respectively.\nModel\nNFE (\u2193)\nMusicality (\u2191)\nQuality (\u2191)\nText Corr.

To conduct fair comparisons, we used\nthe same text prompts in their demos (70 samples from MusicLM; 41 samples from Noise2Music),4\nand asked seven music producers to select the best out of a pair of samples or voting for a tie (both win)\nin terms of musicality, audio quality, and text correlation. In total, we conducted 777 comparisons\nand collected 1,554 ratings. We detail the evaluation protocol in Appendix F. Table 3 shows the\ncomparison results, where each category of ratings is separated into two columns, representing\nthe comparison against MusicLM (MLM) or Noise2Music (N2M), respectively. Finally, MeLoDy\nconsistently achieved comparable performances (all winning proportions fall into [0.4, 0.6]) in\nmusicality and text correlation to MusicLM and Noise2Music. Regarding audio quality, MeLoDy\noutperformed MusicLM (p < 0.05) and Noise2Music (p < 0.01), where the p-values were calculated\nusing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We note that, to sample 10s and 30s music, MeLoDy only takes\n4.32% and 0.41% NFEs of MusicLM, and 10.4% and 29.6% NFEs of Noise2Music, respectively.\nDiversity Analysis\nDiffusion models are distinguished for its high diversity [25]. We conduct an\nadditional experiment to study the diversity and validity of MeLoDy\u2019s generation given the same text\nprompt of open description, e.g., feelings or scenarios. The sampled results were shown on our demo\npage, in which we obtained samples with diverse combinations of instruments and textures.\nAblation Studies\nWe also study the ablation on two aspects of the proposed method. In Appendix\nD, we compared the uniform angle schedule in [23] and the linear one proposed in DPD using the\nMCC metric and case-by-case qualitative analysis. It turns out that our proposed schedule tends to\ninduce fewer acoustic issues when taking a small number of sampling steps. In Appendix E, we\nshowed that the proposed dual-path architecture outperformed other architectures [23, 31] used for\nLDMs in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements using a subset of the training data.\n6\nDiscussion\nLimitation\nWe acknowledge the limitations of our proposed MeLoDy. To prevent from having\nany disruption caused by unnaturally sound vocals, our training data was prepared to mostly contain\nnon-vocal music only, which may limit the range of effective prompts for MeLoDy. Besides, the\ntraining corpus we used was unbalanced and slightly biased towards pop and classical music. Lastly,\nas we trained the LM and DPD on 10s segments, the dynamics of a long generation may be limited.\nBroader Impact\nWe believe our work has a huge potential to grow into a music creation tool for\nmusic producers, content creators, or even normal users to seamlessly express their creative pursuits\nwith a low entry barrier. MeLoDy also facilitates an interactive creation process, as in Midjourney\n[24], to take human feedback into account. For a more precise tune of MeLoDy on a musical style,\nthe LoRA technique [73] can be potentially applied to MeLoDy, as in Stable Diffusion [60].\n4All samples for evaluation are available at https://Efficient-MeLoDy.github.io/. Note that our samples were\nnot cherry-picked, whereas the samples we compared were cherry-picked [6], constituting very strong baselines.\n5We use + to separate the counts for the iterative modules, i.e., LM or DPM. Suppose the cost of each module\nis comparable, then the time steps taken by LM and the diffusion steps taken by DPM can be fairly compared.\n9\nReferences\n[1] Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain, and Pieter Abbeel.

This forward diffusion process is formally defined as\nq(zt|z) = N(zt; \u03b1tz, \u03c32\nt I),\n(14)\nwhere two strictly positive scalar-valued, continuously differentiable functions \u03b1t, \u03c3t define the\nnoise schedule [1] of this forward diffusion process. Building upon the nice properties of Gaussian\ndistributions, we can express q(zt|zs), for any 0 \u2264 s < t \u2264 1, as another Gaussian distribution:\nq(zt|zs) = N\n\u0012\nzt; \u03b1t\n\u03b1s\nzs,\n\u0012\n\u03c32\nt \u2212 \u03b1t\n\u03b1s\n\u03c32\ns\n\u0013\nI\n\u0013\n.\n(15)\nRegarding the choice of noise scheduling functions, we consider the typical setting used in [1, 15]:\n\u03b1t =\np\n1 \u2212 \u03c32\nt , which gives rise to a variance-preserving diffusion process [16]. Specifically, we\nemploy the trigonometric functions in [48], defined as follows:\n\u03b1t := cos(\u03c0t/2)\n\u03c3t := sin(\u03c0t/2)\n\u2200t \u2208 [0, 1]\n(16)\n\u21d4 \u03b1\u03b4 := cos(\u03b4)\n\u03c3\u03b4 := sin(\u03b4)\n\u2200\u03b4 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2].\n(17)\nWith this re-parameterization, the diffusion process can now be defined in terms of angle \u03b4 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]:\nz\u03b4 = cos(\u03b4)z + sin(\u03b4)\u03f5,\n\u03f5 \u223c N(0, I),\n(18)\nwhere z\u03b4 gets noisier as \u03b4 increases from 0 to \u03c0/2.\nA.2\nPrediction of Diffusion Velocity\nThe diffusion velocity of z\u03b4 at \u03b4 [48] is defined as:\nv\u03b4 := dz\u03b4\nd\u03b4 = d cos(\u03b4)\nd\u03b4\nz + d sin(\u03b4)\nd\u03b4\n\u03f5 = cos(\u03b4)\u03f5 \u2212 sin(\u03b4)z.\n(19)\nBased on v\u03b4, we can compute z and \u03f5 from a noisy latent z\u03b4:\nz = cos (\u03b4)z\u03b4 \u2212 sin(\u03b4)v\u03b4 = \u03b1\u03b4z\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c3\u03b4v\u03b4;\n(20)\n\u03f5 = sin (\u03b4)z\u03b4 + cos(\u03b4)v\u03b4 = \u03c3\u03b4z\u03b4 + \u03b1\u03b4v\u03b4,\n(21)\nwhich suggests v\u03b4 a feasible target for network prediction \u02c6v\u03b8(z\u03b4; c) given a collection of conditions\nc, as an alternative to the z prediction (\u02c6z\u03b8(z\u03b4; c)), e.g., in [16], and the \u03f5 prediction (\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(z\u03b4; c)), e.g.,\nin [1, 50, 74]. As reported by Salimans and Ho [48] and Schneider et al. [23], training the neural\nnetwork \u03b8 with a mean squared error (MSE) loss as in the pioneering work [1] remains effective:\nL := Ez\u223cpdata(z),\u03f5\u223cN (0,I),\u03b4\u223cUniform[0,1]\nh\n\u2225cos(\u03b4)\u03f5 \u2212 sin(\u03b4)z \u2212 \u02c6v\u03b8(cos(\u03b4)z + sin(\u03b4)\u03f5; c)\u22252\n2\ni\n, (22)\nwhich forms the basis of DPD\u2019s training loss, i.e., the simplest case of considering only a single\nchunk per input (M = 1) in Eq. (7). We can easily extend this to a multi-chunk version by sampling\nM different angles \u03b41, . . . , \u03b4M \u223c Uniform[0, 1], where the m-th sampled angle is applied to the\ncorresponding chunk of the latent, i.e., z[(m \u2212 1)L/M : mL/M].\nA.3\nGenerative Diffusion Process\nGeneration is done by inverting the forward process from a noise vector randomly drawn from\nN(0, I). One efficient way to accomplish this is to take advantage of DDIM [26], which enables\nrunning backward from angle \u03b4 to angle \u03b4 \u2212 \u03c9, for any step size 0 < \u03c9 < \u03b4:\np\u03b8(z\u03b4\u2212\u03c9|z\u03b4) := q\n\u0012\nz\u03b4\u2212\u03c9\n\f\f\f\fz = z\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c3\u03b4\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(z\u03b4; c)\n\u03b1\u03b4\n\u0013\n= \u03b1\u03b4\u2212\u03c9\n\u0012z\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c3\u03b4\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(z\u03b4; c)\n\u03b1\u03b4\n\u0013\n+ \u03c3\u03b4\u2212\u03c9\u03f5, (23)\n15\nwhere \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I). Song et al.

The audio VAE-GAN mainly comprises three\ntrainable modules: (i) a variational Gaussian encoder E\u03d5(x) \u2261 N(\u00b5\u03d5(x), \u03c3\u03d5(x)I), (ii) a decoder\nD\u03d5(z), and (iii) a set of n discriminators {D(i)}n\ni=1.\nRegarding network architecture, we use the ResNet-style convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in\nHiFi-GAN [66] as the backbone.6 For the encoder, we replace the up-sampling blocks in HiFi-GAN\nwith convolution-based down-sampling blocks, with down-sampling rates of [2, 3, 4, 4], output dimen-\nsions of [32, 64, 128, 256] and kernel sizes of [5, 7, 9, 9] in four down-sampling blocks, giving 40M\n6Our implementation is similar to that in https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan.\n16\nparameters. The final layer of the encoder maps the 256-dimensional output to two 16-dimensional\nlatent sequences, respectively for the mean and variance of diagonal Gaussian sampling.7 As shown\nin Figure 4, to match the normal range of targets for diffusion models [1, 2], we map the sampled\noutputs to [\u22121, 1] by z(i,j) := min\n\b\nmax\n\b\u00afz(i,j)/3, \u22121\n\t\n, 1\n\t\n\u2200i, j, where the subscript (i, j) denotes\nthe value on the i-th row and j-th column, and the choice of 3 in practice would sieve extreme values\noccupying < 0.1%. For the architecture setting of the decoder, it inherits the same architecture of\nHiFi-GAN, and uses up-sampling rates of [4, 4, 3, 2], kernel sizes of [9, 9, 5, 7] and larger number of\noutput channels ([768, 384, 192, 96]) for four up-sampling blocks, taking 60.1M parameters.\nFor adversarial training, we use the multi-period discriminators in [66] and the multi-resolution\nspectrogram discriminators in [67]. The training scheme is similar to that in [66].

For music encoding,\nwe rely on a publicly accessible Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model pre-trained on\nAudioSet,9 which gives promising results on various audio classification benchmarks. For text\nencoding, we employ the BERT [8] base model pre-trained on a large corpus of English data using\na masked language modeling (MLM) objective.10 These two pre-trained encoders, together having\n195.3M parameters, were subsequently fine-tuned on the 257k hours of music data with a text\naugmentation technique similar to [6].

In practice, this could robustly improve the model\u2019s\ncapability of handling free-form text.\nC\nAlgorithms for MeLoDy\nMeLoDy supports music or text prompting for music generation, as illustrated in Figure 1. We\nconcretely detail the sampling procedures in Algorithm 1, where the algorithm starts by generating\nthe latent sequence of length L and then recursively prolongs the latent sequence using Algorithm 2\nuntil it reaches the desired length.\nWe further explain how music continuation can be effectively done in DPD. Recall that the inputs for\ntraining DPD are the concatenated chunks of noisy latents in different noise scales. To continue a\ngiven music audio, we can add a new chunk composed of random noises and drop the first chunk.\nThis is feasible since the conditions (i.e., the semantic tokens and the angles) defined for DPD have\nan autoregressive nature. Based on the semantic LM, we can continue the generation of \u2308TST/M\u2309\nsemantic tokens for the new chunk. Besides, it is sensible to keep the chunks other than the new\nchunk to have zero angles: \u03b4new := [0]L\u2212\u2308L/M\u2309\nr=1\n\u2295 [\u03b4t]\u2308L/M\u2309\nr=1\n, as shown in Algorithm 2.\nIn addition, music inpainting can be done in a similar way. We replace the inpainting partition of the\ninput audio with random noise and partially set the angle vector to zeros to mark the positions where\nthe denoising operations are not needed. Yet, in this case, the semantic tokens can only be roughly\nestimated using the remaining part of the music audio.\nTable 4: The objective measures for the ablation study on angle schedules.\nAngle schedule (\u03c9t)\nSteps (T)\nFAD (\u2193)\nMCC (\u2191)\nUniform [23]: \u03c9t =\n\u03c0\n2T\n10\n8.52\n0.45\n20\n6.31\n0.49\nOurs proposed in Eq.

In particular, the same pre-trained DPD\nmodel \u02c6v\u03b8 and was used to sample with two different angle schedules with 10 steps and 20 steps,\n18\nrespectively, conditional on the same semantic tokens generated for the text prompts in MusicCaps.\nTable 4 shows their corresponding objective measures in terms of FAD and MCC. We observe a\nsignificant improvement, especially when taking a small number of sampling steps, by using the\nproposed sampling method. This is aligned with our expectations that taking larger steps at the\nbeginning of the sampling followed by smaller steps could improve the quality of samples, similar to\nthe findings in previous diffusion scheduling methods [50, 51].\nWe further qualitatively analyze the quality of the generated samples using some simple text prompts\nof instruments, i.e., flute, saxophone, and acoustic guitar, by pair-wise comparing their spectrograms\nas illustrated in Figure 5. In the case of \u201cflute\u201d, sampling with the proposed angle schedule results in\na piece of naturally sound music, being more saturated in high-frequency bands and even remedying\nthe breathiness of flute playing, as shown in Figure 5b. On the contrary, we can observe from the\nspectrogram in Figure 5a that the sample generated with a uniform angle schedule is comparatively\nmonotonous. In the case of \u201csaxophone\u201d, the uniform angle schedule leads to metallic sounds that\nare dissonant, as revealed by the higher energy in 3kHz to 6kHz frequency bands shown in Figure 5c.\nIn comparison, the frequency bands are more consistent in Figure 5d, when the proposed schedule is\nused. While the comparatively poorer sample quality using the uniform schedule could be caused by\nthe limited number of sampling steps, we also show the spectrograms after increasing the sampling\nsteps from 10 to 20. In the case of \u201cacoustic guitar\u201d, when taking 20 sampling steps, the samples\ngenerated with both angle schedules sound more natural. However, in Figure 5e, we witness a\nhorizontal line around the 4.4kHz frequency band, which is unpleasant to hear. Whereas, the sample\ngenerated by our proposed schedule escaped such an acoustic issue, as presented in Figure 5f.\n(a) 10-step sampling with uniform angle schedule for\ntext prompt: \u201cflute\u201d\n(b) 10-step sampling with our proposed angle schedule\nfor text prompt: \u201cflute\u201d\n(c) 10-step sampling with uniform angle schedule for\ntext prompt: \u201csaxophone\u201d\n(d) 10-step sampling with our proposed angle schedule\nfor text prompt: \u201csaxophone\u201d\n(e) 10-step sampling with uniform angle schedule for\ntext prompt: \u201cacoustic guitar\u201d\n(f) 10-step sampling with our proposed angle schedule\nfor text prompt: \u201cacoustic guitar\u201d\nFigure 5: Spectrograms of generated samples with uniform (left) and our proposed (right) angle\nschedules\n19\nTable 5: The objective measures for the ablation study on architectures.\nArchitecture\nVelocity MSE (\u2193)\nSI-SNRi (\u2191)\nUNet-1D [23]\n0.13\n5.33\nUNet-2D [31]\n0.15\n4.96\nDPD (Ours)\n0.12\n6.15\nE\nAblation Study on Architectures\nTo examine the superiority of our proposed dual-path model in Figure 2, we also study the ablation of\nnetwork architectures.

    "text": "Unsupervised Semantic Correspondence\nUsing Stable Diffusion\nEric Hedlin1, Gopal Sharma1, Shweta Mahajan1, 2, Hossam Isack3, Abhishek Kar3,\nAndrea Tagliasacchi3, 4, 5, Kwang Moo Yi1\n1 University of British Columbia, 2 Vector Institute for AI, 3 Google,\n4 Simon Fraser University, 5 University of Toronto\nAbstract\nText-to-image diffusion models are now capable of generating images that are often\nindistinguishable from real images. To generate such images, these models must\nunderstand the semantics of the objects they are asked to generate. In this work we\nshow that, without any training, one can leverage this semantic knowledge within\ndiffusion models to find semantic correspondences \u2013 locations in multiple images\nthat have the same semantic meaning. Specifically, given an image, we optimize\nthe prompt embeddings of these models for maximum attention on the regions\nof interest. These optimized embeddings capture semantic information about the\nlocation, which can then be transferred to another image. By doing so we obtain\nresults on par with the strongly supervised state of the art on the PF-Willow dataset\nand significantly outperform (20.9% relative for the SPair-71k dataset) any existing\nweakly or unsupervised method on PF-Willow, CUB-200 and SPair-71k datasets.\n1\nIntroduction\nEstimating point correspondences between images is a fundamental problem in computer vision,\nwith numerous applications in areas such as image registration [1], object recognition [2], and 3D\nreconstruction [3]. Work on correspondences can largely be classified into geometric and semantic\ncorrespondence search. Geometric correspondence search aims to find points that correspond to the\nsame physical point of the same object and are typically solved with local feature-based methods [4,\n5, 6, 7, 8] and optical flow methods [9, 10]. Semantic correspondence search \u2013 the core application\nof interest in this paper \u2013 focuses on points that correspond semantically [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], not\nnecessarily of the same object, but of similar objects of the same or related class. For example, given\nthe selected kitten paw in the (source) image of Figure 1, we would like to automatically identify\nkitten paws in other (target) images.\nWhether geometric or semantic correspondences, a common\nsource image\nsource attention\ntarget image\ntarget attention\ntarget image\ntarget attention\nFigure 1: Teaser \u2013 We optimize for the prompt embedding of the diffusion model that activates\nattention in the region of the \u2018paw\u2019 for the source image, marked in yellow. With this embedding, the\nattention highlights semantically similar points in various target images, which we then use to find\nsemantic correspondences. This holds even for \u201cout of distribution\u201d target images (LEGO cats).\nrecent trend is to learn to solve these problems [17], as in many other areas of computer vision.\narXiv:2305.15581v2  [cs.CV]  23 Dec 2023\n(a) input image\n\u2018paw\u2019 attention\n\u2018collar\u2019 attention\n\u2018shower\u2019 attention\n\u2018ears\u2019 attention\nFigure 2: Semantic knowledge in diffusion models \u2013 Given an input image and text prompts\ndescribing parts of the image, the attention maps of diffusion models highlight semantically relevant\nareas of the image. We visualize the attention maps superimposed atop the input image.\nWhile learning-based methods provide superior performance [16, 15, 17, 18] often these methods\nneed to be trained on large supervised datasets [17, 19]. For geometric correspondences, this is\nrelatively straightforward, as one can leverage the vast amount of photos that exist on the web and\nutilize points that pass sophisticated geometric verification processes [17, 20, 19]. For semantic\ncorrespondences, this is more challenging, as one cannot simply collect more photos for higher-\nquality ground truth\u2013automatic verification of semantic correspondences is difficult, and human\nlabeling effort is required. Thus, research on unsupervised learned semantic correspondence has been\ntrending [21, 22, 23].\nIn this work, we show that one may not need any ground-truth semantic correspondences between\nimage pairs at all for finding semantic correspondences, or need to rely on generic pre-trained\ndeep features [24, 25] \u2013 we can instead simply harness the knowledge within powerful text-to-\nimage models. Our key insight is that, given that recent diffusion models [26, 27, 28, 29, 30] can\ngenerate photo-realistic images from text prompts only, there must be knowledge about semantic\ncorrespondences built-in within them. For example, for a diffusion model to successfully create\nan image of a human face, it must know that a human face consists of two eyes, one nose, and a\nmouth, as well as their supposed whereabouts \u2013 in other words, it must know the semantics of the\nscene it is generating. Thus, should one be able to extract this knowledge from these models, trained\nwith billions of text-image pairs [30, 31], one should be able to solve semantic correspondences as a\nby-product. Note here that these generative models can also be thought of as a form of unsupervised\npre-training, akin to self-supervised pre-training methods [32, 25], but with more supervision from\nthe provided text-image relationship.\nHence, inspired by the recent success of prompt-to-prompt [33] for text-based image editing, we\nbuild our method by exploiting the attention maps of latent diffusion models. These maps attend to\ndifferent portions of the image as the text prompt is changed. For example, given an image of a cat, if\nthe text prompt is \u2018paw\u2019, the attention map will highlight the paws, while if the text prompt is \u2018collar\u2019,\nthey will highlight the collar; see Figure 2. Given arbitrary input images, these attention maps should\nrespond to the semantics of the prompt. In other words, if one can identify the \u2018prompt\u2019 corresponding\nto a particular image location, the diffusion model could be used to identify semantically similar\nimage locations in a new, unseen, image. Note that finding actual prompts that correspond to words\nis a discrete problem, hence difficult to solve. However, these prompts do not have to correspond\nto actual words, as long as they produce attention maps that highlight the queried image location.\nIn other words, the analogy above holds when we operate on the continuous embedding space of\nprompts, representing the core insight over which we build our method.\nWith this key insight, we propose to find these (localized) embeddings by optimizing them so that the\nattention map within the diffusion models corresponds to points of interest, similarly to how prompts\nare found for textual inversion [34, 35]. As illustrated in Figure 1, given an (source) image and a\n(query) location that we wish to find the semantic correspondences of, we first optimize a randomly\ninitialized text embedding to maximize the cross-attention at the query location while keeping the\ndiffusion model fixed (i.e. stable diffusion [30]). We then apply the optimized text embedding to\nanother image (i.e. target) to find the semantically corresponding location \u2013 the pixel attaining the\nmaximum attention map value within the target image.\nBeyond our core technical contribution, we introduce a number of important design choices that\ndeal with problems that would arise from its naive implementation. Specifically, (1) as we optimize\non a single image when finding the embeddings, to prevent overfitting we apply random crops; (2)\n2\nto avoid the instability and randomness of textual inversion [36, 35] we find multiple embeddings\nstarting from random initialization; (3) we utilize attention maps at different layers of the diffusion\nnetwork to build a multi-scale notion of semantic matching. These collectively allow our method to\nbe on par with strongly-supervised state of the art on the PF-Willow dataset [13] and outperform all\nweakly- and un-supervised baselines in PF-Willow, CUB-200 [37], and SPair-71k datasets [14] \u2013 on\nthe SPair-71k dataset we outperform the closest weakly supervised baseline by 20.9% relative.\nWe emphasize that our method does not require supervised training that is specific to semantic point\ncorrespondence estimation. Instead, we simply utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model, without\nfine-tuning, and are able to achieve state-of-the-art results. To summarize, we make the following\ncontributions:\n\u2022 we show how to effectively extract semantic correspondences from an off-the-shelf Stable Dif-\nfusion [30] model without training any new task-specific neural network, or using any semantic\ncorrespondence labels;\n\u2022 we introduce a set of design choices \u2013 random crops, multiple embeddings, multi-scale attention \u2013\nthat are critical to achieving state-of-the-art performance;\n\u2022 we significantly outperform prior state of the art based on weakly supervised techniques on the\nSPair-71k [14], PF-Willow [13], and CUB-200 [37] datasets (20.9% relative on SPair-71k) and is\non par with the strongly-supervised state of the art on the PF-Willow [13] dataset.\n2\nRelated work\nWe first review work on semantic correspondences and then discuss work focusing on reducing\nsupervision. We also discuss work on utilizing pre-trained diffusion models.\nSemantic correspondences.. Finding correspondences is a long-standing core problem in computer\nvision, serving as a building block in various tasks, for example, optical flow estimation [38, 10],\nstructure from motion [39, 40, 3, 5], and semantic flow [11]. While a large body of work exists,\nincluding those that focus more on finding geometric correspondences that rely on local features [4,\n6, 7] and matching them [41, 42, 43, 8] or directly via deep networks [44, 45, 17, 18], here we focus\nonly on semantic correspondences [11, 16, 15, 46], that is, the task of finding corresponding locations\nin images that are of the same \u201csemantic\u201d \u2013 e.g., paws of the cat in Figure 1. For a wider review of\nthis topic, we refer the reader to [47].\nFinding semantic correspondences has been of interest lately, as they allow class-specific alignment\nof data [46, 48], which can then be used to, for example, train generative models [49], or to transfer\ncontent between images [11, 50, 51]. To achieve semantic correspondence, as in many other fields\nin computer vision, the state-of-the-art is to train neural networks [16, 15]. Much research focus\nwas aimed initially at architectural designs that explicitly allow correspondences to be discovered\nwithin learned feature maps [10, 45, 52, 16]. For example using pyramid architectures [52], or\narchitectures [16] that utilize both convolutional neural networks [53] and transformers [54]. However,\nthese approaches require large-scale datasets that are either sparsely [14, 13] or densely [55] labeled,\nlimiting the generalization and scalability of these methods without additional human labeling effort.\nLearning semantic correspondences with less supervision.. Thus, reducing the strong supervision\nrequirement has been of research focus. One direction in achieving less supervision is through the use\nof carefully designed frameworks and loss formulations. For example, Li et al. [21] use a probabilistic\nstudent-teacher framework to distill knowledge from synthetic data and apply it to unlabeled real\nimage pairs. Kim et al. [22] form a semi-supervised framework that uses unsupervised losses formed\nvia augmentation.\nAnother direction is to view semantic correspondence problem is utilizing pre-trained deep features.\nFor example, Neural Best-Buddies [56] look for mutual nearest neighbor neuron pairs of a pre-trained\nCNN to discover semantic correspondences. Amir et al. [57] investigate the use of deep features from\npre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) [58], specifically DINO-ViT [25]. More recently, in ASIC [23]\nrough correspondences from these pre-trained networks have been utilized to train a network that\nmaps images into a canonical grid, which can then be used to extract semantic correspondences.\nThese methods either rely heavily on the generalization capacity of pre-trained neural network\nrepresentations [56, 57] or require training a new semantic correspondence network [21, 22, 23]. In\nthis work, we show how one can achieve dramatically improved results over the current state-of-the-\n3\nart, achieving performance similar to that of strongly-supervised methods, even without training any\nnew neural network by simply using a Stable Diffusion network.\nUtilizing pre-trained diffusion models.. Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful\nclass of generative models, attracting significant attention due to their ability to generate high-\nquality samples [30, 26, 27, 28, 29, 59, 60]. Diffusion models generate high-quality samples, with\ntext-conditioned versions incorporating textual information via cross-attention mechanisms.\nAmong them, Stable Diffusion [30] is a popular model of choice thanks to its lightweight and open-\nsource nature. While training a latent diffusion model is difficult and resource-consuming, various\nmethods have been suggested to extend its capabilities. These include model personalization [61]\nthrough techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [62] and textual inversion [34], including\nnew conditioning signals via ControlNet [63], or repurposing the model for completely new purposes\nsuch as text-to-3D [64] and text-driven image editing [33]. While the applications vary, many of\nthese applications are for generative tasks, that is, creating images and 3D shapes.\nOf particular interest to us is the finding from Prompt-to-Prompt [33] that the cross-attention maps\nwithin diffusion models can effectively act as a pseudo-segmentation for a given text query \u2013 in other\nwords, it contains semantic information. This is further supported by the fact that intermediate features\nof diffusion models can be used for semantic segmentation [65]. In this work, with these observations,\nand with the help of textual inversion [34], we show that we can utilize Stable Diffusion [30] for not\njust generative tasks, but for the task of finding semantic correspondences, a completely different task\nfrom what these models are trained for, all without any training by repurposing the attention maps,\nsimilarly as in [66] but for an entirely different application and framework.\nConcurrently to our work, work utilizing feature representations within Stable Diffusion for corre-\nspondences has been proposed [67, 68, 69]. These methods look into how to use the deep features\nwithin the Stable Diffusion Network effectively, similar to how VGG19 features [70] are widely used\nfor various tasks. Our method, on the other hand, looks into how we can alter the attention maps\nwithin Stable Diffusion to our will, in other words taking into account how these features are supposed\nto be used within Stable Diffusion \u2013 we optimize word embeddings. By doing so we show that one\ncan perform alternative tasks than simple image creation such as the semantic correspondence task\nwe demonstrated. However, this is not the end of what our framework can do. For example, a recent\nfollowup to our preprint demonstrated an extension of our method to segmentation [71]\n3\nMethod\nOur method identifies semantic correspondences between pairs of images by leveraging the attention\nmaps induced by latent diffusion models. Given a pair of images (respectively source and target), and\na query point in the source image domain, we seek to compute an attention map that highlights areas\nin the target image that are in semantic correspondence with the query. While classical diffusion\nmodels work on images directly, we employ latent diffusion models [30], which operate on encoded\nimages. Further, rather than being interested in the generated image, we use the attention maps\ngenerated as a by-product of the synthesis process. Our process involves two stages; see Figure 3. In\nthe first stage (optimization), we seek to find an embedding that represents the semantics of the query\nregion in the source image by investigating the activation map of the denoising step at time t. In the\nsecond stage (inference), the embeddings from the source image are kept fixed, and attention maps\nfor a given target image again at time t are computed. The location attaining the highest value of\nattention in the generated map provides the desired semantic correspondence. We start by reviewing\nthe basics of diffusion models in Section 3.1, detail our two-stage algorithm in Section 3.2, and\naugmentation techniques to boost its performance in Section 3.3.\n3.1\nPreliminaries\nDiffusion models are a class of generative models that approximate the data distribution by denoising\na base (Gaussian) distribution [59]. In the forward diffusion process, the input image I is gradually\ntransformed into Gaussian noise over a series of T timesteps. Then, a sequence of denoising iterations\n\u03f5\u03b8(It, t), parameterized by \u03b8, and t = 1, . . . , T take as input the noisy image It at each timestep and\npredict the noise added for that iteration \u03f5. The diffusion objective is given by:\nLDM = EI,t,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1)\n\u0002\n\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(It, t)\u22252\n2\n\u0003\n.\n(1)\n4\nImage Encoder\nSource Image \n  t-1\nz\nCross \nAttention \nLayers\nSource Attention Map \nDenoise\nTarget Image \nTarget Attention Map\nText Embedding\nz\n  0\nImage Encoder\nCross \nAttention \nLayers\nz\nDenoise\n  0\nArgmax\n  t\nz\nOptimization\nInference\nz\n  t-1\nPrediction\nQuery\n  t\nz\nDiffuse\nDiffuse\nFigure 3: Method \u2013 (Top) Given a source image and a query point, we optimize the embeddings\nso that the attention map for the denoising step at time t highlights the query location in the source\nimage. (Bottom) During inference, we input the target image and reuse the embeddings for the\nsame denoising step t, determining the corresponding point in the target image as the argmax of the\nattention map. The architecture mapping images to attention maps is a pre-trained Stable Diffusion\nmodel [30] which is kept frozen throughout the entire process.\nRather than directly operating on images I, latent diffusion models (LDM) [30] execute instead on a\nlatent representation z, where an encoder maps the image I into a latent z, and a decoder maps the\nlatent representation back into an image. The model can additionally be made conditional on some\ntext y, by providing an embedding e = \u03c4\u03b8(y) using a text encoder \u03c4\u03b8 to the denoiser:\nLLDM = Ez,t,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1)[\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, e)\u22252\n2]..\n(2)\nThe denoiser for a text-conditional LDM is implemented by a transformer architecture [59, 30]\ninvolving a combination of self-attention and cross-attention layers.\n3.2\nOptimizing for correspondences\nIn what follows, we detail how we compute attention masks given an image/embedding pair, how to\noptimize for an embedding that activates a desired position in the source image, and how to employ\nthis optimized embedding to identify the corresponding point in the target image.\nAttention masks. Given an image I, let z(t) be its latent representation within the diffusion model\nat the t-th diffusion step. We first compute query Ql = \u03a6l(z(t=8))1, and key Kl = \u03a8l(e), where\n\u03a6l(\u00b7), and \u03a8l(\u00b7) are the l-th linear layers of the U-Net [72] that denoises in the latent space. The\ncross-attention at these layers are then defined as:\nM\u2032\nl(e, I) = CrossAttention(Ql, Kl) = softmax\n\u0010\nQlK\u22a4\nl /\np\ndl\n\u0011\n,\n(3)\nwhere the attention map M\u2032 \u2208 RC\u00d7(h\u00d7w)\u00d7P , and P, C, h, and w respectively represent the number\nof tokens, the number of attention heads in the transformer layer, the height, and width of the image\nat the particular layer in the U-Net. Here, Q \u2208 R(h\u00d7w)\u00d7dl, and K \u2208 RP \u00d7dl where dl represents the\ndimensionality of this layer, and softmax denotes the softmax operation along the P dimension.\n1We select the t=8 diffusion step of a T=50 steps diffusion model via hyper-parameter tuning.\n5\n(a) Source image\n(b) Layer 7\n(c) Layer 8\n(d) Layer 9\n(e) Layer 10\n(f) Average\n(g) Target image\n(h) Layer 7\n(i) Layer 8\n(j) Layer 9\n(k) Layer 10\n(l) Average\nFigure 4: Attention response of different layers \u2013 We show example attention maps (b\u2013e) for\nparticular U-Net layers for the optimized embedding that correspond to the location marked with\nthe yellow star on the source image (a) and corresponding average in image (f). We use the same\nembedding for another (target) image (g) and display its attention map as well (h\u2013k) and their average\n(l). The ground-truth semantically corresponding region in the target image is marked also with the\nyellow star. Earlier layers respond more broadly, whereas later layers are more specific. To utilize\nthese different characteristics of each layer we average that of multiple layers into a single attention\nmap.\nAs mentioned earlier in Section 1, and observed in [65], different layers of the U-Net exhibit\ndifferent \u201clevel\u201d of semantic knowledge; see Figure 4. Thus, to take advantage of the different\ncharacteristics of each layer, we average along both the channel axis and across a subset of U-Net\nlayers M\u2032\u2032 \u2208 R(h\u00d7w)\u00d7P = averagec=1...C,l=7..10(M\u2032\nl). Note that the size of the attention maps\nM\u2032\nl differ according to each layer, hence we utilize bilinear interpolation when averaging. Hence,\nwith M(u; e, I) we denote indexing a pixel u of the attention map M\u2032\u2032[1] \u2208 R(h\u00d7w) via bilinear\ninterpolation, where [1] extracts the first of the P available attention maps2, that is, we use the first\ntoken of the embedding to represent our query. 3Examples of these attention maps for embeddings e\nderived from natural text are visualized in Figure 2.\nOptimization. Given a source image Ii and a query pixel location ui\u2208[0, 1]2, we are interested in\nfinding the corresponding pixel uj in the target image Ij. We emulate the source attention map for\nthe query as a Gaussian of standard deviation \u03c3 centered at the query location ui:\nMs(u) = exp\n\u0000\u2212\u2225u \u2212 ui\u22252\n2/2\u03c32\u0001\n.\n(4)\nThe Gaussian map represents the desired region of focus of the attention mechanism. We then\noptimize for the (text) embedding e that reproduces the desired attention map as:\ne\u2217 = arg min\ne\nX\nu\n\u2225M(u; e, Ii) \u2212 Ms(u)\u22252\n2,\n(5)\nInference. With the optimized embedding e\u2217, we can then identify the target point (the point uj in\nIj most semantically similar to ui in Ii) by computing the attention map for the target image, and\nfinding the spatial location that maximizes it. We write:\nuj = arg max\nu\nM(u; e\u2217, Ij).\n(6)\n3.3\nRegularizations\nAs discussed in Section 1, optimizing text embeddings on a single image makes it susceptible to\noverfitting. Furthermore, the process of finding embeddings via optimization, textual inversion,\n2We do not employ the first or last token as typically these are special termination tokens.\n3We empirically observed that the choice of which token does not have a significant impact on the final\noutcome as all other tokens (i.e., P entries of e) all are also optimized regardless due to the softmax that we\napply along the P axis \u2013 optimization will find the prompts (or more exactly the embeddings) that match the\nchosen token location.\n6\nSuccessful \nMixed \nFailure \nSpair-71k\nCUB-200\nPF-Willow\nFigure 8: Qualitative examples \u2013 correspondences estimated from our method are colored in blue\nif correct and in orange if wrong according to PCK@0.05.

To overcome these issues, we\napply various forms of regularization. Note that while we describe these one at a time, these two\naugmentations are simultaneously enabled.\nAveraging across crops. Let Cc(I) be a cropping operation with parameters c, and Uc(I) the\noperation placing the crop back to its original location; that is, Cc(Uc(xc)) = xc for some crop xc.\nFor the c we reduce the image dimensions to 93% (found via hyperparameter sweep) and sample\na uniformly random translation within the image \u2013 we will denote this sampling as c \u223c D. We\naugment the optimization in Equation 5 by averaging across cropping augmentations as:\ne\u2217 = arg min\ne\nEc\u223cD\nX\nu\n\u2225Cc(M(u; e, Ii)) \u2212 Cc(Ms(u))\u22252\n2,\n(7)\nsimilarly, at inference time, we average the attention masks generated by different crops:\nuj = arg max\nu\nEc\u223cD Uc(M(u; e\u2217, Cc(Ij))).\n(8)\nAveraging across optimization rounds. We empirically found that doing multiple rounds of\noptimization is one of the keys to obtaining good performance; see Figure 9. To detail this process,\nlet us abstract the optimization in Equation 7 as e\u2217 = O(\u00afe, Ii), where \u00afe is its initialization. We then\naverage the attention masks induced by multiple optimization runs as:\nuj = arg max\nu\nE\u00afe\u223cD M(u; O(\u00afe, Ii), Ij).\n(9)\n4\nResults\nWe evaluate semantic correspondence search on three standard benchmarks: SPair-71k [14] is the\nlargest standard dataset for evaluating semantic correspondences composed of 70, 958 image pairs of\n18 different classes. Since we do not perform any training, we only use the 12, 234 correspondences\nof the test set for evaluation; PF-Willow [13] comprises four classes \u2013 wine bottle, duck, motorcycle,\nand car \u2013 with 900 correspondences in the test set; CUB-200 [37] includes 200 different classes of\nbirds. Following ASIC [46] we select the first three classes, yielding a total of 1, 248 correspondences\nin the test set.\n7\nTable 1: Quantitative results \u2013 We report the Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), where bold\nnumbers are the best results amongst weakly- or un-supervised methods. Our method outperforms\nall weakly supervised baselines (we use the numbers reported in the literature).

We measure the performance of each method via the standard metric [13, 14, 23] of\nPercentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) under selected thresholds \u2013 we report how many semantic\ncorrespondence estimates are within the error threshold from human-annotation. Following the\nstandard protocol [13, 14, 23], for SPair-71k and PF-Willow thresholds are determined with respect\nto the bounding boxes of the object of interest, whereas for CUB-200, the thresholds are set relative to\nthe overall image dimensions. We report results for thresholds 0.05 and 0.1, as annotations themselves\nare not pixel-perfect due to the nature of semantic correspondences \u2013 i.e., there is no exact geometric\ncorrespondence.\nImplementation details. We use Stable Diffusion version 1.4 [30]. In our ablations, we find that\nmore augmentation help, but with the caveat of (linearly) requiring more computation. Hence, on\nCUB-200 and PF-Willow datasets we use 10 optimization rounds for the embeddings and 30 random\ncrops for the inference. For the larger SPair-71k dataset we use less \u2013 5 embeddings and 20 crops.\nWe choose our hyperparameters based on the validation subset of SPair-71k and PCK@0.05 via a\nfully-randomized search and applied them to all datasets. We use the Adam [73] optimizer to find the\nprompts. For detailed hyperparameter setup see Supplementary Material.\nQualitative highlights. We show qualitative examples of the semantic correspondences estimated by\nour method in Figure 8. Interestingly, our method, even when it disagrees with the human annotation,\nprovides results that can arguably be interpreted as plausible. For example, as shown in the wine bottle\nexample at the bottom-right of Figure 8, source points occluded by the wine glasses are correctly\nmapped to another wine glass in the target image, which disagrees with the human annotator\u2019s label\nwhich points to the wine bottle.\nQuantitative results. We report the performance of our method in Table 1. We compare our method\nagainst weakly-supervised baselines [21, 52, 46], as well as baselines from ASIC [46] that are based\non general-purpose deep features \u2013 using VGG [24] features with Moving Least Squares (MLS)[56]\nand DINO [25] features with Moving Least Squares (MLS) or Nearest Neighbor (NN) matching.\nOur method outperforms all compared weakly supervised baselines. Note that the performance gap in\nterms of average PCK@0.1 compared to the second best method, ASIC [46], is large \u2013 20.9% relative.\nNote also that in the case of the PF-Willow dataset, our method is on par with the current strongly\nsupervised state-of-the-art. Even in the case of the SPair-71k dataset, our results are comparable to a\nvery recent method VAT [15] besides the few problematic classes \u2013 bottle, bus, plant, train, tv. These\nproblematic classes are typically those that exhibit strong symmetry, which we do not explicitly deal\nwith. For detailed per-class results, see our Supplementary Material. Considering that our method is\nfully unsupervised when it comes to the task of semantic correspondences, these results are quite\nsurprising.\nAblations. To ablate our model, we use the PF-Willow [13] dataset and report PCK@0.05.

In Figure 9b, we show that using multiple optimized embeddings significantly boosts\nperformance, and in Figure 9c, we see how using more crops further leads to improvements during\ninference. Finally, besides crops during inference, if we disable random crops during embedding\noptimization PCK@0.05 drops to 45.5 (vs. 53.0 in our full model).\nBeyond semantic correspondences of the same class.. We further experiment with correspondences\nacross different classes \u2013 e.g., correlating different animals. As shown in Figure 10 in many cases\nour method provides correspondences that are arguably correct even for objects that are of different\nclasses. This includes being from similar classes (sheep and dog) to more different classes (bird and\nairplane), and to wildly different classes (chair and horse).\n5\nConclusions\nWe have demonstrated the remarkable potential of leveraging diffusion models, specifically Stable\nDiffusion [30], for the task of semantic correspondence estimation. We have shown that by simply\noptimizing and finding the embeddings for a location of interest, one can find its semantically corre-\nsponding locations in other images, although the diffusion model was never trained for this task. We\nfurther introduced design choices that significantly impact the accuracy of the estimated correspon-\ndences. Ultimately, our approach significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised methods on\nSPair-71k [14], PF-Willow [13], and CUB-200 datasets [37] (20.9% relative for SPair-71k), and even\nachieves performance on par with strongly supervised methods in PF-Willow dataset [13].\nLimitations and future work. This study highlights the emergent properties of training large\nmodels on vast amounts of data, revealing that a model primarily designed for image generation can\nalso be utilized for other tasks, specifically semantic correspondences. The success of our method\nunderscores the importance of exploring the hidden capabilities of these large text-to-image generative\nmodels and suggests that there may be other novel applications and tasks that can benefit from the\nvast knowledge encoded within these models. For example, as an immediate application, our method\ncan be used to scale up training of 3D generative models such as FigNeRF [49] with images from the\nweb without human supervision.\n9\nWe note that our method does have its limitations. Many of the failure modes include dealing with\nsymmetric objects. An explicit way to deal with these cases with more refined techniques to extract\ncorrespondences may help solve this problem. It also requires significant compute. On an NVIDIA\nRTX 3090 GPU, finding a single prompt for a single keypoint takes 30 seconds. We suspect that one\ncould potentially train a semantic correspondence network based on our estimates to achieve both\nscalability in terms of training data and fast inference time.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada\n(NSERC) Discovery Grant, NSERC Collaborative Research and Development Grant, Google, Digital\nResearch Alliance of Canada, and by Advanced Research Computing at the University of British\nColumbia.\nReferences\n[1] B.B.

When looking at the per-class\nperformance over the 18 classes in the Spair-71k dataset it can be seen that our method outperforms\nall weakly supervised methods on 16 out of 18 classes and in many cases (bike, car, motorcycle,\nplant) we have a substantial margin over these methods. We also greatly reduce the margin to strongly\nsupervised methods and for some classes (bike, chair, motorcycle) we outperform them.\nB\nHyperparameter selection\nThe hyperparameters are selected by carrying out 50 different runs, where each run involves 50\ncorrespondences randomly subsampled from the validation set for the SPair-71k [14] dataset.\nDue to the limited computation resources available at our disposal, we only used a subset of the\nvalidation set for searching the hyperparameters. We note that it is possible that a better set of\nhyperparameters can be found should one use the complete validation set. The best-performing\nrun was then chosen based on its PCK@0.1 metric. Each run was executed over the same set of 50\ncorrespondences, maintaining consistency across all trials. The variation between these runs lies\nsolely in the hyperparameters used, which were selected as follows:\n\u2022 U-Net layers: Randomly selected within the range of 7 to 15.\n\u2022 Learning rate for prompt optimization:: A random value between 0.01 and 5e-4 was chosen for\neach run.\n\u2022 Sigma radius: Selected randomly in the range of 8 to 32.\n\u2022 Noise level: Randomly chosen within the range t = 1 to t = 10, where T = 50.\n\u2022 Number of optimization steps: Randomly chosen in the range of 100 to 300.\n\u2022 Image crop size: The images were cropped consistently within each run and set randomly in the\nrange 50%-100%.\nTable 2: SPair-71k [14] detailed results \u2013 we report detailed results on the SPair71k dataset in\nterms of PCK@0.1. Bolded numbers are best results amongst weak- or un-supervised methods. Our\nmethod outperforms all compared weakly supervised baselines and is comparable to CHM [74], a\nstrongly supervised baseline from 2021.

For PF-Willow [13] and CUB-200 [37] datasets, majority of image pairs have most\ncorrespondences correctly localized, demonstrating more than what the accumulated PCK@0.1 shows.\nFor the harder SPair-71k [14] dataset results are spread.\nThe hyperparameters selected from this process were as follows:\n\u2022 U-Net layers: 7, 8, 9, and 10 out of 16. These layers correspond to attention maps of dimensions\n16 \u00d7 16 for layers 7 to 9, and 32 \u00d7 32 for layer 10.\n\u2022 Learning rate for prompt optimization: 2.37 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\u2022 Sigma radius: 27.98\n\u2022 Noise level: Added noise of t = 8 where T = 50\n\u2022 Number of optimization steps: 129\n\u2022 Image crop size: Crop size as a percentage of the original image is 93.17%\nC\nModel architecture\nThe architecture in Figure 3 is based on the stable diffusion model version 1.4 [30]. This architecture\nis designed to accept an input image of shape 3\u00d7512\u00d7512, which is then passed through an encoder\nto yield an image of shape 4 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 with channel dimension C as 4. This encoded image is\nreferred to as z0. In accordance with the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) [59],\nnoise is added to z0 to generate zt.\nThe denoising U-Net architecture for stable diffusion is comprised of a total of 16 layers: 6 layers in\nthe contracting path, 1 layer in the bottleneck, and 9 layers in the expansive path. The progression of\nthe image through these layers, along with the respective dimensions per layer (dl), are as follows:\n\u2022 Contracting path: 64 \u00d7 64 (dl = 40) \u2192 64 \u00d7 64 (dl = 40) \u2192 32 \u00d7 32 (dl = 80) \u2192 32 \u00d7 32 (dl =\n80) \u2192 16 \u00d7 16 (dl = 160) \u2192 16 \u00d7 16 (dl = 160)\n\u2022 Bottleneck: 8 \u00d7 8 (dl = 160)\n\u2022 Expansive path: 16 \u00d7 16 (dl = 160) \u2192 16 \u00d7 16 (dl = 160) \u2192 16 \u00d7 16 (dl = 160) \u2192 32 \u00d7 32 (dl =\n80) \u2192 32 \u00d7 32 (dl = 80) \u2192 32 \u00d7 32 (dl = 80) \u2192 64 \u00d7 64 (dl = 40) \u2192 64 \u00d7 64 (dl = 40) \u2192 64 \u00d7 64\n(dl = 40)\nA typical U-Net layer in text conditioned latent diffusion models [30] is augmented with the cross-\nattention mechanism for conditioning on the prompts. The queries in this mechanism are the\nprojections of the flattened intermediate representations of the U-Net, and the keys and the values are\nthe projections of the prompt embeddings. The total length of tokens for this model, P, is 77 where\neach token has a dimensionality of 768.\nD\nAdditional results\nTo provide more in-depth analysis, in Figure 11 we depict the distribution of image pairs according\nto the ratio of correspondences within the image pair that achieve PCK@0.1. For example, an image\npair with all correctly estimated correspondences would fall into the 100% bin, whereas one that has\nonly have of the correspondences correct in 50%. For PF-Willow [13] and CUB-200 [37] datasets\nour approach produces a high PCK@0.1 score for most test image pairs as shown, indicating the\n16\neffectiveness of our approach. For SPair-71k [14], which is a harder dataset, the results are more\nevenly spread.\nFor each of the bin ranges for each dataset, we visualize representative image pairs in Figure 12,\nFigure 13, and Figure 14. Note that in many cases, incorrectly identified correspondences appear to\nstill align with semantically consistent points on the target object \u2013 they simply disagree with the\nannotated labels of the datasets.\nTypical correct and incorrect examples of attention maps for each dataset can be seen in Fig-\nure 15,Figure 16, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure 19, and Figure 20. Correspondences are\nvisualized as lines that connect source points on the left of each image pair to estimated points on the\nright target image.\n17\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(a) 90%-100%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(b) 80%-90%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(c) 70%-80%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(d) 60%-70%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(e) 50%-60%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(f) 40%-50%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(g) 30%-40%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(h) 20%-30%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(i) 10%-20%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(j) 0%-10%\nFigure 12: Examples for the SPair-71k [14] dataset \u2013 typical image pairs for each bin in Figure 11.\nCorrect correspondences are indicated in blue, while incorrect ones are depicted in orange.\n18\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(a) 90%-100%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(b) 80%-90%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(c) 70%-80%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(d) 60%-70%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(e) 50%-60%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(f) 40%-50%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(g) 30%-40%\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n(h) 20%-30%\n(i) 10%-20%\n(j) 0%-10%\nFigure 13: Examples for the PF-Willow [13] dataset \u2013 typical image pairs for each bin in Figure 11.\nThere are no correspondences with accuracies in the range [0, 30)%.

Despite\nreinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample\ncomplexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or\nMinecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read Crafter\u2019s original aca-\ndemic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through\na large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LATEX source as game context\nand a description of the agent\u2019s current observation, our SPRING framework em-\nploys a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and\ndependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment\nby traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological\norder, with the LLM\u2019s answer to final node directly translating to environment\nactions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context \u201creasoning\u201d induced\nby different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter environment.

Finally, we show the potential of Crafter as a\ntest bed for LLMs. Code at github.com/holmeswww/SPRING\n1\nIntroduction\nOpen-world survival games like Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022) and Crafter (Hafner, 2021) pose\nsignificant challenges for AI algorithms due to a combination of factors: procedural generation\nrequires strong generalization; diverse action space requires multi-task capabilities; technology tree\nrequires long-term planning and deep exploration; diverse and conflicting objectives requires goal\nprioritization. In particular, Crafter is designed for efficient simulation and fast iteration. Similar to\nMinecraft, Crafter features key challenges such as multi-tasking, exploration with a deep and wide\ntech-tree, requiring the agent to craft multiple tools and interact with multiple objects to survive in\nthe game.\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been the go-to approach for game-based problems, with numerous\nsuccesses in games like Go (Silver et al., 2017), robotics (Fu et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023) and\nvarious video games (Vinyals et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Badia et al., 2020; Hafner\net al., 2023). While RL demonstrated impressive performance, it still suffers from certain limitations,\nsuch as high sample complexity and difficulty in incorporating prior knowledge. Such drawbacks\nmake it exceptionally challenging to apply RL to diverse and complex open-world benchmarks like\n\u2217Work done during internship at Microsoft. For correspondence, contact ywu5@andrew.cmu.edu\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2305.15486v3  [cs.AI]  11 Dec 2023\nFigure 1: Overview of SPRING. The context string, shown in the middle column, is obtained by\nparsing the LATEX source code of Hafner (2021). The LLM-based agent then takes input from a\nvisual game descriptor and the context string. The agent uses questions composed into a DAG for\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and the last node of the DAG is parsed into action.\nCrafter (Hafner, 2021) or Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022). Addressing the benefits and drawbacks of RL\nis therefore crucial for achieving a sample-efficient solution.\nOn the other hand, large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery\net al., 2022) have shown remarkable success when prompted for various tasks, including embodied\nplanning and acting (Ahn et al., 2022; Du et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023), QA or\ndialogue (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023), and general problem-solving (Brown et al., 2020;\nBubeck et al., 2023). Their unique planning (Ahn et al., 2022), reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023), and\nproblem-solving (Bubeck et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) ability makes them a promising candidate\nfor incorporating prior knowledge and in-context reasoning for game-based problems, particularly\nwhen it comes to addressing the aforementioned limitations of RL.\nHence, in this work, we study the possibility and reliability of LLMs for understanding and reasoning\nwith human knowledge, in the setting of games. We consider a two staged approach SPRING\n(Figure 1): (1) studying the paper: the first stage reads the LATEX of the paper of (Hafner, 2021) and\n(2) reasoning: the second stage involves reasoning about that knowledge through a QA framework to\ntake an environment action. Note that the Crafter environment was released after the data collection\ndate of GPT-3.5 and GPT 4 (OpenAI, 2023) models2, the environment is unseen to them. We first\nuse LLM to extract prior knowledge from the LATEX source code of the original paper by Hafner\n(2021). We then use a similar QA summarization framework as Wu et al. (2023) which produces QA\ndialogue on game mechanics. SPRING handles significantly more diverse contextual information\nthan (Wu et al., 2023), making use of all 17 action/interaction types and even information about\ndesirable behaviors documented in the paper.\nWe focus on reading the relevant academic paper in the first stage of SPRING, by first deciding\nthe paragraphs that are relevant for playing the game. Then we extract key information through\na series of questions such as \u201cWrite all information helpful for the game in a numbered list.\". In\nthe second stage,we promote and regulate in-context chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs to solve\ncomplex games. The reasoning module is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with questions as nodes\nand dependencies as edges. For example, the question \u201cFor each action, are the requirements met?\"\ndepends on the question \u201cWhat are the top 5 actions?\", creating an edge from the latter to the former.\nFor each environment step, we traverse the DAG computing LLM answers for each node in the\ntopological order of the graph. The final node of the DAG is a question about the best action to take\nand the LLM answer for the question is directly translated to environment action.\nQualitatively, our experiments show that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, can\nexecute sophisticated trajectories independently in Crafter (Hafner, 2021). Quantitatively, SPRING\u2019s\nzero-shot performance with GPT-4 surpassing all state-of-the-art RL algorithmstrained for 1M steps\n(Table 2).\nOur contributions are as follows:\n2GPT-3.5/4 training data ends in September 2021 according to OpenAI API\n2\n\u2022 SPRING is the first to tackle a competitive RL benchmark by explicitly extracting multiple\ninteractions and tech-tree dependencies directly from an academic paper.\n\u2022 We are the first to show SOTA performance in a challenging open world game with a\nzero-shot LLM-based (GPT-4) policy\n\u2022 We study the quality of in-context \u201creasoning\u201d induced by different prompts and propose a\ncontrolled chain-of-thought prompting through a DAG of questions for decision making.\n2\nMethod\nThis section is structured as follows. We first describe how we generate the context from the LATEX\nsource code of Hafner (2021) in Section 2.1. Then we describe our SPRING framework and how we\ncompute the action in Section 2.2.\nProblem Setting\nOur goal is to show that LLMs can plan and act reasonably well in an environment\nwhere control tasks are less required. In the setting of Crafter, we define the states, s, as samples\nfrom state distribution S. We are interested in creating a goal-conditioned policy \u03c0 which maps state\ns to action a \u2208 A, \u03c0 : S \u2192 A. Due to the use of LLM, we further break the policy down into two\nparts: a descriptor D which describes key aspects the visual observation in plain text (d = D(s)).\nAnd an LLM-based actor which takes state description d and outputs action a.\nIn addition, we define Sj\npara to be the jth paragraph in the LATEX source of the environment paper\n(Hafner, 2021), and MLLM to be the LLM which takes a context string and a question string as input\nand outputs an answer to the question.\n2.1\nStudying the paper: Context from LATEX source\nFigure 2: Paper Studying Moudle. The 3-step approach for computing Cq from the LATEXsource\ncode of Hafner (2021). First, as shown in the left column, for each paragraph we compute LLM\nanswer for all relevancy questions in Qrel, and keep only the relevant paragraphs. Second, as shown in\nthe middle column, we compute paragraph-level LLM answer to q. Third, we summarize the answer\ninto Cq with a summary prompt; we concatenate Cq across q \u2208 Qgame and obtain C.\nSimilar to Wu et al. (2023), we compose gameplay specific questions and then compute LLM answer\nto the questions for each subsection in the latex files. Since a considerable amount of the paper is\nirrelevant to the gameplay, we use a set of 2 questions Qrel={\u201cWould this paragarph help me succeed in this game?\",\n\u201cDoes this paragraph contain information on the game mechanics, or game strategies?\"} to identify relevance, and a set of 4\nquestions Qgame={\u201cWrite all information helpful for the game in a numbered list.\", \u201cIn plain text. List all objects I need to interact/avoid to\nsurvive in the game. Use \"I would like to X object Y\" in each step. Replace Y by the actual object, X by the actual interaction.\", \u201cWrite all game\nobjectives numbered list. For each objective, list its requirements.\", \u201cWrite all actions as a numbered list. For each action, list its requirements.\"}\nto summarize gameplay and action space relevant information. We add the prompt \u201cDO NOT answer in\nLaTeX.\u201d to all of Qgame to prevent the LLM from outputting the list in LATEX format.\nFor a specific gameplay specific question q \u2208 Qgame, our goal is to compute Cq, the answer to q\nconditioned on the paper. However, since the length of the paper exceeds input length constraints\nfor most LLMs, we have to break the paper down into paragraphs individual Sj\npara. We provide an\nillustration of the process in Figure 2.\nFirst, we filter the paragraphs for relevance and keep only paragraphs identified as relevant by at least\none question from Qrel. We set P rel\nq\nto be the set of relevant paragraphs.\n3\nP rel\nq\n=\n\b\nSj\npara|\u2203qr \u2208 Qrel s.t. MLLM\n\u0000Sj\npara, qr\n\u0001\n= \u201cYes\u201d\n\t\n(1)\nSecond, we compute the set, Aq, of answers to q for each relevant paragraph from P rel\nq , from the\nLATEX source code.\nAq =\n\b\nMLLM (Spara, q) : Spara \u2208 P rel\nq\n\t\n(2)\nThird, to obtain the answer string Cq from the set Aq, we query an LLM with a summarization\nprompt qsummarize = \u201cRemove duplicate items.\u201d\nCq = MLLM (concat(Aq), qsummarize)\n(3)\nFinally, we concatenate (with the linebreak character) all question-context pairs to form the context\nstring C for SPRING.\nC = concat ({\u201cQuestion: q Answer: Cq\u201d|\u2200q \u2208 Qgame})\n(4)\n2.2\nReasoning: QA-DAG for SPRING\nNode\nQuestion\nq1\nList objects in the current observation. For each object, briefly answer what resource it provides\nand its requirement.\nq2\nWhat was the last action taken by the player?\nq3\nFor each object in the list, are the requirements met for the interaction?\nq4\nDid the last player action succeed? If not, why?\nq5\nList top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nq6\nWhat are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nq7\nList top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from\nthe list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nq8\nFor each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nqa\nChoose the best executable action from above.\nTable 1: List of all 9 questions in Qact. The questions are designed to promote consistent chain-of-\nthought. Experimentally, we find the LLM robust to different phrasing of the questions.\nFigure 3: Reasoning. (a) The visual descriptor takes the last two gameplay screens as input, and\noutputs their descriptions in language (dt, dt\u22121). (b) SPRING traverses a DAG of questions from\nTable 1 in topological order. Answer to the final question qa is mapped to environment action using\nsub-string matching. (c) The LLM answer for each question (node) is conditioned on the previous 2\nsteps of observation, the context C, and answers to the immediate parents of the current node.\nFor LLMs to be able to understand the gameplay, we first follow Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023)\nto define an visual descriptor Mdesc which converts state s \u2208 S to textual description d (Figure 3 a).\n4\nTo achieve consistent chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2021) throughout hundreds of steps\nwithin one round of gameplay, we compose a fixed set of questions Qact = {q1, . . . , qa} to query\nthe LLM at every step of the game, with question-question dependencies as D = {(qu, qv)|qu, qv \u2208\nQact and answering qv requires the answer of qu}. Note that the above specification forms a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) with nodes Qact edges D (Figure 3 b).\nFor any question (node) qv \u2208 Qact, we compute the answer At\nqv for time step t, conditioned on the\ngameplay context C, most recent 2 steps of game description dt\u22121, dt, and answers to its dependencies\n(Figure 3 c).\nAt\nqv = MLLM\n\u0000concat\n\u0000C, dt\u22121, dt,\n\b\nAt\nqu|(qu, qv) \u2208 D\n\t\u0001\n, qv\n\u0001\n(5)\nExperimentally, we find that prompting the LLM with only the direct parents of a question greatly\nreduces the context length, and helps LLM to focus on the most relevant contextual information.\nWe traverse the DAG using a modified topological sort algorithm to compute LLM answer for each\nquestion based on its topological order. Finally, we map the answer to the last question in the node qa\ndirectly to one of the 17 named actions in the environment with sub-string matching (a = At\na). We\ntake the default action \u201cDo\u201d on sub-string matching failure.3\n3\nExperiments and Results\nWe present our experiments as follows. First, we explain our experimental setup and baselines for our\nexperiments. Then, we compare SPRING to popular RL methods on the Crafter benchmark. Finally,\nwe conduct experiments and analysis on different pieces of our architecture to study the influence of\neach part over the in-context \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities of the LLM.\n3.1\nExperimental Details\nThe Crafter environment (Hafner, 2021) is a procedurally generated open-world survival game for\nbenchmarking RL algorithms with 22 achievements in a tech tree of depth 7. The environment is a\ngrid-world features top-down observation and discrete action space of size 17. The observation also\nshows the current inventory state of the player, including its health points, food, water, rest levels,\nand inventory. The game is inspired by Minecraft and features a similar get-to-diamond challenge.\nIn comparison, Crafter captures many key research challenges of Minecraft in a simpler and faster\nenvironment, thus speeding up experiments and result collection.\nEnvironment Descriptor\nThe gameplay screen (top left of Fig 3.) consists of a 9 \u00d7 9 grid\n({(i, j) | 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 9}). The top 7 rows consist of the local view of the world; each cell (i, j) is\nassociated with a pre-defined background (e.g., \u201cgrass\u201d, \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cnone\u201d) and possibly with an object\n\u201casset\u201d (e.g., \u201ctree\u201d, \u201chealth\u201d, \u201cplayer\u201d). The bottom 2 rows represent agent status (e.g., \u201chealth\u201d) and\nitem inventories, which include images of assets (e.g., \u201cstone sword\u201d), and the number of each assent\nin the inventory.\nOur environment descriptor accepts as input the gameplay screen and outputs a text description of\nthe screen. We first create combinations of background and object (appearance) assets. Then we\nadd number assets to recognize the quantity of inventory/ status. We match these combinations\nwith the gameplay screen, using cv2.filters with a matching threshold of 0.9. We disable the\ndetector during nights when observations are unreliable. Finally, for each (i, j), we filter the matched\ncombinations, and select the one with the highest matching score. From this information, we can\nmeasure the distance and direction of each object relative to the player; simultaneously, we can count\nthe agent status and inventory item.\nThe\nenvironment\ndescriptor\nthen\nobtains\nthe\nset\nof\nobjects\nin\nobservation\nO\n=\n{(obj, dist, direction)}, the set of inventory items I = {(object, count)}, and the agent status\nH = {(attribute, value, max)}. Including only the closest object of each kind, we compose the\nobservation description d as: \u201cYou see : - <obj> <dist> steps to your <direction>. Your status:\n<attribute>: <value>/ <max>. Your inventory: - <object>: <count>\u201d. We describe direction of objects\nusing \u201cnorth\u201d,\u201csouth\u201d,\u201ceast\u201d,\u201cwest\u201d.\n3We will release code for our agent at github.com/anonymous\n5\nMethod\nScore\nReward\nTraining Steps4\nHuman Experts\n50.5 \u00b1 6.8%\n14.3 \u00b1 2.3\nN/A\nSPRING + paper (Ours)\n27.3 \u00b1 1.2%\n12.3 \u00b1 0.7\n0\nDreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023)\n14.5 \u00b1 1.6%\n11.7 \u00b1 1.9\n1M\nELLM (Du et al., 2023)\nN/A\n6.0 \u00b1 0.4\n5M\nEDE (Jiang et al., 2022)\n11.7 \u00b1 1.0%\nN/A\n1M\nDreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2020)\n10.0 \u00b1 1.2%\n9.0 \u00b1 1.7\n1M\nPPO (Schulman et al., 2017)\n4.6 \u00b1 0.3%\n4.2 \u00b1 1.2\n1M\nRainbow (Hessel et al., 2018)\n4.3 \u00b1 0.2%\n5.0 \u00b1 1.3\n1M\nPlan2Explore (Sekar et al., 2020)\n2.1 \u00b1 0.1%\n2.1 \u00b1 1.5\n1M\nRND (Burda et al., 2018)\n2.0 \u00b1 0.1%\n0.7 \u00b1 1.3\n1M\nRandom\n1.6 \u00b1 0.0%\n2.1 \u00b1 1.3\n0\nTable 2: Table comparing SPRING and popular RL algorithms in terms of game score, reward, and\ntraining steps. Results for SPRING is summarized over 5 independent trials. SPRING out-performs\nthe previous SOTA in terms of all metrics. In addition, since SPRING gathers knowledge from\nreading the paper, it requires no training.\nEvaluation Metrics\nAgents in Crafter are evaluated primarily based on two metrics: reward and\nscore. The game assigns a sparse +1 reward each time the agent unlocks a new achievement in an\nepisode, and assigns reward of \u22120.1/0.1 when the agent loses/gains one health point. The score\nmetric (Hafner, 2021) is computed by aggregating the success rates for each achievement:\nS = exp\n \n1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nln (1 + si)\n!\n\u2212 1,\nwhere si is the agent\u2019s success rate on achievement i and N = 22 is the number of achievements.\nNote that RL agents only train on the reward, and SPRING does not require any training.\nRL Baselines\nWe include results from popular actor-critic methods like PPO (Schulman et al.,\n2017); DQN variants like Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018); intrinsically motivated methods like\nRND (Burda et al., 2018), Plan2Explore (Sekar et al., 2020), EDE (Jiang et al., 2022); LLM assisted\nsolutions like ELLM Du et al. (2023); model-based methods like DreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2020);\nDreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023), which currently holds the state-of-the-art.\nLLMs.\nFor LLM access, we use GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI, OpenAI) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)\nfrom OpenAI\u2019s API.\n3.2\nOverall Results\nWe compare the performance of RL baselines to SPRING with GPT-4 conditioned on the environment\npaper (Hafner, 2021) in Table 2.\nSPRING out-performs the previous SOTA, including previous attempts at using LLMs for Crafter\nby large margins, achieving an 88% relative improvement on game score and a 5% improvement in\nreward on the best performing RL method (Hafner et al., 2023). Since the model obtains knowledge\nfrom reading the paper, SPRING requires 0 training steps, while RL methods generally require\nmillions of training steps4.\nWe include a plot of unlock rate by task, comparing our method to popular RL baselines in Figure 4.\nSPRING assisted by prior knowledge out-performs RL methods by more than 10x on achievements\nlike \u201cMake Stone Pickaxe\u201d, \u201cMake Stone Sword\u201d, and \u201cCollect Iron\u201d, which are up to depth 5 down\nin the tech tree and significantly harder to reach through random exploration. For achievements\n\u201cEat Cow\u201d and \u201cCollect Drink\u201d, SPRING achieves perfect performance, whereas model-based RL\nframework like Dreamer-V3 has more than 5x lower unlock rate for \u201ceat cow\u201d since cows are moving\nand harder to reach through random exploration. Finally, we note that SPRING did not take the action\n\u201cPlace Stone\u201d, which can be reached easily by random exploration, since placing a stone was not\ndiscussed as beneficial for the agent in the paper (Hafner, 2021).\n4We base our comparison on the hard 1M cap set by Hafner (2021).\n6\nCollect Coal\nCollect Diamond\nCollect Drink\nCollect Iron\nCollect Sapling\nCollect Stone\nCollect Wood\nDefeat Skeleton\nDefeat Zombie\nEat Cow\nEat Plant\nMake Iron Pickaxe\nMake Iron Sword\nMake Stone Pickaxe\nMake Stone Sword\nMake Wood Pickaxe\nMake Wood Sword\nPlace Furnace\nPlace Plant\nPlace Stone\nPlace Table\nWake Up\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\nSuccess Rate (%)\nOurs\nDreamerV3\nRainbow\nFigure 4: Ability spectrum showing the unlocking percentages for all 22 achievements.

Since SPRING starts off with knowledge about the game, it achieves\nmore than 10x higher unlock rate on previously hard-to-reach tasks like \u201cEat Plant\u201d, \u201cMake Stone\nPickaxe\u201d, \u201cMake Stone Sword\u201d, and \u201cCollect Iron\u201d.\nMethod\nAchievement Depth\nReward\nQuestions per Step\nSPRING + Full Paper\n6\n12.3 \u00b1 0.7\n9\nSPRING + Paper w/ modified C\n4\n9.4 \u00b1 1.8\n9\nSPRING + Action Description\n4\n8.2 \u00b1 0.2\n9\nSPRING + w/o C\n1\n0.5 \u00b1 0.2\n9\nSPRING + Full Paper\n6\n12.3 \u00b1 0.7\n9\nStep-by-step prompt + Full Paper\n5\n7.3 \u00b1 4.4\n2\nQA w/o DAG + Full Paper\n4\n4.3 \u00b1 3.9\n9\nw/o QA + Full Paper\n2\n2.4 \u00b1 1.3\n1\nSPRING + Full Paper\n6\n12.3 \u00b1 0.7\n9\nSPRING + Full Paper w/ GPT-3.5\n2\n3.3 \u00b1 2.9\n9\nTable 3: Analysis on how different parts of SPRING contribute to its performance, comparing the\nmax achievement depth in the tech tree, the reward, and the number of human-written questions in\nthe prompt. Results are summarized over 5 independent trials. The first 4 rows study the necessity\nof prior knowledge from the context string C. The middle 4 rows study different chain-of-thought\nprompting techniques. The last 2 rows study the role of LLMs. All three aspects are important for\nSPRING to achieve best reported performance.\n3.3\nComponent Analysis\nWe study how the different aspects of the framework contribute to the behavior of the agent through a\nseries of ablations as shown in Table 3.\nStudying the LATEX Paper\nIn the first 4 rows of Table 3, we investigate the contribution of\ngameplay context from the LATEX paper toward performance of the agent. We report the performance\nof SPRING with no contextual information (w/o C) (row 4); SPRING conditioned on only the action\ndescriptions and dependencies from (Hafner, 2021) Table F.1 (only question 4 from Qgame) (row 3);\nSPRING conditioned on the context manually modified to exclude the \u201ccrafting table\u201d dependency\nfor wooden_pickaxe by removing two corresponding lines from the context C (row 2); SPRING\nconditioned on the full context from the paper (row 1).\nAs expected, since Crafter environment is unseen for GPT, the agent achieves performance similar\nto random agent without any game context. When provided with only action descriptions and\naction dependencies, using only question 4 from Qgame in section 2.1, SPRING achieves strong 67%\nperformance comparable to DreamerV2 (Silver et al., 2017).\nFor the next piece of the experiment, we manually remove \u201cnear crafting table\u201d dependency for\nwooden_pickaxe from it\u2019s context, which is required for 11 later achievements. SPRING with GPT-4\nincurs a 24% performance drop. Interestingly, we find that the LLM has some ability to recover from\n7\nthe inaccurate context information. We observe that after failing to craft the wooden_pickaxe without\na table, the agent instead tries to craft a wooden_sword first to maintain survival. Eventually, the agent\nwas able to identify the missing requirement through guessing and trying after some unsuccessful\ntrials, and craft the wooden_pickaxe. However, the confusion delayed the agent\u2019s progress and\ntherefore causes the performance gap with the agent conditioned on the full context (row 5).\nReasoning\nIn the middle 4 rows of Table 3, we investigate the contribution of different prompting\nmethods toward performance of the model. Conditioned on the full context from the LATEX paper, we\nreport the performance of GPT-4 directly prompted to output the action using the last question qa only\n(row 8); GPT-4 prompted with all questions from Qact but in a list without the DAG dependencies D\n(row 7); GPT-4 prompted \u201cLet\u2019s think step-by-step\u201d (Kojima et al., 2022) about the next action, and\nprompted to choose a permissible action qa with let\u2019s think step-by-step followed by qa again (row\n6); GPT-4 with SPRING (row 5).\nRelative to our method, we observe that directly prompting the LLM for the action leads to a 80%\nperformance drop, and therefore does not result in a meaningful agent. The popular chain-of-thought\nreasoning prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think step-by-step\u201d (Kojima et al., 2022) achieves reasonable reward with\na 40% drop, but with a high 60.27% standard deviation. Qualitatively, we observe that the LLM\nproduces inconsistent outputs across time steps, due to the fact that the model\u2019s chain-of-thought\nis not directed or controlled through the prompt. Therefore, LLMs prompted with \u201cLet\u2019s think\nstep-by-step\u201d alone cannot reliably follow a good policy. Controlling the chain-of-thought with 9\nquestions from Qact (section 2.2) successfully controls the consistency of LLM outputs across time\nqualitatively. However, we observe that the LLM often ignores earlier questions at later stages of QA\nwhen all previous questions are presented in a list, leading to random disagreements in answers. For\nexample, the LLM may correctly identify that it needs \u201cwooden pickaxe\u201d to mine the stone ahead\nin the first few questions, but forgets about the requirement later when it\u2019s prompted for actions.\nQuantitatively, the model performs 65% worse with 90% variance without the DAG. The introduction\nof DAG eliminates this problem by reducing the QA context length to only a question\u2019s immediate\nparents.\nOverall, SPRING achieves the best performance and a small 6% performance standard deviation, due\nto more consistent reasoning over time steps with better focus and fewer distractions.\nLLM\nIn the last two rows of Table 3, we show that the same architecture does not work well with\nGPT-3.5-turbo. We believe the observed 73% performance gap mainly comes from GPT-3.5-turbo\u2019s\nworse performance at following fine-grained instructions in each of the questions, which are required\nfor chain-of-thought reasoning with SPRING.\n3.4\nCost for running SPRING\nThe number of queries per step is 9 (same as the number of questions). Each game could take around\n300 steps, but can go up to 500 steps in the worst case. Therefore, the maximum number of queries\nper game can go up to 4500. According to the public price of GPT-4 API, each query costs around\n0.065. The total cost should be less than 270 (USD) per game with GPT-4. Given the progress\nin chip-set development, we are hopeful that the inference costs will lower, making LLMs more\naccessible for the public.\n3.5\nPotential for Benchmarking LLMs\nIn Table 4, we compare popular publicly available LLMs including GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5\n(text-davinci-003) (OpenAI, OpenAI), Bard (Manyika, Manyika), Claude (Anthropic, Anthropic),\nAlpaca-30b (Taori et al., 2023) under the same setting on Crafter, following the same step-by-step\nprompt as Section 3.3 and Table 3. We observe a clear separation in performance under our setting.\n4\nRelated Work\nRL v.s.

However, RL algorithms are typically trained with reward functions\ndeliberately engineered to cover all in-game achievements (Hafner, 2021; Hafner et al., 2023). Such\nreward functions often require a lot of expert knowledge and careful formulation.\nOn the other hand, LLM agents like SPRING does not need the reward (we report reward for\ncomparison purpose, SPRING does not use the reward during inference), but instead uses external\nknowledge from the LATEX source code. In addition, current LLM agents lack the capabilities of\nimproving from interactions.\nWe hope future works would be able to leverage the benefits of both paradigms in order to achieve\nefficient planning with fine-grained control.\nPolicy Informed by Natural Language Instructions\nIn the instruction following setting, step-by-\nstep instructions have been used to generate auxiliary rewards, when environment rewards are sparse.\nGoyal et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2019) use auxiliary reward-learning modules trained offline to\npredict whether trajectory segments correspond to natural language annotations of expert trajectories.\nThere has been many attempts to go beyond instruction following to learning from unstructured\nnatural language (Branavan et al., 2012; Goldwasser and Roth, 2014; Zhong et al., 2021; Wang\nand Narasimhan, 2021). Zhong et al. (2021); Wang and Narasimhan (2021) make use of special\narchitectures to learn reasoning on grid worlds with template-generated instructions. However, the\nmodel requires 200 million training samples from templates identical to the test environments. Such\na training requirement limiting the generalization of the model and causes performance loss even on\nslightly bigger grid worlds with identical mechanics.\nWu et al. (2023) proposes a summary (Read) and reasoning (Reward) through a QA prompting\nframework with an open-source QA LLM (Tafjord and Clark, 2021). The framework demonstrates\nthe possibility of an using real-world human-written manuals to improve RL performance on popular\ngames, despite limiting the interaction types to only \u201chit\u201d. Our framework handles all 17 kinds of\ninteractions available in the game. Moreover, our framework makes use of information on tech-tree\ndependencies, and suggestions on desired policies extracted from the academic paper.\nLLMs for Planning\nLLMs have shown promising results at high-level planning in indoor embodied\nmanipulation environments. Huang et al. (2022); Ahn et al. (2022) primarily explores generating\nplans for embodied tasks, with limited actions space and trajectory length. Song et al. (2022); Wu\net al. (2022) enhances Ahn et al. (2022) with greater action diversity and real-time re-planning.\nHowever, a lot of the high-level plans lack executability and has to be post-processed to meet specific\ntask requirements, thus limiting the generalization to complex open world tasks. In addition, all\nprior works along this line operates on few-shot human/expert generated demonstrations containing\nup to 17 trajectories to provide context for LLMs, which requires more manual labor, and may\nlimit the generalization to unseen scenarios. In comparison, our SPRING framework requires no\ndemonstration.\nLLMs for Open World Games\nCompared to popular indoor manipulation tasks, planning in open-\nworld game environments poses the following additional challenges. 1) Long horizon. Due to the\nnature how in-game achievement/technology progresses, a successful gameplay can easily go beyond\n200 steps (Hafner, 2021). 2) Parallel objectives. Open-world environments contain objectives that\ncan be pursued in parallel and often require prioritization (Wang et al., 2023). Therefore, open world\ngames are significantly more challenging than current indoor embodied manipulation environments.\n9\nDu et al. (2023) applies LLMs as high-level planners to assist RL exploration in Crafter. Wang\net al. (2023); Yuan et al. (2023) use LLMs as high-level planner and goal selector to control a low\nlevel-policy in Minecraft. Tsai et al. (2023) studies the capabilities of ChatGPT on text games.\nNotably, all prior works require expert or human generated example trajectories as context for the\nLLMs. Since the example trajectories do not cover all scenarios, all prior works may encounter\nunseen situation during evaluation, leading to an overall performance inferior to state-of-the-art\nRL algorithms (Hessel et al., 2018; Guss et al., 2021; Hafner et al., 2023), trained without the use\nof LLMs. To our knowledge, we are the first to show an LLM (GPT-4) achieving performance\nsurpassing the state-of-the-art RL algorithms in a challenging open world game.\n5\nLimitations and Future Work\nA primary limitation in using an LLM to support interaction with the environment is the need for\nobject recognition and grounding. However, these limitations do not exist in environments that offer\naccurate object information, such as contemporary games (Fan et al., 2022) and virtual reality worlds\n(Kolve et al., 2017). While pre-trained visual backbones (He et al., 2017) perform poorly on games,\nthey have shown reasonable performance for environments closer to the real-world (Shridhar et al.,\n2020). In addition, with recent progress on visual-language models (Bubeck et al., 2023; Driess et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), we believe there will be reliable and generalizable solutions\nto visual-language understanding in the foreseeable future. Future works could focus on address the\nrequirement for a separate visual descriptor with large visual-language models.\n6\nConclusions\nIn this work, we explore solving the Crafter (Hafner, 2021) RL benchmark using the latest LLMs by\nreading the LATEX source code of an academic paper about the benchmark. We study the quality of\nin-context \u201creasoning\u201d and \u201cplanning\u201d induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of\nthe Crafter open-world environment. To enforce consistent planning and execution over hundreds of\nenvironment steps, we introduce SPRING, an innovative prompting framework for LLMs designed\nto enable in-context chain-of-thought planning and reasoning. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4\noutperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training.\nOur work demonstrates the reliability of LLMs for understanding and reasoning with human knowl-\nedge. We hope that our work points to a new way of integrating human prior knowledge into RL\ntraining through intrinsic rewards (Wu et al., 2023), hierarchical RL (Shu et al., 2017), or sub-goal\nplanning (Wang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023).\nBroader Impacts\nOur research on LLM holds potential for both positive and negative impacts. The benefits include\nbetter understanding of the powers of LLM and enhanced integration of prior knowledge, which could\nlead to advancement in various AI topics. However, the risks may involve reliance on computationally\ndemanding models, game cheating or exploitation, and reliance on prior knowledge.\nReferences\nAhn, M., A. Brohan, N. Brown, Y.

For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its\nrequirement.\nAnswer:\n1. Tree: Provides wood when chopped down; requires having a wood pickaxe or better to chop down.\n2. Cow: Provides food (meat) when killed; requires having a wood sword or better to kill.\n3. Grass: Can be used to make plantations or used for aesthetic purposes; requires being dug to collect.\nQuestion: What was the last action taken by the player?\nAnswer:\nThe last action taken by the player was move_east.\nQuestion: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?\nAnswer:\nBased on the current observation and inventory:\n1. Tree: The requirement is not met because you need a wood pickaxe or better to chop down the tree, and you have nothing in\nyour inventory.\n2. Cow: The requirement is not met because you need a wood sword or better to kill the cow, and you have nothing in your\ninventory.\n3. Grass: The requirement is met as you can dig the grass without any special tool.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Collect Wood (Priority: 5/5) - Collecting wood is essential to craft tools and build structures. First, you need to craft\na wood pickaxe to chop down trees and obtain wood. However, you currently don\u2019t have the required tools to interact\nwith the tree.\n2. Craft a Wood Pickaxe and Wood Sword (Priority: 4/5) - Once you collect wood, you should craft a wood pickaxe to enable\ncollecting stone and a wood sword to defend yourself and hunt for food. You need a table to craft these items, so you\nmight need to find or place one.\n3. Collect Food and Water (Priority: 3/5) - Maintaining your food and drink levels is crucial for survival. You have\nobserved a cow nearby, but you currently don\u2019t have the required tools to kill it. You should prioritize crafting\ntools, and then hunt the cow for food. For water, you need to find a water source like a lake or river to drink from.\nNote: The priority scale is from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest priority.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nTop Sub-task: Collect Wood\nRequirements:\n1. Facing the tree\n2. Having the necessary tool (wood pickaxe) to chop down the tree and collect wood\nWhat should the player do first:\nBefore collecting wood, the player needs to craft a wood pickaxe. To craft a wood pickaxe, the player requires a table and\nwood in their inventory. Since the player currently doesn\u2019t have any tools or a table, they should first find or place\na table, then collect wood using their hands or any available tool, and use the table to craft a wood pickaxe. After\ncrafting the wood pickaxe, the player can chop down the tree and collect wood more efficiently, which can be used for\ncrafting other tools and structures.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)\nThe player should move east towards the tree to collect wood, which will help them in crafting a table and the necessary\ntools.\n2. Priority 2: Do (Chop tree) (Requirement: Facing tree; have necessary tool or bare hands)\nOnce the player is near the tree, they should chop down the tree using their hands or any available tool to collect wood.\n3. Priority 3: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)\nAfter collecting wood, the player should place a table using the wood in their inventory. This table will help the player\ncreate the required tools.\n16\n4. Priority 4: Make Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory)\nUsing the table, the player should craft a wood pickaxe, which will help them collect resources more efficiently.\n5. Priority 5: Collect Wood using Wood Pickaxe (Requirement: Facing the tree, having the wood pickaxe)\nWith the wood pickaxe, the player can chop down trees and collect wood faster, allowing them to craft more tools and\nstructures for survival.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met. The player\u2019s most recent observation states they\u2019re facing grass towards the east,\nindicating there\u2019s a flat ground on the east side.\n2. Do (Chop tree): No, the requirement is not met yet. The player needs to move closer to the tree (3 steps to the east) and\nface it to meet the requirement for chopping down the tree.\n3. Place Table: No, the requirement is not met. The player needs to collect wood by chopping the tree first.\n4. Make Wood Pickaxe: No, the requirement is not met. The player needs to collect wood and place a table to craft a wood\npickaxe.\n5. Collect Wood using Wood Pickaxe: No, the requirement is not met. The player needs to create a wood pickaxe first and then\nface a tree to collect wood with the pickaxe.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the east, allowing the player to\nmove in that direction.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from the list above is \"Move East\" as its requirement (flat ground right to the agent) is met\naccording to the player\u2019s most recent observation.\n============Step: 3, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_east.\nYou see:\n- stone 7 steps to your south-east\n- tree 2 steps to your east\n- cow 3 steps to your east\nYou face grass at your front (east).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 9/9\n- drink: 9/9\n- energy: 9/9\nYou have nothing in your inventory.\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove East\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its\nrequirement.\nAnswer:\n1. Tree: Provides wood which can be used to craft tools and weapons; Requirements: None, just approach the tree and interact\nwith it.\n2. Cow: Provides meat which can be consumed for food; Requirements: None, just approach the cow and interact with it.\n3. Stone: Provides stone which can be used to craft tools, weapons, and build structures; Requirements: Requires a wood\npickaxe or better for efficient collection, just approach the stone and interact with it.\nQuestion: What was the last action taken by the player?\nAnswer:\nThe last action taken by the player was \"move_east.\"\nQuestion: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?\nAnswer:\n1. Tree: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction as there are no specific tools needed to collect wood from the tree.\nYou can approach it and interact with it directly.\n2. Cow: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction as there are no specific tools needed to obtain meat from the cow.\nHowever, having a weapon like a wood sword would be helpful for efficient collection. You can approach it and interact\nwith it directly.\n3. Stone: No, the requirements are not met for interaction as you need a wood pickaxe or better to efficiently collect the\nstone. You currently do not have any pickaxe in your inventory.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Collect wood from the nearby tree (Priority: 5/5) - This is the most essential sub-task, as wood is the basic resource\nneeded to craft tools and weapons, such as a wood pickaxe, which would enable collecting stone.\n2. Craft a wood pickaxe after collecting wood (Priority: 4/5) - Crafting a wood pickaxe will be necessary to efficiently\nmine stone, another important resource for crafting better tools and building structures.\n17\n3. Obtain meat from the nearby cow (Priority: 3/5) - While not as immediately essential as collecting wood or crafting tools,\nobtaining meat from the cow will help ensure a steady food supply and keep the player\u2019s food level at a safe point.\nHaving a weapon like a wood sword would be helpful, but not strictly necessary for this sub-task.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nThe top sub-task is to collect wood from the nearby tree.\nRequirements:\n- Be close enough to the tree in order to interact with it.\nAs the tree is 2 steps to the east of the player, the first thing the player should do is move east to get closer to the\ntree until they are adjacent to it. Then, they can start interacting with the tree to collect wood.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move East (Action 2) - The requirement is that there is flat ground to the east of the player.\n2. Priority 2: Move East (Action 2) - The requirement is that there is flat ground to the east of the player, and the tree\nis not yet adjacent.\n3.

Iron: No, the requirement of a stone_pickaxe or better is not met as the player only has a wood_pickaxe in their\ninventory.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Craft a Stone Pickaxe (Priority 5): Mine stone (using the wood_pickaxe) and craft a stone_pickaxe at the table to meet\nthe requirement for mining iron.\n2. Mine Coal (Priority 4): Use the wood_pickaxe to mine the coal nearby, as coal is useful for smelting iron and creating\nbetter tools and weapons.\n3. Mine and Collect Wood (Priority 3): Interact with the tree to collect wood resources, which are essential for crafting\nitems, tools, and building structures.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nThe requirements for the top sub-task (Craft a Stone Pickaxe) are:\n1. Mine Stone: Use the wood_pickaxe to mine nearby stone. The player sees stone 2 steps to their south-east.\n2. Access a Table: There is a table 2 steps to the player\u2019s south. They need to be close to the table to craft a\nstone_pickaxe.\nThe player should first move towards the stone (south-east) and mine it using their wood_pickaxe to collect enough stone\nresources for crafting a stone_pickaxe.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1 - Move South-East: This action has a flat ground requirement. The player needs to move south-east to approach\nthe stone visible 2 steps away in that direction.\n47\n2. Priority 2 - Do: Facing the creature or material and having the necessary tool are the requirements. In this case, the\nplayer should use their wood_pickaxe to mine the stone they approached in the previous step.\n3. Priority 3 - Move South: Flat ground is required. Since the table is 2 steps to the player\u2019s south, moving south will\nbring the player closer to the table, which is needed for crafting.\n4. Priority 4 - Make Stone Pickaxe: The requirements are that there must be a nearby table and that the player has wood and\nstone in their inventory. After collecting the stone in the previous steps, the player can now craft a stone_pickaxe\nwhile being close to the table.\n5. Priority 5 - Drink: To restore the drink meter before it drops too low, the player needs to find a drinkable water source.\nThis action requires a drink source like a lake or river within reach.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1 - Move South-East: Yes, the requirement of flat ground is met as there is a path one step to the player\u2019s east\nand stone two steps to the player\u2019s south-east.\n2. Priority 2 - Do: Not yet, as the player has not moved to the stone yet. Once the player moves to the stone, the\nrequirements of facing the material (stone) and having the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe) will be met.\n3. Priority 3 - Move South: Yes, the requirement of flat ground is met. The table being two steps to the player\u2019s south\nindicates that it is reachable.\n4. Priority 4 - Make Stone Pickaxe: Not yet, as the player has not collected the stone yet. Once the player moves to the\nstone and collects it using the wood_pickaxe, the requirements of a nearby table and having wood and stone in the\ninventory will be met.\n5. Priority 5 - Drink: No, the current observation does not provide information about a drinkable water source. The player\nneeds to find a lake or river within reach before this requirement will be met.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action of \"move_north\" succeeded. In Player Observation Step 50, we can see that the player has moved\nto a new position facing the iron to their north. The action succeeded because there was likely flat ground to the\nnorth allowing the player to move in that direction.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from the list above is Priority 1 - Move South-East.

Priority 5/5: Craft a stone_pickaxe using the collected stone and wood, which will be required to collect the iron (2\nsteps to your south) and other valuable resources. You will need to locate a crafting table or create one if you haven\n\u2019t done so yet.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nRequirements for the top sub-task (Collect more wood from the tree):\n1. Wood_pickaxe: The player already has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory.\n2. Proximity to the tree: The tree is 3 steps to the player\u2019s west.\nWhat should the player do first:\nThe player should first move towards the tree by taking 3 steps to the west. Once adjacent to the tree, the player can then\nuse the wood_pickaxe to collect more wood.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\nPriority 1:\nAction: Move West (towards the tree for wood)\nRequirement: Flat ground left to the agent\nNote: Move West action might be performed multiple times (up to 3 steps) to reach the tree.\nPriority 2:\nAction: Do (to collect wood using wood_pickaxe)\nRequirement: Facing the tree; have the wood_pickaxe in the inventory\nPriority 3:\nAction: Move South (approach a path containing resources)\nRequirement: Flat ground below the agent\nPriority 4:\nAction: Do (use wood_pickaxe to collect coal and iron)\nRequirement: Facing coal or iron; have the wood_pickaxe in the inventory\nPriority 5:\nAction: Sleep (to restore energy)\nRequirement: Energy level is below maximum\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\nPriority 1:\nAction: Move West (towards the tree for wood)\nRequirement: Flat ground left to the agent\n- The requirement is met as there is grass 1 step to the west.\n82\nPriority 2:\nAction: Do (to collect wood using wood_pickaxe)\nRequirement: Facing the tree; have the wood_pickaxe in the inventory\n- The requirement is not met yet as the player is not facing the tree. The player needs to move closer to the tree and face\nit before this requirement is met.\nPriority 3:\nAction: Move South (approach a path containing resources)\nRequirement: Flat ground below the agent\n- The requirement is met as there is a path 1 step to the south.\nPriority 4:\nAction: Do (use wood_pickaxe to collect coal and iron)\nRequirement: Facing coal or iron; have the wood_pickaxe in the inventory\n- The requirement is not met yet as the player is not facing coal or iron. The player needs to move closer to the coal or\niron and face it before this requirement is met.\nPriority 5:\nAction: Sleep (to restore energy)\nRequirement: Energy level is below maximum\n- The requirement is met as the player\u2019s energy is currently at 8/9.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the agent\u2019s east, allowing the\nagent to move in that direction. The player now faces a stone at their front (east).\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from the list above is:\nPriority 1:\nAction: Move West (towards the tree for wood)\nRequirement: Flat ground left to the agent\n============Step: 51, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_west.\nYou see:\n- stone 2 steps to your east\n- path 2 steps to your south-east\n- tree 2 steps to your west\n- lava 6 steps to your north-east\n- coal 4 steps to your south-east\n- iron 3 steps to your south-east\n- cow 6 steps to your north-west\nYou face grass at your front (west).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 7/9\n- drink: 7/9\n- energy: 8/9\nYour inventory:\n- stone: 2\n- coal: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove West\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation.

Coal: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction as you have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory.\n83\n7. Iron: No, the requirements are not met for interaction as iron requires a stone_pickaxe or better to mine, and you only\nhave a wood_pickaxe.\n8. Cow: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction, as any weapon or tool can be used to kill a cow, although better\nweapons will increase the damage dealt.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 4/5: Craft a stone_pickaxe: Since you have enough stone in your inventory, crafting a stone_pickaxe will allow\nyou to mine iron and advance further in the game.\n2. Priority 4/5: Collect wood: Collecting wood will enable you to craft additional tools, a table, and construct shelter.\nWood is a versatile resource that is essential for progressing in the game.\n3. Priority 3/5: Kill a cow and collect food: Your food level is at 7/9, so you\u2019ll need to replenish it soon. Killing a cow\nand collecting food will ensure you stay healthy, and it can also prevent the risk of running out of food in critical\nsituations.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nThe top sub-task is crafting a stone_pickaxe. The requirements for this task are:\n1. Having wood and stone in your inventory. (You already have 2 stones, but you need wood.)\n2. Being near a table to craft the pickaxe.\nBefore the player can craft a stone_pickaxe, they should first collect wood which is a necessary resource for crafting. The\nwood can be collected by approaching a tree (there\u2019s one 2 steps to the west) and using the wood_pickaxe. After\ncollecting wood, the player should ensure that they are near a table to craft the stone_pickaxe. If there is no table\nnearby, the player may need to place one using the wood they collected.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent)\nReason: To get closer to the tree (2 steps to the west) in order to collect wood.\n2. Priority 2: Do (Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)\nReason: To use the wood_pickaxe on the tree to collect wood once you are near it and facing it.\n3. Priority 3: Place Table (Requirement: Wood in inventory)\nReason: Once you have collected wood, place a table to use for crafting.\n4. Priority 4: Make Stone Pickaxe (Requirement: Nearby table; wood, stone in inventory)\nReason: To craft the stone_pickaxe which will allow the player to collect iron and progress in the game.\n5. Priority 5: Move South-East (Requirement: Flat ground below and right to the agent)\nReason: To get closer to iron (3 steps to your south-east) after crafting the stone_pickaxe, which will be used to collect\niron.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Move West: Yes, the requirement of flat ground left to the agent is met since the player faces grass to the west.\n2. Do: Not yet, the player needs to be facing the tree and have the required tool (wood_pickaxe is in inventory) to collect\nwood.\n3. Place Table: No, the requirement of having wood in the inventory is not met. The player needs to collect wood first.\n4. Make Stone Pickaxe: Not yet, the player needs a nearby table for crafting, and although stone is in the inventory, the\nplayer needs to collect wood and place the table first.\n5. Move South-East: Yes, the requirement for the flat ground below, and right to the agent is met; this direction leads\ntowards the iron. However, the player should first complete the crafting of a stone_pickaxe before collecting iron.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action \"move_west\" succeeded because the player was able to move from facing stone to facing grass, as\nmentioned in the observations. There was flat ground (grass) to the west of the player, which allowed the player to\nmove in that direction successfully.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from the list above is \"Move West\" because the requirement of flat ground left to the agent is\nmet and it brings the player closer to the tree to collect wood, which is essential for crafting and progressing in\nthe game.\n============Step: 52, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_west.\nYou see:\n- grass 1 steps to your north\n- stone 3 steps to your east\n- path 3 steps to your south-east\n- lava 7 steps to your north-east\n- coal 5 steps to your south-east\n- iron 4 steps to your south-east\n- cow 5 steps to your north-west\nYou face tree at your front (west).\nYour status:\n84\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 7/9\n- drink: 7/9\n- energy: 8/9\nYour inventory:\n- stone: 2\n- coal: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove West\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation.

Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Create a stone_pickaxe:\nPriority: 5/5\n85\nReason: A stone_pickaxe will allow you to mine iron ore and collect more resources efficiently. Since you have the\nnecessary stone and a wood_pickaxe, crafting a stone_pickaxe should be your top priority.\n2. Collect more wood:\nPriority: 4/5\nReason: Wood is essential for crafting numerous items and tools in the game. You\u2019re currently facing a tree, and although\nyou don\u2019t have an axe, you can still collect wood using your hands or another tool.\n3. Pursue and kill a cow for food and leather:\nPriority: 3/5\nReason: Your food level is 7/9, and killing a cow will provide meat for sustenance and leather for armor. It\u2019s not a top\npriority but still important to ensure your survival in the game. Using a weapon like a sword will make this task\nmore efficient.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nTop Sub-task: Create a stone_pickaxe\nRequirements:\n1. A crafting table - You need a crafting table to create more advanced tools like the stone_pickaxe.\n2. Stone - You already have two pieces of stone in your inventory, which is sufficient to craft a stone_pickaxe.\n3. Wood - You need wood or wooden planks to create tool handles. Since you already have a wood_pickaxe, it is likely you\nhave crafted with wood before, so it is assumed you know the process of turning wood into planks.\nWhat should the player do first?\n1. Build a crafting table if you haven\u2019t already. To craft a table, collect wood from a tree, convert the wood into wooden\nplanks, and then use four wooden planks to craft a table.\n2. Once the crafting table is built, place it in front of you (if not already there).\n3. Interact with the crafting table, and use the available stone and wood in your inventory to create a stone_pickaxe.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action.

Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1 - Move West: Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent. (This is based on the most recent in-game observation\nwhere the player is facing grass (west). Going west would allow the player to explore more and potentially find a\nwater source.)\n2. Priority 2 - Move North: Requirement: Flat ground above of the agent. (Exploring north could increase the chances of\nfinding a water source, fulfilling the drink objective.)\n3. Priority 3 - Move East: Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent. (By exploring east, the player may come across a\nwater source or other needed resources.)\n4. Priority 4 - Move South: Requirement: Flat ground below the agent. (Going south would further the exploration and could\nyield a water source or other valuable assets.)\n5. Priority 5 - Do (Drink Water): Requirement: Facing a water source like a lake or river at the agent\u2019s front. (This action\nwould be taken once the player has found a water source and faced it. Drinking water would restore the player\u2019s\nthirst levels.)\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Move West: Yes, the requirement is met. The player is currently facing grass (west) which indicates flat ground left to\nthe agent.\n2. Move North: Based on the player observation, there is no information about what\u2019s directly north, so it\u2019s unclear if\nthere is flat ground above the agent. However, there is a path 2 steps to the north-east and a tree 4 steps to the\nnorth-west, which may indicate that moving north could be possible.\n3. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met. There is a path 2 steps to the agent\u2019s north-east and flat ground is right to the\nagent.\n4. Move South: Based on the player observation, there is no information about what\u2019s directly south, so it\u2019s unclear if\nthere is flat ground below the agent. However, there is a stone 3 steps to the agent\u2019s south-east and a table 2 steps\nto the agent\u2019s south-east, which may indicate that moving south could be possible.\n5. Do (Drink Water): No, the requirement is not met as the player is currently facing grass (west) and there is no water\nsource at the agent\u2019s front that the player can drink from. The player must first locate a water source and face it to\nfulfill this requirement.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded because there was flat ground to the west of the player, allowing them to\nmove in that direction without any obstacles.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from above is Move West because the requirement is met, as the player is currently facing grass (\nwest) which indicates flat ground left to the agent. This action will allow the player to explore and potentially find\nvaluable resources such as a water source.\n============Step: 95, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_west.\nYou see:\n- stone 3 steps to your south-east\n- path 2 steps to your north-east\n- tree 4 steps to your north-west\n- table 2 steps to your south-east\n- cow 5 steps to your north-west\nYou face grass at your front (west).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 6/9\n- drink: 5/9\n- energy: 8/9\nYour inventory:\n- stone: 1\n- coal: 2\n- iron: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n- stone_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\n148\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove East\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation.

Priority 1: Move South-East (Action 3) - Requirements: Flat ground diagonal to the agent.\nYes, the requirements are met. The player can move south-east to get closer to the stone.\n2. Priority 2: Move South (Action 4) - Requirements: Flat ground below the agent.\nNo, the requirements are currently not met. After moving south-east, the player might have the flat ground below them, and\nthen they can move south.\n3. Priority 3: Do (Action 5) - Requirements: Facing the stone resource (3 steps south-east); have the stone_pickaxe (already\nin the inventory).\nNo, the requirements are currently not met. The player needs to be near and facing the stone resource first, which will be\npossible after moving south-east and then south.\n4. Priority 4: Move North-East (Action 2) - Requirements: Flat ground diagonal to the agent.\nNo, the requirements are currently not met. The player first has to move south-east, south, and mine the stone before they\ncan move northeast towards the table.\n5. Priority 5: Place Furnace (Action 9) - Requirements: Stone in inventory (will be collected after mining the stone).\nNo, the requirements are currently not met. The player needs to successfully mine the stone, and then they can place the\nfurnace near the table.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded. The player was able to move west because there was flat ground (grass) in\nfront of the player, allowing them to move in that direction.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move South-East (Action 3) as it has its requirements met: there is\nflat ground diagonal to the agent.

Priority 1: Place Furnace (Requirement: Stone in inventory)\nThe player has enough stone in their inventory to craft a furnace, which is needed for smelting iron ores later.\n2. Priority 2: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent)\nThe player should start exploring their surroundings to locate iron ores which are necessary for crafting an iron_pickaxe\nand iron_sword.\n3. Priority 3: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent)\nContinuing exploration in search of iron ores, the player should move in different directions.\n4. Priority 4: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool)\nOnce the player locates iron ores, they should use their stone_pickaxe to mine them for collecting more iron.\n5. Priority 5: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent)\nAs part of exploring the surroundings and possibly finding more resources, the player can move in this direction as well.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Place Furnace: Yes, the requirement is met. The player has 1 stone in their inventory, which is enough to place a furnace.\n2. Move East: Yes, the requirement is met. The player faces a path (flat ground) to their east.\n3. Move South: No, the requirement is not met at this moment due to the player facing a table. The player needs to face flat\nground to the south to move in that direction.\n4. Do: No, the requirement is not met. The player has not found any iron ores and is not facing any creature or material to\ninteract with.\n5. Move North: Yes, the requirement is met. The player has a path (flat ground) 1 step to their north, which makes it\npossible to move in that direction.\n168\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed?

Place Table (Priority 1):\n- Requirement: Wood in inventory\n- Met: Yes (player has 1 wood)\n============Step: 133, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action place_table.\nYou see:\n- stone 4 steps to your east\n205\n- path 4 steps to your south-east\n- tree 3 steps to your west\n- cow 2 steps to your north\nYou face grass at your front (west).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 5/9\n- drink: 4/9\n- energy: 9/9\nYour inventory:\n- wood: 1\n- stone: 4\n- coal: 2\n- iron: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n- stone_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove West\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its\nrequirement.\nAnswer:\n1. Stone: Provides stone resource, requires a wood or better pickaxe to collect.\n2. Path: Provides easier movement, no requirements to interact.\n3. Tree: Provides wood resource, requires an axe or hands to collect.\n4. Cow: Provides food resource, requires a sword or other weapon to defeat.\n5. Grass: Provides no critical resources, no interaction requirements.\nQuestion: What was the last action taken by the player?\nAnswer:\nThe last action taken by the player was \"place_table.\"\nQuestion: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?\nAnswer:\n1. Stone: Yes, the requirements are met since you have a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in your inventory.\n2. Path: Yes, the requirements are met as there are no specific requirements to interact with the path.\n3. Tree: Yes, the requirements are met even though you don\u2019t have an axe, you can still collect wood using your hands.\n4. Cow: Yes, the requirements are met even though you don\u2019t have a sword, you can use other means to defeat the cow (such as\nthe wood or stone pickaxe) to obtain food.\n5. Grass: Yes, the requirements are met as there are no specific requirements to interact with the grass.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Collect more wood (Priority: 5/5) - Wood is essential for crafting more tools, and you only have one piece of wood in\nyour inventory. Collecting more wood would allow you to build more advanced tools like a sword for defense or an axe\nfor faster wood collection.\n2. Restore drink level (Priority: 4/5) - Your drink level is low at 4/9. Find a clean water source like a lake or river and\ndrink from it to restore your thirst level.\n3. Defeat the cow for food (Priority: 3/5) - Your food level is at 5/9, which is not critical yet, but defeating the cow\nwould provide you with a food resource to restore your health later when needed. Use one of your pickaxes as a weapon\nuntil you can craft a sword for more efficient combat.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nRequirements for the top sub-task (Collect more wood):\n1. Locate a nearby tree.\n2. Have a tool for chopping wood, such as a wood/stone pickaxe or craft an axe for more efficient wood collection if you\nhave enough materials.\nWhat should the player do first:\n- The player should first move towards the nearby tree, which is 3 steps to their west; move_west for 3 steps in a row to\nreach the tree.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1.

The requirement to collect stone is to have\na wood pickaxe.\n2. Path: The path is not a resource provider, but it serves as a safe passage to navigate the game world without facing\nresistance from the terrain.\n3. Tree: The tree provides wood, which is needed for crafting tools, weapons, and furniture. No specific requirements are\nneeded to collect wood, but having an axe can speed up the process.\n4. Cow: The cow provides food (meat) to restore the player\u2019s food level. The requirement to collect food from the cow is to\nhave a weapon, like a wood or stone sword, to defeat it.\n5. Grass: Grass does not provide any resources directly but can be a flat surface to move on or place items. No requirements\nare needed to interact with grass.\nQuestion: What was the last action taken by the player?\nAnswer:\nThe last action taken by the player was move_west.\nQuestion: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?\nAnswer:\n207\n1. Stone: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction, as the player has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory.\n2. Path: As there are no requirements for interacting with the path, this can be considered as met.\n3. Tree: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction. While there\u2019s no specific requirement for collecting wood, having an\naxe can speed up the process. However, even without an axe, the player can still collect wood.\n4. Cow: The player does not have a sword (wood or stone) in their inventory, so the requirements for interaction with the\ncow (to collect food) are not met.\n5. Grass: As there are no requirements for interacting with grass, this can be considered as met.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Craft a weapon (Priority: 5/5): Crafting either a wood sword or a stone sword should be the player\u2019s top priority as they\nneed a weapon to defend themselves and defeat cows to collect food.\n2. Collect food (Priority: 4/5): The player has a low food level (5/9), so defeating a cow is crucial for obtaining food and\nreplenishing their food meter. This task will become possible once the player has crafted a weapon.\n3. Collect drink (Priority: 3/5): The player\u2019s drink level is at 4/9, so finding a water source, like a lake or river, will\nhelp replenish their thirst. This task can be performed while focusing on crafting a weapon and collecting food.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nFor the top sub-task (Crafting a weapon), the requirements are:\n1. Crafting a Wood Sword:\n- Requires a nearby placed table\n- Wood in inventory (which the player already has: 1 wood)\n2. Crafting a Stone Sword:\n- Requires a nearby placed table\n- Wood and stone in inventory (which the player already has: 1 wood and 4 stone)\nThe player already placed a table in Step 266, and they have the necessary materials in their inventory. Therefore, the\nplayer should craft a weapon (either a wood or stone sword) first using the placed table. Crafting a stone sword would\nbe more effective, as it is a stronger weapon compared to the wood sword.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1.

Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 4/5: Find a source of water to drink. The player\u2019s thirst level is only 4/9, so finding water would be crucial\nto replenish their thirst.\n2. Priority 3/5: Chopping the tree to collect more wood. The player only has 1 wood in their inventory, and having more wood\nwould be helpful for future crafting and building activities.\n3. Priority 5/5: Check the player\u2019s inventory for the recently crafted stone sword. If the sword is missing, try crafting\nanother stone sword to be equipped for any combat situations that might arise, such as defending against monsters or\nkilling the cow for food. The player\u2019s food level is 5/9, so hunting the cow could help to replenish this resource.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nFor the top sub-task of finding a source of water to drink:\nRequirements:\n1. Locate a body of water such as a lake, river, or pond.\n2. Have an empty container to collect the water or be close enough to drink directly from the source.\nThe player should first explore their surroundings to locate a body of water nearby. They can move in any direction (north,\nsouth, east, or west) to find a water source. Once they find a water source, they should interact with it to drink and\nreplenish their thirst level. If they have an empty container, they can use it to collect and store water for later\nconsumption.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move North, East, South, or West (depending on the direction of the water source) - Requirement: Flat ground\nin the chosen direction.\n2.

Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 4/5: Drink water to restore thirst - With a thirst level of 3/9, the player should prioritize finding a water\nsource and drinking from it to stay hydrated.\n2. Priority 4/5: Collect food and eat - The player\u2019s food level is 4/9, which indicates that they should focus on finding a\nstable food source. The cow nearby can be killed to provide meat for immediate consumption, and the sapling can be\nplanted to grow more trees, which could eventually provide fruits.\n3. Priority 3/5: Collect more resources - As the player has only 1 wood, 2 coal, and 1 iron in their inventory, they should\ncontinue collecting resources such as iron, stone, and wood for crafting items and expanding the shelter. Chopping\ndown trees and mining iron are potential sub-tasks to achieve this goal.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nTop sub-task: Drink water to restore thirst.\nRequirements:\n1. Find a water source, such as a lake, river, or well.\n2.

Drink water when standing next to the water source.\nWhat should the player do first:\nThe player should first scout for a water source nearby. If no water source is immediately visible, they should explore the\nsurrounding areas by moving in different directions until they locate one. Once a water source is found, the player\nshould approach and drink from it to restore their thirst level.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n225\n1. Priority 1: Move (move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west) - Requirement: Flat ground in the respective direction.\nThis action is a priority as it would help the player explore the environment and locate resources, such as water\nsources or trees.\n2. Priority 2: Drink - Requirement: Standing next to a water source. Drinking is a priority as it will restore the player\u2019s\nthirst level, which is currently low (3/9).\n3. Priority 3: Do (chop down a tree) - Requirement: Facing a tree; have the necessary tool (wood_pickaxe, which the player\nhas in their inventory). This action will help the player gather wood, an essential resource for crafting and building\nshelter.\n4. Priority 4: Sleep - Requirement: Energy level is below maximum. Sleeping will restore the player\u2019s energy, although the\nenergy level is still high (8/9) so it could be done later.\n5. Priority 5: Make Wood Sword - Requirement: Nearby table; wood in inventory. Crafting a wood sword is important for self-\ndefense against potential threats like zombies and skeletons, but it\u2019s a slightly lower priority than finding water\nand collecting wood as the player\u2019s health level is currently full (9/9).\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Move (move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west): Yes, the requirements are met. The player can choose a direction\nwith flat ground (such as move_north towards the grass) to explore the environment.\n2. Drink: No, the requirements are not met. The player needs to be standing next to a water source to drink, which is not\nthe case in the current observation.\n3. Do (chop down a tree): Yes, the requirements are met. The player is facing a tree in the west direction and has a\nwood_pickaxe in their inventory.\n4. Sleep: No, the requirement is not met. Although the player\u2019s energy level is below maximum, it is still quite high (8/9),\nso sleeping would not provide much benefit at this time.\n5. Make Wood Sword: Yes, the requirements are met. The player has wood in their inventory, but they will need to place a\ntable first (using wood from the inventory) before making the wood sword.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded. It succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the east of the\nplayer, allowing them to move in that direction.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from the list above is chopping down a tree. To do this, the player should take the \"Do\" action,\nwhich has met requirements: The player is facing a tree and has a wood_pickaxe in their inventory. This action will\nhelp gather more wood, an essential resource for crafting and building shelter.\n============Step: 147, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action do.\nYou see:\n- grass 1 steps to your west\n- path 5 steps to your south-east\n- tree 2 steps to your west\n- furnace 2 steps to your north-east\nYou face cow at your front (east).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 4/9\n- drink: 3/9\n- energy: 8/9\nYour inventory:\n- sapling: 1\n- wood: 1\n- coal: 2\n- iron: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n- stone_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove South\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation.

Find a water source to drink and replenish thirst (Priority: 3/5)\n- Your drink level is currently low, so finding a water source to drink from should be a priority to avoid dehydration.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nThe top sub-task is to craft a sword for hunting and self-defense. The requirements for it are:\n1. Locate a nearby crafting table or place a table using your wood inventory.\n2. If you have enough wood, create a wood_sword at the table.\n3. If you have enough stone, create a stone_sword at the table, which is preferred due to its better durability and damage.\nThe player should first locate a nearby crafting table or place one using the available wood in their inventory. Then,\ndepending on the available resources (wood or stone) in the inventory, the player should craft either a wood_sword or\na stone_sword at the table.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action.

The player was able to move west because there was flat ground (grass) in that\ndirection, allowing the player to move without any obstacles.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action for the player is to \"Move East\" since it fulfills the requirement of having flat ground (path)\nin the desired direction, and it helps the player to move back towards the path and potentially avoid the zombie.\n============Step: 190, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_east.\nYou see:\n- grass 1 steps to your west\n- stone 4 steps to your north-east\n- tree 6 steps to your north-west\n- table 3 steps to your south-east\n- zombie 2 steps to your north\nYou face path at your front (east).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 3/9\n- drink: 1/9\n- energy: 7/9\nYour inventory:\n- wood: 1\n- coal: 2\n- iron: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n- stone_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove South\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its\nrequirement.\nAnswer:\n1. Grass: Provides no resources. No requirements.\n2. Stone: Provides stone resources required for crafting tools and building structures. Requires a wood pickaxe or better to\ncollect.\n3. Path: Provides no resources, but makes travel easier. No requirements.\n4. Tree: Provides wood resources for crafting tools, weapons, and building structures. Requires a wood pickaxe or better to\ncollect.\n5. Table: Used for crafting tools and weapons. Requires wood to craft.\n6. Zombie: Provides experience points and possibly rare drops. Requires weapons, such as a wood or stone sword, to defeat.\nQuestion: What was the last action taken by the player?\nAnswer:\nThe last action taken by the player was \"move_east.\"\nQuestion: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?\nAnswer:\n1. Grass: No requirements for interaction, so yes, the requirements are met.\n290\n2. Stone: You have a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in your inventory, so yes, the requirements for collecting stone are\nmet.\n3. Path: No requirements for interaction, so yes, the requirements are met.\n4. Tree: You have a wood_pickaxe in your inventory, so yes, the requirements for collecting wood are met.\n5. Table: You already have a table in your vicinity, so yes, the requirements for crafting with the table are met.\n6. Zombie: You don\u2019t have a sword in your inventory, so no, the requirements for defeating the zombie are not met. You need\nto craft either a wood, stone, or iron sword to interact with the zombie effectively.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Craft a sword to defend against the zombie (Priority: 5/5). Since there\u2019s a zombie nearby, crafting a sword should be the\nhighest priority for self-defense.\n2. Collect wood from the tree to have enough resources for crafting and building (Priority: 4/5). Wood is essential for\nvarious crafting recipes and building structures, so it\u2019s important to gather more.\n3. Increase drink level by finding a water source (Priority: 4/5). Your drink level is 1/9, which is quite low. Finding a\nwater source to restore your thirst level is crucial for survival.\n4. Find food and increase your food level (Priority: 3/5). Your food level is also quite low (3/9), although not as critical\nas your drink level. Finding and consuming food should be done after addressing the more pressing priorities.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nThe top sub-task is to craft a sword to defend against the zombie. The requirements for crafting a sword (either wood, stone,\nor iron) are as follows:\n1. Be near the crafting table (there\u2019s a table 3 steps to your south-east).\n2. Have the necessary resources in your inventory.\nThe wood sword requires wood in your inventory. The stone sword requires wood and stone in your inventory. The iron sword\nrequires wood, coal, and iron in your inventory.\nSince you already have wood (1), coal (2), and iron (1) in your inventory, you can make an iron sword for better defense.\nFirst, move 3 steps south-east to reach the crafting table. Then, craft the iron sword using the wood, coal, and iron that\nyou already have in your inventory.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move South-East (3 steps) - Requirement: Flat ground in the desired direction (south-east).\nReason: Moving towards the crafting table to create a sword.\n2. Priority 2: Make Iron Sword - Requirements: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory.\nReason: To be able to defend against the zombie.\n3. Priority 3: Move North (2 steps) - Requirement: Flat ground in the desired direction (north).\nReason: Engage with the zombie once the iron sword is crafted.\n4. Priority 4: Defeat Zombie - Requirements: No specific requirement.\nReason: To eliminate the zombie threat and survive the encounter.\n5. Priority 5: Drink water - Requirement: Access to a water source (lake, river, or any other water source).\nReason: To replenish the player\u2019s thirst, which is currently at 1/9.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Move South-East (3 steps): Yes, the requirements are met. The ground in the southeast direction is not explicitly\nmentioned, but considering the path and the table, it should be flat ground.\n2. Make Iron Sword: No, the requirements are not met. Although the player has iron and a nearby table, they also need to be\nnear a furnace. The furnace\u2019s location is not given in the recent observations.\n3. Move North (2 steps): Yes, the requirements are met. Moving north twice brings the player closer to the zombie and will\nbe a valid action.\n4. Defeat Zombie: No, the requirements are not met yet. While there are no specific inventory requirements for this action,\nit is recommended to have a sword first (ideally the iron sword) to successfully defeat the zombie. Since the player\nhasn\u2019t crafted an iron sword yet, it would be better to wait until they do.\n5. Drink water: No, the requirements are not met. Currently, there is no mention of a water source in the recent\nobservations. The player needs to find a water source (lake, river, etc.) to drink from it.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action \"move_east\" succeeded. The player was able to move to the east because there was a path (flat\nground) in that direction, allowing the player to move without any obstacles.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from above is to \"Move South-East (3 steps)\" considering that it meets the requirements of flat\nground in the desired direction, and it brings the player closer to the crafting table.\n============Step: 191, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_south.\nYou see:\n- stone 4 steps to your south-east\n- path 2 steps to your north-east\n291\n- tree 4 steps to your south-east\n- table 2 steps to your south-east\n- zombie 3 steps to your north\nYou face grass at your front (south).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 3/9\n- drink: 1/9\n- energy: 7/9\nYour inventory:\n- wood: 1\n- coal: 2\n- iron: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n- stone_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove West\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its\nrequirement.\nAnswer:\n1. Stone: Provides stone as a resource, requires wood pickaxe or better to collect.\n2. Path: No resource provided, requires no requirement.\n3. Tree: Provides wood as a resource, requires wood pickaxe or better to collect.\n4. Table: Provides a crafting surface, requires wood to craft and place.\n5. Zombie: Provides experience or loot (if the game supports it), requires a weapon (wood, stone, or iron sword) to defeat.\n6. Grass: No resource provided, requires no requirement.\nQuestion: What was the last action taken by the player?\nAnswer:\nThe last action taken by the player was \"move_south.\"\nQuestion: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?\nAnswer:\n1. Stone: Yes, the requirements for interaction are met since the player has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in their\ninventory.\n2. Path: Yes, the requirements for interaction are met as there are no specific requirements needed to interact with a path.\n3. Tree: Yes, the requirements for interaction are met since the player has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in their\ninventory.\n4. Table: Yes, the requirements for interaction are met since the table is already placed and available for crafting. The\nplayer also has wood in their inventory which can be used for crafting.\n5. Zombie: Yes, the requirements for interaction are met, as the player can use the wood_pickaxe or stone_pickaxe currently\nin their inventory to defend themselves or craft a weapon to defeat the zombie.\n6. Grass: Yes, the requirements for interaction are met as there are no specific requirements needed to interact with grass.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Increase Drink level: Priority 5. The player\u2019s drink level is currently at 1/9, which is critically low. They should\nlocate a water source, such as a lake, and interact with it to replenish their drink level.\n2. Increase Food level: Priority 4. The player\u2019s food level is at 3/9, which is low. They should focus on finding a source\nof food, like animals to hunt or plants to gather, to increase their food level.\n3. Defend against the Zombie: Priority 3. There is a zombie 3 steps to the north, posing a potential threat. The player\nshould prepare to defend themselves by crafting a weapon or using their current tools, like the wood_pickaxe or\nstone_pickaxe, to attack the zombie if necessary.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nRequirements for the top sub-task (Increase Drink level):\n1. Find a water source such as a lake, river, or well.\n2. Interact with the water source to drink and replenish the drink level.\nWhat should the player do first:\nThe player should first try to locate a water source nearby, like a lake or river, by exploring the area around them. They\nshould move in a direction where they might find a water source or remember seeing one in previous steps of the game.\nOnce they have found a water source, they should interact with it to drink and increase their drink level.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - As the player faces grass at their front, moving\nwest brings them closer to the grass, which can help them find a nearby water source.\n2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Moving north will help the player avoid the zombie\nand possibly come across water or other resources.\n3. Priority 3: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - If moving west or north doesn\u2019t provide any water\nsource or if the player wants to explore further in search of water, moving east is the next option.\n4. Priority 4: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent) - Moving south might provide the player with more\nexploration options; however, it will bring them closer to the zombie, which increases the risk.\n292\n5. Priority 5: Do (Facing creature or material; have necessary tool) - While searching for a water source, the player can\ninteract with materials or creatures they come across, such as mining stone, cutting wood, or fighting monsters. But\nonly if they have the necessary tool and health/energy to perform the action.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\nBased on the player\u2019s current observations and status:\n1. Priority 1: Move West: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) to the player\u2019s left (west).\n2. Priority 2: Move North: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) above the player (north).\n3. Priority 3: Move East: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (path) to the player\u2019s right (east).\n4. Priority 4: Move South: Yes, the requirement is met as there is flat ground (grass) below the player (south).\n5. Priority 5: Do: This action requires more context, as it depends on the material or creature the player is facing and the\nnecessary tool they possess. Currently, the player has a wood_pickaxe and a stone_pickaxe in their inventory. If the\naction involves mining stone or cutting wood, the player meets the requirements. However, if the action involves\ncombat with the zombie, the player does not have a sword and may need to craft one first.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action \"move_south\" succeeded because the player was able to face grass at their front (south) without\nany obstacles or restrictions in their way.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from the list, considering the player\u2019s current situation, would be Priority 1: Move West. This\naction meets the requirement of flat ground left to the agent, and it brings the player closer to the grass, which can\npotentially help them find a nearby water source.\n============Step: 192, Cumulative Reward: 0.0============\nYou took action move_west.\nYou see:\n- stone 5 steps to your south-east\n- path 3 steps to your north-east\n- tree 5 steps to your south-east\n- table 3 steps to your south-east\n- cow 5 steps to your south-west\n- zombie 3 steps to your north-east\nYou face grass at your front (west).\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 2/9\n- drink: 1/9\n- energy: 7/9\nYour inventory:\n- wood: 1\n- coal: 2\n- iron: 1\n- wood_pickaxe: 1\n- stone_pickaxe: 1\n------------ QA ------------\nQuestion: Action\nAnswer:\nMove East\nQuestion: List objects in the current observation.

Also, keep an eye on your energy level and find a safe place to rest when needed.\nQuestion: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Find a water source and drink to replenish thirst level (Priority: 5/5) - Your thirst level is at 0/9, making it an\nurgent task to find a water source for drinking and prevent negative effects or death from dehydration.\n2. Kill the cow for food and eat to replenish hunger level (Priority: 4/5) - Your food level is at 2/9, which is quite low.\nKilling the cow and eating the meat would help in restoring your hunger level and maintaining good health.\n3. Find a safe place to rest and sleep to replenish energy level (Priority: 3/5) - Your energy level is at 6/9, which is\nstill reasonable but will need replenishing eventually. Finding a safe place to rest will help ensure that you regain\nyour energy without interruptions from potential dangers like monsters.\nRemember to monitor your health, food, drink, and energy levels throughout the game and to adjust your priorities as needed.\nQuestion: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?\nAnswer:\nFor the top sub-task of finding a water source and drinking to replenish thirst level, the requirements are:\n1. Locate a water source such as a lake, river, or pond in the game world.\n2. Approach the water source safely, ensuring the path is clear of any monsters or hazards.\n3. Interact with the water source to drink and replenish your thirst level.\nThe player should first focus on locating a water source in their vicinity. Since the player\u2019s current observations do not\nshow any nearby water, they should explore the surrounding area by moving in different directions (north, south, east,\nor west) and observing their environment for any signs of water sources.\nQuestion: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all\nactions. Indicate their priority out of 5.\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move (Move East/West/North/South): Flat ground in the chosen direction. The player should explore the\nsurroundings to find a water source, as their drink level is very low.\n2. Priority 2: Do: Facing water source. The player must drink water to replenish thirst once the water source is located.\n3. Priority 3: Do: Facing cow with wood/stone/iron sword (as the player doesn\u2019t possess a weapon currently). The player\nneeds to defeat the cow for food to replenish their food level.\n304\n4. Priority 4: Make Wood Sword: Nearby table and wood in inventory. Crafting a wood sword with the wood in the inventory and\nthe table 5 steps south-east will help the player defeat the cow for food.\n5. Priority 5: Move closer to the table (Move East/South). Flat ground in the chosen direction. The player needs to approach\nthe table to craft the wood sword.\nQuestion: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?\nAnswer:\n1. Priority 1: Move (Move East/West/North/South): Yes, the requirements are met. There is flat ground in each direction for\nthe player to move.\n2. Priority 2: Do: Facing water source: No, the requirements are not met. The player has not found a water source yet.\n3. Priority 3: Do: Facing cow with wood/stone/iron sword: No, the requirements are not met. The player does not have a sword\nto defeat the cow.\n4. Priority 4: Make Wood Sword: Yes, the requirements are met. The player has wood in their inventory, and there is a table\nnearby (5 steps to the southeast).\n5. Priority 5: Move closer to the table (Move East/South): Yes, the requirements are met. There is flat ground in each\ndirection for the player to approach the table.\nQuestion: Did the last player action succeed? Why?\nAnswer:\nYes, the last player action (move_west) succeeded because there was flat ground (grass) to the west, allowing the player to\nmove in that direction.\nQuestion: Choose the best executable action from above.\nAnswer:\nThe best executable action from above is Priority 1: Move (Move East/West/North/South). The player should explore the\nsurroundings to find a water source, as their drink level is very low, and the requirements for this action are met.\n305\n"

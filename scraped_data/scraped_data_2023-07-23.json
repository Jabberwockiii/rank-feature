Nev-\nertheless, expanding this exciting progress to video is still lagging behind. A surge of large-scale\ntext-to-video generative models has emerged, demonstrating impressive results in generating clips\nsolely from textual descriptions. However, despite the progress made in this area, existing video\nmodels are still in their infancy, being limited in resolution, video length, or the complexity of video\ndynamics they can represent. In this paper, we harness the power of a state-of-the-art pre-trained\ntext-to-image model for the task of text-driven editing of natural videos. Specifically, our goal is to\ngenerate high-quality videos that adhere to the target edit expressed by an input text prompt, while\npreserving the spatial layout and motion of the original video. The main challenge in leveraging an\nimage diffusion model for video editing is to ensure that the edited content is consistent across all\nvideo frames \u2013 ideally, each physical point in the 3D world undergoes coherent modifications across\ntime. Existing and concurrent video editing methods that are based on image diffusion models have\ndemonstrated that global appearance coherency across the edited frames can be achieved by extend-\ning the self-attention module to include multiple frames (Wu et al., 2022; Khachatryan et al., 2023b;\n1\narXiv:2307.10373v3  [cs.CV]  20 Nov 2023\nCeylan et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023). Nevertheless, this approach is insufficient for achieving the\ndesired level of temporal consistency, as motion in the video is only implicitly preserved through the\nattention module. Consequently, professionals or semi-professionals users often resort to elaborate\nvideo editing pipelines that entail additional manual work. In this work, we propose a framework to\ntackle this challenge by explicitly enforcing the original inter-frame correspondences on the edit.\nIntuitively, natural videos contain redundant information across frames, e.g., depict similar appear-\nance and shared visual elements. Our key observation is that the internal representation of the video\nin the diffusion model exhibits similar properties. That is, the level of redundancy and temporal\nconsistency of the frames in the RGB space and in the diffusion feature space are tightly correlated.\nBased on this observation, the pillar of our approach is to achieve consistent edit by ensuring that\nthe features of the edited video are consistent across frames. Specifically, we enforce that the edited\nfeatures convey the same inter-frame correspondences and redundancy as the original video features.\nTo do so, we leverage the original inter-frame feature correspondences, which are readily available\nby the model. This leads to an effective method that directly propagates the edited diffusion features\nbased on the original video dynamics. This approach allows us to harness the generative prior of\nstate-of-the-art image diffusion model without additional training or fine-tuning, and can work in\nconjunction with an off-the-shelf diffusion-based image editing method (e.g., Meng et al. (2022);\nHertz et al. (2022); Zhang & Agrawala (2023); Tumanyan et al. (2023)).\nTo summarize, we make the following key contributions:\n\u2022 A technique, dubbed TokenFlow, that enforces semantic correspondences of diffusion fea-\ntures across frames, allowing to significantly increase temporal consistency in videos gen-\nerated by a text-to-image diffusion model.\n\u2022 Novel empirical analysis studying the proprieties of diffusion features across a video.\n\u2022 State-of-the-art editing results on diverse videos, depicting complex motions.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nText-driven image & video synthesis\nSeminal works designed GAN architectures to synthesize\nimages conditioned on text embeddings (Reed et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). With the ever-\ngrowing scale of vision-language datasets and pretraining strategies (Radford et al., 2021; Schuh-\nmann et al., 2022), there has been a remarkable progress in text-driven image generation capabilities.\nUsers can sytnesize high-quality visual content using simple text prompts. Much of this progress\nis also attributed to diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Croitoru et al., 2022; Dhariwal\n& Nichol, 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) which have been established as state-\nof-the-art text-to-image generators (Nichol et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022;\nRombach et al., 2022; Sheynin et al., 2022; Bar-Tal et al., 2023). Such models have been extended\nfor text-to-video generation, by extending 2D architectures to the temporal dimension (e.g., using\ntemporal attention Ho et al. (2022b)) and performing large-scale training on video datasets (Ho\net al., 2022a; Blattmann et al., 2023; Singer et al., 2022). Recently, Gen-1 (Esser et al., 2023) tai-\nlored a diffusion model architecture for the task of video editing, by conditioning the network on\nstructure/appearance representations. Nevertheless, due to their extensive computation and memory\nrequirements, existing video diffusion models are still in infancy and are largely restricted to short\nclips, or exhibit lower visual quality compared to image models. On the other side of the spectrum,\na promising recent trend of works leverage a pre-trained image diffusion model for video synthesis\ntasks, without additional training (Fridman et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023a; Qi et al.,\n2023). Our work falls into this category, employing a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model for\nthe task of video editing, without any training or finetuning.\nConsistent video stylization\nA common approach for video stylization involves applying image\nediting techniques (e.g., style transfer) on a frame-by-frame basis, followed by a post-processing\nstage to address temporal inconsistencies in the edited video (Lai et al. (2018b); Lei et al. (2020;\n2023)). Although these methods effectively reduce high-frequency temporal flickering, they are not\ndesigned to handle frames that exhibit substantial variations in content, which often occur when\napplying text-based image editing techniques (Qi et al., 2023). Kasten et al. (2021) propose to de-\ncompose a video into a set of 2D atlases, each provides a unified representation of the background\nor of a foreground object throughout the video. Edits applied to the 2D atlases are automatically\nmapped back to the video, thus achieving temporal consistency with minimal effort. Bar-Tal et al.\n(2022); Lee et al. (2023b) leverage this representation to perform text-driven editing. However, the\natlas representation is limited to videos with simple motion and requires long training, limiting the\napplicability of this technique and of the methods built upon it. Our work is also related to classi-\ncal works that demonstrated that small patches in a natural video extensively repeat across frames\n(Shahar et al., 2011; Cheung et al., 2005), and thus consistent editing can by simplified by editing\n2\nPer-frame editing \nOurs\nOriginal \nt\nx\nt\nx\nt\nx\nSample Frames\nx-t slice\nFeatures (PCA)\nFigure 3: Diffusion features across time. Left: Given an input video (top row), we apply DDIM inversion\non each frame and extract features from the highest resolution decoder layer in \u03f5\u03b8. We apply PCA on the\nfeatures (i.e., output tokens from the self-attention module) extracted from all frames and visualize the first\nthree components (second row). We further visualize an x-t slice (marked in red on the original frame) for both\nRGB and features (bottom row). The feature representation is consistent across time \u2013 corresponding regions\nare encoded with similar features across the video. Middle: Frames and feature visualization for an edited video\nobtained by applying an image editing method (Tumanyan et al. (2023)) on each frame; inconsistent patterns\nin RGB are also evident in the feature space (e.g., on the dog\u2019s body). Right: Our method enforces the edited\nvideo to convey the same level of feature consistency as the original video, which translates into a coherent and\nhigh-quality edit in RGB space.\na subset of keyframes and propagating the edit across the video by establishing patch correspon-\ndences using handcrafted features and optical flow (Ruder et al., 2016; Jamri\u02c7ska et al., 2019) or by\ntraining a patch-based GAN (Texler et al., 2020). Nevertheless, such propagation methods strug-\ngle to handle videos with illumination changes, or with complex dynamics. Importantly, they rely\non a user provided consistent edit of the keyframes, which remains a labor-intensive task yet to be\nautomated. Yang et al. (2023) combines keyframe editing with a propagation method by Jamri\u02c7ska\net al. (2019). They edit keyframes using a text-to-image diffusion model while enforcing optical\nflow constraints on the edited keyframes. However, since optical flow estimation between distant\nframes is not reliable, their method fails to consistently edit keyframes that are far apart (as seen in\nour Supplementary Material - SM), and as a result, fails to consistently edit most videos.\nSource\nTarget I\nTarget II\nReconstructed\nTarget \n(a)\nWarped\nSource   Target\n(b)\nNearest-Neighbour\nField \n(c)\nFigure 2: Fine-grained feature correspondences.\nFeatures (i.e., output tokens from the self-attention\nmodules) extracted from of a source frame are used\nto reconstruct nearby frames. This is done by: (a)\nswapping each feature in the target by its nearest fea-\nture in the source, in all layers and all generation time\nsteps, and (b) simple warping in RGB space, using\na nearest neighbour field (c), computed between the\nsource and target features extracted from the highest\nresolution decoder layer. The target is faithfully re-\nconstructed, demonstrating the high level of spatial\ngranularity and shared content between the features.\nOur work shares a similar motivation as this ap-\nproach that benefits from the temporal redundan-\ncies in natural videos. We show that such redun-\ndancies are also present in the feature space of a\ntext-to-image diffusion model, and leverage this\nproperty to achieve consistency.\nControlled generation via diffusion features\nmanipulation\nRecently,\na\nsurge\nof\nworks\ndemonstrated how text-to-image diffusion mod-\nels can be readily adapted to various editing and\ngeneration tasks, by performing simple opera-\ntions on the intermediate feature representation\nof the diffusion network (Chefer et al., 2023;\nHong et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023; Tumanyan\net al., 2023; Hertz et al., 2022; Patashnik et al.,\n2023; Cao et al., 2023).\nLuo et al.

Tune-A-Video\n(Wu et al., 2022) observed that by extending the self-attention module to operate on more than a sin-\ngle frame, it is possible to generate frames that share a common global appearance. Qi et al. (2023);\nCeylan et al. (2023); Khachatryan et al. (2023a); Shin et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023) leverage this\nproperty to achieve globally-coherent video edits. Nevertheless, as demonstrated in Sec. 5, inflat-\ning the self-attention module is insufficient for achieving fine-grained temporal consistency. Prior\nand concurrent works either compromise visual quality, or exhibit limited temporal consistency. In\nthis work, we also perform video editing via simple operations in the feature space of a pre-trained\ntext-to-image model, we explicitly encourage the features of the model to be temporally consistent\nthrough TokenFlow.\n3\nPRELIMINARIES\nDiffusion Models\nDiffusion probabalistic models (DPM) (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Croitoru\net al., 2022; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) are a class of\ngenerative models that aim to approximate a data distribution q through a progressive denosing\nprocess. Starting from a Gaussian i.i.d noisy image xT \u223c N(0, I), the diffusion model \u03f5\u03b8, gradually\ndenoises it, until reaching a clean image x0 drawn from the target distribution q. DPM can learn a\nconditional distribution by incorporating additional guiding signals, such as text conditioning.\nSong et al. (2020) derived DDIM, a deterministic sampling algorithm given an initial noise xT . By\napplying this algorithm in the reverse order (a.k.a. DDIM inversion) starting from the clean x0, it\nallows to obtain the intermediate noisy images {xi}T\nt=1 used to generate it.\nStable Diffusion\nStable Diffusion (SD) (Rombach et al., 2022) is a prominent text-to-image dif-\nfusion model that operates in a latent image space. A pretrained encoder maps RGB images to this\nspace, and a decoder decodes latents back to high-resolution images. In more detail, SD is based\non a U-Net architecture (Ronneberger et al., 2015), which comprises of residual, self-attention, and\ncross-attention blocks. The residual block convolves the activations from a previous layer, while\ncross-attention manipulates features according to the text prompt. In the self-attention block, fea-\ntures are projected into queries Q, keys K, and values V . The Attention operation (Vaswani\net al., 2017) computes the affinities between the d-dimensional projections Q, K to yield the output\nof the layer:\nA \u00b7 V where A = Attention(Q; K) and Attention(Q; K) = Softmax\n\u0012QKT\n\u221a\nd\n\u0013\n(1)\n4\n\u201cA robotic wolf\u201d\n\u201cA colourful polygonal illustration\u201d\n\u201cMaui from Moana Movie\u201d\n\u201cA Pixar animation\u201d\nInput video\nInput video\n\u201cA Van Gogh portrait\u201d\n\u201cA marble sculpture\u201d\n\u201cIce sculpture of a car\u201d\n\u201cSand sculpture of a car on the beach\u201d\nInput video\nInput video\nFigure 5: Results.

To achieve this, our framework leverages a pretrained and fixed\ntext-to-image diffusion model \u03f5\u03b8.\nNa\u00a8\u0131vely leveraging \u03f5\u03b8 for video editing, by applying an image editing method on each frame inde-\npendently (e.g., Hertz et al. (2022); Tumanyan et al. (2023); Meng et al. (2022); Zhang & Agrawala\n(2023)), results in content inconsistencies across frames (e.g., Fig. 3 middle column). Our key\nfinding is that these inconsistencies can be alleviated by enforcing consistency among the internal\ndiffusion features across frames, during the editing process.\nNatural videos typically depict coherent and shared content across time. We observe that the internal\nrepresentation of natural videos in \u03f5\u03b8 has similar properties. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we\nvisualize the features extracted from a given video (first column). As seen, the features depict a\nshared and consistent representation across frames, i.e., corresponding regions exhibit similar repre-\nsentation. We further observe that the original video features provide fine-grained correspondences\nbetween frames, using a simple nearest neighbour search (Fig 2). Moreover, we show that these\ncorresponding features are interchangeable for the diffusion model \u2013 we can faithfully synthesize\none frame by swapping its features by their corresponding ones in a nearby frame (Fig 2(a)).\nNevertheless, when an edit is applied to each frame individually, the consistency of the features\nbreaks (Fig. 3 middle column). This implies that the level of consistency of in RGB space is corre-\nlated with the consistency of the internal features of the frames. Hence, our key idea is to manipulate\nthe features of the edited video to preserve the level of consistency and inter-frame correspondences\nof the original video features.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, our framework, dubbed TokenFlow, alternates at each generation timestep\nbetween two main components: (i) sampling a set of keyframes and jointly editing them according to\nP; this stage results in shared global appearance across the keyframes, and (ii) propagating the fea-\ntures from the keyframes to all of the frames based on the correspondences provided by the original\n5\n\u201cA rainbow-textured dog\u201d\n\u201cA shiny metal sculpture\u201d\nTAV\n\u201cAn origami of a stork\u201d\nInput\nPNP\nGen-1\nText2 \nVideo\nFate- \nZero\nRerender \na Video\nOurs\nFigure 6: Comparison.\nWe compare our method against Tune-A-Video (TAV, Wu et al.

We refer the reader to our supplementary material for full-video\ncomparisons.\nvideo features; this stage explicitly preserves the consistency and fine-grained shared representation\nof the original video features. Both stages are done in combination with an image editing technique\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8 (e.g, Tumanyan et al. (2023)). Intuitively, the benefit of alternating between keyframe editing\nand propagation is twofold: first, sampling random keyframes at each generation step increases the\nrobustness to a particular selection. Second, since each generation step results in more consistent\nfeatures, the sampled keyframes in the next step will be edited more consistently.\nPre-processing: extracting diffusion features.\nGiven an input video I, we apply DDIM in-\nversion (see Sec. 3) on each frame Ii, which yields a sequence of latents [xi\n1, ..., xi\nT ]. For each\ngeneration timestep t, we feed the latent xi\nt of each frame i \u2208 [n] to the model and extract the tokens\n\u03d5(xi\nt) from the self-attention module of every layer in the network \u03f5\u03b8 (fig. 4, top). We will later use\nthese tokens to establish inter-frame correspondences between diffusion features.\n4.1\nKEYFRAME SAMPLING AND JOINT EDITING\nOur observations imply that given the features of a single edited frame, we can generate the next\nframes by propagating its features to their corresponding locations. Most videos, however, can\nnot be represented by a single keyframe. To account for that, we consider multiple keyframes,\nfrom which we obtain a set of features (tokens), Tbase, that will later be propagated to the entire\nvideo. Specifically, at each generation step, we randomly sample a set of keyframes {Ji}i\u2208\u03ba in\nfixed frame intervals (see SM for details). We joinly edit the keyframes by extending the self-\nattention block to simultaneously process them (Wu et al., 2022), thus encouraging them to share a\nglobal appearance. In more detail, the input to the modified block are the self-attention features from\nall keyframes {Qi}i\u2208\u03ba, {Ki}i\u2208\u03ba, {V i}i\u2208\u03ba where Qi, Ki, V i are the queries, keys, and values of\nframe i \u2208 \u03ba, \u03ba = {i1, ...ik}. The keys of all frames are concatenated, and the extended-attention is:\nExtAttn\n\u0010\nQi; [Ki1, . . . Kik]\n\u0011\n= Softmax\n \nQi \u0002\nKi1, . . . Kik\u0003T\n\u221a\nd\n!\n(2)\n6\nThe output of the block for frame i is given by:\n\u03d5(J i) = \u02c6\nA \u00b7 [V i1, . . . V ik]\nwhere\n\u02c6\nA = ExtAttn\n\u0010\nQi; [Ki1, . . . Kik]\n\u0011\n(3)\nIntuitively, each keyframe queries all other keyframes, and aggregates information from them. This\nresults in a roughly unified appearance in the edited frames (Wu et al., 2022; Khachatryan et al.,\n2023b; Ceylan et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023). We define Tbase = {\u03d5(Ji)}i\u2208\u03ba, for each layer in the\nnetwork (Fig. 4 bottom middle).\n4.2\nEDIT PROPAGATION VIA TOKENFLOW\nGiven Tbase, we propagate it across the video based on the token correspondences extracted from\nthe original video. At each generation step t, we compute the nearest neighbor (NN) of each original\nframe\u2019s tokens, \u03d5(xi\nt), and its two adjacent keyframess\u2019 tokens, \u03d5(xi+\nt ), \u03d5(xi\u2212\nt ) where i+ is the\nindex of the closest future keyframe, and i\u2212 the index of the closest past keyframe. Denote the\nresulting NN fields \u03b3i+, \u03b3i\u2212:\n\u03b3i\u00b1[p] = arg min\nq\nD\n\u0000\u03d5(xi)[p], \u03d5(xi\u00b1)[q]\n\u0001\n(4)\nWhere p, q are spatial locations in the token feature map, and D is cosine distance. For simplicity,\nwe omit the generation timestep t; our method is applied in all time-steps and self-attention layers.\nOnce we obtain \u03b3\u00b1, we use it to propagate the edited frames\u2019 tokens Tbase to the rest of the video,\nby linearly combining the tokens in Tbase corresponding to each spatial location p and frame i:\nF\u03b3(Tbase, i, p) = wi \u00b7 \u03d5(Ji+)[\u03b3i+[p]] + (1 \u2212 wi) \u00b7 \u03d5(Ji\u2212)[\u03b3i\u2212[p]]\n(5)\nWhere \u03d5(Ji\u00b1) \u2208 Tbase and wi \u2208 (0, 1) is a scalar proportional to the distance between frame i\nand its adjacent keyframes (see SM), ensuring a smooth transition. Note that F also modifies the\ntokens of the sampled keyframes. That is, we modify the self-attention blocks to output a linear\ncombination of the tokens in Tbase for all frames, including the keyframes, according to the original\nvideo token correspondences.\nAlgorithm 1 TokenFlow editing\nInput:\nI = [I1, ..., In]\n\u25b7 Input Video\nP\n\u25b7 Target text prompt\n\u02c6\u03a8\n\u25b7 Diffusion-based image editing technique\n{xi\nt}T\nt=1, {\u03d5(xi)}n\ni=1 \u2190 DDIM-Inv[Ii]\n\u2200i \u2208 [n], t \u2208 [T]\nJ1\nT , . . . , Jn\nT \u2190 x1\nT , . . . , xn\nT\nFor t = T, . . . , 1 do\nK = {i1, . . . , ik} \u2190 sample keyframe indices\nF\u03b3 \u2190 \u03b3i\u00b1 \u2200i \u2208 [n]\ncompute NN field\n{Jj\nt\u22121}j\u2208K \u2190 \u02c6\u03f5\u03b8[{Jj\nt}j\u2208K; ExtAttn]\nTbase \u2190 \u03d5({Jj\nt\u22121}j\u2208K)\nextract keyframes\u2019 tokens\nJt\u22121 \u2190 \u02c6\u03f5\u03b8[Jt; TokenFlow(F\u03b3(Tbase))]\nOutput: J = [J1\n0, . . . , Jn\n0 ]\nOverall algorithm\nWe summarize our\nvideo editing algorithm in Alg. 1: We\nfirst perform DDIM inversion on the in-\nput video I and extract the sequence\nof noisy latents {xi\nt}T\ni \u2208 [n] (fig 4, top). t=1 for all frames\nWe then denoise\nthe video, alternating between keyframes\nediting and TokenFlow propagation: At\neach generation step t, we randomize\nk < n keyframe indices, and denoise\nthem using an image editing technique\n(e.g., Tumanyan et al.

We then denoise the entire video\nJt by combining the image-editing tech-\nnique with TokenFlow (Eq. 5, Fig. 4 (II))\nat every self-attention block in every layer of the network. Note that each layer includes a residual\nconnection between the input and output of the self-attention block, thus performing TokenFlow at\neach layer is necessary.\n5\nRESULTS\nWe evaluate our method on DAVIS videos (Pont-Tuset et al., 2017) and on Internet videos depicting\nanimals, food, humans, and various objects in motion. The spatial resolution of the videos is 384\u00d7\n672 or 512\u00d7512 pixels, and they consist of 40 to 200 frames. We use various text prompts on each\nvideo to obtain diverse editing results. Our evaluation dataset comprises of 61 text-video pairs. We\nutilize PnP-Diffusion (Tumanyan et al., 2023) as the frame editing method, and we use the same\nhyper-parameters for all our results. PnP-Diffusion may fail to accurately preserve the structure of\neach frame due to inaccurate DDIM inversion (see Fig. 3, middle column, right frame: the dog\u2019s\nhead is distorted). Our method improves robustness to this, as multiple frames contribute to the\ngeneration of each frame in the video. Our framework can be combined with any diffusion-based\nimage editing technique that accurately preserves the structure of the images; results with different\n7\nimage editing techniques (e.g. Meng et al. (2022); Zhang & Agrawala (2023)) are available in the\nSM. Fig. 5 and 1 show sample frames from the edited videos. Our edits are temporally consistent and\nadhere to the edit prompt. The man\u2019s head is changed to Van-Gogh or marble (top left); importantly,\nthe man\u2019s identity and the scene\u2019s background are consistent throughout the video. The patterns of\nthe polygonal wolf (bottom left) are the same across time: the body is consistently orange while the\nchest is blue. We refer the reader to the SM for implementation details and video results.\nBaselines.\nWe compare our method to state-of-the-art, and concurrent works: (i) Fate-Zero (Qi\net al., 2023) and (ii) Text2Video-Zero (Khachatryan et al., 2023b), that utilize a text-to-image model\nfor video editing using self-attention inflation. (iii) Re-render a Video (Yang et al., 2023) that edits\nkeyframes by adding optical flow optimization to self-attention inflation of an image model, and then\npropagates the edit from the keyframes to the rest of the video using an off-the-shelf propagation\nmethod. (iv) Tune-a-Video (Wu et al., 2022) that fine-tunes the text-to-image model on the given test\nvideo. (v) Gen-1 (Esser et al., 2023), a video diffusion model that was trained on a large-scale image\nand video dataset. (vi) Per-frame diffusion-based image editing baseline, PnP-Diffusion (Tumanyan\net al., 2023). We additionally consider the two following baselines: (i) Text2LIVE (Bar-Tal et al.,\n2022) which utilize a layered video representation (NLA) (Kasten et al., 2021) and perform test-time\ntraining using CLIP losses. Note that NLA requires foreground/background separation masks and\ntakes \u223c10 hours to train. (ii) Applying PnP-Diffusion on a single keyframe and propagating the edit\nto the entire video using Jamri\u02c7ska et al. (2019).\n5.1\nQUALITATIVE EVALUATION\nFig. 6 provides a qualitative comparison of our method to prominent baselines; please refer to SM for\nthe full videos. Our method (bottom row) outputs videos that better adhere to the edit prompt while\nmaintaining temporal consistency of the resulting edited video, while other methods struggle to meet\nboth these goals. Tune-A-Video (second row) inflates the 2D image model into a video model, and\nfine-tunes it to overfit the motion of the video; thus, it is suitable for short clips. For long videos\nit struggles to capture the motion resulting with meaningless edits, e.g., the shiny metal sculpture.\nApplying PnP for each frame independently (third row) results in exquisite edits adhering to the\nedit prompt but, as expected, lack any temporal consistency. The results of Gen-1 (fourth row) also\nsuffer from some temporal inconsistencies (the beak of the origami stork changes color). Moreover,\ntheir frame quality is significantly worse than that of a text-to-image diffusion model. The edits of\nText2Video-Zero and Fate-Zero (fifth and sixth row) suffer from severe jittering as these methods\nrely heavily on the extended attention mechanism to implicitly encourage consistency. The results\nof Rerender-a-Video exhibit notable long-range inconsistencies and artifacts arising primarily from\ntheir reliance on optical flow estimation for distant frames (e.g. keyframes), which is known to be\nsub-optimal (See our video results in the SM; when the wolf turns its head, the nose color changes).\nWe provide qualitative comparison to Text2LIVE and to a RGB propagation baseline in the SM.\n5.2\nQUANTITATIVE EVALUATION\nTable 1: We evaluate our method in temporal consistency\nby computing warp-error and conducting a user study, and\nin fidelity to the target text prompt using CLIP similarity.\nSee Sec. 5 for more details.\nWarp-err \u2193 User preference CLIP\n\u0000\u00d710\u22123\u0001\nof our method score \u2191\nLDM recon.\n2.0\n\u2212\n0.23\nPnP-Diffusion\n11.3\n94%\n0.33\nText2Video-Zero\n12.5\n78%\n0.33\nTune-a-Video\n30.0\n82%\n0.31\nFate-Zero\n6.9\n71%\n0.32\nGen1\n\u2212\n70%\n0.32\nRerender-a-Video\n1.8\n71%\n0.32\nOurs w joint attention\n5.9\n90%\n0.33\nOurs w/o rand keyframes\n3.7\n\u2212\n0.33\nOurs\n3.0\n\u2212\n0.33\nWe evaluate our method in terms of:\n(i) edit fidelity measured by comput-\ning the average similarity between\nthe CLIP embedding (Radford et al.,\n2021) of each edited frame and the\ntarget text prompt; (ii) temporal con-\nsistency.\nFollowing Ceylan et al.\n(2023); Lai et al. (2018a), tempo-\nral consistency is measured by (a)\ncomputing the optical flow of the\noriginal video using Teed & Deng\n(2020), warping the edited frames\naccording to it, and measuring the\nwarping error, and (b) a user study;\nWe adopt a Two-alternative Forced\nChoice (2AFC) protocol suggested\nin Kolkin et al. (2019); Park et al.\n(2020), where participants are shown\nthe input video, ours and a baseline result, and are asked to determine which video is more tem-\nporally consistent and better preserves the motion of the original video. The survey consists of\n2000-3000 judgments per baseline obtained using Amazon mechanical turk. We note that warping-\nerror could not be measured for Gen1 since their product platform does not output the same number\nof input frames. Table 1 compares our method to baselines. Our method achieves the highest CLIP\n8\n\u201cA tractor\u201d\nFigure 7: Limitations. Our method edits the video according to the feature correspondences of the original\nvideo, hence it cannot handle edits that requires structure deviations.\nscore, showing a good fit between the edited video and the input guidance prompt. Furthermore, our\nmethod has a low warping error, indicating temporally consistent results. We note that Re-render-\na-Video optimizes for the warping error and uses optical flow to propagate the edit, and hence has\nthe lowest warping error; However, this reliance on optical flow often creates artifacts and long-\nrange inconsistencies which are not reflected in the warping error. Nonetheless, they are apparent\nin the user study, that shows users significantly favoured our method over all baselines in terms of\ntemporal consistency. Additionally, we consider the reference baseline of passing the original video\nthrough the LDM auto-encoder without performing editing (LDM recon.). This baseline provides an\nupper bound on the temporal consistency achievable by LDM auto-encoder. As expected, the CLIP\nsimilarity of this baseline is poor as it does not involve any editing. However, this baseline does not\nachieve zero warp error either due to the imperfect reconstruction of the LDM auto-encoder, which\nhallucinates high-frequency information.\nWe further evaluate our correspondences and video representation by measuring the accuracy of\nvideo reconstruction using TokenFlow.\nSpecifically, we reconstruct the video using the same\npipeline of our editing method, only removing the keyframes editing part. Table 2 reports the PSNR\nand LPIPS distance of this reconstruction, compared to vanilla DDIM reconstruction. As seen,\nTokenFlow reconstruction slightly improves DDIM inversion, demonstrating robust frame represen-\ntation. This improvement can be attributed to the keyframe randomization; It increases robustness to\nchallenging frames since each frame is reconstructed from multiple other frames during the gener-\nation. Notably, our evaluation focuses on accurate correspondences within the feature space during\ngeneration, rather than RGB frame correspondences evaluation, which is not essential to our method.\n5.3\nABLATION STUDY\nTable 2:\nWe reconstruct the video using\nthe TokenFlow pipeline, excluding keyframe\nediting. We evaluate the TokenFlow represen-\ntation with PSNR and LPIPS metrics. Our\nreconstruction improves vanilla DDIM inver-\nsion, highlighting the robusteness of Token-\nFlow representation.\nPSNR \u2191\nLPIPS\u2193\nLDM recon.\n31.13\n0.03\nDDIM inversion\n25.32\n0.14\nOurs\n25.74\n0.13\nFirst, we ablate the use of TokenFlow, Sec. 4.2, for en-\nforcing temporal consistency.\nIn this experiment, we\nreplace TokenFlow with extended attention (Eq. 3) and\ncompute it between each frames of the edited video and\nthe keyframes (w joint attention). Second, we ablate the\nrandomizing of the keyframe selection at each genera-\ntion step (w/o random keyframes). In this experiment, we\nuse the same keyframe indices (evenly spaced in time)\nacross the generation. Table 1 (bottom) shows the quan-\ntitative results of our ablations, the resulting videos can\nbe found in the SM. As seen, TokenFlow ensures higher\ndegree of temporal consistency, indicating that solely re-\nlying on the extension of self-attention to multiple frames is insufficient for achieving fine-grained\ntemporal consistency. Additionally, fixing the keyframes creates an artificial partition of the video\ninto short clips between the fixed keyframes, which reflects poorly on the consistency of the result.\n6\nDISCUSSION\nWe presented a new framework for text-driven video editing using an image diffusion model. We\nstudy the internal representation of a video in the diffusion feature space, and demonstrate that\nconsistent video editing can be achieved via consistent diffusion feature representation during the\ngeneration. Our method outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating a significant improvement in\ntemporal consistency. As for limitations, our method is tailored to preserve the motion of the original\nvideo, and as such, it cannot handle edits that require structural changes (Fig 7.) Moreover, our\nmethod is built upon a diffusion-based image editing technique to allow the structure preservation\nof the original frames. When the image-editing technique fails to preserve the structure, our method\nenforces correspondences that are meaningless in the edited frames, resulting in visual artifacts.\nLastly, the LDM decoder introduces some high frequency flickering (Blattmann et al., 2023). A\npossible solution for this would be to combine our framework with an improved decoder (e.g.,\nBlattmann et al. (2023), Zhu et al. (2023)). We note that this minor level of flickering can be easily\neliminated with exiting post-process deflickering (see SM). Our work shed new light on the internal\nrepresentation of natural videos in the space of diffusion models (e.g., temporal redundancies), and\nhow they can be leveraged for enhancing video synthesis. We believe it can inspire future research\nin harnessing image models for video tasks, and for the design of text-to-video models.\n9\n7\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nWe thank Narek Tumanyan for his valuable comments and discussion.

(2023) and use DDIM inversion with classifier-\nfree guidance scale of 1 and 1000 forward steps; and extract the self-attention input tokens from this\nprocess similarly to Qi et al. (2023).\nRuntime.\nSince we don\u2019t compute the attention module on most video frames (i.e., we only com-\npute the self-attention output on the keyframes) our method is efficient in run-time, and the sampling\nof the video reduces the time of per-frame editing by 20%. The inversion process with 1000 steps is\nthe main bottleneck of our method in terms of run-time, and in many cases a significantly smaller\namount of steps is suffieicent (e.g. 50). Table 3 reports runtime comparisons using 50 steps in all\nmethods. Notably, our sampling time is indeed faster than that of per-frame editing (PnP).\nHyper-parameters.\nIn equation 5 we set wi to be:\nwi = \u03c3(d\u2212/(d+ + d\u2212))\nwhere d+ = ||i \u2212 i+||, d\u2212 = ||i \u2212 i\u2212||\n(6)\nwhere \u03c3 is a sigmoid function, i+ and i\u2212 are the future and past neighboring keyframes of i, respec-\ntively.\nFor sampling the edited video we set the classifier-free guidance scale to 7.5. At each timestep, we\nsample random keyframes in frame intervals of 8.\nBaselines.\nFor running the baseline of Tune-a-video (Wu et al., 2022) we used their official repos-\nitory. For Gen-1 (Esser et al., 2023) we used their platform on Runaway website. This platform\noutputs a video that is not in the same length and frame-rate as the input video; therefore, we could\nnot compute the warping error on their results.

In\nMeta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into\na shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to\nextract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main\ncomponents: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific\nheads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform\nunified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on differ-\nent benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks\nincluding fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical\napplication (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph,\ntabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for devel-\noping unified multimodal intelligence with transformers. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/invictus717/MetaTransformer.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe human brain, which is considered as the inspiration for neural network models, processes\ninformation from various sensory inputs, e.g. visual, auditory, and tactile signals, simultaneously.\nMoreover, knowledge from one source can benefit the comprehension of another. However, in\ndeep learning, designing a unified network capable of processing a wide range of data formats is a\nnon-trivial task due to the significant modality gap [1\u20133].\nEach data modality presents unique data patterns, which makes it difficult to adapt models trained\non one modality to another. For instance, images exhibit a high degree of information redundancy\ndue to densely packed pixels, which is not the case with natural language [4]. Point clouds, on\nthe other hand, have a sparse distribution in 3D space, making them more susceptible to noise and\nchallenging to represent [5]. Audio spectrograms are time-varying and non-stationary data patterns\nconsisting of combinations of waves across frequency domains [6]. Video data contains a sequence of\nimage frames, which gives it the unique capability to capture both spatial information and temporal\ndynamics [7]. Graph data represents entities as nodes and relationships as edges in a graph, modeling\ncomplex, many-to-many relationships between entities [8]. Owing to the substantial differences\ninherent to various data modalities, it is common practice to utilize distinct network architectures to\nencode each modality separately. For instance, Point Transformer [9] leverages vector-level position\nattention to extract structural information from 3D coordinates, but it cannot encode an image, a\nnatural language paragraph, or an audio spectrogram slice. Therefore, designing a unified framework\ncapable of utilizing a modality-shared parameter space to encode multiple data modalities remains a\nsignificant challenge. Recently, the development of unified frameworks such as VLMO [2], OFA [10],\nand BEiT-3 [3] have improved the ability of the network for multimodal understanding, through\nlarge-scale multimodal pretraining on paired data [3, 10, 2], but they are more focused on vision and\nlanguage, and unable to share the whole encoder across modalities\nThe transformer architecture and attention mechanism, proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017 [11]\nfor natural language processing (NLP), have made a significant difference in deep learning [11\u201316].\nThese advancements have been instrumental in enhancing perception across different modalities\nsuch as 2D vision (including ViT [17, 18] and Swin Transformer [19]), 3D vision (such as Point\nTransformer [9] and Point-ViT [20, 21]), and audio signal processing ( AST [6]), etc. These works\nhave demonstrated the versatility of transformer-based architectures, inspiring researchers to explore\nwhether it\u2019s possible to develop foundation models capable of unifying multiple modalities, ultimately\nachieving human-level perception across all modalities.\nTable 1: Comparison between Meta-Transformer and related works on perception tasks.\nMethod\nModalities\nShare Parameters\nUnpaired Data\nTransformer [11]\n\u2718\n\u2718\nViT [13], Swin Transformer [19], MAE [4]\n\u2718\n\u2718\nPoint Transformer[9], PCT [22], Point ViT [21]\n\u2718\n\u2718\nAST [6], SSAST [23]\n\u2718\n\u2718\nCLIP [24], Flamingo [25], VLMO [2], OFA [10]\n\u2718\n\u2718\nBEiT-3 [3]\nSeveral Layers\n\u2718\nImageBind [26]\n\u2718\n\u2718\nMeta-Transformer [ours]\nWhole Backbone\n\u2714\n2\nIn this paper, We explore the potential of transformer architecture to process 12 modalities including\nimages, natural language, point cloud, audio spectrogram, video, infrared, hyperspectral, X-Ray,\nIMU, tabular, graph, and time-series data, as shown in Figure 1. We discuss the learning process\nwith transformers for each modality and address the challenges associated with unifying them into a\nsingle framework. Consequently, we propose a novel unified framework named Meta-Transformer\nfor multimodal learning. Meta-Transformer is the first framework to simultaneously encode\ndata from a dozen of modalities using the same set of parameters, allowing a more cohesive\napproach to multimodal learning (as shown in Table 1). Meta-Transformer incorporates three simple\nand effective components: a modality-specialist (\u00a7 3.2) for data-to-sequence tokenization, a modality-\nshared encoder (\u00a7 3.3) for extracting representations across modalities, and task-specific heads\nfor downstream tasks. Specifically, Meta-Transformer first transforms multimodal data into token\nsequences that share a common manifold space. Then, a modality-shared encoder with frozen\nparameters extracts representations, which are further adapted to individual tasks by updating the\nparameters of downstream task heads and lightweight tokenizers only. Finally, task-specific and\nmodality-generic representations can be effectively learned by this simple framework.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks of 12 modalities. By utilizing images\nof LAION-2B [24] dataset for pretraining exclusively, Meta-Transformer demonstrates remarkable\nperformance in processing data from multiple modalities, achieving consistently superior outcomes\nover state-of-the-art methodologies in different multimodal learning tasks. More detailed experimental\nsettings can be found in \u00a7 D.\nIn conclusion, our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 For multimodal research, we propose a novel framework, Meta-Transformer, which enables\na unified encoder to simultaneously extract representations from multiple modalities with\nthe same set of parameters.\n\u2022 For multimodal network design, we comprehensively examine the functions of transformer\ncomponents such as embeddings, tokenization, and encoders in processing various modali-\nties. Meta-Transformer provides valuable insights and sparks a promising new direction in\ndeveloping a modality-agnostic framework capable of unifying all modalities.\n\u2022 Experimentally, Meta-Transformer achieves outstanding performance on various datasets\nregarding 12 modalities, which validates the further potential of Meta-Transformer for\nunified multimodal learning.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nSingle-Modality Perception\nThe development of various neural networks facilitates the perception of machine intelligence [27\u2013\n29, 11].\nMulti-Layer Perceptron for pattern recognition. At the beginning, support vector machine (SVM)\nand multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are applied to text [30], image [31], point cloud [32], and audio [33]\nclassification. These innovative works merit the feasibility of introducing AI to pattern recognition.\nRecurrent & Convolutional Neural Network. Hopfield Network [34] is the original form of\nrecurrent networks, then LSTM [35] and GRU [36] further explore the advantages of RNNs in\nsequence modeling and application in NLP tasks [37\u201339], which is also widely applied in audio\nsynthesis [40]. Meanwhile, the success of CNNs including LeNet [41], AlexNet [42], VGG [43],\nGoogleNet [44] and ResNet [29] in image recognition greatly promote the application of CNNs\nin other fields such as text classification [45, 46], point cloud understanding [47\u201349], and speech\nclassification [50].\nTransformer. Recently, transformer architecture [11] has been adopted in various tasks such as\ntext understanding [51] and generation [52] in NLP, classification [13], detection [53] and segmenta-\ntion [15] in images, point cloud understanding [22, 9], and audio recognition [6, 23].\nHowever, similar to applications of CNNs and RNNs, these networks are modified according to dis-\ntinct properties of modalities. There is no common architecture for modality-agnostic learning. More\nimportantly, information from different modalities can be complementary [54\u201356], it\u2019s significant\n3\nto design a framework that can encode data from different modalities and bridge these complicated\nrepresentations via a shared parameter space.\n2.2\nTransformed-based Multimodal Perception\nThe advantages of transformers for perception are the global receptive field and similarity modeling,\nwhich prominently facilitate the development of multimodal perception. MCAN [57] proposes the\ndeep modular co-attention networks between vision and language, which performs the cross-modal\nalignment by concisely maximizing the cross-attention. Then it becomes a consensus [2, 1, 10, 3]\nto utilize a cross-attention mechanism to bridge different modalities. With the success of pretrain-\nfinetune paradigm, more works are getting focused on how to effectively align representations\nextracted across modalities by pretraining. VL-BERT [58] pioneers modality-aligned representations\nfor generic vision-language understanding with the MLM paradigm. Then Oscar [59] described the\nobject semantics in both visual and textural contents. Frameworks such as Vinvl [60], Simvlm [1],\nVLMO [2], ALBEF [61], and Florence [62] further explore the advantages of joint representations\nacross vision-language modalities in terms of semantic consistency.\nMultimodal models are also utilized for few-shot learning [25], sequence-to-sequence learning [10],\ncontrastive learning [63]. BEiT-v3 [3] proposes to take images as a foreign language with a more fine-\ngrained cross-modal mask-and-reconstruction process, sharing partial parameters. And MoMo [64]\nfurther explores the training strategy and objective functions while using the same encoder for images\nand texts.\nDespite these advances, there remain significant obstacles to designing unified multimodal networks\ndue to differences between modalities. Additionally, most research in this area has focused on\nvision and language tasks, and may not directly contribute to challenges such as 3D point cloud\nunderstanding, audio recognition, or other modalities. The Flamingo model [25] represents a powerful\nfew-shot learner, but its transferability to point clouds is limited, and it remains a challenge to leverage\nprior knowledge from one modality to benefit the others. In other means, existing multimodal methods\nhave limited extensibility on more modalities, although they have taken expensive training costs.\nAddressing these discrepancies is dependent on bridging different modalities using the same set of\nparameters, akin to how a bridge connects multiple river banks.\n3\nMeta-Transformer\nIn this section, we depict the proposed framework, Meta-Transformer, in detail. Meta-Transformer\nunifies the multiple pipelines of processing data from different modalities and fulfills encoding texts,\nimages, point clouds, audio, and the other 8 modalities with a shared encoder. To achieve this,\nMeta-Transformer is composed of a data-to-sequence tokenizer to project data to a shared embedding\nspace, a modality-agnostic encoder to encode the embedding of different modalities, and task-specific\nheads to perform downstream predictions, as shown in Fig. 2.\n3.1\nPreliminary\nFormally, we denote the input space of n modalities as {X1, X2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Xn}, while {Y1, Y2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Yn}\nare the corresponding label spaces. In addition, we assume there exists an effective parameter space\n\u0398i for each modality, where any parameter \u03b8i \u2208 \u0398i can be utilized for processing data xi \u2208 Xi from\nthat modality. We say that the essence of Meta-Transformer is to find a shared \u03b8\u2217 that satisfies:\n\u03b8\u2217 \u2208 \u03981 \u2229 \u03982 \u2229 \u03983 \u2229 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0398n,\n(1)\nwith the hypothesis:\n\u03981 \u2229 \u03982 \u2229 \u03983 \u2229 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0398n \u0338= \u2205.\n(2)\nThe multimodal neural networks can be formulated as a unified mapping function F : x \u2208 X \u2192\n\u02c6y \u2208 Y, where x is the input data coming from any modality {X1, X2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Xn} and \u02c6y denotes the\nprediction of the network. Let\u2019s denote y as the ground truth labels, the multimodal pipeline can be\nformulated as:\n\u02c6y = F(x; \u03b8\u2217), \u03b8\u2217 = arg min\nx\u2208X\n[L(\u02c6y, y)].\n(3)\n4\nShared Token Space\nPoint Cloud\nImages\n\u201cThe answer \nis blowing in the wind.\u201d\nNatural Language\nAudio Spectrogram\n\u2026 L1\n*\n1\n\u2026\n0 *\n1\nL2\n0 *\n1\nL3\n\u2026\n0 *\n1\nL4\n\u2026\nData-to-Sequence Tokenizer\n0\nWord Piece\nImage Patches\nSkeleton Adjacency\nSpectrograms\nSegmentation\nDetection\nScene Segmentation\nClassification\nClassification\nSpeech Classification\n\u201csentences have the \nsame semantics?\u201d\n\u201csentiment positive \nor negative?\u201d\n\u201cdetermine\nstatements is \nentailed.\u201d\nParaphrase\nSentiment\nInference\nUnified Multimodal Model \nPart Segmentation\nParameter Frozen\nParameter Trainable\nFigure 2: Meta-Transformer consists of data-to-sequence tokenization, unified feature encoding, and\ndown-stream task learning. The framework is illustrated with text, image, point cloud, and audio.\n3.2\nData-to-Sequence Tokenization\nWe propose a novel meta-tokenization scheme designed to transform data across various modalities\ninto token embeddings, all within a shared manifold space. This approach is then applied to\ntokenization, taking into account the practical characteristics of modality, as illustrated in Figure 3.\nWe take text, images, point clouds, and audio as examples. More details can be found in supplementary\nmaterials. In specific, we use xT , xI, xP , and xA to denote a data sample of text, image, point cloud,\nand audio spectrogram.\nNatural Language. Following the common practice [51, 65], we use WordPiece embeddings [66]\nwith a 30,000 token vocabulary. WordPiece segments original words into subwords. For example, the\noriginal sentence: \u201cThe supermarket is hosting a sale\u201d, could be converted by WordPiece to: \u201c_The\n_super market _is _host ing _a _sale\u201d.\nIn this case, the word \u201csupermarket\u201d is divided into two subwords \u201c_super\u201d and \u201cmarket\u201d and the\nword \u201chosting\u201d is divided into \u201c_host\u201d and \u201cing\u201d, while the rest words are unchanged and still single\nunits. The front of the first character of each original word will be stacked with a special character\n\u201c_\u201d, indicating the beginning of a natural word. Each subword is corresponding to a unique token in a\nvocabulary, then is projected to a high-dimensional feature space with word embedding layers. As a\nresult, each input text is transformed to a set of token embeddings x \u2208 Rn\u00d7D, where n is the number\nof tokens and D is the dimension of embedding.\nImages. To accommodate 2D images, we reshape the image x \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7C into a sequence of\nflattened 2D patches xp \u2208 RNs\u00d7(S2\u00b7C), where (H, W) represents the original image resolution, C\ndenotes the number of channels; S is the patch size, and Ns = (HW/S2) is the resulting number of\npatches. After that, a projection layer is utilized to project the embedding dimension to D:\nxI \u2208 RC\u00d7H\u00d7W \u2192 x\u2032\nI \u2208 RNs\u00d7(S2\u00b7C) \u2192 x\u2032\u2032\nI \u2208 RNs\u00d7D.\n(4)\nNote that we use the same operation for infrared images but the linear projection for hyperspectral\nimages. In addition, we simply replace 2D convolution layers with 3D convolution for video\nrecognition. More details can be found in B.1 and B.3.\nPoint Cloud. To learn 3D patterns with transformers, we convert point clouds from raw input space\nto the token embedding space. X = {xi}P\ni=1 denotes a point cloud of P points, where xi = (pi, fi),\npi \u2208 R3 represents the 3D coordinates, and fi \u2208 Rc is feature of the i-th point. Generally, fi contains\nvisual hints such as color, viewpoint, normal, etc. We employ the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS)\noperation to sample a representative skeleton of original point clouds with a fixed sampling ratio\n(1/4). Then we employ K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to group neighboring points. Based on grouped\nsets containing local geometric prior, we construct the adjacency matrix with center points of grouped\nsubsets to further undercover the comprehensive structural information of 3D objects and 3D scenes.\n5\nParsing\n1\u00d71 Conv\nFlatten\n(b) Text Tokenization\nT\nE\nSentences\nProjection\nSub    words\nC\uf0a2\n(a) Meta Scheme\nx\nx\nE\nTransformation\nConvolution\nGrouping\nLocal   Data\nLocal   Semantics\nPatchify\nS\u00d7S Conv\nFlatten\n(c) Image Tokenization\nC H W\nIx\n\uf0b4\n\uf0b4\n\uf0ce\nI\nE\nC S S\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4\nC H W\n\uf0b4\n\uf0b4\nPatches\nPatch\nFPS & KNN\nFlatten\n(d) Point Tokenization\n(3\n)\nP\nc\npx\n\uf0b4\n+\n\uf0ce\nP\nE\nSubsets\n(3\n)\n4\nP\nc\n\uf0b4\n+\nAdjacency\n1\u00d71 Conv\n(3\nc)\nS S\n+\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4\nPatchify\nFlatten\n(e) Audio Tokenization\nT F\nxA\n\uf0b4\n\uf0ce\nA\nE\n1 T F\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4\nPatches\nS\u00d7S Conv\nSpectrum\n1 S S\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4\nFigure 3: Illustration of Data-to-Sequence Tokenization 3.2. We propose the meta scheme in (a)\ncontaining grouping, convolution, and transformation progress. Then (b)-(e) represents the building\nblocks applied with our meta scheme on texts, images, point clouds, and audio spectrograms.\nFinally, we aggregate the structural representations from K subsets. We obtain point embeddings as:\nxP \u2208 RP \u00d7(3+c) \u2192 x\u2032\nP \u2208 R\nP\n4 \u00d7 D\n2 \u2192 x\u2032\u2032\nP \u2208 R\nP\n16 \u00d7D.\n(5)\nAudio Spectrogram. Initially, we pre-process the audio waveform with the duration of t seconds\nwith log Mel filterbank [67]. Then we employ the Hamming window with a stride of ts on the\nfrequency of fs to split the original wave into l = (t/ts) intervals and further transform the original\nwave into l-dimensional filterbank.\nSubsequently, we split the spectrogram into patches from time and frequency dimensions with\nthe same patch size of S. Different from image patches, audio patches overlap on spectrograms.\nFollowing AST [6], we also choose to split whole spectrograms into Ns = 12[(100t \u2212 16)/10]\npatches by S \u00d7 S convolution, then we flatten patches into token sequences. Finally, we summarize\nthe process:\nxA \u2208 RT \u00d7F \u2192 x\u2032\nA \u2208 RNs\u00d7S\u00d7S \u2192 x\u2032\u2032\nA \u2208 R(Ns\u00b7D/S2)\u00d7D,\n(6)\nwhere T and F denote time and frequency dimensions.\n3.3\nUnified Encoder\nAfter transforming the raw inputs to token embedding space, we leverage a unified transformer en-\ncoder with frozen parameters to encode the sequences of token embeddings from different modalities.\nPretraining. We utilize ViT [13] as the backbone network and pre-train it on the LAION-2B dataset\nwith contrastive learning, which reinforces the ability for generic token encoding. After pretraining,\nwe freeze the parameters of the backbone network. In addition, for text understanding, we utilize the\npretrained text tokenizer of CLIP [24] to segment sentences into subwords and transform subwords\ninto word embeddings.\nModality-Agnostic Learning. Following common practice [51, 13], we prepend a learnable token\nxCLS to the sequence of token embeddings, and the final hidden state of xCLS token (z0\nL) serves as the\nsummary representation of the input sequence, which is usually utilized for performing recognition.\nTo reinforce positional information, we incorporate position embeddings into the token embeddings.\nRecall that we tokenize the input data to 1D embeddings, thus, we opt for standard learnable 1D\nposition embeddings. In addition, we do not observe substantial performance improvements using\nmore sophisticated 2D-aware position embeddings on image recognition. We simply fuse the position\nembeddings and the content embeddings with an element-wise addition operation, and the resulting\nembedding sequences are then fed into the encoder.\nThe transformer encoder with a depth of L compromises multiple stacked multi-head self-attention\n(MSA) layers and MLP blocks. The input token embeddings are fed into an MSA layer first, then\n6\nan MLP block. Then the output of (\u2113 \u2212 1)-th MLP block serves as the input of \u2113-th MSA layer.\nLayer Normalization (LN) is appended before each layer and the residual connection is applied after\neach layer. The MLP contains two linear FC layers along with a GELU non-linear activation. The\nformulation of the transformer is:\nz0 = [xCLS; Ex1; Ex2; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; Exn] + Epos,\nE \u2208 Rn\u00d7D, Epos \u2208 R(n+1)\u00d7D\n(7)\nz\u2032\n\u2113 = MSA(LN(z\u2113\u22121)) + z\u2113\u22121,\n\u2113 = 1 . . . L\n(8)\nz\u2113 = MLP(LN(z\u2032\n\u2113)) + z\u2032\n\u2113,\n\u2113 = 1 . . . L\n(9)\ny = LN(z0\nL)\n(10)\nwhere Ex denotes the token embeddings from proposed tokenizer and n denotes the number of\ntokens. We augment patch embeddings and learnable embedding with position embeddings Epos.\n3.4\nTask-Specific Heads\nAfter obtaining learning representations, we feed representations to the task-specific heads h(\u00b7; \u03b8h),\nwhich consists mainly of MLPs and varies from modalities and tasks. The learning objective of\nMeta-Transformer can be summarized as:\n\u02c6y = F(x; \u03b8\u2217) = h \u25e6 g \u25e6 f(x),\n\u03b8\u2217 = arg min\n\u03b8\nL(\u02c6y, y),\n(11)\nwhere f(\u00b7), g(\u00b7), and h(\u00b7) denote the function of tokenizer, backbone, and heads, respectively.\n4\nExperiments\nIn this section, we perform experiments on each of the 12 modalities. We demonstrate the potential\nof Meta-Transformer for multimodal perception. A summary of our experimental design is shown in\nTable 2 and more experimental details can be found in \u00a7 C.1.\n4.1\nExperimental Setups\nText understanding. For text understanding evaluation, we employ the General Language Under-\nstanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark [68] which incorporates several different datasets, covering\na wide range of natural language understanding tasks.\nImage understanding. 1) Classification: we conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K [69] which\ncontains approximately 1.3 million images with 1000 categories. Following common practices [70,\n19, 71], base-scale models are trained for 300 epochs, while large models are pre-trained on ImageNet-\n22K (14.2 million images) for 90 epochs and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K for another 20 epochs. 2)\nObject Detection: we conduct experiments on the MS COCO dataset [72] using Mask R-CNN [73]\nas the detector and training each model for 12 epochs. 3) Semantic Segmentation: we train the\nsegmentation head UperNet [74] on ADE20K [75] for 160k iterations, providing a fair comparison\nwith previous CNN-based and transformer-based backbones.\nInfrared, X-Ray, and Hyperspectral data understanding. We conduct experiments on infrared\nimage, X-Ray scan, and hyperspectral data recognition with RegDB [76], Chest X-Ray [77], and\nIndian Pine 4 datasets, respectively.\nPoint cloud understanding. 1) Classification: to assess the performance of Meta-Transformer in 3D\nobject classification, we use the ModelNet-40 [78] benchmark, consisting of CAD models across\n40 classes, with 9,843 training samples and 2,468 validation samples. 2) Semantic segmentation: to\nevaluate performance in 3D point cloud segmentation, we assess the model on both S3DIS [79] and\nShapeNetPart [80] datasets. The S3DIS dataset encompasses 6 large indoor areas and 13 semantic\nclasses, comprising 271 rooms. The ShapeNetPart dataset includes 16,880 object models across 16\nshape categories.\nAudio recognition. For audio recognition, we utilize the Speech Commands V2 [81] dataset, which\nconsists of 105,829 one-second recordings of 35 common speech commands.\n4https://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TGRS_SpectralFormer/blob/main/data/\nIndianPine.mat\n7\nVideo recognition. For video understanding, we conduct experiments on the UCF101 [82] dataset\nfor action recognition, with more details presented in \u00a7 B.1.\nTime-series forecasting. For time-series forecasting, we conduct experiments on ETTh1 [83],\nTraffic5, Weather6, and Exchange [84] datasets. We use the tokenizer of Autoformer [85].\nGraph understanding.

On image\nclassification, with the help of CLIP [24] text encoder, Meta-Transformer delivers great performances\nunder zero-shot classification with the Meta-Transformer-B16F and Meta-Transformer-L14F, achiev-\ning 69.3% and 75.3%, respectively. At the same time, when the pretrained parameters are further\ntuned, Meta-Transformer can outperform existing advanced methods, with Meta-Transformer-B16T\nand Meta-Transformer-L14T achieving 85.4% and 88.1% accuracy, respectively. The latter outper-\nforms both SwinV2-L/24\u2021 [107] (87.6%) and InternImage-XL [96]\u2021 (88.0%) on ImageNet [69]\nclassification.\n9\nTable 6: Experimental results for point cloud understanding.

On object\ndetection, Meta-Transformer-B16F and Meta-Transformer-L14F achieve APs of 31.7% and 43.5%,\nwhile Meta-Transformer-B16T and Meta-Transformer-L14T reach 46.4% and 56.3% AP, respectively.\nIn semantic segmentation, the mIoUs for Meta-Transformer-B16F and Meta-Transformer-L14F are\n33.4% and 41.2%, while Meta-Transformer-B16T and Meta-Transformer-L14T achieve 51.0% and\n55.0%, respectively. In comparison, SwinV2-L/24\u2021 outperforms the Meta-Transformer in both\nobject detection (58.8% AP) and semantic segmentation (55.9% mIoU). The Meta-Transformer-L14T\nmodel has a similar performance to InternImage-XL\u2021 [96] in semantic segmentation (both achieving\n55.0% mIoU), but outperforms it in object detection (56.3% AP compared to 55.3% AP). These\nresults highlight that Meta-Transformer demonstrates a competitive performance in various image\nunderstanding tasks even compared to Swin Transformer [19] and InternImage.\n4.4\nResults on Infrared, Hyperspectral, and X-Ray data\nTable 5a presents the performance comparison of Meta-Transformer and other advanced methods\non the RegDB dataset [76] for infrared image recognition. Meta-Transformer-B16F demonstrates\ncompetitive results with a Rank-1 accuracy of 73.50% and an mAP of 65.19%. While it may not out-\nperform the top-performing methods, Meta-Transformer proves to be a simple transferable approach\nfor infrared image recognition tasks. These results indicate the potential of Meta-Transformer in\nhandling the challenges associated with infrared images and contribute to advancements in this field.\nTable 7:\nX-ray image recognition with Meta-\nTransformer.

SpectralFormer [100] achieves im-\npressive accuracy scores, with a patch-wise\napproach. Plain vision transformer also per-\nforms well in comparison when fully tun-\ning all parameters. Meta-Transformer-B16F\ndemonstrates competitive results on hyper-\nspectral image recognition with lower over-\nall accuracy. However, Meta-Transformer\nstands out for its significantly fewer trainable parameters (only 0.17M) compared to other methods.\nThis reveals a promising development direction of applying the Meta-Transformer to remote sensing,\nenvironmental monitoring, and mineral exploration. For X-Ray images, similar to dealing with\ninfrared images, we take the same image tokenizer as common visible images. From Table 7, we can\nobserve that Meta-Transformer can achieve a competitive performance of 94.1% accuracy.\n4.5\nResults on 3D Point Cloud Understanding\nTable 6 showcases the experimental results for point cloud understanding, comparing the perfor-\nmance of Meta-Transformer with other state-of-the-art methods on the ModelNet-40 [78], S3DIS [79],\n10\nand ShapeNetPart [80] datasets. The tasks include classification, semantic segmentation, and object\npart segmentation. When pretrained on 2D data, Meta-Transformer-B16F demonstrates competi-\ntive performance, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 93.6% on ModelNet-40 with only 0.6M\ntrainable parameters, which is comparable to the best-performing models. On the S3DIS Area-5\ndataset, Meta-Transformer outperforms other methods with a mean IoU (mIoU) of 72.3% and a\nmean accuracy (mAcc) of 83.5%, using 2.3M parameters. Moreover, Meta-Transformer excels\nin the ShapeNetPart dataset, achieving the highest scores on both instances mIoU (mIoUI) and\ncategory mIoU (mIoUC) with 87.0% and 85.2%, respectively, using 2.3M parameters. In summary,\nMeta-Transformer demonstrates remarkable advantages in point cloud understanding tasks, offering\ncompetitive performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\n4.6\nResults on Audio Recognition\nIn order to fairly compare Meta-Transformer with existing audio transformer series [6, 23]\nof similar scale, we conduct experiments on audio recognition using Meta-Transformer-B32.\nTable 8: Audio understanding with Meta-Transformer.

With frozen pa-\nrameters, Meta-Transformer-B32F\nachieves an accuracy of 78.3%\nwhile requiring only 1.1M param-\neters for tuning.\nOn the other\nhand, the Meta-Transformer-B32T\nmodel exhibits a significantly higher accuracy of 97.0% when tuning the parameters, whereas the AST\nmodel only reaches an accuracy of 92.6%. When AST is pre-trained on ImageNet and supplemented\nwith additional Knowledge Distillation (KD), it achieves an improved performance of 98.1%, but\nwith a higher number of trainable parameters of 86.9M. SSAST models display accuracy scores\nranging from 97.8% to 98.0% while requiring 89.3M parameters.

It suggests that Meta-\nTransformer is also advantageous for tabular\ndata understanding, especially on complex datasets such as Bank Marketing.\nTable 12: Graph data understanding with Meta-Transformer.

Among all the methods, Graphormer shows the\nbest performance with the lowest train and validation MAE scores of 0.0582 and 0.1234, respectively.\n12\nIn contrast, Meta-Transformer-B16F delivers the train and validation MAE scores of 0.8034 and\n0.8863, which reveals the limited ability of current Meta-Transformer architecture for structural data\nlearning. We will further improve this in the future. Besides, following ImageBind [26], we conduct\nclassification on the Ego4D dataset [88], with input data, Meta-Transformer delivers an accuracy of\n73.9%.\n5\nLimitation\nFrom the perspectives of complexity, methodology, and further application, the limitations of the\nMeta-Transformer are summarized as follows:\nComplexity: Meta-Transformer requires O(n2 \u00d7 D) computation dealing with token embeddings\n[E1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , En]. High memory cost and heavy computation burden make it difficult to scale up.\nMethodology:\nCompared\nwith\nAxial\nAttention\nmechanism\nin\nTimeSformer\n[7]\nand\nGraphormer [125], Meta-Transformer lacks temporal and structural awareness. This limitation\nmay affect the overall performance of Meta-Transformer in tasks where temporal and structural\nmodeling plays a critical role, such as video understanding, visual tracking, or social network\nprediction.\nApplication: Meta-Transformer primarily delivers its advantages in multimodal perception. It\u2019s still\nunknown about its ability for cross-modal generation. We will work on this in the future.\n6\nConclusion\nIn the early stages of artificial intelligence development, pioneers introduced the Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) to address prediction tasks in machine learning. Later, recurrent and convolutional\nnetworks expanded AI capabilities in multimedia data processing, achieving significant success in ex-\ntracting representations from texts, images, point clouds, and audio. MLPs have since been integrated\ninto deep convolutional networks. In this paper, we explore the potential of plain transformers for\nunified multimodal learning, highlighting a promising trend toward developing unified multimodal\nintelligence with a transformer backbone. To some extent, this paper supports the dominant position\nof transformers in next-generation networks. Importantly, CNNs and MLPs are not left behind. They\nplay essential roles in data tokenization and representation projection. This process exemplifies the\nlaw of succession in neural networks and the ongoing evolution of artificial intelligence.\n13\nReferences\n[1] Zirui Wang, Jiahui Yu, Adams Wei Yu, Zihang Dai, Yulia Tsvetkov, and Yuan Cao.\nSimvlm: Simple visual language model pretraining with weak supervision. arXiv preprint\narXiv:2108.10904, 2021.\n[2] Wenhui Wang, Hangbo Bao, Li Dong, and Furu Wei.

Springer, 2022.\n21\nAppendix\nA\nSummary\nThe appendix is organized as the following:\n\u2022 We first validate and discuss the potential of the Meta-Transformer on more modalities\n(video, infrared, X-Ray, and hyperspectral images) in addition to the modalities shown in\nthe main paper, and we provide surprising experimental results on these modalities in \u00a7 B.\n\u2022 Then we further demonstrate the performance and merits of Meta-Transformer in dealing\nwith multi-modal tasks (involving inputs from more than one modality to perform predic-\ntions) in \u00a7 C.\n\u2022 In addition, we introduce more details of experiments on text, image, point cloud, and audio\nin \u00a7 D.\n\u2022 Last but not least, we discuss the impact of Meta-Transformer on the machine learning and\ncomputer vision community in \u00a7 E.\nB\nExtensibility on Single-Modality Perception\nIn the main body of this paper, we illustrate that Meta-Transformer can simultaneously uncover\nthe underlying patterns of natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, and audio spectrograms\nwith the same network architecture and network parameters. Furthermore, we explore its ability\nin perceiving other modalities, like video recognition, infrared, X-Ray, and hyperspectral image\nrecognition. In specific, we conduct experiments on UCF101 [82] (video), RegDB [76] (infrared\nimages), Chest X-Ray [77], and Indian Pine (hyperspectral images) datasets.\nB.1\nVideo Recognition\nFor video recognition, we follow VideoMAE [111] to modify the tokenizer by replacing the\n2D embedding layer with a 3D embedding layer to simultaneously encode the spatial-temporal\ninformation from input frames. After tokenization, by leveraging the modality-shared encoder and\ntask-specific heads, Meta-Transformer is able to extract high-level semantic features from videos and\nachieve favorable performance in the action recognition task of the UCF101 dataset.\nDataset. The UCF101 [82] dataset is a common-used benchmark dataset for action recognition tasks.\nIt is an extended version of UCF50 and contains 13,320 video clips of 101 categories. These 101\ncategories can be divided into 5 groups: Body motion, Human-human interactions, Human-object\ninteractions, Playing musical instruments and Sports. All the input frames are with a resolution of\n320\u00d7240 and a fixed frame rate of 25 FPS, collected from YouTube.\nB.2\nInfrared Image Recognition\nInfrared and hyperspectral image recognition poses unique challenges due to their specific char-\nacteristics. For infrared images, the Meta-Transformer framework could be adapted to capture\nthermal information by encoding temperature values alongside visual features, where the tokenizer\nfor infrared images is the same as common RGB images.\nDataset. The RegDB [76] dataset focuses on evaluating the performance of infrared recognition\nalgorithms in unconstrained and realistic scenarios. It includes variations in pose, expression, illumi-\nnation, and occlusion. We conduct experiments on the RegDB dataset to evaluate the performance of\nMeta-Transformer on infrared recognition.\nB.3\nHyperspectral Image Recognition\nSimilarly, for hyperspectral images, we expect that Meta-Transformer can also handle the high-\ndimensional spectral information by representing each spectral band in token embeddings. Compared\n22\nwith dealing with RGB images, the only modification is that we employ the new linear projection\nlayer to replace the existing 2D convolution layer.\nDataset. The Indian Pine dataset is widely used in remote sensing and hyperspectral image analysis.\nIt consists of 145 \u00d7 145 pixels with 145 spectral bands, which are captured in Indiana.\nB.4\nX-Ray Image Recognition\nIn addition, we explore the potential of the Meta-Transformer in medical image analysis. We\nleverage the tokenizer for RGB images here to encode raw medical images. Specifically, we conduct\nexperiments regarding X-ray image analysis on the Chest X-Ray [77] dataset. It is a collection\nof medical images commonly used for the analysis and diagnosis of various thoracic conditions.\nIt comprises 7,000 X-ray images of the chest. The dataset is annotated with labels indicating the\npresence or absence of abnormalities such as lung diseases, fractures, and heart conditions.\nC\nExtensibility on Multi-Modality Perception\nSince the modalities of text, image, point cloud, and audio are all involved in this paper, we did\nnot conduct comprehensive multi-modal experiments as common practice such as Flamingo [25],\nOFA [10], or BEiT-3 [3]. Instead, we conduct multi-modal experiments on a new and challenging\ntask of Audio-Visual Segmentation [126], which is mainly focused on building an intelligent listener\nto align with fundamental visual tasks.\nC.1\nAudio-Visual Segmentation\nAudio-visual segmentation [126] refers to the task of segmenting objects from different audio\nsources within a referring image. It aims to develop algorithms that analyze both audio and visual\nsignals simultaneously to identify and delineate distinct sources or events. It finds applications in\nfields like video conferencing, surveillance, multimedia analysis, and augmented reality.\nWe conduct experiments on the AVSS [126] dataset, which is recently released in the field of audio-\nvisual research. It provides a comprehensive collection of audio and visual data captured in real-world\nscenarios. The dataset includes synchronized audio and visual recordings, featuring various events\nof human actions and natural sounds. In contrast to introducing multi-modal fusion modules as\nexisting methods, Meta-Transformer directly concatenates visual and audio embeddings after Data-to-\nSequence tokenization. After extracting representation, we employ a simple global average pooling\nlayer to obtain the final representations of two modalities. Table 13 illustrates the performance of\nTable 13: Audio-Visual Segmentation with Meta-Transformer. We conduct experiments on the\nAVSS [126] dataset, we report mIou (%) and F-score.\nMethod\nmIou (%)\nF-score\nParams\nAVSS [126] (ResNet-50)\n20.18\n0.252\n\u02dc80M\nAVSS [126] (ASPP)\n28.94\n-\n\u02dc180M\nAVSS [126] (PVT-v2)\n29.77\n0.352\n\u02dc180M\nMeta-Transformer\n31.33\n0.387\n86.5M\nMeta-Transformer and existing methods on the AVSS dataset for audio-visual segmentation. The\nevaluation metrics reported in this task are mIou and F-score. In comparison, Meta-Transformer\noutperforms all other methods with the highest mIou of 31.33% and the highest F-score of 0.387.\nIt also stands out for its significantly lower parameter count, with only 86.5 million parameters\ncompared to the approximate 80M to 180M parameters of other methods.\nMeta-Transformer offers several advantages over other methods in the field.\n\u2022 Unified architecture. It relieves modality-specific encoders and reduces computation by\nleveraging a unified encode to process both audio and images, resulting in a more efficient\nand streamlined process.\n23\n\u2022 Faster convergence. Thanks to the unified architecture for processing both audio and\nimages, the encoder can deeply align the two modalities instead of only at the output end,\nwhich leads to faster convergence. Meta-Transformer only needs 4 training epochs to reach\n31.33% of mIou.\n\u2022 Superior performance. Meta-Transformer achieves a significant improvement of 10%\ncompared to other methods of a similar parameter scale.\n\u2022 Efficiency. Despite its enhanced performance, Meta-Transformer achieves this with much\nfewer parameters, requiring only 1/3 of the parameter amount, which makes forward and\nbackward progress ease.\nIn summary, the benefits of employing the Meta-Transformer to deal with multi-modal tasks are\nappealing due to computational efficiency, rapid convergence, improved performance, and parameter\nefficiency. It reveals the significantly promising direction to apply Meta-Transformer to more multi-\nmodal tasks.\nD\nExperimental Details\nOur code is built on open-source projects including MMClassification8, MMDetection9, MMseg-\nmentation10, OpenPoints11, Time-Series-Library12, Graphomer 13.\nWe sincerely thank their great contributions. More implementation details can be found in our source\ncode.\nE\nFurther Impact Discussion\nE.1\nModality-Free Perception\nWe hope that Meta-Transformer can introduce new insight into both multi-modal learning and multi-\nmodal generation fields. Meta-Transformer enables the usage of a shared encoder to encode diverse\nmodalities, e.g. natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, as well as audio spectrograms., and\nproject them into a shared representation space. This naturally reduces the modality gap across\nmodalities and mitigates the burden of cross-modal alignment. In addition, Meta-Transformer\nremoves the need for paired training data (such as image-text pairs), thus endowing multi-modal\nlearning with more training flexibility.\nE.2\nApplication Prospects\nWe investigate the application of Meta-Transformer on a wide range of modalities including RGB\nimages, text, point clouds, video understanding, remote sensing (hyper-spectral images), nighttime\nsurveillance (infrared images), and medical analysis (X-Ray images).\nIn video understanding, Meta-Transformer reveals the potential of enhancing the analysis and\ninterpretation of videos by integrating information from text, audio, and image with the shared\nencoder. This benefits tasks such as action recognition, event detection, and video summarization.\nMeta-Transformer\u2019s capability to handle video-related modalities paves the way for improved video\nunderstanding applications in areas like video surveillance, video indexing, and content-based video\nretrieval.\nIn hyperspectral imaging for remote sensing, Meta-Transformer enables the analysis and under-\nstanding of hyperspectral data by extracting high-level semantic features. It enhances tasks such as\n8https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain/tree/mmcls-1.x\n9https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection\n10https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation\n11https://github.com/guochengqian/openpoints\n12https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library\n13https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer\n24\nclassification, target detection, and land cover mapping, improving the accuracy and efficiency of\nremote sensing applications. The ability to process hyperspectral images using Meta-Transformer\nopens doors for advancements in environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, and disaster\nmanagement.\nIn medical applications, particularly X-ray image analysis, Meta-Transformer offers a promising\napproach to improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency with multi-modal information. It can\neffectively capture and fuse information from X-ray images, clinical data, and other modalities to\naid in disease detection, anomaly identification, and treatment planning by leveraging its unified\nlearning framework. Meta-Transformer\u2019s capability to handle multi-modal data enhances the potential\nfor more accurate and comprehensive medical imaging analysis, leading to better patient care and\noutcomes.\nFor infrared images used in nighttime recognition and surveillance, Meta-Transformer\u2019s ability to\nprocess infrared data helps extract crucial information for object detection, tracking, and recognition\nin low-light conditions, which opens an avenue for advancements in nighttime surveillance, security\nsystems, and autonomous navigation in challenging environments with the cooperation between\ninfrared cameras with RGB cameras.\nE.3\nConclusion\nIn summary, we think that the ability of Meta-Transformer to unify multi-modal learning comes\nfrom that neural network architectures can learn modality-invariant patterns. The architecture of\nMeta-Transformer illustrates the advantages of length-variable token embeddings in multi-modal\nlearning, which provides flexible but unified forms of multi-modal semantics. Then it\u2019s time to\nthink about designing algorithms to train networks that generalize on unseen modalities. Meanwhile,\nit\u2019s also intriguing to design the architecture of a unified multi-modal decoder, which can decode\nrepresentations into any form of a specific modality.\nAlthough Meta-Transformer presents a surprising performance and shows a new promising direction\nin multi-modal perception, we are not sure whether the proposed architectures are also effective in\ngenerative tasks. And it remains mysterious how to develop modality-invariant generative models.\nWe hope that this can inspire future research.\n25\n"

In this paper, we intro-\nduce a method for reconstructing music from brain activity, captured using func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

As an alternative we consider\nretrieving music from a large database, instead of generating it.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nMusic holds universal significance, acting as a medium for expression and communication across\ndiverse cultures. The representation of music within our brains has been a significant topic of interest\nin neuroscience. Previous studies have examined human brain activity, as captured by functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while participants listened to music. These studies discovered\nmusical feature representations in the brain, such as rhythms (Alluri et al., 2012), timbres (Toiviainen\net al., 2014; Allen et al., 2018), emotions (Koelsch et al., 2006), and musical genres (Casey, 2017;\nNakai et al., 2021). This body of research provides valuable insights into how music-related features \u2013\nboth objective and subjective, acoustic and semantic \u2013 are represented within the brain, illuminating\nthe complexity of our experiences with music.\nWith the advent of text-to-music models, conditional generation of high-fidelity music has become\nfeasible (Forsgren & Martiros, 2022; Agostinelli et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2023a;\n\u2217 Equal contribution; correspondence to timodenk@google.com and takagi.yuu.fbs@osaka-u.ac.jp\n1\narXiv:2307.11078v1  [q-bio.NC]  20 Jul 2023\nCopet et al., 2023). This exciting development bridges the gap between our linguistic understanding\nof music and the actual creation of musical compositions. Thus, new questions arise: How do the text\nand music embeddings used by these music generation models correspond to representations in the\nhuman brain? Furthermore, if a correspondence exists, is it possible to generate music directly from\nbrain activity?\nIn this paper, we explore the feasibility of reconstructing music from brain activity scans with\nMusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023). We also compare some of the internal representations of\nMusicLM, such as the high-level semantic embedding space of MuLan (Huang et al., 2022) and the\nlow-level, averaged embeddings from w2v-BERT, to activity in different brain regions, providing\nnovel insights.\nIn detail, we make the following contributions:\n\u2022 We reconstruct music from fMRI scans by predicting high-level, semantically-structured\nmusic embeddings and using a deep neural network to generate music from those features.\nOur evaluation indicates that the reconstructed music semantically resembles the original\nmusic stimulus.\n\u2022 We find that different components of our music generation model are predictive of activity\nin the human auditory cortex. The distinction between low- and high-level audio representa-\ntions within the auditory cortex is less pronounced than that observed in the visual cortex\nfor visual stimuli.\n\u2022 We offer novel insights suggesting that within the auditory cortex there is significant overlap\nin the voxels that are predictable from (a) purely textual descriptions of music and (b) the\nmusic itself.\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nMUSIC GENERATION MODELS\nGenerating high-fidelity music has been challenging due to the need to produce music with both\nhigh-quality audio and long-term consistency. An initial approach was introduced by Jukebox\n(Dhariwal et al., 2020), which proposes a hierarchical structure at different time resolutions, modeled\nautoregressively with Transformer-based models. While Jukebox generates music with high temporal\ncoherence, it contains perceptible artifacts. PerceiverAR (Hawthorne et al., 2022) makes use of\nSoundStream, a neural audio codec which compresses audio at low bitrates, while maintaining a\nhigh-quality reconstruction (Zeghidour et al., 2021a). PerceiverAR models a sequence of discrete\nSoundStream embeddings autoregressively, generating high quality audio but lacking in temporal\ncoherence.\nRecently, auto-regressive and diffusion-based models have significantly advanced the quality of\nsynthesis in both music and broader audio generation. AudioLM (Borsos et al., 2022) suggests\nautoregressively modeling a hierarchical tokenization scheme composed of both semantic and acoustic\ndiscrete audio representations. MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) integrates the AudioLM framework\nwith the joint music/text embedding model MuLan (Huang et al., 2022), enabling the generation of\nhigh-fidelity music conditioned on detailed text descriptions.\nOther Transformer-based methods encompass Donahue et al. (2023), Lam et al. (2023a), and Copet\net al. (2023), with the last of these leveraging the EnCodec audio codec (D\u00b4efossez et al., 2022).\nAdditionally, diffusion model-based strategies for music generation are used by Riffusion (Forsgren\n& Martiros, 2022), with the most recent advancements proposed in (Huang et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023; Ghosal et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2023b).\nWithin the framework of our Brain2Music pipeline, we employ MusicLM and its constituent compo-\nnents. However, our methodology is fundamentally adaptable to any music generator, provided the\ngenerator can accommodate conditioning on a dense embedding. When this project began, MusicLM\nwas the only potent music generation model accessible to us.\n2\n2.2\nFMRI AUDIO DECODING AND FMRI ENCODING\nOne of the key goals in neuroscience is to understand the representations that govern the relationship\nbetween brain activity and sensory and cognitive experiences. To this end, researchers construct\nencoding models to quantitatively describe which features of these experiences (e.g., color, motion,\nand phonemes) are encoded as brain activity. In contrast, they also build decoding models to infer the\nexperienced content from a specific pattern of brain activity (for a review, see Naselaris et al. (2011)).\nParticularly in recent years, researchers have discovered correspondences between the internal\nrepresentations of deep learning models and those of the brain across various sensory and cognitive\nmodalities (Yamins et al., 2014; Kell et al., 2018). These findings have advanced our understanding\nof brain functions through (a) the development of encoding models mediated by the representations\n(G\u00a8uc\u00b8l\u00a8u & van Gerven, 2015), (b) interpretations of the representations based on their correspondence\nwith brain functions (Cross et al., 2021; Takagi & Nishimoto, 2022), and (c) reconstruction of\nexperienced content (such as visual images) from brain activity (Shen et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2023;\nTakagi & Nishimoto, 2023).\nMore specifically, in the context of investigating auditory brain functions, researchers have developed\nencoding models using deep learning models that process auditory inputs (Kell et al., 2018), and\nconducted studies to reconstruct perceived sounds from brain activity (Santoro et al., 2017; Park\net al., 2023). However, so far, these studies have largely targeted general sounds, including voices\nand natural sounds. There are no instances of constructing encoding models using the internal\nrepresentations of text-to-music generative models, or reconstructing musical experiences from brain\nactivity with a focus on music and its unique features.\n3\nMETHODS\n3.1\nMUSIC FMRI DATASET\nWe pre-process the music genre neuroimaging dataset1 from Nakai et al. (2022) in a same manner\nas Nakai et al. (2021). See Appendix A.1.1 for details of the preprocessing protocol. The dataset\ncontains music stimuli from 10 genres (blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop,\nreggae, and rock) which were sampled randomly from the (music-only) dataset GTZAN (Tzanetakis\n& Cook, 2002). A total of 54 music pieces (30s, 22.050kHz) were selected from each genre, providing\n540 music pieces. A 15s music clip was selected at random from each music piece. For each clip, 2s\nof fade-in and fade-out were applied and the overall intensity was normalized. The dataset contains\n480 examples for training and 60 for reporting the final results.\nData collection details.\nDuring scanning, five participants were asked to focus on a fixation cross\nat the center of the screen and to listen to the music clips through MRI-compatible insert earphones\n(Model S14, Sensimetrics). Every subject heard the same music clips. This headphone model can\nattenuate scanner noise and has been widely used in previous MRI studies with auditory stimuli\n(Norman-Haignere et al., 2015). Scanning was performed using a 3.0T MRI scanner (TIM Trio;\nSiemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. For functional scanning, we\nscanned 68 interleaved axial slices with a thickness of 2.0mm without a gap using a T2\u2217-weighted\ngradient echo multi-band echo-planar imaging (MB-EPI) sequence (Moeller et al., 2010) (repetition\ntime (TR, aka. sampling interval) = 1,500ms, echo time (TE) = 30ms, flip angle (FA) = 62\u25e6, field\nof view (FOV) = 192 \u00d7 192mm2, voxel size = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2mm3, multi-band factor = 4). A total of\n410 volumes were obtained for each run.\nText captions.\nIn this work, we augment the original dataset (Nakai et al., 2022) by introducing En-\nglish text captions which we have made publicly available2. These captions, averaging approximately\n46 words or 280 characters in length, typically describe the musical pieces in terms of genre, instru-\nmentation, rhythm, and mood. They often comprise fragmented or semi-complete sentences, with an\naverage of about 4.5 sentences per caption. The style of writing is subjective, reflecting not only the\ntechnical components of the music such as the instruments used, but also the emotional responses or\n1Download link: openneuro.org/datasets/ds003720\n2kaggle.com/datasets/nishimotolab/music-caption-brain2music\n3\nCodec (SoundStream)\nStage 1\nStage 2\nLow-level (w2v-BERT)\nHigh-level (MuLan)\nLinear \nregression\nLow-level (w2v-BERT)\nfMRI response\nSoundStream\ndecoder\nGenerated music\nMusicLM\nHigh-level (MuLan)\nFigure 2: Visual representation of MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) in the context for fMRI\ndecoding.

The process begins with an fMRI response, captured from a test subject exposed to music.\nIt is subsequently mapped to a 128-dimensional MuLan embedding via linear regression. The first\nstage of MusicLM then refines the MuLan embedding into low-level representation of w2v-BERT\ntokens with temporal information. The subsequent stage, informed by both the output of the previous\nstage and the MuLan embedding, generates tokens for the SoundStream audio codec.

Several exemplar captions and the instructions given to the raters are in Section A.4. In this\npaper, the captions are used to study how purely semantic, text-derived embeddings relate to brain\nactivity induced by the corresponding music stimuli.\n3.2\nMULAN AND MUSICLM\nMuLan (Huang et al., 2022) is a joint text/music embedding model consisting of two towers, one\nfor text (MuLantext) and one for music (MuLanmusic). The text tower is a BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nmodel pre-trained on a large text corpus. For the audio tower we use the ResNet-50 (He et al., 2015)\nvariant. MuLan\u2019s training objective is to minimize a contrastive loss between the 128-dimensional\nembeddings produced by each tower for an example pair of aligned music and text. For example,\nthe embedding of a rock song\u2019s waveform is supposed to be close to the embedding of the text rock\nmusic and far from calming violin solo. In this paper, if we refer to a MuLan embedding we mean by\ndefault the embedding of the music tower.\nMusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) is a conditional music generation model. Conditioning signals\ninclude \u2013 but are not limited to \u2013 text, other music, and melody. In our decoding pipeline MusicLM\nis conditioned on a MuLan embedding which we compute based on an fMRI response. Figure 2\nvisualizes the components of MusicLM. Music is generated in two consecutive stages. The first\nstage learns to map a MuLan embedding to a sequence of w2v-BERT tokens. These tokens used in\nMusicLM are extracted from a w2v-BERT (Chung et al., 2021) model\u2019s activations in the 7th layer,\nby clustering them with k-means.\nMusicLM\u2019s second stage maps the w2v-BERT tokens from the first stage and the MuLan embedding\nto acoustic tokens. These stem from a SoundStream (Zeghidour et al., 2021a) model\u2019s residual vector\nquantizer. The resulting tokens are converted back into audio using a SoundStream decoder. As in\nAudioLM (Borsos et al., 2022), the second stage is split into a coarse and fine modeling stage. All\nthree stages are implemented as Transformer models.\n3.3\nDECODING: RECONSTRUCTING MUSIC FROM FMRI\nWith decoding we refer to attempting the reconstruction of the original stimuli (to which a test\nsubject was exposed) based on their recorded brain activity. This process, shown in Figure 1, can\n4\nTable 1: Different embeddings and their properties: d denotes the embedding dimensionality. r is the\nnumber of embeddings we compute per 15s music clip, when we advance the given window with\na step size of 1.5s. We also provide the original frequency of the embeddings as provided by the\nmodels. After averaging across the given time window for SoundStream and w2v-BERT embeddings,\nthe frequency becomes 0.67 Hz for all models, given our step size of 1.5s. For a comparison, we\nalso include properties of the fMRI data of subject 1 (for which d are the dimensions of the top 6\nmost-correlated ROIs when predicting MuLanmusic embeddings).\nEmbedding\nd\nr\nOriginal freq.

For\nsubject 1 it is around 60k. Our prediction targets are the music embeddings of the stimulus (e.g.,\nMuLan), T \u2208 Rn\u00d7r\u00d7demb, with r being the number of embeddings computed per 15s clip (which\ndepends on the embedding model\u2019s window size and the constant step size of 1.5s by which we\nadvance this window). Table 1 lists the embeddings, derived from models present in MusicLM, that\nwe are considering as candidate music embeddings in the Brain2Music architecture from Figure 1.\nTo align R and T along the time dimension, we average entries in R in a sliding-window fashion to\nmatch the time ranges for which feature vectors in T were computed. For example, to predict the\nMuLan embedding ranging from 0s to 10s (due to MuLan\u2019s window size being 10s) we rely on the\naverage of five fMRI scans (from 0-1.5s, 1.5-3s, ..., 9s-10.5). This leaves us with m := n \u00d7 r pairs of\nresponse and target, which we split following Nakai et al. (2022). We model the relationship between\nmusic embeddings and responses with weight matrix W \u2208 Rdfmri\u00d7demb:\n\u02c6T = RW .\n(1)\nWe use an L2-regularized linear regression to estimate W on the training dataset. Note that there is\nno generalization between different subjects, because of anatomical differences. For each subject and\ntarget dimension, the regression regularization hyperparameter is tuned with five-fold cross validation\non the training dataset, while a test split is held out for later evaluation. Details are in Appendix A.1.2.\nThe training is independently performed for each anatomically defined region of interest (ROI) from\nthe Destrieux atlas (Destrieux et al., 2010). An ROI is a group of voxels. From all 150 ROIs we select\nthe top nROIs = 6 with the highest correlation scores (as determined via cross-validation) and create\nan ensemble model by averaging their predictions. Concretely that leaves us with ROIs varying in\nsize3. The median across all subjects is 138.5 voxels; the average is 258.6 voxels. Although the exact\nlocation of the ROIs chosen for each subject vary, for all subjects, ROIs are chosen primarily from\nthe auditory cortex. For a given 15s music stimulus we predict r many embeddings (depending on\nthe chosen embedding type).\nMusic retrieval and music reconstruction.\nWe explore two different approaches to derive the\noriginal stimulus from the prediction \u02c6T namely retrieving similar music from an existing music corpus\nand generating music with MusicLM.\nFor the retrieval we compute the MuLan embeddings for the first 15s of every music clip in the Free\nMusic Archive (FMA) (Defferrard et al., 2017). Unless stated otherwise, we use the large variant\n3ROI sizes vary between subjects. The top six ROIs of subject 1, for example, which are the most predictive\nof MuLan embeddings, have the dimensionalities 61, 70, 109, 218, 296, and 706.\n5\nwhich contains a wide range of diverse music; concretely, 106,574 music tracks from 161 unbalanced\ngenres. The retrieved music is the audio of the clip whose embeddings are the closest to the predicted\none as measured by the cosine similarity.\nAlternatively, we can generate the music by conditioning the MusicLM model (a high-level overview\nis in Section 3.2) on the predicted embeddings. The model can then be used to generate music\nconditionally. To condition MusicLM we average the r = 4 predicted MuLan embeddings along the\ntime dimension. This is not strictly necessary, but we empirically found the generated outputs to be\nmore stable compared to a version in which we provided all four embeddings to the model.\nThe two methods, retrieval and generation, have different advantages and disadvantages. The retrieval\napproach constrains the faithfulness by its limited size. The predicted embedding could potentially\ncontain rich information about the song which is partially lost by mapping it onto its nearest neighbor\nin the dataset. The generative model, on the other hand, can in theory generate any kind of music\ncovered by its training distribution, making it conceptually more powerful. That includes tracks\nwhich are not training examples (e.g., combinations of musical concepts). A disadvantage of this\nmethod is that the generation model may not adhere precisely to the provided embedding.\nEvaluation metrics.\nFollowing the decoding literature (Takagi & Nishimoto, 2022; Park et al.,\n2023), we compute an identification accuracy of the predicted d-dimensional embeddings with\nrespect to their target embeddings. Assume there is a matrix of predicted embeddings P \u2208 Rn\u00d7d and\na matrix (of equal size) containing target embeddings T . Let C \u2208 Rn\u00d7n be computed from P and\nT , specifically Ci,j is Pearson correlation coefficient between i-th row of P and j-th row of T . The\nidentification accuracy for the i-th prediction is defined as:\nid acci =\n1\nn \u2212 1\nn\nX\nj=1\n1 [Ci,i > Ci,j] .\n(2)\nThe identification accuracy for all examples is simply the average:\nid acc = 1\nn\nn\nX\ni=1\nid acci .\n(3)\nThis score, ranging from 0 to 1 with 0.5 indicating performance equivalent to random chance, provides\na quantified measure of how well an embedding was predicted in relation to other embeddings in the\ndataset.\nAn intuitive view on the identification accuracy is that a model with 86% such accuracy, on average,\n14% of the candidates retrieved will score higher, i.e., have a higher correlation coefficient, than the\ncorrect candidate. In a dataset with 60 examples, the average rank of the correct music clip would be\n0.14 \u00d7 60 \u2248 8.\nAs a second metric we also use top-n class agreement based on the LEAF (Zeghidour et al., 2021b)\nclassifier operating on AudioSet classes (Gemmeke et al., 2017). In this context, we compute the per-\nclass probabilities for original and reconstructed music. We then look at three groups of music-related\nclasses, namely genres, instruments, and moods. For each group we compute the top-n agreement\nmeasuring how much overlap there is between the top-n most probable class labels computed for\noriginal and reconstruction. The full list of AudioSet class names in each group is in Appendix A.1.3.\n3.4\nENCODING: WHOLE-BRAIN VOXEL-WISE MODELING\nTo interpret the internal representations of MusicLM, we examine the correspondence between them\nand recorded brain activity. More specifically, we build whole-brain voxel-wise encoding models\nto predict fMRI signals using different music embeddings occurring in MusicLM: audio-derived\nembeddings (MuLanmusic and w2v-BERT-avg), and text-derived embeddings (MuLantext).\nWe first build encoding models to predict voxel activity from the audio-derived embeddings:\nMuLanmusic and w2v-BERT-avg. We compare how they are represented differently in the human\nbrain.\nNext, we build encoding models using audio-derived MuLanmusic and text-derived MuLantext embed-\ndings to predict fMRI signals. This allows us to explore the differences between these two types\n6\nof embeddings. The text-derived embeddings are particularly interesting to study, because they can\n\u2013 by definition \u2013 only represent the high-level information contained in the music caption they are\ncomputed from. The MuLantext embeddings we use have a 1:1 correspondence to GTZAN clips and\nare computed by inferring MuLan\u2019s text tower (a fine-tuned BERT model) for a given GTZAN clip\u2019s\ntext caption. Caption examples are in Section A.4.\nFinally, we conduct a control analysis to determine whether MuLanmusic encompasses more than\ngenre information. To accomplish this, we compare the prediction performance of the MuLanmusic\nmodel versus one-hot vectors of music genre for each GTZAN clip.\nThe training data preparation is done in the same manner as in the decoding (outlined in Section 3.3).\nThe modeling problem is inverse to Equation 1, i.e., fMRI responses are predicted based on different\nembeddings.\nModel weights are estimated from training data using L2-regularized linear regression, and subse-\nquently applied to test data. We estimate weights of the model from training data, and regularization\nparameters are explored during the training using five-fold cross-validation. For evaluation, we\nuse Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between predicted and measured fMRI signals. We compute\nstatistical significance by comparing the estimated correlations to the null distribution of correlations\nbetween two independent Gaussian random vectors of the same length of the test data. We set the\nthreshold for statistical significance at P < 0.05, and corrected for multiple comparisons using the\nFDR procedure. For MuLantext and one-hot music genre vectors, we perform up-sampling to match\nMuLanmusic\u2019s sampling rate.\n4\nRESULTS\n4.1\nDECODING (FMRI TO MUSIC)\nMusic embedding prediction.\nGoing from fMRI to music requires the prediction of an intermediate\nmusic representation, that is, selecting the music embedding to use in Figure 1. In our architecture,\nthe choice of the music embedding represents a bottleneck for the subsequent music generation: Only\nif we can predict music embeddings close to music embeddings of the original stimulus heard by the\nsubject, will we be able to generate music that is similar to the original stimulus with MusicLM. The\nreconstruction quality is further constrained by what the embedding can capture.\nResults obtained when predicting different embedding types are reported in Table 2. We find that\nMuLanmusic embeddings can be more accurately predicted from fMRI signals than MuLantext, w2v-\nBERT-avg, or SoundStream-avg embeddings. When predicting MuLanmusic embeddings, we observe\nthe highest correlation as well as the highest identification accuracy. Three reasons may contribute\nto this: (1) The MuLantext and MuLanmusic embeddings, based on their properties mentioned in\nTable 1, may be more closely aligned to the high level of abstraction represented in the fMRI data\nthan the other embedding types. (2) The heuristics we applied to align w2v-BERT and SoundStream\nembeddings to the fMRI data may not be optimal and may require further analysis. (3) MuLanmusic\nembeddings have access to more musical information than MuLantext embeddings because they are\ncomputed from the audio signal.\nBased on this finding, in the remainder of this section, we use the fMRI data to predict MuLanmusic\nembeddings (for brevity referred to as MuLan embeddings) and use them to reconstruct the orig-\ninal stimulus. However, we include w2v-BERT-avg in the evaluation and the encoding analysis\n(Section 3.4) to provide a comparison between two embeddings of different semantic level.\nQualitative reconstruction results.\nThe two ways of reconstructing music which we compare\nare retrieval from FMA and generation with MusicLM. Figure 3 contains qualitative results for\nsubject 1, comparing the original stimulus to music retrieved from FMA based on a predicted MuLan\nembedding and the music clips sampled from MusicLM. Note that sampling multiple clips and\nexamining their differences is one way of qualitatively determining which information MusicLM\nadds to what the MuLan embedding contains. We find that both retrieved and generated constructions\nare semantically similar to the original stimulus, e.g., with respect to genre, vocal style, overall mood.\nThe temporal structure of the stimulus is often not preserved in the reconstruction. There are also\nfailure cases in which the reconstruction is from an entirely different genre.\n7\nTable 2: Comparison of different music embedding prediction targets (fMRI-to-embedding). The\nreported error is the standard deviation across five test subjects. We provide metrics on the test dataset,\nwhich represent the main results of this table, together with their respective values on the training\ndataset. Identification accuracy and correlation are computed between embeddings of GTZAN audio\n(computed with the embedding model listed in the respective row) and the embeddings predicted by\nthe regression model. An analysis of the regression regularization hyperparameter tuning, which is\ncritical to avoid overfitting, can be found in Appendix A.1.2.\nEmbedding\nIdentification accuracy\nCorrelation\nTest\nTrain\nTest\nTrain\nSoundStream-avg\n0.674 \u00b1 0.016\n0.764 \u00b1 0.029\n0.184 \u00b1 0.020\n0.255 \u00b1 0.009\nw2v-BERT-avg\n0.837 \u00b1 0.005\n0.941 \u00b1 0.007\n0.113 \u00b1 0.003\n0.167 \u00b1 0.006\nMuLantext\n0.817 \u00b1 0.014\n0.877 \u00b1 0.009\n0.181 \u00b1 0.012\n0.245 \u00b1 0.009\nMuLanmusic\n0.876 \u00b1 0.015\n0.992 \u00b1 0.003\n0.307 \u00b1 0.016\n0.538 \u00b1 0.023\nFigure 3: Spectrograms of different music clips: The left-most column contains the stimulus which\nsubjects were exposed to. To the right is the music retrieved from FMA and three clips sampled from\nMusicLM. Both generation and retrieval are done via MuLan embeddings. It is visually perceptible\nthat spectrograms in the same row resemble similarities. Audio examples (randomly sampled, one\nper genre) can be found at google-research.github.io/seanet/brain2music#ret-vs-gen\nIn Figure A.2 we perform a comparison of retrieval and generation across the five different subjects.\nThe main finding is that qualitatively, the reconstruction is overall of consistent quality across all five\nsubjects. This is not necessarily a given, when dealing with fMRI data, because of differences in\nsubjective experiences, and suggests our method is robust.\nQuantitative reconstruction evaluation.\nFigure 4 shows the main quantitative results. We use\ntwo quantitative measures to evaluate the similarity of reconstructed music and original stimulus:\nidentification accuracy (for two embeddings of different semantic level of abstraction) and AudioSet\ntop-n class agreement.\nThe quality limit imposed by retrieval from FMA is estimated via an oracle predictor. It simply\nbypasses the linear regression and instead retrieves an FMA clip based on the original music stimulus\u2019\nMuLan embedding. It simulates the retrieval performance we would achieve if our fMRI to MuLan\nprediction was perfect. Performance achieved by a model sampling randomly from FMA is indicated\nby the chance result in the plots.\nOverall we observe significant above-chance performance on all metrics, establishing strong support\nfor our ability to extract musical information from the fMRI scans. The identification accuracy\ncomparison across different embedding types hints at our reconstruction to be most faithful to the\noriginal stimulus with respect to high-level semantic features as captured by MuLan. While this\nmight seem unsurprising, given MuLan is the target embedding of our prediction, it is not necessarily\ngranted that high-level semantic information about perceived music is contained in the recorded brain\nresponse in the first place.\n8\nFigure 4: Main quantitative results of the decoding, i.e., music reconstruction. The dashed, horizontal\nlines (chance) indicate the performance of a random music predictor (sampling from the FMA\ndataset). The dotted lines (oracle) are the oracle performance, corresponding to the performance\nachieved by a regressor which would predict exactly the ground truth MuLan embedding of GTZAN.\nError bars indicate standard error of the mean across five subjects. a Identification accuracy for\ndifferent evaluation embeddings. Identification accuracy computed between the embeddings of the\noriginal stimulus and the embeddings of the reconstruction. For embedding the music we consider\ntwo embedding types. The reconstructed music is more similar to the stimulus it was derived from\nwith respect to high-level embeddings (MuLan) than the low-level w2v-BERT-avg. Differences\nbetween generation and retrieval on FMA large (about 106k clips) are marginal, whereas retrieving\nfrom FMA small (8k clips) is overall worse. b AudioSet top-n class agreement for different groups\nof AudioSet classes. A list of the classes in each group is in Appendix A.1.3. Generation is here\nsignificantly superior to retrieval from FMA (both small and large). The worst performance \u2013 relative\nto chance and oracle \u2013 is attained on the instrument agreement. c Identification accuracy (based\non MuLan embeddings of original and generated music) shown separately for each of the GTZAN\ngenres. The model performance is consistent across all genres.\nWhether or not low-level information is contained in the reconstruction is measured by the identifica-\ntion accuracy on w2v-BERT-avg. Note, however, that the results are confounded by the embedding\naveraging we perform for w2v-BERT to align the temporal resolution of the embeddings with that of\nthe fMRI scans. However, the numbers are in-line with the qualitative observation we make, that is,\nlow-level, acoustic features are relatively not well aligned, whereas the overall music style is.\nWe further observe consistent prediction performance across different genres (as labeled in the\nGTZAN dataset). The highest accuracy is achieved on classical music, which is likely due to its\ndistinctive musical style.\n4.2\nENCODING (BRAIN ACTIVITY PREDICTION)\nComparison between different audio-derived embeddings.\nFigure 5a shows the prediction ac-\ncuracy of the encoding models for different types of audio-derived embeddings of music within\nMusicLM: MuLan and w2v-BERT-avg. MuLan embeddings tend to have higher prediction per-\nformance in the lateral prefrontal cortex than w2v-BERT-avg, suggesting that MuLan captures\nhigh-level music information processed in the human brain. However, when we focus on the auditory\ncortex, both of the embeddings have some degree of correspondence with human brain activity in the\nauditory cortex. Given that the text-music model used in this study was not brain-inspired compared\nto the previous deep learning model such as convolutional neural network, it is intriguing that this\ncorrespondence with the brain emerged. In addition, although each embedding represents different\nlevels of audio-derived embeddings from low (w2v-BERT-avg) to high (MuLan), they predicted\nfairly similar brain regions within the auditory cortex. Figure 5b further confirms that well predicted\nvoxels are largely overlapping between two embeddings. These results suggest that, unlike the visual\ncortex (Takagi & Nishimoto, 2022), there is not as strong of a hierarchical functional differentiation\n9\nFigure 5: a Prediction performance (measured using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients) for the voxel-\nwise encoding model applied to held-out test music on subject 1, projected onto the inflated (top,\nlateral and medial views) and flattened cortical surface (bottom, occipital areas are at the center), for\nboth left and right hemispheres.

Darker colors indicate a higher number of voxels in the corresponding\nbin.\nof audio-derived embeddings in the auditory cortex as previously thought. Note, as we mentioned at\n4.1, that the results are confounded by the embedding averaging we perform for w2v-BERT. Please\nsee also the limitations in Section 5. We provide additional results for all subjects in Figure A.4.\nComparison between audio- and text-derived MuLan embeddings.\nIn the previous analysis,\nwe confirmed that functional differentiation within the auditory cortex is not as strong with respect\nto hierarchical audio-derived embeddings. We next investigate how much text-derived, abstract\ninformation about music is differently represented in the auditory cortex compared to audio-derived\nembeddings.\nFigure 6a shows the prediction performance of the encoding models for MuLantext versus MuLanmusic.\nWe provide additional results for all subjects in Figure A.4. It shows that for some subjects, the\ninner side of the sulcus represents music stronger than outer side. However, there still seems to be\nmodest functional differentiation in the brain. Although these two representations are trained to match\n(Huang et al., 2022), due to the many-to-many nature of text and music pairings the objective cannot\nbe achieved perfectly. We show that, from a neuroscience perspective, MuLanmusic and MuLantext\nactually acquired fairly similar representations. Figure 6b further confirms that well-predicted voxels\nare largely overlapping between two embeddings.\nFigure 6: a Prediction performance on subject 1 for MuLantext model versus MuLanmusic model.\nAll colored voxels P < 0.05, FDR corrected. The area in the red rectangle corresponds to the\nauditory cortex. b Density plot of the MuLanmusic (x-axis) versus MuLantext (y-axis) model prediction\naccuracy.\n4.3\nGENERALIZATION BEYOND MUSIC GENRE\nWe next investigate whether our model can generalize to the music genre that was not used during\ntraining. To do so, we ablate one genre during training and determine the identification accuracy on\n10\nFigure 7: a Comparison of identification accuracy between the model trained and tested using full\ndata, as shown in Figure 4 (full) and those models trained with one-genre-out ablation data and tested\non the ablated genre (ablation). b Comparing prediction performance obtained by MuLanmusic and\none-hot genre representation on subject 1. For display purposes, only the voxels where the prediction\nperformance of both models is greater than 0.4 (almost all of which are within the auditory cortex)\nare colored.\nclips of the held-out genre (from the test set). Figure 7a shows that our model performs significantly\nabove chance on the unseen music genres. This suggests that our reconstruction method is generalizing\nbeyond the genres present in the training data.\nWe further compare the prediction performances of the MuLanmusic and genre models to test whether\nour encoding model captures information beyond music genres. We find that, compared to the music\ngenres vectors, the MuLanmusic embeddings predict activity in the auditory cortex more broadly and\nwith higher accuracy (Figure 7b). This is another piece of evidence that our model might predict\nbeyond the music genre information. We provide additional results for all subjects in Figure A.5.\n5\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nLimitations.\nThe powerful music generation model we use converts a MuLan embedding into\nmusic. Information that is not contained in the embedding, but required to produce a music clip, is\nadded by the model. In the retrieval case, it is even guaranteed that the reconstruction is musical,\nbecause it is directly pulled from a dataset of music. While this leads to impressive, human-digestible\nresults, it also suggests a higher level of reconstruction quality than there may be.\nThe main three factors limiting the reconstruction quality are:\n1. how much information we can extract with linear regression from the fMRI data,\n2. what the chosen music embedding \u2013 in our case MuLan \u2013 can capture, and\n3. the limitations of the music retrieval (dataset size and diversity) or generation (generative\nmodel capabilities).\nIn the encoding analysis in Section 4.2 we investigate the limitations of (1 + 2) together by predicting\nbrain activity for different embedding types. We disentangle (2 + 3) from (1) by showing the\nmaximum attainable performance as an oracle dashed-line in Figure 4. It shows, for example, that\ntop-1 class agreement on moods cannot exceed 78% given the MuLan embedding and FMA retrieval\ndataset choice. To observe the variability of (3), we experiment with three different reconstruction\nprocesses, i.e., two sizes of FMA for retrieval and a generative model. Further investigation of (1),\n(2), and (3) remains an open challenge.\n11\nThe coarse temporal sampling rate of fMRI (1.5s, in the present study) is a limitation of the present\nstudy. However, it is noteworthy that even at the fMRI sampling rate of 2.5s, Santoro et al. (2017)\nshowed temporal specificity at 200ms by using multi-voxel patterns. Different voxels might have\ninformation about different frequency bands, which may collectively contribute to this result. How\nmuch information can actually be retrieved from fMRI is a subject for future research (see Nishimoto\net al. (2011) for reconstructing perceived natural movies from fMRI data using frequency-decomposed\nvoxel-wise representations).\nThe terminology music reconstruction may suggest there is a direct reconstruction loss between music\nstimuli and reconstructed music. This is \u2013 given the limited amount of data \u2013 clearly not feasible in\nour setup. We refer to the overall system as a music reconstruction, whereas one might argue that\nthe reconstruction target is actually MuLan. There is currently no clear path to end-to-end music\nreconstruction with fMRI data.\nLastly, the temporal averaging of SoundStream and w2v-BERT embeddings likely worsens their\nexpressiveness. The role which the embeddings of these models play in MusicLM, differs from\ntheir application here, in terms of the temporal resolution, which we indicate by adding the suffix\n\u201c-avg\u201d to them whenever the averaged version is used. Determining which information they contain\npost-averaging and, orthogonally, evaluating on further measures of music similarity are next steps.\nThis applies to our encoding and decoding studies alike.\nFuture work.\nWe perform music reconstruction from fMRI signals that were recorded while human\nsubjects were listening to music stimuli through headphones. An exciting next step is to attempt\nthe reconstruction of music or musical attributes from a subject\u2019s imagination. In such a setting a\nsubject imagines a music clip they know well and the decoding analysis examines how faithfully the\nimagination can be reconstructed. This has not been explored yet and would qualify for an actual\nmind reading label.\nComparing the reconstruction properties among a diverse subjects with different musical expertise is\nanother possible direction of exploration. Comparing, for example, the reconstruction quality between\nsubjects who are professional conductors or musicians and subjects with barely any self-reported\nmusic experience could give insights into differences in subjective perception.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nWith Brain2Music we explored the exciting research direction of reconstructing music from recorded\nhuman brain activity. By conditioning MusicLM on a dense music embedding predicted from fMRI\ndata, we were able to generate music which resembles the original music stimuli on a semantic level.\nWe also investigated the connection between a text-to-music model and the human brain in a\nquantitative manner by constructing an encoding model. Specifically, we assessed where and to what\nextent high-level semantic information and low-level acoustic features of music are represented in the\nhuman brain. Although text-to-music models are rapidly developing, their internal processes are still\npoorly understood. This study is the first to provide a quantitative interpretation from a biological\nperspective.\nGiven the nascent stage of music generation models, this work is just a first step. Future work may\nimprove the temporal alignment between reconstruction and stimulus or explore the reconstruction of\nmusic from pure imagination.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Aren Jansen for his review of a draft of this paper.

(2022) in a same fashion as\nNakai et al. (2021), recited below. Motion correction is performed for each run using the Statistical\nParametric Mapping toolbox (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK;\nfil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). All volumes are aligned to the first EPI image for each participant. Low-\nfrequency drift is removed using a median filter with a 240s window. To augment model fitting\naccuracy, the response for each voxel is normalized by subtracting the mean response and then scaling\nit to the unit variance. We use FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999) to identify the cortical surfaces from the\nanatomical data and register them with the voxels of the functional data. We use only cortical voxels\nas targets of the analysis for each participant. For each participant, we use the voxels identified in the\ncerebral cortex in the analysis (53,421 to 64,700 voxels per participant).\nA.1.2\nHYPERPARAMETER TUNING\nWe use a ridge regression to estimate our model parameters. Citing the himalaya documentation5:\nLet X \u2208 Rn\u00d7p be a feature matrix with n samples and p features, y \u2208 Rn a target vector, and \u03b1 > 0\na fixed regularization hyperparameter. Ridge regression (Hoerl & Kennard, 1970) defines the weight\nvector b\u2217 \u2208 Rp as:\nb\u2217 = arg minb\u2225Xb \u2212 y\u22252\n2 + \u03b1\u2225b\u22252\n2 .\n(4)\nThe equation has a closed-form solution b\u2217 = My, where M = (X\u22a4X + \u03b1Ip)\u22121X\u22a4 \u2208 Rp\u00d7n.\nTo determine \u03b1 we run 5-fold cross-validation on the training data. Note that there is one \u03b1 parameter\nper regression target, i.e., 128 in our case when predicting MuLan embeddings. We inspect the\nperformance on training and evaluation data around the chosen \u03b1 vector \u201c\u03b1 (opt)\u201d in Figure A.1.\nFigure A.1: Performance of the regressor when trained with \u03b1 values in the neighborhood of the \u03b1\nthat was determined to be optimal on the training split via cross-validation. The model starts to overfit\nwith lower values of \u03b1 (to the left) and underfits in the opposite direction. The plot is computed for a\nmodel predicting MuLan embeddings for subject 1.\n4Download link: openneuro.org/datasets/ds003720\n5gallantlab.org/himalaya/models.html#ridge\n16\nA.1.3\nAUDIOSET CLASS GROUPS\nIn our AudioSet evaluation metric we compute the overlap of the top-n most likely classes (between\nreconstructed and original music) in three different groups. The groups and the n choice are genres\n(top-2), instruments (top-2), and moods (top-1).\nBelow is a list of the AudioSet class names of each group:\nGenres (top-2): Pop music, Hip hop music, Rock music, Rhythm and blues, Soul music, Reggae, Country, Funk,\nFolk music, Middle Eastern music, Jazz, Disco, Classical music, Electronic music, Music of Latin America,\nBlues, Music for children, New-age music, Vocal music, Music of Africa, Christian music, Music of Asia, Ska,\nTraditional music, Independent music\nInstruments (top-2): Plucked string instrument, Keyboard (musical), Percussion, Orchestra, Brass instrument,\nBowed string instrument, Wind instrument, woodwind instrument, Harp, Choir, Bell, Harmonica, Accordion,\nBagpipes, Didgeridoo, Shofar, Theremin, Singing bowl, Scratching (performance technique)\nMoods (top-1): Happy music, Sad music, Tender music, Exciting music, Angry music, Scary music\nA.2\nADDITIONAL RESULTS OF THE DECODING\nFigure A.2: The comparison shows the spectrograms of music retrieved or generated for dif-\nferent test subjects, who were all exposed to the same stimuli.\nThe predicted embedding\nis MuLan.\nAudio examples (randomly sampled, one per genre) can be found at google-\nresearch.github.io/seanet/brain2music#all-subjects\n17\nA.3\nADDITIONAL RESULTS OF ENCODING\nWe present additional results for all subjects in Figures A.3, A.4, and A.5 for Figures 5, 6, and 7. They show that\nour results are robust across subjects.\nFigure A.3: a All subject results for comparing prediction performances between different audio-\nderived embeddings: MuLanmusic and w2v-BERT-avg. b Density plot of the MuLanmusic (x-axis)\nversus w2v-BERT-avg (y-axis) model prediction accuracy.

Many voxels are better predicted by MuLanmusic than genre.\n20\nA.4\nTEXT CAPTION DATASET\nWe release a text caption dataset6 for the 540 GTZAN music clips (15s crop) for which fMRI data as recorded.\nThe captions were collected with the online freelance platform coconala.com by human raters, all of which are\nmusic professionals (musician, teacher, composer). The instruction given to the raters is:\nWe have numerous 15-second clips for which we\u2019d like you to provide a written description of about four\nsentences in Japanese (or English). By written description, we mean something that includes an explanation\nor impression of the music piece, as demonstrated in the following example: \u201cThis is a Drum & Bass track. It\nfeatures high-speed scratching from a turntable and includes sampled screams. You can hear a sinister tune\nbeing played by the synthesizer. The rhythmic backdrop is composed of fast electronic drum beats. This track\nseems like it could be used as a soundtrack for a car racing game.\u201d\nBelow are ten example captions; one per genre. A table with audio and captions side by side is at google-\nresearch.github.io/seanet/brain2music#gtzan-caps\nblues.00017: It is lazy blues with a laid-back tempo and relaxed atmosphere. The band structure is simple, with\nthe background rhythm punctuated by bass and guitar cutting. The impressive phrasing of the lead guitar gives\nthe piece a nostalgic impression.\nclassical.00008: Several violins play the melody. The melody is simple and almost unison, but it moves between\nminor and major keys and changes expression from one to the other.\ncountry.00012: This is a classic country song. You can hear clear singing and crisp acoustic guitar cutting. The\nwood bass provides a solid groove with a two-beat rhythm. This is country music at its best. Ideal for nature\nscenes and homely atmospheres.\ndisco.00004: This music piece has a disco sound. Vocals and chorus create extended harmonies. The synthesiser\ncreates catchy melodies, while the drumming beats rhythmically. Effective tambourine sounds accentuate the\nrhythms and add further dynamism. This music is perfect for dance parties, club floors and other scenes of\ndancing and fun.\nhiphop.00014: This is a rap-rock piece with a lot of energy. The distorted guitars are impressive and provide an\nenergetic sound. The bass is an eight beat, creating a dynamic groove. The drums provide the backbone of the\nrhythm section with their powerful hi-hats. The vocal and chorus interaction conveys tension and passion and\ndraws the audience in.\njazz.00040: This is medium-tempo old jazz with female vocals. The band is a small band similar to a Dixie Jazz\nformation, including clarinet, trumpet and trombone. The vocal harmonies are supported by a piano and brass\nensemble on a four beat with drums and bass.\nmetal.00026: This is a metal instrumental piece with technical guitar solos and distortion effects. The heavy,\npowerful bass creates a sense of speed, and the snare, bass and guitar create a sense of unity in unison at the\nend. It is full of over-the-top playing techniques and intense energy.\npop.00032: Passionate pops piece with clear sound and female vocals. The synth accompaniment spreads out\npleasantly and the tight bass grooves along. The beat-oriented drums drive the rhythm, creating a strong and\nlively feeling. Can be used as background music in caf\u00b4es and lounges to create a relaxed atmosphere.\nreggae.00013: This reggae piece combines smooth, melodic vocals with a clear, high-pitched chorus. The bass\nis swingy and supports the rhythm, while whistles and samplers of life sounds can be heard. It is perfect for\nrelaxing situations, such as reading in a laid-back caf\u00b4e or strolling around town.\nrock.00032: This rock piece is characterised by its extended vocals. The guitar plays scenically, while the bass\nenhances the melody with rhythmic fills. The drums add dynamic rhythms to the whole piece. This music is ideal\nfor scenes with a sense of expansiveness and freedom, such as mountainous terrain with spectacular natural\nscenery or driving scenes on the open road.\n6kaggle.com/datasets/nishimotolab/music-caption-brain2music\n21\n"

However, previous studies have mainly fo-\ncused on coarse-grained evaluation (i.e.\noverall preference-based evaluation),\nwhich limits interpretability since it does not consider the nature of user instruc-\ntions that require instance-wise skill composition. In this paper, we introduce\nFLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment SKill\nSets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based\nevaluation which decomposes coarse-level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for\neach instruction. We experimentally observe that the fine-graininess of evaluation\nis crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the\nreliability of the evaluation. Using FLASK, we compare multiple open-source\nand proprietary LLMs and observe a high correlation between model-based and\nhuman-based evaluations1.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown an impressive capability of following user instructions\nby aligning to human values, such as responding in a helpful, honest, and harmless manner (Ouyang\net al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a;b; Kim et al., 2023c; Korbak et al., 2023; Askell et al., 2021). In\nparticular, techniques such as instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF) have significantly improved this ability by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM on diverse tasks or\nuser preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). However, evaluating\nthe alignment of LLMs to human values is challenging for two reasons. First, open-ended user\ninstructions usually require a composition of multiple abilities, which makes measurement with a\nsingle metric insufficient. Second, since these instructions are task-agnostic, the required abilities\noften vary from one instance to another, making it impractical to use a fixed set of metrics.\nCurrently, the evaluation of LLMs primarily relies on multiple independent benchmarks using au-\ntomatic metrics (accuracy, ROUGE, etc.) or overall scoring to the model response based on human\nor model-based preference (Longpre et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023b; Ouyang et al., 2022; Zheng\net al., 2023). However, both evaluation settings are insufficient. Benchmarks that adopt multiple\nmetrics are not scalable since each of them targets different skills, domains, and difficulties such as\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) for logical correctness, and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) for truth-\nfulness. Also, relying on these automatic metrics limits interpretability and reliability because only\ntask-wise analysis is possible and automatic metrics are sensitive to surface forms (Krishna et al.,\n2021). Moreover, merely assigning a single score based on preferences does not tell the whole story\nbecause there could be multiple axes to evaluate the response, such as completeness, factuality, etc.\nInstead, we need to evaluate the model\u2019s performance using fine-grained criteria to comprehend the\nmodel from various perspectives. Although many recent works have studied multi-metric or fine-\ngrained evaluation of LLMs, they mainly focus on a fixed metric set across instances for specific\ntasks, which is not applicable to the task-agnostic evaluation setting for LLM alignment (Liu et al.,\n2023; Liang et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022; Min et al., 2023; Krishna et al., 2023).\n\u2217 Denotes equal contribution.

(b) Fine-grained evaluation of FLASK first annotates fine-grained metadata for each instruction and\nconducts evaluation by assigning a score to each skill based on skill-specific or instance-specific score rubrics.\nTo address the limitations of current evaluation settings, we propose FLASK (Fine-grained\nLanguage Model Evaluation based on Alignment SKill Sets), a novel evaluation protocol that adopts\na fine-grained scoring setup, enabling task-agnostic skill evaluation aligned with the provided in-\nstructions. We define 4 primary abilities which are divided into 12 fine-grained skills for compre-\nhensive language model evaluation: Logical Thinking (Logical Correctness, Logical Robust-\nness, Logical Efficiency), Background Knowledge (Factuality, Commonsense Understanding),\nProblem Handling (Comprehension, Insightfulness, Completeness, Metacognition), and User\nAlignment (Conciseness, Readability, Harmlessness). First, we collect a total of 1,740 evaluation\ninstances from various NLP datasets and annotate the relevant set of skills (a skill set), domains, and\nthe difficulty level for each instance. Then, evaluators assign scores ranging from 1 to 5 for each\nannotated skill based on the reference answer and skill-specific scoring rubrics, where the evaluators\ncould be human evaluators or state-of-the-art LLMs2. For the 89 instances that are labeled to be most\ndifficult (FLASK-HARD), we additionally introduce adopting even a more fine-grained evaluation\nby using instance-specific rubrics. The overall illustration is shown in Figure 1.\nBy applying FLASK, we compare and analyze various open-source and proprietary LLMs depend-\ning on the skill set, target domain, and difficulty. We conduct both human-based and model-based\nevaluations and observe that their results are highly correlated. We experimentally observe that\napplying fine-grained evaluation not only leads to better interpretability but also better reliability,\nincreasing the correlation between human and model evaluation and mitigating the bias of model-\nbased evaluation. Also, by conducting extensive analysis based on automatic model-based evalua-\ntion, we present several findings:\n\u2022 We observe that current open-source LLMs significantly underperform proprietary LLMs for\nLogical Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities.\n\u2022 We observe that some skills such as Logical Correctness and Logical Efficiency require larger\nmodel sizes to effectively acquire them compared to other skills.\n\u2022 We show that even state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs struggle on FLASK-HARD set, up to 50%\nperformance degradation for some skills compared to the whole FLASK evaluation set.\nWe suggest that comprehensive analysis of LLMs through fine-grained evaluation is important and\npractical for both the developers and practitioners. For model developers, FLASK facilitates ac-\ncurate interpretation of the model\u2019s current state, providing clear guidance for improving model\nalignment. For practitioners, FLASK\u2019s fine-grained comparison of different LLMs helps recom-\nmend suitable models for specific situations.\n2\nRELATED WORKS\nHolistic Evaluation of LLMs\nHolistic evaluation of LLMs is crucial for assessing model\nstrengths, weaknesses, and potential risks (Shevlane et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gehrmann et al.,\n2022; Chia et al., 2023; Laskar et al., 2023). To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LLMs,\n2We provide further discussions of using LLMs as evaluators in Appendix D.2.\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nmany works have assessed models on multiple independent benchmarks using automated metrics,\nsuch as accuracy for knowledge/reasoning tasks or ROUGE for long-form text generation (Chung\net al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Suzgun et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022c; Gao et al., 2021; Zhong\net al., 2023). To assess multiple aspects of the model response, multi-metric evaluation settings have\nbeen proposed, providing a more comprehensive perspective of the model performance beyond ac-\ncuracy (Liang et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022).\nFurthermore, to faithfully evaluate LLMs on tasks such as fact verification or summarization, recent\nworks have proposed fine-grained atomic evaluation settings (Min et al., 2023; Krishna et al., 2023).\nEspecially, Wu et al. (2023a); Lightman et al. (2023) show that fine-grained evaluation of model\nresponses could be utilized for better rewards. In FLASK, we adopt an instance-wise fine-grained\nmulti-metric setting, which distinguishes it from previous works and is more applicable to evaluate\nthe general capabilities of LLMs.\nAlignment of LLMs\nAligning pre-trained LLMs to human values can be achieved through dif-\nferent fine-tuning techniques such as supervised instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF). For instruction tuning, various techniques have shown effectiveness such\nas task and model scaling (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022c; Chung et al.,\n2022), dataset distillation (Chiang et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Dettmers et al.,\n2023; Geng et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), instruction generation (Ye et al.,\n2022b; Honovich et al., 2022b), data augmentation through model-generated response (Wang et al.,\n2022b; Honovich et al., 2022a; Kim et al., 2023b), multilingual instruction tuning (Muennighoff\net al., 2022) or in-context instruction learning (Ye et al., 2023a). For RLHF, techniques such as\ntraining on synthetic feedback (Bai et al., 2022b; Kim et al., 2023c) or applying reinforcement\nlearning during pretraining (Korbak et al., 2023) have shown to better control the model\u2019s response\nto make LLMs aligned to human values. However, a comprehensive comparison between various\nuser-aligned models trained with different techniques is yet to be studied in sufficient detail.\n3\nFLASK: FINE-GRAINED LANGUAGE MODEL EVALUATION PROTOCOL\nWe introduce FLASK, a fine-grained skill set-based evaluation protocol for assessing the alignment\nof language models. We define 4 primary abilities, divided into 12 skills, that are necessary to follow\nuser instructions in a desirable manner (Section 3.1). We specify the process of the evaluation dataset\nconstruction (Section 3.2) and the evaluation process (Section 3.3). Additionally, for a challenging\nscenario, we introduce FLASK-HARD (Section 3.4). The illustration of the overall process is shown\nin Figure 21 in the Appendix. We emphasize that applying instance-wise multi-metric evaluation\nis what mainly distinguishes our work from previous evaluation settings, enabling task-agnostic\nevaluation. In this work, we consider two types of evaluators: human evaluators and EVAL LM, one\nof the state-of-the-art LLMs used for evaluation.\n3.1\nSKILL SET CATEGORIZATION\nBuilding on previous research in language model evaluation, (Sugawara & Aizawa, 2016; Sugawara\net al., 2017; Radziwill & Benton, 2017; Schlegel et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2021), we aim to develop\na comprehensive taxonomy for assessing the performance of LLMs. This taxonomy is designed as\na systematic framework to categorize the essential skills for understanding and responding to a\nwide range of single-turn English instructions. Based on the skill categorization of Rogers et al.\n(2021) which was specifically proposed for question answering and reading comprehension, we\nrecategorize skills suitable for LLM alignment. Our proposed categorization includes four primary\nabilities, each of which is further divided into 2-4 skills, resulting in a total of 12 skills:\n\u2022 Logical Thinking refers to the ability to apply reasoning, critical thinking, and deductive\nskills when processing and responding to instructions. In order to do so, models should generate a\nlogically correct final answer (LOGICAL CORRECTNESS) while preserving generalizability during\nthe step-by-step logical process without any contradiction (LOGICAL ROBUSTNESS). Also, the\nlogical process should be efficient and not contain any unnecessary steps (LOGICAL EFFICIENCY).\n\u2022 Background Knowledge comprises the capacity to generate responses by accessing a broad\nrepository of general and domain-specific information. This ability requires the model to provide\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\naccurate and contextually relevant responses to instructions requiring factual (FACTUALITY) or\ncommonsense knowledge (COMMONSENSE UNDERSTANDING).\n\u2022 Problem Handling pertains to the proficiency in addressing challenges that emerge while\nprocessing and responding to user instructions. This category encompasses the capacity to under-\nstand the implicit and explicit purpose and requirements of the instruction (COMPREHENSION),\ndevelop creative perspectives or interpretations of the instruction (INSIGHTFULNESS), handle the\ninstruction by providing in-depth and in-breadth information (COMPLETENESS), and be aware of\nits own capability to answer the instruction (METACOGNITION).\n\u2022 User Alignment represents the ability to empathize with the user and align its responses to the\nuser\u2019s intentions, preferences, and expectations. This category encompasses the model\u2019s ability to\nstructure the answer to promote the users\u2019 readability (READABILITY), presenting a concise re-\nsponse for the reader without unnecessary information (CONCISENESS), and considering potential\nrisks to user safety (HARMLESSNESS).\nWe ensure that each skill offers a wide range of criteria for a holistic evaluation of various LLMs.\nWe provide the specific definition for each skill in Table 11 in the Appendix.\n3.2\nEVALUATION DATA CONSTRUCTION\nThe process of constructing the evaluation data involves several steps, 1) collecting input-output\npairs from various datasets, 2) modifying the collected instances, and 3) filtering based on length\ncriteria, resulting in a total of 1,740 instances sourced from 122 datasets. We first collect input\n(instruction) and output (reference answer) pairs from various English NLP datasets, both multi-\ntask datasets (e.g. MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020)) and single-task datasets (e.g. GSM8K (Cobbe\net al., 2021)). For single-task datasets, we restrict them to account for at most 20 instances per\ndataset for diversity. After collection, we modify the instances by manually writing instructions for\ndatasets that do not include instructions. Lastly, we remove instances where the input length exceeds\n2048. More details including the list of source datasets are provided in Appendix J.\nFor each evaluation instance, we annotate the metadata which consists of 1) the essential skills to\nfollow the instruction, 2) target domains, and 3) the difficulty level of the instructions. We first\nvalidate that human labelers and EVAL LM have a high correlation for the metadata annotation\non a subset of 200 instances. We have observed a 95.22% acceptance rate for skill annotation, an\n81.32% acceptance rate for domain annotation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.774 for\ndifficulty annotation. Since the model-based annotation has acceptable noise and high correlation\nto human labelers, we utilize the EVAL LM for metadata annotation to reduce the burden of human\nannotations. We provide more details on validating the annotation of EVAL LM in Appendix G.2.\nFor the selection of necessary skills, the EVAL LM selects the top-3 essential skills required to fol-\nlow the instructions for each instance, from the 12 skills defined in Section 3.1. We achieve this\nby providing the EVAL LM with the instruction, reference answer, and descriptions of all 12 skills.\nFor domain annotation, we identify 10 domains: Humanities, Language, Culture, Health, History,\nNatural Science, Math, Social Science, Technology, and Coding by modifying the Wikipedia cate-\ngorization of Reid et al. (2022). Lastly, for difficulty level annotation, we divide the difficulty level\ninto 5 levels based on the extent of required domain knowledge by referencing Webb\u2019s depth of\nknowledge (Webb, 1997; 1999) and NIH proficiency scale3: simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced\nlifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major-level knowledge, and expert-level knowl-\nedge where we map each level into a level from 1 to 5. Details of the metadata annotation process\nare provided in Appendix E and the statistics of the evaluation dataset are provided in Appendix F.\n3.3\nEVALUATION PROCESS\nUtilizing the annotated metadata for each instance, we evaluate and analyze the target model re-\nsponse in a fine-grained manner. Evaluators, either human annotators or EVAL LM, are given the\nevaluation instruction, reference answer, response of the target model, and pre-defined score rubric\nfor each selected skill from Section 3.2. The evaluators assess the target model\u2019s response by as-\nsigning scores ranging from 1 to 5, following skill-specific scoring rubrics, which include detailed\n3hr.nih.gov/working-nih/competencies/competencies-proficiency-scale\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\ndescriptions for each score. For model-based evaluation, we enforce the EVAL LM to generate\na rationale before assigning a score, inspired by the effectiveness of CoT prompting (Wei et al.,\n2022b) for the evaluation of LLMs (Liu et al., 2023). Once the evaluators have scored each skill of\nthe instance, we aggregate the scores based on the skill, domain, and difficulty level for fine-grained\nanalysis. This analysis allows for an in-depth understanding of how the target model performs across\nvarious metadata compositions. The illustration of the evaluation process and the score rubric for\neach skill is provided in Figure 1 and Appendix K.1.\n3.4\nFLASK-HARD\nTo assess state-of-the-art LLMs in challenging scenarios, we additionally introduce FLASK-HARD\nsubset. This subset comprises 89 instances that are annotated as expert-level knowledge difficulty\n(Level 5), including tasks such as predicting chess checkmates and solving advanced mathematics\nproblems. Due to the intricate nature of FLASK-HARD tasks which may prevent reliable evaluation,\nwe explore a more fine-grained evaluation setting for FLASK-HARD. Instead of using a fixed score\nrubric for each skill, we introduce an instance-specific score rubric for each skill. Specifically, EVAL\nLM first generates at most 5 subquestions (checklists) that correspond to one of the related skills\nannotated in Section 3.2 for each instance. Then, we manually remove duplicates or subquestions\nunrelated to the annotated skillset. After we annotate subquestions for each instance, evaluators\ngive a score ranging from 1 to 5 based on the judgment of whether the model response fulfilled the\nspecific criteria of the subquestions. We specify the illustration in Figure 1 and the prompt in Figure\n35 (Appendix) for the instance-specific score rubric, respectively.\n4\nRELIABILITY OF FLASK\nIn this section, we investigate the reliability of FLASK by 1) measuring the correlation between\nhuman-based and model-based evaluation and 2) the robustness to stylistic changes of model-based\nevaluation. For correlation measurement, we conduct both human-based and model-based evalua-\ntions on 200 instances randomly sampled from the whole FLASK evaluation set. We recruited 10\nhuman labelers who have majored in various fields including computer science, mathematics, eco-\nnomics, business, chemistry, etc. We evaluate 4 models: 1) GPT-3.5, 2) BARD, 3) VICUNA-13B,\nand 4) ALPACA-13B4. For model-based evaluation, we use GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) as the default\nEVAL LM since it is known to show the highest correlation with human labelers (Liu et al., 2023;\nDubois et al., 2023)5. Details of the human evaluation process are provided in Appendix G.1 and\nthe analysis of inter-labeler agreement between skills is provided in Appendix C.1. To measure the\nrobustness to stylistic changes, we use the response of GPT-3.5 of FLASK-HARD and generate an\nadversarial set to make the response more verbose. We measure the consistency of the scores given\nby the EVAL LM between the original and the adversarial response.\nFine-graininess leads to a high correlation between human-based and model-based evaluation.\nWe compare the result of human-based and model-based evaluation of FLASK in Figure 2. Overall,\nthe tendency is similar between the two evaluation settings: ALPACA model results in the worst per-\nformance for most of the skills, and both VICUNA and ALPACA have a significant performance gap\nbetween GPT-3.5 and BARD on Logical Thinking (Logical Robustness, Logical Correctness,\nLogical Efficiency) and Background Knowledge abilities (Factuality, Commonsense Under-\nstanding skills) compared to other skills. However, it\u2019s worth noting that both evaluation settings\nare necessary, as neither is perfect and they complement each other. In human-based evaluation, we\nobserve central tendency bias (Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2020), where labelers tend to assign middle\nscores more often on the Likert scale, resulting in a more uniform score distribution. Also, human\nlabelers are prone to fatigue since the annotation task requires knowledge-intensive evaluation, such\nas code implementation tasks (Casper et al., 2023; Bowman et al., 2022). On the other hand, model-\nbased evaluation is known to possess style and verbosity bias (Wang et al., 2023b; Dubois et al.,\n2023; Zheng et al., 2023), where the evaluation model tends to prefer responses similar to its own\n4We specify the details of models being evaluated in Appendix B.\n5We use the gpt-4-0613 version for model-based evaluation.

For example, for some skills, the EVAL LM\ntends to prefer the response styles of GPT-3.5 compared to BARD, unlike human evaluators.\n\u03c1\n\u03c4\nr\nROUGE-L\n0.333\n0.240\n0.289\nSkill-agnostic (GPT-3.5)\n0.360\n0.267\n0.450\nFLASK (GPT-3.5)\n0.424\n0.330\n0.449\nSkill-agnostic (CLAUDE)\n0.352\n0.264\n0.391\nFLASK (CLAUDE)\n0.432\n0.334\n0.458\nSkill-agnostic (GPT-4)\n0.641\n0.495\n0.673\nFLASK (GPT-4)\n0.680\n0.541\n0.732\n\u2013 Reference Answer\n0.516\n0.429\n0.566\n\u2013 Rationale\n0.634\n0.523\n0.683\n\u2013 Score Rubric\n0.646\n0.512\n0.696\nTable 1: Correlation between model-based evalu-\nation and human labelers for Skill-agnostic (skill-\nagnostic rubric) and FLASK (skill-specific rubric)\nacross different EVAL LMS (GPT-3.5, CLAUDE,\nGPT-4). We report Spearman (\u03c1), Kendall-Tau (\u03c4),\nand Pearson (r) correlation. We also measure the ef-\nfect of including a reference answer, rationale gen-\neration, and score rubric.\nTo quantitatively analyze the correlation between\nhuman-based and model-based evaluation, we\nmeasure the Spearman, Kendall-Tau, and Pear-\nson correlation.\nWe first observe that using an\nautomatic metric (ROUGE-L) results in the low-\nest correlation.\nNext, we compare the skill-\nspecific rubric setting of FLASK with the refer-\nence answer-guided, skill-agnostic evaluation set-\nting introduced in Zheng et al. (2023) and illus-\ntrated in Figure 1a, which provides an overall sin-\ngle score without considering the skill set6. As\nshown in Table 1, applying a skill-specific fine-\ngrained evaluation leads to a stronger correlation\nbetween human-based and model-based evalua-\ntion consistently across various EVAL LMS. Also,\nby comparing different EVAL LMS, we observe\nthat GPT-4 shows the highest correlation com-\npared to GPT-3.5 and CLAUDE. Additionally, we\nanalyze the effect of including a reference answer,\ngenerating a rationale before assigning a score,\nand including a score rubric for each skill during the model-based evaluation of FLASK, respec-\ntively. As shown in Table 1, we notice that removing any of the factors leads to a significant drop in\nthe correlation, especially for the reference answer.\nSkill-Agnostic\nSkill-Specific\nInstance-Specific\nRobustness\n43.82\n52.99\n55.78\nFigure\n3:\nComparison\nof\nskill-agnostic, skill-specific, and\ninstance-specific\nscore\nrubrics\nin terms of their robustness to\nstylistic changes.\nFine-grained evaluation mitigates the bias of model-based\nevaluation.\nAs mentioned previously, model-based evaluation is\nknown to be prone to biases (Wang et al., 2023b; Zheng et al.,\n2023). Among various biases, we investigate the effect of fine-\ngrained evaluation on verbosity bias which is quantitatively mea-\nsurable in a controllable setup. We take the original response of\nGPT-3.5 on FLASK-HARD and prompt GPT-3.5 to make the re-\nsponse more verbose while retaining the contents. We measure the\nrobustness of the evaluation method by calculating the ratio that the\nEVAL LM assigns the same score regardless of the stylistic changes.\nWe compare the skill-agnostic evaluation, the skill-specific rubric\nof FLASK, and the instance-specific rubric of FLASK introduced\n6For coarse-grained evaluation setting, we assume that a uniform score has been assigned for every skill for\ncorrelation calculation. We also specify the prompt for skill-agnostic evaluation in Figure 36 in the Appendix.\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nin Section 3.4 and illustrated in Figure 17. As shown in Figure 3, we observe that the robustness\nincreases as the fine-graininess of the evaluation setting increases. This indicates that increasing the\nfine-graininess could mitigate the biases and enhance the reliability of the model-based evaluation\nto some extent. We provide the correlation between response length and the performance score for\neach skill of various models on the whole FLASK evaluation set in Figure 22 and Table 5 in the\nAppendix. Although the instance-specific rubric is the most robust to stylistic changes, it is more\ncostly as it requires an additional stage for annotating subquestions and manual validation. We there-\nfore utilize the instance-specific rubric in FLASK-HARD only. We leave extending it to the whole\nevaluation set and the investigation of other biases as future work.\n5\nANALYSIS BASED ON AUTOMATIC EVALUATION OF FLASK\nAlthough conducting both human-based and model-based evaluation is reliable for comprehensive\nanalysis, human-based evaluation is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, considering the high\ncorrelation with human-based evaluation shown in Table 1, for the evaluation on the whole FLASK\nevaluation set, we focus on automatic model-based evaluation for an extensive analysis of LLMs.\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nVicuna 13B\nWizardLM 13B\nGPT-3.5\nFigure 4: The performance comparison\nbetween GPT-3.5, VICUNA, and WIZ-\nARDLM for each skill on the FLASK\nevaluation set.\nCurrent open-source models significantly underperform\nproprietary models on particular skills.\nFirst, to com-\npare open-sourced models with proprietary models on the\nentire set, we compare GPT-3.5, VICUNA-13B, and WIZ-\nARDLM-13B where the latter two models are trained with\nGPT-3.5 responses during instruction tuning. As shown\nin Figure 4, VICUNA and WIZARDLM show similar per-\nformance across all skills. In contrast to the claim of Xu\net al. (2023), this implies that the effect of complex instruc-\ntions is not significant when using the same base model,\nteacher model, and training configuration. By comparing\nGPT-3.5 and the other two open-source models (VICUNA\nand WIZARDLM), we observe that Problem Handling\nand User Alignment abilities can be almost fully imi-\ntated, including Metacognition, Readability, and Concise-\nness.\nHowever, a large gap is especially noticeable in\nLogical Thinking and Background Knowledge\nabilities. This result aligns with Gudibande et al. (2023)\nwhich demonstrates that the open-source models only imitate the style of the proprietary models\nrather than the factuality. We also observe a similar tendency for larger open-source models such\nas T \u00a8ULU-65B as shown in Table 9. By analyzing the performance in terms of each domain, we find\nthat both open-source models significantly underperform GPT-3.5 in Math, and Coding domains,\nas shown in Figure 29a in the Appendix. Moreover, by analyzing the performance by difficulty level\nin Figure 30 in the Appendix, open-source models consistently exhibit poor performance across\ndifficulties, especially on Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities.\nSome skills require larger model sizes.\nWe analyze the effect of the model scale for each skill\nby comparing T \u00a8ULU 7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B shown in Figure 5. Overall, we can observe that larger\nmodels lead to better performance, which aligns with the result of Chung et al. (2022); Wei et al.\n(2022a). However, the range of improvement varies across different skills. For example, skills such\nas Readability, Harmlessness, and Metacognition show slow improvement as the model scales up.\nOn the other hand, skills such as Logical Robustness, Logical Correctness, and Logical Efficiency\nshow rapid improvements. Using FLASK, we confirm the findings of Gudibande et al. (2023) that\nskills requiring logical reasoning or fact retrieval benefit significantly from model scaling. Inter-\nestingly, we observe that for some skills, the performance nearly saturates after a particular scale;\nLogical Efficiency and Conciseness after 30B, Insightfulness after 13B and Metacognition after 7B.\nThis suggests that some skills necessitate larger model sizes, while others can be achieved with\nsmaller models. By analyzing the effect of model scaling for different levels of difficulty for each\n7For the evaluation settings of FLASK, we exclude the scores corresponding to Completeness and Concise-\nness since these skills should be inherently dependent on the length of the response.\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n(a) Robustness\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n(b) Correctness\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.5\n2.7\n2.9\n3.1\n3.3\n(c) Efficiency\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n(d) Factuality\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n(e) Commonsense\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n(f) Comprehension\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n(g) Insightfulness\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n(h) Completeness\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n(i) Metacognition\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\n4.8\n5.0\n(j) Readability\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\n4.8\n(k) Conciseness\n7B\n13B\n30B\n65B\nModel Size\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\n4.8\n(l) Harmlessness\nFigure 5: The performance of T \u00a8ULU shown for each skill depending on the model scale (7B, 13B, 30B, 65B).\nWhile skills such as Logical Robustness and Logical Correctness largely benefit from model scaling, smaller\nmodels also perform well in skills such as Readability and Metacognition.\n1\n2\n3\n>=4\nDifficulty\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n(a) Robustness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nDifficulty\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n(b) Correctness\n<=2\n3\n>=4\nDifficulty\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n(c) Efficiency\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nDifficulty\n2.50\n2.75\n3.00\n3.25\n3.50\n3.75\n4.00\nChatGPT\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\n(d) Completeness\nFigure 6: The performance comparison among GPT-3.5, T \u00a8ULU-7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B for Logical Robust-\nness, Logical Correctness, Factuality, and Completeness, depending on the difficulty of the instructions. Larger\nmodels show effectiveness on easier instructions especially. The full results are shown in Figure 31 (Appendix).\nskill, we find that scaling the model size is more effective for easier instructions, as shown in Figure\n6. Larger models of T \u00a8ULU reduce the performance gap with GPT-3.5, especially for the simple\nlifestyle knowledge (Level 1), whereas the gap increases for higher difficulties. We provide the\nresults for each domain in Figure 32 and additionally observe that different skills require different\ntraining steps in Appendix C.6.\nProprietary models also struggle on the FLASK-HARD set.\nWe also compare the performance\nof various proprietary models (GPT-3.5, BARD, CLAUDE, INSTRUCTGPT, GPT-4) on the FLASK\nevaluation set as shown in Figure 7a. For all skills of Problem Handling, CLAUDE shows the\nbest performance while for Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge, GPT-3.5\nshows the best performance. INSTRUCTGPT shows the worst performance across most skills be-\ncause it often provides short responses while not fully addressing the intention of given instruction.\nWe provide the comparison between proprietary models for each domain in Figure 33. Furthermore,\nwe compare the performance of different proprietary models on the FLASK-HARD set, as shown\nin Figure 7b and 7c, which adopts skill-specific and instance-specific score rubrics, respectively.\nFirst, we observe that on FLASK-HARD, the performance significantly degrades for Logical\nThinking and Background Knowledge abilities compared to Figure 7a. Also, by comparing\nother models with GPT-4, we observe that there is a large gap for Logical Correctness, Insightful-\nness, and Commonsense Understanding. Interestingly, even the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model also\nperforms poorly for Logical Correctness and Factuality skills on the FLASK-HARD set. This sug-\ngests there is significant room for improvement in those abilities even for the proprietary models.

(c) Performance comparison of various pro-\nprietary models on the FLASK-HARD evaluation set using instance-specific score rubrics. Exact numbers\nincluding those for open-source models are reported in Table 9 and Table 10 (Appendix).\ncomparing Figure 7b and Figure 7c, we can observe that adopting an instance-specific score rubric\nleads to a lower score overall. This indicates that instance-specific score rubric is a more strict setting\nsince it necessitates accomplishing a more specific requirement as shown in the example of Figure 1.\nAlthough an in-depth analysis of the model scales or training techniques is infeasible for proprietary\nmodels, FLASK-HARD could provide action items for companies developing proprietary models.\n6\nAPPLICATION OF FLASK\nFLASK for Developers\nFLASK enables model developers to more accurately analyze the per-\nformance of their own models and suggests detailed action items for intermediate model check-\npoints. Specifically, developers working on open-source LLMs can compare the performance with\nproprietary LLMs and try to close the gap between them, especially for Logical Thinking\nand Background Knowledge abilities. On the other hand, developers working on proprietary\nLLMs can devise methods to enhance the performance of their own models on the FLASK-HARD\nset. Similar to the role of Wang et al. (2022a); Longpre et al. (2023a) for instruction-tuned LLMs and\nLongpre et al. (2023b); Xie et al. (2023) for pre-trained LLMs, FLASK can be utilized for making\nbetter base models, making better training datasets, and making better training techniques.\nFLASK for Practitioners\nFLASK enables practitioners to select appropriate LLMs for different\nsituations, similar to the role of Jiang et al. (2023). Because the evaluation setting of FLASK is\ndynamic, practitioners can perform metadata annotation on their own test sets and approximate\nwhich models would be suitable. For example, if the end-use case is a chatbot for chit-chat, using\n7B fine-tuned open-source models might be enough. In contrast, it might be worthwhile to pay for\nAPI calls of proprietary LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. Potentially, the result of FLASK can be\nused to automatically route and recommend suitable LLMs depending on the instruction.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduce FLASK, a fine-grained language skill set evaluation setting for the align-\nment of language models. We categorize 12 fine-grained skills to evaluate LLMs and annotate\nnecessary skills, the target domain, and the difficulty level for each instance. FLASK provides a\ncomprehensive and interpretable analysis of the capabilities of LLMs by allowing the analysis of\nthe performance depending on different skills, domains, and difficulty levels. Also, we observe that\napplying fine-grained evaluation results in better reliability in terms of correlation between human-\nbased and model-based evaluation and the robustness of model-based evaluation to stylistic changes.\nWe analyze various open-source and proprietary LLMs and suggest that FLASK could be utilized\nfor making better language models and providing meaningful insights of various LLMs for both de-\nvelopers and practitioners. We hope that FLASK could serve as an initial guideline for fine-grained\nevaluation towards a comprehensive and reliable evaluation setting.\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partly supported by KAIST-NAVER Hypercreative AI Center and Institute of In-\nformation & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea\ngovernment (MSIT) (No.2022-0-00264, Comprehensive Video Understanding and Generation with\nKnowledge-based Deep Logic Neural Network, 40%; No.2021-0-02068, Artificial Intelligence In-\nnovation Hub, 20%).

Agieval: A human-centric benchmark for evaluating foundation\nmodels. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.06364, 2023.\n19\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nA\nLIMITATION AND FUTURE WORK\nA.1\nLIMITATION OF EVALUATORS\nAs discussed in Section 4, both human and model evaluators possess limitations during evaluation.\nHuman labelers tend to show central tendency bias and are prone to annotation fatigue due to the\ndifficulty and wide scope of knowledge needed to evaluate each instance. These factors might\nhave caused the moderate inter-agreement between human labelers. We expect that using advanced\nfeatures such as document retrieval for fact verification (Min et al., 2023) or highlight hints (Krishna\net al., 2023) could mitigate this issue. On the other hand, the model-based evaluation shows bias in\npreferring longer responses and in writing styles that are similar to the evaluation\u2019s model writing\nstyle. While model-based evaluation is more efficient in terms of time and cost as discussed in\nAppendix G.3, we emphasize that evaluation in both settings is crucial to reliably figure out the true\ncapability of a language model. We leave mitigating the limitations for respective evaluation settings\nas future work. Also, we did not extensively conduct human-based evaluations due to cost and time\nconstraints. For a more reliable setting, a larger number of labelers from diverse demographics could\nbe recruited and the human-based evaluation could be conducted on a larger set. Also, while we\nevaluated only 4 models for human-based evaluation, a larger number of models could be evaluated\nfor future work.\nA.2\nSCOPE OF THE EVALUATION\nWe restrict the scope of the current evaluation instance to be monolingual (including only English\nuser instructions), single-turn, language-focused, and zero-shot. We leave extension to multilingual\ninstructions, multi-turn, multi-modal, and few-shot in-context learning evaluation to future work.\nAlso, the FLASK-HARD subset only contains 89 instances, making the effect of outliers unavoid-\nable when analyzing by each skill, domain, or difficulty. However, expansion to these axes could\nbe easily implemented once the instances are collected using the process described in Section 3.2,\nbecause the metadata annotation is automatic and dynamic. Also, we only apply instance-specific\nscoring rubrics on FLASK-HARD. Although we have shown that adopting a more fine-grained\nevaluation setting leads to increased robustness for model-based evaluation, we have not conducted\nhuman evaluations for the instance-specific scoring rubrics on the FLASK whole set due to time\nand cost constraints. Additionally, new abilities of LLMs are newly discovered (Wei et al., 2022a),\nindicating that recategorization of the primary abilities and skills might be needed for future models\npossessing potentially much more powerful abilities and skills.\nB\nMODEL DETAILS\nWe evaluate LLMs with varying model sizes, training techniques, and training datasets. We evaluate\nseveral proprietary LLMs where the model responses are provided through private APIs with model\ndetails hidden from the end users. These include 1) OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022), 2) Ope-\nnAI\u2019s INSTRUCTGPT (text-davinci-003) (Ouyang et al., 2022), 3) Google\u2019s BARD (Google, 2023),\nand 4) Anthropic\u2019s CLAUDE 1.0 (Anthropic, 2023)8. For open-source models which are fine-tuned\nbased on human-curated datasets or responses from proprietary models, we compare 1) ALPACA\n13B (Taori et al., 2023) which is a fine-tuned LLAMA model (Touvron et al., 2023a) on 52,000\ninstructions and responses generated by text-davinci-0039, 2) VICUNA 13B(Chiang et al., 2023)\nwhich is a LLAMA model fine-tuned on 70K responses of GPT-3.5 available through ShareGPT,\n3) WIZARDLM 13B (Xu et al., 2023), a LLAMA model fine-tuned on 250K instructions and re-\nsponses augmented by GPT-3.5 through instruction evolving, 4) T \u00a8ULU 13B (Wang et al., 2023b), a\nLLAMA model fine-tuned on 490K training instances which are a mixture of human and machine-\ngenerated instructions and responses, 5) LLAMA2 Chat 70B(Touvron et al., 2023b), a chat-variant\nof LLAMA2 model fine-tuned with instruction tuning and RLHF. To evaluate LLMs with various\nmodel sizes, we also compare T \u00a8ULU 7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B models. Also, to compare the effect\nof different fine-tuning datasets, we compare models finetuned on SHAREGPT10, CODE-ALPACA\n8For proprietary models, we use the most recent model versions at the period of May 2023 - June 2023.\n9Because the official ALPACA 13B checkpoint is not released at the point of conducting evaluation, we use\nthe open-instruct-stanford-alpaca-13b model weights provided by Wang et al.

For human-based eval-\nuation, because we assign 3 labelers for each instance, we\nmeasure the agreement between 3 labelers. For model-\nbased evaluation, we set the decoding temperature as 1.0\nfor nondeterministic generations while keeping the EVAL\nLM (GPT-4) fixed and measure the agreement between 3\nruns. First, the overall agreement of inter-labeler agree-\nment for human-based evaluation is 0.488, indicating a\nmoderate correlation while the agreement is 0.835 for\nmodel-based evaluation. Second, we analyze the human-\nhuman agreement, model-model agreement, and human-\nmodel correlation for each skill as shown in Table 2.\nWhile skills such as Logical Correctness and Common-\nsense Understanding have a high agreement or correla-\ntion for all settings, skills such as Readability and Con-\nciseness do not. This implies that more subjectivity tends\nto exist in User Alignment ability than Logical\nThinking and Background Knowledge abilities\nconsistent for all settings. We expect that disagreement\nbetween labelers for User Alignment ability could\nbe utilized for additional training signals or personaliza-\ntion for subjective tasks (Gordon et al., 2021; Salemi\net al., 2023). We explore agreement between different\nEVAL LMS in Appendix C.8.\nC.2\nANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT FINETUNING DATA\nThrough the metadata annotation process of FLASK, we can analyze not only the evaluation data\nbut also the instructions of fine-tuning data. To compare different fine-tuning datasets, we com-\npare SHAREGPT, FLAN V2, ALPACA, CODE-ALPACA, and EVOL-INSTRUCT data by randomly\nsampling 200 instances. We first compare the primary ability and skill proportion for each training\ndata as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. While SHAREGPT and FLAN V2 show similar pro-\nportions, EVOL-INSTRUCT focuses more on Logical Thinking and Problem Handling.\nAlso, ALPACA focuses on Problem Handling and User Alignment while CODE-ALPACA\nmainly focuses on Logical Thinking. By comparing the domain proportion shown in Figure\n10, we observe that SHAREGPT, CODE-ALPACA and EVOL-INSTRUCThave a large proportion of\nthe Coding and Technology domain while FLAN-V2 and ALPACA have a large proportion of Lan-\nguage domain. Lastly, we compare the difficulty level of each instruction of training data shown in\nFigure 11. Overall, ALPACA and FLAN V2 show relatively low difficulty while CODE-ALPACA\nand SHAREGPT show moderate difficulty and EVOL-INSTRUCT shows the highest difficulty.\nWe also report the performance of different fine-tuning datasets on a subset of FLASK where only\nthe instances that have short reference answers (less than 5 words) are selected in Figure 12. Differ-\nent from the result of Figure 14, the performance gap between different training instructions reduces\nespecially for Logical Thinking and User Alignment. This indicates that the low perfor-\nmance of FLAN V2 in Figure 14 is due to the failure to generate long-form responses rather than\nthe lack of ability. We leave exploring the effect of replacing the responses of FLAN V2 instruction\nto longer responses as future work.\n21\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nUser Alignment\n23.0%\nProblem Handling\n43.1%\nLogical Thinking\n17.6%\nBackground \n16.3%\n(a) SHAREGPT\nUser Alignment\n18.4%\nProblem Handling\n42.2%\nLogical Thinking\n17.9%\nBackground \n21.4%\n(b) FLAN V2\nUser Alignment\n23.7%\nProblem Handling\n47.8%\nLogical Thinking\n10.8%\nBackground \n17.6%\n(c) ALPACA\nUser Alignment\n6.3%\nProblem Handling\n19.9%\nBackground \n4.5%\nLogical Thinking\n69.3%\n(d) CODE-ALPACA\nUser Alignment\n14.6%\nProblem Handling\n47.8%\nLogical Thinking\n24.7%\nBackground \n13.0%\n(e) EVOL-INSTRUCT\nFigure 8: Proportion of primary abilities (Logical Thinking, Background Knowledge,\nProblem Handling, and User Alignment) for each fine-tuning dataset.\nC.3\nEFFECT OF DIFFERENT TRAINING DATA\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nShareGPT\nFLAN V2\nAlpaca\nCode-Alpaca\nEvol-Instruct\nFigure 14: Skill comparison of models trained\non different fine-tuning datasets (SHAREGPT,\nFLAN V2, ALPACA, CODE-ALPACA, EVOL-\nINSTRUCT) on the evaluation set of FLASK.\nWe\nanalyze\nthe\neffect\nof\ndifferent\nfine-\ntuning datasets by fine-tuning LLAMA 13B\nmodel with SHAREGPT, FLAN V2, ALPACA,\nCODE-ALPACA, and EVOL-INSTRUCT data,\nrespectively. The results are shown in Figure\n14. First, the model trained on FLAN V2 un-\nderperforms other baselines for most skills. Be-\ncause FLAN V2 consists of relatively short re-\nsponses, training on FLAN V2 leads to fail-\nure for instructions that require long-form text\ngeneration. However, for the evaluation sub-\nset where the length of the reference answer is\nshorter than 5 words, FLAN V2 shows similar\nperformance to other baselines as illustrated in\nFigure 12. This indicates that while FLAN V2\nis effective for instructions that require short\nresponses, it is not suitable for long-form text\ngeneration. Second, by comparing the effect\nof training on ALPACA and CODE-ALPACA,\nwe can observe that CODE-ALPACA model out-\nperforms ALPACA on Logical Thinking\nability, indicating that domain-specific instruc-\ntion tuning on the Coding domain leads to\nimproved Logical Thinking.\nThird, by\ncomparing the result of models trained with SHAREGPT and EVOL-INSTRUCT, although the in-\nstructions of EVOL-INSTRUCT are more difficult than SHAREGPT as shown in Figure 11, using\n22\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nHarmlessness\n6.0%\nConciseness\n8.5%\nReadability\n10.5%\nCompleteness\n10.5%\nInsightfulness\n6.5%\nCorrectness\n6.7%\nEfficiency\n7.2%\nFactuality\n9.0%\nCommonsense\n8.7%\nComprehension\n15.3%\n(a) SHAREGPT\nConciseness\n8.9%\nReadability\n8.4%\nMetacognition\n6.7%\nCompleteness\n6.6%\nComprehension\n18.0%\nRobustness\n4.5%\nCorrectness\n10.6%\nEfficiency\n4.9%\nFactuality\n12.3%\nCommonsense\n11.6%\n(b) FLAN V2\nHarmlessness\n1.7%\nConciseness\n8.7%\nReadability\n14.9%\nCompleteness\n11.6%\nInsightfulness\n7.9%\nCorrectness\n7.5%\nEfficiency\n2.7%\nFactuality\n12.2%\nCommonsense\n6.5%\nComprehension\n24.3%\n(c) ALPACA\nReadability\n3.7%\nComprehension\n15.1%\nEfficiency\n27.8%\nCommonsense\n1.8%\nRobustness\n19.0%\nCorrectness\n23.8%\n(d) CODE-ALPACA\nConciseness\n3.2%\nReadability\n11.5%\nCompleteness\n14.9%\nInsightfulness\n4.7%\nComprehension\n24.6%\nRobustness\n6.7%\nCorrectness\n9.0%\nEfficiency\n10.0%\nFactuality\n9.2%\nCommonsense\n4.3%\n(e) EVOL-INSTRUCT\nFigure 9: Proportion of 12 skills for each fine-tuning dataset.\nmore difficult training instructions does not lead to significant changes. We provide skill proportion,\ndomain proportion, and difficulty comparison between different fine-tuning instructions in Appendix\nC.2.\nC.4\nEFFECT OF TRAINING ON BETTER RESPONSES\nWe explore the effect of training on better response for each instruction by using better teacher\nmodels for distillation-based instruction tuning. We compare ALPACA which is finetuned on the\nresponses of INSTRUCTGPT and GPT4-ALPACA which is finetuned on the responses of GPT-4.\nGPT-4 model is known to show better performance than INSTRUCTGPT, also shown in Figure 7a,\nbeing a better teacher model. We also illustrate the result of GPT-3.5 for comparison. As shown in\nFigure 15, GPT4-ALPACA 13B outperforms ALPACA 13B for all skills. This shows that using better\nresponses during training leads to better performance. However, although GPT-4 is known to show\nbetter performance than GPT-3.5, also shown in Figure 7a, GPT4-ALPACA underperforms GPT-\n3.5 for all skills. This shows that although training on better responses improves the performance,\nthe enhancement is not enough. Instead, training on a better base model other than LLAMA 13B\nmodel could lead to better performance.\nC.5\nEFFECT OF RLHF\nWe analyze the effect of RLHF training by comparing VICUNA-13B with STABLEVICUNA-13B11,\nwhich additionally finetunes VICUNA model via RLHF on a mixture of OpenAssistant Conversa-\ntions Dataset (OASST1) (K\u00a8opf et al., 2023), GPT4All (Anand et al., 2023), and ALPACA (Taori\net al., 2023) training instances. The reward model to train STABLEVICUNA model is trained with\na mixture of OASST1, Anthropic HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a), and Stanford Human Preferences\nDataset (Askell et al., 2021). The result is shown in Table 3.

We\nconjecture that the performance degradation on most of the skills is due to the quality of the dataset\nused for RLHF being worse than the dataset used during instruction tuning (SHAREGPT). However,\nwe leave a detailed analysis of the comparison of these fine-tuning datasets as future work. Even\nthough the performance degrades for most skills, the RLHF process leads to consistent improve-\nment on Logical Thinking, implying that using more advanced RLHF techniques (Lightman\net al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023a) might reduce the gap of Logical Thinking ability between\nopen-source and proprietary LLMs.\nC.6\nFINE-TUNING STEPS VARIATION\nWe explore the effect of different fine-tuning steps by instruction-tuning a LLAMA 7B on\nSHAREGPT for different numbers of epochs. We report the performance for each skill in Fig-\nure 16 where the training epoch of zero corresponds to LLAMA 7B model performance.

However, the performance tendency after the\nfirst epoch varies depending on the skill. For skills such as Logical Correctness, Logical Efficiency,\nFactuality, Completeness, and Conciseness, the performance improves consistently, Logical Cor-\nrectness showing the biggest improvement. From the result of Figure 5 and Figure 16, we suggest\nthat Logical Correctness skill requires both extensive scale of the model and training steps for effec-\ntive acquisition. On the other hand, the performance decreases after the first epoch for skills such as\nHarmlessness, Readability, and Logical Robustness. These results show that different skills require\ndifferent training steps, similar to the result of the model scale of Figure 5. Therefore, we conjecture\nthat optimizing each skill using experts might lead to better performance (Shen et al., 2023a; Jang\net al., 2023; Ye et al., 2022a).\nC.7\nUSING CLAUDE AS EVAL LM FOR EVALUATION\nWe explore using CLAUDE as EVAL LM instead of GPT-4. The result is shown in Figure 17.\nBy comparing with setting GPT-4 model as EVAL LM shown in Table 9, we find that CLAUDE\ngives better scores for Logical Thinking and worse scores for User Alignment overall.\nEspecially, different from the result of Table 9, Figure 17 shows that open-source models such as\nVICUNA largely reduce the gap with proprietary models for Logical Thinking and Factuality\nabilities. Considering that the human-based evaluation shows an opposite result in Figure 2 and the\ncorrelation with human labelers is lower for CLAUDE compared to GPT-4, we conjecture that this\ntendency is due to CLAUDE not possessing much Logical Thinking and Factuality abilities\nas clearly shown in Figure 7a. Therefore, we use GPT-4 as the EVAL LM as default. However,\nwe suggest using various EVAL LMS for model-based evaluation of FLASK if the ability between\nevaluators is similar for closer simulation of human-based evaluation (Dubois et al., 2023).\n25\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nAlpaca 13B\nGPT4-Alpaca 13B\nGPT-3.5\nFigure 15: Effect of training with better teacher models for distillation-based instruction tuning.\nVICUNA\nSTABLEVICUNA\nRelative Gain (%)\n(SFT)\n(SFT+RLHF)\nLogical Robustness\n2.27\n2.36\n3.96\nLogical Correctness\n2.52\n2.61\n3.13\nLogical Efficiency\n2.61\n2.65\n1.57\nFactuality\n3.39\n3.17\n-6.96\nCommonsense Understanding\n3.49\n3.36\n-3.92\nComprehension\n3.56\n3.35\n-6.41\nInsightfulness\n3.27\n2.93\n-11.86\nCompleteness\n3.70\n3.39\n-9.18\nMetacognition\n3.71\n3.38\n-9.90\nReadability\n4.86\n4.57\n-2.49\nConciseness\n4.17\n4.03\n-3.48\nHarmlessness\n4.93\n4.86\n-1.37\nTable 3: Performance comparison by skill set between VICUNA, which is finetuned solely on super-\nvised fine-tuning (SFT) and STABLEVICUNA, which is fine-tuned using RLHF after SFT. We also\nreport the relative gain (%) after RLHF training process.\nC.8\nEXPLORING AGREEMENT BETWEEN EVAL LMS\nExpanding on the analysis of Section 4, we also measure the inter-model agreement setting where\nwe set 3 separate EVAL LMS (GPT-3.5, CLAUDE, GPT-4) as evaluators and measure the agree-\nment between 3 different models similar to the setting of AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023). The\nresult shows that the overall inter-model agreement is 0.471 in Table 4. This is consistent with the\nresult of Dubois et al. (2023), showing that using inter-model evaluation shows similar inter-labeler\nagreement to human-based evaluation. However, when we analyze the agreement for each skill in\nTable 4, in contrast to the result of Table 2, inter-model show a different tendency with inter-labeler\nagreement for human-based evaluation, showing the lowest agreement for Logical Robustness. We\nconjecture that this is due to the inherent ability gap between each EVAL LMS shown in Figure 7a,\nwhere the gap is evident for Logical Robustness and Logical Efficiency (Lee et al., 2023).\nC.9\nADDITIONAL MODELS\nWe evaluate additional models which include 1) LLAMA2 Chat 13B, 2) VICUNA 7B, 3) VICUNA\n33B, 4) and SELFEE 13B. For LLAMA2 Chat 13B, we compare with VICUNA 13B to compare the\neffect of using better base models and LLAMA2 Chat 70B to compare the effect of the model size.\n26\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\n(a) Robustness\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n(b) Correctness\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n(c) Efficiency\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n(d) Factuality\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n(e) Commonsense\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n(f) Comprehension\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n(g) Insightfulness\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n(h) Completeness\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n2.00\n2.25\n2.50\n2.75\n3.00\n3.25\n3.50\n(i) Metacognition\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\n(j) Readability\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n(k) Conciseness\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTraining Epochs\n4.3\n4.4\n4.5\n4.6\n4.7\n4.8\n(l) Harmlessness\nFigure 16: The effect of fine-tuning steps of LLAMA-7B.\nInter-Model Agreement\nLogical Robustness\n0.339\nLogical Correctness\n0.488\nLogical Efficiency\n0.461\nFactuality\n0.495\nCommonsense Understanding\n0.468\nComprehension\n0.481\nInsightfulness\n0.496\nCompleteness\n0.488\nMetacognition\n0.471\nReadability\n0.470\nConciseness\n0.472\nHarmlessness\n0.481\nOverall\n0.471\nTable 4: Agreement between 3 different EVAL LMS (GPT-3.5, CLAUDE, and GPT-4).\nAs shown in Figure 18, by comparing VICUNA 13B and LLAMA2 Chat, using better base models\nleads to slight improvement for Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge while\nthe improvement is significant for Insightfulness and Completeness skill. However, LLAMA2 Chat\nleads to worse Conciseness. Since the fine-tuning dataset is different for VICUNA and LLAMA2\nChat, further analysis is needed to analyze the effect of the base model.\nAlso, by comparing\nLLAMA2 Chat 13B and 70B, we observe that using larger models leads to improved performance\noverall, aligned with the result of Figure 5.

Note that only for VICUNA 33B, we use version\n1.3, which is one of the best-open-source models at the point of the experiment on AlpacaEval (Li\net al., 2023b). As shown in Figure 19, using larger models leads to improved skills overall. However,\nthere still exists a significant gap between GPT-3.5 for Logical Thinking and Background\nKnowledge abilities. For SELFEE (Ye et al., 2023b), which is a LLAMA model instruction-tuned\nto give feedback and revise its own response iteratively, we compare with VICUNA 13B and GPT-\n3.5 to confirm the effectiveness of self-revision. The result is shown in Figure 20. We observe that\nSELFEE shows improved performance on Logical Robustness, Logical Correctness, Insightfulness,\nCompleteness while performing on par or worse compared to VICUNA model. This implies that for\nLLAMA 13B model, using self-feedback and revision improves the Insightfulness and Complete-\nness while it does not reduce the gap between proprietary models for Logical Thinking and\nBackground Knowledge abilities.\nD\nBROADER RELATED WORK & BACKGROUND\nD.1\nEVALUATION OF LLMS\nConventionally, the performance of LLMs is measured by assessing the model on separate bench-\nmarks using automatic metrics such as accuracy for knowledge/reasoning tasks or ROUGE for long-\nform text generation (Chung et al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Suzgun et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\n2022c; Gao et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2023). However, automatic metrics are based on surface-level\nfeatures, indicating the limitation in terms of comprehensiveness and correlation to actual model\nperformance (Gehrmann et al., 2022). Recently, to overcome the limitations of automatic metrics,\nhuman-based or model-based evaluation has been adopted, usually evaluating the overall quality of\nthe model by annotating a binary preference or an overall scalar score. Although human-based eval-\nuation is known to be more reliable, it is not scalable or easily reproducible (Ouyang et al., 2022;\nKrishna et al., 2023). On the other hand, model-based evaluation, a more scalable and reproducible\noption, has been widely used to simulate human-based evaluation with the cost of compromised\nreliability to some extent (Dubois et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Chiang & yi Lee, 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023; Zheng et al., 2023).\n28\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nVicuna 13B\nLLaMA2 Chat 13B\nLLaMA2 Chat 70B\nFigure 18: Comparing VICUNA 13B, LLAMA2 Chat 13B, LLAMA2 Chat 70B via FLASK.\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nVicuna 7B\nVicuna 13B\nVicuna 33B\nGPT-3.5\nFigure 19: Comparing VICUNA 7B, VICUNA 13B, VICUNA 33B, and GPT-3.5 via FLASK.\nD.2\nUSING LLMS AS EVALUATORS\nRecently, LLM evaluators have been largely used to simulate human-based evaluation due to the\ncost and time efficiency compared to human evaluation. However, using LLMs as evaluators have\nthe limitation of certain biases: position bias, verbosity, style bias (Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n2023a), where LLMs tend to prefer the first option, longer responses, responses having a similar\nstyle as its own output. For the evaluation setting of FLASK, position bias is eliminated because\nwe are giving an absolute score instead of relying on a binary comparison. Also, by dividing the\nscoring scheme into fine-grained skill-level factors, we try to mitigate the effect of verbosity and\n29\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna 13B\nSelFee 13B\nFigure 20: Comparing GPT-3.5, VICUNA 13B, SELFEE 13B via FLASK.\nMetadata Annotation\nRaw Language Tasks\nSelf-instruct\nMMLU\nTheoremQA\nAnnotator\nTask 1\nQuestion:\nSkillset\nFactuality\nComprehension\nConciseness\nDomain\nMath\nDifficulty\nLevel 3\nEvaluation\nFLASK\nEvaluator\nFactuality: 3\nComprehension: 4\nConciseness: 5\nTask 1\nQuestion:\nResponse:\nFLASK\nHard\nAnalysis\nDifficulty = 5?\nFigure 21: The overall process of FLASK evaluation process, including evaluation data construction, metadata\nannotation process, evaluation scoring process, and the collection of FLASK-HARD.\nstyle bias. For verbosity bias, we compare the correlation between response length and performance\nfor Logical Correctness and Completeness skill. As shown in Figure 22 and Table 5, Completeness\nskill is inherently influenced by response length, showing a high correlation between response length\nand performance. However, for Logical Correctness skill, the correlation decreased to some extent,\nshowing that dividing the scoring scheme into fine-grained skill-level factors mitigates verbosity\nbias.\nE\nDETAILS FOR METADATA ANNOTATION PROCESS\nFor the skill set annotation of EVAL LM, we initially did not control the number of annotated skills\nper instance. We faced the issue that some skills could be universally applied to most instances (e.g.\nReadability or Comprehension), leading to most instances containing annotation of the universal\nskills. However, our aim of the skill evaluation is to focus on user instructions that truly requires\nthat skill. For example, logical problems do not necessitate readability compared to writing tasks\nsuch as \u2018Write a template for First-Person LinkedIn profile summary\u2019. We found that annotating\ntop-K (K=3) relevant skills per instance led to the optimal balance; avoiding labeling skills such\nas readability to all instances while leaving out instances that truly required the skill. Also, the\nmetacognition skill has an inherent characteristic that the skill is often dependent on the model\n30\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n103.1\n152.5\n201.8\n251.2\n300.6\nResponse Length\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(a) Logical Robustness\n50.7\n99.7\n148.7\n197.7\n246.7\nResponse Length\n2.50\n2.75\n3.00\n3.25\n3.50\n3.75\n4.00\n4.25\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(b) Logical Correctness\n123.5\n180.9\n238.2\n295.6\n352.9\nResponse Length\n2.75\n3.00\n3.25\n3.50\n3.75\n4.00\n4.25\n4.50\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(c) Logical Efficiency\n104.3\n166.8\n229.4\n291.9\n354.5\nResponse Length\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(d) Factuality\n54.6\n110.8\n167.0\n223.3\n279.5\nResponse Length\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(e) Commonsense\n108.6\n168.0\n227.5\n287.0\n346.5\nResponse Length\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(f) Comprehension\n148.7\n201.8\n254.8\n307.8\n360.9\nResponse Length\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(g) Insightfulness\n164.9\n226.8\n288.8\n350.8\n412.8\nResponse Length\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(h) Completeness\n55.5\n111.3\n167.0\n222.8\n278.6\nResponse Length\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(i) Metacognition\n136.3\n189.1\n241.9\n294.7\n347.4\nResponse Length\n4.45\n4.50\n4.55\n4.60\n4.65\n4.70\n4.75\n4.80\n4.85\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(j) Readability\n82.9\n133.1\n183.3\n233.4\n283.6\nResponse Length\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(k) Conciseness\n67.2\n122.2\n177.2\n232.2\n287.1\nResponse Length\n4.3\n4.4\n4.5\n4.6\n4.7\n4.8\n4.9\nPerformance\nGPT-3.5\nVicuna\nWizardLM\nTulu 7B\nTulu 13B\nTulu 30B\nTulu 65B\nBard\nInstructGPT\nClaude\nGPT-4\nLlama2\n(l) Harmlessness\nFigure 22: Correlation between average response length for each model and the performance for\neach skill on the whole FLASK evaluation set using skill-specific score rubrics.\nbeing evaluated. Since language models are evaluated by text-based LLMs or humans in this work,\nwe set the reference based on the capability of GPT-4. Therefore, we focus on instances that require\nother modalities (ex) Do you like the taste of pizza?) or answering about future events (ex) If bitcoin\nhas gone up in value over the last twenty years, what do we know will happen in the next twenty\nyears?) to include metacognition for annotation. Moreover, we observed that the EVAL LM has\nposition bias when selecting the top-3 necessary skills from preliminary experiments. Therefore,\nwe randomly shuffle the index of each skill description for each instance. We specify the domain\ncategorization of FLASK in Table 6, which is divided into 10 domains and 38 sub-domains in total,\nas mentioned in Section 3.2. We modify the domain categorization of Wikipedia (Reid et al., 2022)\n31\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nPearson\nLogical Robustness\n0.239\nLogical Correctness\n0.147\nLogical Efficiency\n0.148\nFactuality\n0.395\nCommonsense Understanding\n0.380\nComprehension\n0.478\nInsightfulness\n0.763\nCompleteness\n0.737\nMetacognition\n0.412\nReadability\n0.468\nConciseness\n-0.725\nHarmlessness\n0.540\nTable 5: Pearson Correlation between average response length of multiple models (T \u00a8ULU-7B,\nT \u00a8ULU-13B, T \u00a8ULU-30B, T \u00a8ULU-65B, GPT-3.5, BARD, CLAUDE, INSTRUCTGPT, WIZARDLM,\nVICUNA, LLAMA2, GPT-4) and the performance for each skill on the whole FLASK evaluation\nset using skill-specific score rubrics.\nDomain\nSub-Domains\nHumanities\nCommunication, Education, Religion, Psychology, Philosophy, Ethics\nLanguage\nPoetry, Literature\nSocial Science\nBusiness, Finance, Economics, Law, Politics\nHistory\nHistory\nCulture\nArt, Sports, Mass Media, Music, Food\nTechnology\nAgriculture, Marketing, Management, Electronics, Engineering\nCoding\nCoding\nMath\nMathematics, Logic, Statistics\nNatural Science\nBiology, Earth Science, Nature, Astronomy, Chemistry, Physics\nHealth\nHealthcare, Medicine, Exercise, Nutrition\nTable 6: Domain categorization of FLASK where it is divided into 10 domains, and further divided\ninto 38 sub-domains.\nsuch as adding the Coding domain into a separate domain considering the significance of the Coding\ndomain for LLMs (Li et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2023). Note that the full list of 10 domains and 38\nsub-domains are provided to EVAL LM for model-based evaluation and human labelers for human-\nbased evaluation. For difficulty, since the concept of difficulty is inherently subjective depending\non the annotator\u2019s background and education level, we define the difficulty as how much domain\nknowledge is needed. We write descriptions and example instances for each level to clarify the\nboundaries between each level. Similar to the evaluation prompt of Chiang et al. (2023), we write\nseparate guidelines and examples for Math (Figure 50) and Coding (Figure 51) domains, since these\ndomains have distinct required domain knowledge compared to other domains (Figure 49).\nF\nMETADATA STATISTICS OF EVALUATION SET OF FLASK\nWe provide detailed statistics of the evaluation set of FLASK. We first provide the proportion of each\nprimary ability and skill of the evaluation set, shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24. Among different\nskills, Comprehension skill accounts for the largest ratio since most instruction requires understand-\ning the purpose of the instruction and fulfilling the requirements accordingly. On the other hand,\nHarmlessness and Metacognition skills account for the least. We also report the proportion of each\nskill for FLASK-HARD in Figure 25. We can observe that the distribution of FLASK-HARD is sim-\nilar to FLASK. The proportion of each domain of the evaluation set is shown in Figure 26. While\nHumanities and Culture domains account for the largest portion, domains such as History account\nfor the smallest portion. Lastly, we report the statistics of each difficulty level of the evaluation set\n32\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nUser Alignment\n17.7%\nProblem Handling\n39.8%\nLogical Thinking\n16.7%\nBackground \n25.8%\nFigure 23: Proportion of each primary ability of the FLASK evaluation set.\nHarmlessness\n2.5%\nConciseness\n6.4%\nReadability\n8.8%\nMetacognition\n2.6%\nCompleteness\n8.9%\nInsightfulness\n5.8%\nComprehension\n22.5%\nRobustness\n4.2%\nCorrectness\n9.1%\nEfficiency\n3.4%\nFactuality\n12.0%\nCommonsense\n13.8%\nFigure 24: Proportion of each skill of the FLASK evaluation set.\nin Table 7.

We communicated with labelers through a separate Slack channel and we held a 1-hour\ntutorial session to introduce the purpose of the task and the annotation process. A single instance\nis labeled by 3 labelers, which means that every labeler annotates 60 instances. For each instance,\nevaluators are provided the question (instruction), the reference answer, and the list of responses of\n4 models (GPT-3.5, BARD, VICUNA, ALPACA) while the model name is hidden.

First, binary domain acceptance is a task to judge whether the domain\nannotation annotated by EVAL LM (GPT-4) is acceptable. Second, evaluators annotate whether the\nskill is well annotated and give a score for each skill ranging from 1 to 5 based on the predefined\nscore rubric. For skill acceptance, we make a score of \u2018N/A\u2018 for evaluation of the model response for\neach skill, which is assigned when the skill annotated by the EVAL LM is not needed or irrelevant to\nanswering the instruction. For difficulty, labelers annotate the difficulty level that ranges from 1 to\n5, where Level 1 corresponds to simple lifestyle knowledge and Level 5 corresponds to expert-level\nknowledge. The user interface of the human labeling process is shown in Figure 27 and Figure 28.\nG.2\nRELIABILITY OF AUTOMATIC METADATA ANNOTATION BY GPT-4\nThrough the process of human evaluation explained in Appendix G.1, we measure the reliability\nof automatic metadata annotation. For domain annotation, the acceptance rate is 81.32% while the\nacceptance rate for skill annotation is 95.22%. Lastly, for the correlation between human label-\ners and annotation model (GPT-4) of difficulty level annotation, the Spearman, Kendall-Tau, and\nPearson correlation is 0.779, 0.653, and 0.774 respectively, indicating a moderate correlation. Also,\nthe agreement between labelers for difficulty level measured with Krippendorff\u2019s alpha is 0.540,\nshowing a moderate agreement (Hughes, 2021).\nG.3\nCOST AND TIME COMPARISON BETWEEN MODEL-BASED AND HUMAN-BASED\nEVALUATION\nWe compare the cost and time between model-based and human-based evaluation shown in Table\n8. Overall, model-based evaluation is 22 times cheaper and 129 times faster than human-based\n34\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 27: User interface of the human labeling process.\nModel-based Evaluation\nHuman-based Evaluation\nEvaluator\nGPT-4\nHuman labelers\nCost per query\n$0.06\n$1.3\nTime per query\n\u223c2 sec\n257.8 sec\nTable 8: Cost and time comparison between model-based evaluation and human-based evaluation.\nevaluation, indicating that model-based evaluation could be an efficient way to evaluate LLMs.\nHowever, note that we recommend both evaluation settings are needed for reliable evaluation due to\nthe respective limitations of each setting, discussed in Section 4.\nH\nADDITIONAL RESULTS\nWe provide additional results of the model-based evaluation of FLASK. In Figure 30, we show the\nperformance comparison between GPT-3.5, VICUNA 13B, and WIZARDLM 13B for each skill.\nIn Figure 31, we show the performance comparison between GPT-3.5, T \u00a8ULU-7B, 13B, 30B, and\n65B for each skill, depending on the difficulty of the instruction. In Figure 32, we show the perfor-\nmance comparison between GPT-3.5, T \u00a8ULU-7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B for each domain. In Figure\n33, we show the performance comparison between various proprietary models for each domain. By\ncomparing GPT-3.5 and CLAUDE, we can observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms on Math and Coding\ndomain, while CLAUDE outperforms GPT-3.5 on the rest of the domains.\n35\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nOpen-source\nProprietary\nOracle\nVICUNA\nWIZARDLM\nT \u00a8ULU-65B\nLLAMA2-70B\nGPT-3.5\nBARD\nCLAUDE\nGPT-4\nLogical Robustness\n2.26\n2.41\n2.66\n2.59\n3.94\n3.47\n3.59\n4.22\nLogical Correctness\n2.57\n2.70\n3.09\n2.90\n3.77\n3.48\n3.66\n4.22\nLogical Efficiency\n2.85\n2.97\n3.23\n3.05\n4.26\n3.81\n4.14\n4.54\nFactuality\n3.37\n3.38\n3.49\n3.59\n3.90\n3.76\n3.88\n4.22\nCommonsense\n3.48\n3.55\n3.56\n3.76\n4.13\n4.01\n4.09\n4.50\nComprehension\n3.54\n3.62\n3.48\n3.73\n3.98\n3.84\n4.13\n4.34\nInsightfulness\n3.03\n3.04\n2.80\n3.56\n3.28\n3.43\n3.45\n3.80\nCompleteness\n3.44\n3.41\n3.32\n3.90\n3.79\n3.92\n4.17\n4.26\nMetacognition\n3.45\n3.88\n3.03\n4.05\n3.77\n3.41\n3.98\n4.32\nReadability\n4.65\n4.72\n4.57\n4.74\n4.86\n4.68\n4.82\n4.85\nConciseness\n4.36\n4.45\n4.40\n3.95\n4.56\n3.69\n4.56\n4.69\nHarmlessness\n4.50\n4.81\n4.46\n4.92\n4.90\n4.80\n4.92\n4.86\nTable 9: Comparison of open-source and proprietary models on the whole FLASK evaluation set.\nThe model size is 13B for VICUNA, ALPACA and 70B for LLAMA2 Chat.

We include not only datasets that are conventionally used\nfor the evaluation of LLMs such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022),\nbut also datasets sourced from diverse domains such as FinQA (Chen et al., 2022) which evaluates\nthe numerical reasoning over financial data and Haiku Generation dataset (Scialom et al., 2022).\nDuring dataset collection, for instances that have missing outputs (reference answers), we collect\nthe reference answers using the responses of the EVAL LM. From preliminary experiments, we\nobserved that EVAL LM only references the reference answer instead of fully relying on it during\nevaluation. The evaluation set of FLASK is collected from 120 NLP datasets, resulting in 1,700\ninstances in total. We also provide the full list of the source datasets composing the FLASK-HARD\nset, shown in Table 13.\n37\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nPRIMARY\nABILITY\nSKILL\nDEFINITION\nAPPLICATION\nLogical\nThinking\nLogical\nRobustness\nDoes the model ensure general applicabil-\nity and avoid logical contradictions in its\nreasoning steps for an instruction that re-\nquires step-by-step logical process?

For tasks involving coding, the pro-\nposed solution should also consider time\ncomplexity.\nIf asked to sort a list of numbers, a\nmodel should provide a concise, step-\nby-step explanation without restating\nthe obvious or using an overly complex\nalgorithm.\nBackground\nKnowledge\nFactuality\nDid the model extract pertinent and ac-\ncurate background knowledge without any\nmisinformation when factual knowledge\nretrieval is needed? Is the response sup-\nported by reliable evidence or citation of\nthe source of its information?\nWhen asked about the boiling point of\nwater at sea level, a factually correct\nresponse would be 100 degrees Celsius\n(212 Fahrenheit)\nCommonsense\nUnderstanding\nIs the model accurately interpreting world\nconcepts for instructions that require a sim-\nulation of the expected result or necessitate\ncommonsense or spatial reasoning?\nThe model should know that ice melts\nwhen exposed to heat, even if it is not\nexplicitly mentioned.\nProblem\nHandling\nComprehension\nDoes the response fulfill the requirements\nof the instruction by providing relevant in-\nformation especially when the instruction\nis complex and includes multiple require-\nments? This includes responding in accor-\ndance with the explicit and implicit pur-\npose of given instruction.\nIf asked to evaluate the pros and cons\nof a particular policy, a model demon-\nstrating strong Comprehension would\ndiscuss the potential benefits and draw-\nbacks of the policy.\nInsightfulness\nIs the response creative, original or novel,\nincluding new perspectives or interpreta-\ntions of existing information?\nWhen discussing potential trends in\nfashion, an insightful response could\nsuggest a unique style or combination\nbased on past trends and current pref-\nerences.\nCompleteness\nDoes the response provide a sufficient ex-\nplanation? Comprehensiveness and thor-\noughness of the response should be con-\nsidered, which depends on the breadth of\ntopics covered and the level of detail pro-\nvided within each topic.\nWhen asked to describe how photo-\nsynthesis works, a complete response\nshould explain the process, including\nthe roles of sunlight, water, and carbon\ndioxide in producing glucose and oxy-\ngen.\nMetacognition\nDid the model respond with awareness of\nits own capability?\nDid the model ac-\nknowledge the uncertainty in ambiguous or\nuncertain instructions, and disclose its lim-\nitations when it lacked the necessary infor-\nmation or limited capability to provide a\nreliable response?\nIf asked a question beyond their\nknowledge, a metacognitively-aware\nmodel might respond, \u201dI am unsure\nof the answer, but I could suggest re-\nsources for further research.\u201d\nUser\nAlignment\nReadability\nIs the response structured to promote read-\nability and coherence? Does the response\nexhibit excellent organization?\nWhen asked to explain a complex\ntopic, a readable response would in-\nclude logical explanations, appropriate\nparagraph breaks, and a coherent flow\nof ideas.\nConciseness\nIs the response presented in a concise man-\nner for the reader without any unnecessary\ninformation?\nWhen asked to define a term, a concise\nresponse would provide a clear, brief\ndefinition without including unrelated\ndetails.\nHarmlessness\nDoes the model\u2019s response refrain from bi-\nases tied to gender, race, ethnicity, or re-\nligion? Moreover, does it consider poten-\ntial risks to user safety, avoiding provision\nof responses that could potentially result in\nphysical harm or endangerment?\nWhen discussing controversial topics,\na harmless response would be neutral,\nevidence-based, and sensitive to di-\nverse perspectives.\nTable 11: Skill Categorization of FLASK.\n38\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nHumanities\nLanguage\nSocial\nScience\nHistory\nCulture\nTechnology\nCoding\nMath\nNatural\nScience\nHealth\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nVicuna 13B\nWizardLM 13B\nGPT-3.5\n(a) Domain Comparison via FLASK\nRobustness\nCorrectness\nEfficiency\nFactuality\nCommonsense\nComprehension\nInsightfulness\nCompleteness\nMetacognition\nReadability\nConciseness\nHarmlessness\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4.5\nVicuna 13B\nWizardLM 13B\nGPT-3.5\n(b) Skill Comparison via FLASK-HARD\nFigure 29: (Left) The performance comparison between GPT-3.5, VICUNA, and WIZARDLM for\neach skill on the FLASK-HARD evaluation set.

RL algorithms\naim to devise effective strategies by maximizing cumulative rewards from interactions with the envi-\nronment. This approach has led to remarkable achievements in diverse fields, including gaming and\nrobotics (Silver et al., 2014; Schulman et al., 2016; Lillicrap et al., 2016; Mnih et al., 2016). These\nalgorithms often comprise multiple components that are essential for training and adapting neural\npolicies. For example, model-based RL involves learning a model of the world (Racani\u00e8re et al.,\n2017; Hafner et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020) while most model-free pol-\nicy gradient methods train a value or Q-network to control the variance of the gradient update (Mnih\net al., 2013; Schulman et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2018; Hessel et al., 2018). Training these multi-\nfaceted networks poses challenges due to their nested nature (Boyan & Moore, 1994; Anschel et al.,\n2017) and the necessity to extract meaningful features from state-action spaces, coupled with assign-\ning appropriate credit in complex decision-making scenarios. Consequently, these factors contribute\nto fragile learning procedures, high sensitivity to hyperparameters, and limitations on the network\u2019s\nparameter capacity (Islam et al., 2017; Henderson et al., 2018; Engstrom et al., 2020).\nTo address these challenges, various auxiliary tasks have been proposed, including pre-training\ndifferent networks to solve various tasks, such as forward or backward dynamics learning (Ha &\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n1\narXiv:2307.10936v2  [cs.AI]  4 Dec 2023\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nSchmidhuber, 2018; Schwarzer et al., 2021) as well as using online contrastive learning to disen-\ntangle feature extraction from task-solving (Laskin et al., 2020; Nachum & Yang, 2021; Eysenbach\net al., 2022). Alternatively, pre-training agents from a static dataset via offline RL without requiring\ninteraction with the environment also enables robust policies to be deployed for real applications.\nMost of these approaches rely either on conservative policy optimization (Fujimoto & Gu, 2021;\nKumar et al., 2020) or supervised training on state-action-rewards trajectory inputs where the trans-\nformer architecture has proven to be particularly powerful (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021).\nRecently, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pre-training neural net-\nworks in various domains including NLP (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron\net al., 2023), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021; He et al., 2022) or bi-\nology (Lin et al., 2023; Dalla-Torre et al., 2023), especially when combined with the transformer\narchitecture. Inspired by impressive NLP results with the transformer architecture applied to se-\nquential discrete data, most self-supervised techniques use tokenization, representing input data as a\nsequence of discrete elements called tokens. Once the data is transformed, first principle objectives\nsuch as mask modeling (Devlin et al., 2018) or next token prediction (Brown et al., 2020) can be\nused for self-supervised training of the model. In RL, recent works have explored the use of self-\nsupervised learning to pre-train transformer networks with expert data. While these investigations\nhave yielded exciting outcomes, such as zero-shot capabilities and transfer learning between envi-\nronments, methods such as MTM (Wu et al., 2023) and SMART (Sun et al., 2023) often rely on\nhighly specific masking techniques and masking schedules (Liu et al., 2022a), and explore transfer\nlearning across a limited number of tasks. Hence, further exploration of this class of methods is war-\nranted. In this paper, we provide a general study of the different self-supervised objectives and of the\ndifferent tokenization techniques. In addition, we outline a standardized set of downstream tasks for\nevaluating the transfer learning performance of pre-trained models, ranging from behavioral cloning\nto offline RL, robustness to sensor failure, and adaptation to changing dynamics.\nOur contributions. With this objective in mind, we introduce the PASTA study, which stands\nfor pretrained action-state transformer agents. This study provides comprehensive comparisons that\ninclude four pre-training objectives, two tokenization techniques, four pre-training datasets, and 7\ndownstream tasks. These tasks are categorized into three groups and span four continuous control\nenvironments. The PASTA downstream tasks encompass imitation learning and standard RL to\ndemonstrate the versatility of the pre-trained models. In addition, we explore scenarios involving\nfour physical regime changes and 11 observation alterations to assess the robustness of the pre-\ntrained representations. Finally, we assess the zero-shot performance of the models for predictions\nrelated to decision-making. We summarize the key findings of our study below:\n1. Tokenize trajectories at the component level. Tokenization at the component level signif-\nicantly outperforms tokenization at the modality level. In other words, it is more effective\nto tokenize trajectories based on the individual components of the state and action vectors,\nrather than directly tokenizing states and actions as is commonly done in existing works.\n2. Prefer first principle objectives over convoluted ones. First principle training objectives,\nsuch as random masking or next-token prediction with standard hyperparameters match or\noutperform more intricate and task-specific objectives carefully designed for RL, such as\nthose considered in MTM or SMART.\n3. Pre-train the same model on datasets from multiple domains. Simultaneously pre-\ntraining the model on datasets from the four environments leads to enhanced performance\nacross all four environments compared to training separate models for each environment.\n4. Generalize with a small parameter count. All of the examined models have fewer than 7\nmillion parameters. Hence, while these approaches are both affordable and practical even\non limited hardware resources, the above findings are corroborated by experimentation with\nfour transfer learning scenarios: a) probing (the pre-trained models generate embeddings\nand only the policy heads are trained to address downstream tasks), b) last layer fine-tuning\n(only the last layer of the pre-trained model is fine-tuned), c) full fine-tuning and d) zero-\nshot transfer.\n2\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nFigure 1: Illustration of the PASTA study. Left: State-action trajectories are collected from multiple\nenvironments and are tokenized at the component level. Middle: A transformer model is pre-\ntrained by processing fixed-size chunks of these sequences. It learns latent representations T(s)\nof the environments\u2019 states. In this study, we compare different tokenization schemes, masking\npatterns, and pre-training objectives, e.g., random tokens prediction (BERT) or next token prediction\n(GPT). Right: The representations of the pre-trained transformer models are evaluated on multiple\ndownstream tasks in which the learned representation T(s) serves as a surrogate state for the policy.\nDifferent fine-tuning methods are investigated: probing, last-layer fine-tuning and full fine-tuning.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nSelf-supervised Learning for RL.\nSelf-supervised learning, which trains models using unlabeled\ndata, has achieved notable success in various control domains (Liu & Abbeel, 2021; Yuan et al.,\n2022; Laskin et al., 2022). One effective approach is contrastive self-prediction (Chopra et al., 2005;\nLe-Khac et al., 2020; Yang & Nachum, 2021; Banino et al., 2021) which have proven effective\nin efficient data augmentation strategies, enabling downstream task solving through fine-tuning,\nparticularly in RL tasks (Laskin et al., 2020; Nachum & Yang, 2021). Our study aligns with this\ntrend, focusing on domain-agnostic self-supervised mechanisms that leverage masked predictions to\npre-train general-purpose RL networks.\nOffline RL and Imitation Learning.\nOffline learning for control involves leveraging historical\ndata from a fixed behavior policy \u03c0b to learn a reward-maximizing policy in an unknown envi-\nronment. Offline RL methods are typically designed to restrict the learned policy from producing\nout-of-distribution actions or constrain the learning process within the support of the dataset. Most\nof these methods usually leverage importance sampling (Sutton et al., 2016; Nair et al., 2020; Liu\net al., 2022b) or incorporate explicit policy constraints (Kumar et al., 2019; Fujimoto & Gu, 2021;\nFakoor et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2023). In contrast, Imitation learning (IL) focuses on learning poli-\ncies by imitating expert demonstrations. Behavior cloning (BC) involves training a policy to mimic\nexpert actions directly while Inverse RL (Ng et al., 2000) aims to infer the underlying reward func-\ntion to train policies that generalize well to new situations. In contrast, the models investigated in\nPASTA focus on learning general reward-free representations that can accelerate and facilitate the\ntraining of any off-the-shelf offline RL or IL algorithm.\nMasked Predictions and Transformers in RL.\nRecently, self-supervised learning techniques\nbased on next token prediction (Brown et al., 2020) and random masked predictions (Devlin et al.,\n2018) have gained popularity. These methods involve predicting missing content by masking por-\ntions of the input sequence. These first principle pre-training methods have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in various domains, including NLP (Radford et al., 2018; 2019), computer vision (Dosovit-\nskiy et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021; Van Den Oord et al., 2017), and robotics (Driess et al., 2023). We\nexplore the effectiveness of different variants of these approaches, with various masking patterns and\npre-training objectives, in modeling RL trajectories and learning representations of state-action vec-\ntor components. Transformer networks have been particularly valuable for these purposes. The de-\n3\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\ncision transformer (Chen et al., 2021) and trajectory transformer (Janner et al., 2021) have emerged\nas offline RL approaches using a causal transformer architecture to fit a reward-conditioned policy,\npaving the way for subsequent work (Zheng et al., 2022; Yamagata et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022a; Lee\net al., 2023; Badrinath et al., 2023). Notably, GATO (Reed et al., 2022) is a multi-modal behavioral\ncloning method that directly learns policies, while PASTA focuses on pre-training self-supervised\nrepresentations. Additionally, MTM (Wu et al., 2023) and SMART (Sun et al., 2023) propose orig-\ninal masking objectives for pre-training transformers in RL. MTM randomly masks tokens while\nensuring some tokens are predicted without future context. It uses modality-level masking and is\nlimited to single-domain pre-training. Conversely, SMART uses a three-fold objective for pre-\ntraining a decision transformer with forward-dynamics prediction, inverse-dynamics prediction, and\n\"random masked hindsight control\" with a curriculum masking schedule. It focuses on processing\nreal-valued visual observation sequences and investigates generalization across different domains.\nIn PASTA, we compare several first principle pre-training objectives without a masking schedule to\nthese state-of-the-art approaches across multiple environments and diverse downstream tasks.\n3\nTHE PASTA STUDY\n3.1\nPRELIMINARIES\nSelf-supervised\nLearning\nframework.\nIn\nthis\npaper,\nwe\nstudy\nself-supervised\nlearn-\ning (Balestriero et al., 2023) techniques to pre-train models on a large corpus of static (of-\nfline) datasets from interactions with simulated environments, as done in Shah & Kumar (2021);\nSchwarzer et al. (2023). By solving pre-training objectives, such as predicting future states or filling\nin missing information, the models learn to extract meaningful features that capture the underlying\nstructure of the data. We focus our study on the use of the transformer architecture due to its ability\nto model long-range dependencies and capture complex patterns in sequential data. In addition, the\nattention mechanism is designed to consider the temporal and intra-modality (position in the state or\naction vectors) dependencies. After pre-training the models, we evaluate their capabilities to solve\ndownstream tasks. This analysis is done through the lenses of three mechanisms: (i) probing, (ii)\nfine-tuning, and (iii) zero-shot transfer. The goal of the study is to investigate which pre-training\nprocess makes the model learn the most generalizable representations to provide a strong founda-\ntion for adaptation and learning in specified environments. An illustration of the approach adopted\nin PASTA is given in Figure 1.\nReinforcement Learning framework.\nIn this paper, we place ourselves in the Markov De-\ncision Processes (Puterman, 1994) framework.\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a tuple\nM = {S ,A ,P,R,\u03b3}, where S is the state space, A is the action space, P is the transition kernel,\nR is the bounded reward function and \u03b3 \u2208 [0,1) is the discount factor. Let \u03c0 denote a stochastic pol-\nicy mapping states to distributions over actions. We place ourselves in the infinite-horizon setting,\ni.e., we seek a policy that optimizes J(\u03c0) = E\u03c0[\u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b3tr(st,at)]. The value of a state is the quantity\nV \u03c0(s) = E\u03c0[\u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b3tr(st,at)|s0 = s] and the value of a state-action pair Q\u03c0(s,a) of performing action\na in state s and then following policy \u03c0 is defined as: Q\u03c0(s,a) = E\u03c0 [\u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b3tr(st,at)|s0 = s,a0 = a].\n3.2\nCOMPONENT-LEVEL TOKENIZATION\nA key focus of the PASTA study is the representation of trajectories at the component-level for\nstates and actions (i.e., one state component corresponds to one token, as depicted in the middle\npanel of Figure 1) rather than at the modality-level (i.e., one state corresponds to one token). Most\nprevious work, including SMART (Sun et al., 2023) and MTM (Wu et al., 2023) focus on the\nmodality-level and consider each trajectory as a sequence of state, action (and often return) tuples,\nwhile an alternative is to break the sequences down into individual state and action components.\nMoreover, for the purpose of this study, we exclude the return to focus on general methods applicable\nto reward-free settings that learn representations not tied to task-specific rewards (Stooke et al.,\n2021; Yarats et al., 2021). Based on our experimental results, we argue that the component-level\nlevel tokenization allows capturing dynamics and dependencies at different space scales, as well as\nthe interplay between the agent\u2019s morphological actions and the resulting states. As we observe\nin Section 4, this results in more generalizable representations that improve the performance of\ndownstream tasks across different robotic structures.\n4\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nFigure 2: Performance aggregation of the component-level tokenization models (C-*) and modality-\nlevel models (MTM and SMART) with different masking and training objectives. In (a) we report\nthe Interquartile Mean (IQM) of the expert normalized score, computed with stratified bootstrap\nconfidence intervals (CI), obtained in the four fine-tuning downstream tasks over 5 seeds and in (b)\nthe zero-shot transfer tasks: Action Prediction (AP), Forward Prediction (FP), and Inverse Predic-\ntion (IP) with 95% CI. Results are aggregated over all four environments. We developed our own\nimplementation of MTM and SMART using the same masking patterns and training objectives. \u2191\n(resp. \u2193) indicates that higher (resp. lower) is better.\n3.3\nPRE-TRAINING\nTrajectory modeling.\nThe PASTA study includes different types of self-supervised learning\nstrategies, each using different combinations of random token masking and/or next token prediction.\nNext token prediction uses autoregressive masking, while random masked prediction aims to learn\nfrom a sequence of trajectory tokens denoted as \u03c4 = (s0\n0,...,sK\n0 ,a0\n0,...,aL\n0,...,s0\nT,...,sK\nT ). The model\u2019s\ntask is to reconstruct this sequence when presented with a masked version \u02c6\u03c4 = T\u03b8(Masked(\u03c4)),\nwhere K is the observation space size, L is the action space size and T is an arbitrary trajectory\nsize. Here, T\u03b8 refers to a bi-directional transformer, and Masked(\u03c4) represents a modified view\nof \u03c4 where certain elements in the sequence are masked. For instance, a masked view could be\n(s0\n0,...,sK\n0 ,a0\n0,...,aL\n0,...,_,...,_), where the underscore \u201c_\u201d symbol denotes a masked element.\nPre-training objectives.\nNext, we introduce the masking patterns investigated in the experimen-\ntal study. First, the C-GPT masking pattern mimics GPT\u2019s masking mechanism and uses causal\n(backward-looking) attention to predict the next unseen token in RL trajectories. Second, we have\nthe C-BERT masking pattern, derived from BERT\u2019s masking mechanism which uses random masks\nto facilitate diverse learning signals from each trajectory by enabling different combinations. Fig-\nure 1 provides a visual representation of the C-BERT and C-GPT masking mechanisms. Third,\nthe MTM masking scheme (Wu et al., 2023) combines random masking (similar to BERT) and\ncausal prediction of the last elements of the trajectory. This latter aims to prevent the model from\noverly relying on future token information. While MTM operates at the modality level, we adapt it\nto operate directly on components by masking random tokens within the trajectory and additionally\nmasking a certain proportion of the last tokens. We refer to this method as C-MTM, which stands for\ncomponent-level MTM. Finally, SMART\u2019s training objective encompasses three different masking\npatterns (Sun et al., 2023): forward-dynamics, inverse-dynamics and masked hindsight control. The\ntraining involves adding up the three losses corresponding to the three masking patterns. Similarly,\nwe derive C-SMART, where instead of masking an entire modality at each stage, we mask a random\nfraction of the tokens within that modality. See Appendix C for additional details.\n3.4\nDOWNSTREAM EVALUATION\nIn this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of PASTA models in transfer learning from two perspec-\ntives. Firstly, we examine the ability of pre-trained models to generate high-quality representations.\nThis evaluation is carried out through probing, full fine-tuning and last layer fine-tuning. Secondly,\nwe investigate the capability of pre-trained models to solve new tasks in a zero-shot transfer set-\nting. To accomplish this, we introduce two sets of tasks: Representation learning tasks (4) and\nZero-shot transfer tasks (3), comprising a total of 7 evaluation downstream tasks. These task sets\n5\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nare further divided into sub-categories. These categories are designed to provide a general-purpose\nassessment for pre-trained agents, irrespective of the specific environment or domain.\nFigure 3: (a) Performance profile of models after full fine-tuning, last layer fine-tuning, no fine-\ntuning (probing), and RL policies trained from raw observations. Shaded areas show bootstrapped\nconfidence intervals over 5 seeds and 256 rollouts. (b) Evaluation in all downstream tasks with\nmulti- and single-domain pre-training, no-pretraining and training from raw observations. Remark-\nably, multi-domain pre-training performs better or on par with single-domain pre-training, despite\nbeing trained on the same amount of data.\nRepresentation learning.\nThe representation learning tasks encompass four sub-categories: Im-\nitation Learning, Offline RL, Sensor Failure, and Dynamics Change. We evaluate the quality of\nraw representations learned by pre-trained agents using probing on these tasks. In this setting, the\nweights of the pre-trained models are kept fixed, and the embeddings produced by the final attention\nlayer are fed into a single dense layer network. As the expressive power of such networks is limited,\nachieving good performance is contingent upon the embeddings containing sufficient information.\nFurthermore, we assess the quality of the produced representations through full fine-tuning and last\nlayer fine-tuning, where the weights of the pre-trained agents are further updated to solve the down-\nstream tasks. Fine-tuning just the last layer updates only a small fraction of the total weight volume\n(<1 million parameters), enhancing memory efficiency and lowering the computational resources\nrequired.\nZero-shot transfer.\nThe zero-shot tasks are organized into three categories: Action Prediction\n(AP), Forward dynamics Prediction (FP), and Inverse dynamics Prediction (IP). These categories\nevaluate the pre-trained models\u2019 ability to directly predict states or actions based on trajectory infor-\nmation. Specifically, the prediction problems can be expressed as follows; AP: (\u03c4t\u22121,st \u2192 at), FP:\n(\u03c4t\u22121,st,at \u2192 st+1) and IP: (\u03c4t\u22121,st,st+1 \u2192 at), where the input to the model is shown on the left\nside of the parentheses, and the prediction target is shown on the right side. For each category, we\nexamine both component prediction and modality (state or action) prediction.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we present the experimental study conducted to examine the impact of pre-training\nobjectives, tokenization, and dataset preparation choices on the generalization capabilities of pre-\ntrained PASTA models.\n4.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nDomains.\nTo assess the effectiveness of our approach, we select tasks from the Brax library (Free-\nman et al., 2021a), which provides environments designed to closely match (Freeman et al., 2021b)\nthe original versions found in MuJoCo\u2019s environment suite (Todorov et al., 2012). Brax provides\n6\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nTable 1: Comparison of agents using representations learned from modality-level tokenization,\ncomponent-level tokenization, and from an MLP policy network in the four representation learn-\ning downstream tasks.

More information about the environments is\ngiven in Appendix D.2. The pre-training datasets consist of trajectories collected from four Brax\nenvironments: HalfCheetah, Hopper, Walker2d and Ant. Following the protocols used in previous\nwork (Fu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2023), we trained 10 Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al.,\n2018) agents initialized with different seeds and collected single- and multi-domain datasets com-\nposed of 680 million tokens in total. For details about the pre-training datasets, we refer the reader\nto Appendix D.3.\nConsequently, the 7 downstream tasks presented in Section 3 are set up for each environment re-\nsulting in a total of 28 tasks across environments. The reason we introduce multiple environments\nfor pre-training and evaluation is (i) to evaluate the reproducibility of our findings across domains\nand (ii) to study the performance of models pre-trained on the four datasets simultaneously (multi-\ndomains model) compared to specialized single-domain models. For further details about the im-\nplementation of downstream tasks, please refer to Appendix D.4.\nImplementation details.\nIn this study, we focus on reasonably sized and efficient models, typi-\ncally consisting of around 7 million parameters. To capture positional information effectively, we\nincorporate a learned positional embedding layer at the component level. Additionally, we include\na rotary position encoding layer following the approach in Su et al. (2021) to account for relative\npositional information. More implementation details are provided in Appendix B. To convert the\ncollected data (state or action components) into tokens, we adopt a tokenization scheme similar\nto Reed et al. (2022). Continuous values are mu-law encoded to the range [-1, 1] and discretized\ninto 1024 uniform bins. The sequence order follows observation tokens followed by action tokens,\nwith transitions arranged in timestep order.\nBaselines\nTo put in perspective the performance attained by the different pre-trained models, we\ncompare them with a simple MLP architecture, that learns directly from the raw observations with\nno pre-training. For fairness, the architecture and parameters of the MLP have been tuned by taking\nthe best performance independently on each domain and on each downstream task.\n7\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\n4.2\nRESULTS\nComponent-level Tokenization.\nOur initial analysis probes the influence of tokenization detail \u2013\nhow finely we dissect the data \u2013 on the models\u2019 ability to generalize. We scrutinize this by training\nmodels using both the SMART and MTM protocols at two levels of granularity: modality-level\n(predicting entire observations and actions) for SMART and MTM, and component-level (focus-\ning on individual observation and action elements) for C-SMART and C-MTM. Despite sharing\nidentical architectures and training conditions, and being trained on the same multi-domain dataset,\nthe models\u2019 fine-tuning performances vary. As depicted in Figure 2 (a), a shift from modality-level\nto component-level tokenization markedly enhances model performance across a spectrum of tasks,\nincluding Imitation Learning, Offline RL, variations of Sensor Failure, and Dynamics Change tasks.\nFurthermore, Table 1 provides a breakdown of performance for both tokenization techniques across\ndifferent domains. Overall, we observe that transitioning from modality-level to component-level\ntokenization improves performance.\nMasking objectives.\nSubsequently, we compare fundamental tokenization approaches, i.e.,\nmasked language modeling (BERT) and next token prediction (GPT) against state-of-the-art trans-\nformer RL methods MTM and SMART which incorporate more tailored design choices. In the light\nof the previous section demonstrating the advantages of using component-level tokenization, we de-\nsign C-BERT and C-GPT which focus on individual observation and action elements. These mod-\nels are trained under similar conditions as C-SMART and C-MTM on the multi-domain dataset.\nWe systematically fine-tune all models for all downstream tasks and domains. Figure 2 (a) reveals\nthat C-BERT exhibits on average higher performance on the considered downstream tasks com-\npared to other masking schemes and training objectives. This demonstrates that simpler objectives\nare sufficient to achieve robust generalization performance. Based on C-BERT showing the best\nperformance among other models, it is selected for further analysis within this study.\nMulti-domain representation.\nWe now investigate the benefits of pre-training models on multi-\ndomain representations, using a granular, component-level tokenization approach. Figure 3 (b)\npresents an aggregated comparison of multi-domain and single-domain representation models across\nall tasks and domains, with each model being trained on the same number of tokens. We compare\nthese approaches with a randomly initialized model and our MLP policy network baseline. Our\nfindings confirm that policies trained with multi-domain representations using component-level to-\nkenization outperform policies trained from raw observations with neural networks comprised of an\nequivalent number of parameters (cf. Appendix D.1). This validates the capability of the model to\nproduce useful representations. We also compare the performance of multi-domain models against\na randomly initialized model (no pre-training) with the same architecture and confirm the positive\neffect of pre-training on the observed performance. Then, comparing multi-domain models against\nspecialized models trained in isolation for each environment, we show that specialized models are\nslightly outperformed in terms of final performance, suggesting that multi-domain models can com-\npress the information contained in the representation of the four domains into one single model by\nsharing most of the parameters between the different domains and without performance degrada-\ntion. Note that to ensure a fair comparison, all models were trained on the same amount of tokens\nand have the same representation capability (architecture and number of learned parameters). For\na detailed breakdown of the results for each downstream task, please refer to panels provided in\nAppendix A.1.\nFine-tuning.\nFigure 3 (a) presents the performance profiles for various fine-tuning strategies:\nprobing (the transformer\u2019s parameters are frozen), last layer fine-tuning (only the last layer\u2019s pa-\nrameters are trained) and full fine-tuning (all the parameters are trainable). We observe that full\nfine-tuning results in a higher fraction of runs achieving near-expert scores, followed by last-layer\nfine-tuning, MLP, and probing. We note that the performance of the probed model may initially seem\nunexpected, yet several underlying factors could contribute to this outcome. Primarily, it suggests\nthat the pre-training tasks may not align closely with the downstream tasks, leading to represen-\ntations that, although rich, are not directly applicable. This mirrors that of LLMs which require\ntask-specific fine-tuning for particular NLP applications. The results show that the fine-tuning pro-\ncess appears to bridge the gap between the generic representations and the specialized requirements\nof the downstream tasks.\n8\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nTable 2: Breakdown of Expert-normalized returns in the Sensor Failure and Dynamics Change tasks.\n(\u2191) indicates that higher is better.\nModel\nSensor Failure\nDynamics Change\nMulti-domain pre-training (\u2191)\n0.69\u00b10.01\n0.17\u00b10.01\nSingle-domain pre-training (\u2191)\n0.66\u00b10.01\n0.18\u00b10.01\nMLP (raw observations) (\u2191)\n0.41\u00b10.02\n0.11\u00b10.01\nNo pre-training (\u2191)\n0.55\u00b10.01\n0.16\u00b10.01\nRobust representations.\nIn this section, we focus on resilience to sensor failure and adaptability\nto dynamics change. These factors play a crucial role in real-world robotics scenarios, where sensor\nmalfunctions and environmental variations can pose risks and impact decision-making processes.\nWe used BC as the training algorithm and during evaluation, we systematically disabled each of\nthe 11 sensors individually by assigning a value of 0 to the corresponding coordinate in the state\nvector. In Table 2, multi-domain models exhibit higher performance compared to the baselines,\ndemonstrating their enhanced robustness in handling sensor failures. Furthermore, we introduced\nfour gravity changes during the inference phase, and the results reaffirm the resilience of multi-\ndomain learning in adapting to dynamics change, corroborating our previous findings.\nZero-shot predictions.\nIn this section, we extend our study into the zero-shot capabilities of pre-\ntrained models. We evaluated an additional suite of tasks, outlined in Section 3.4, originally intro-\nduced in MTM (He et al., 2022). Notably, Figure 2 (b) reveals that the errors in Action Prediction\n(AP), Forward Prediction (FP), and Inverse Prediction (IP) for C-GPT and C-BERT are on par with\nthose of more sophisticated models like C-MTM or C-SMART. This suggests that even simple pre-\ntraining objectives are well-aligned with the inference tasks, despite the models not being explicitly\ntrained for these tasks. Such findings reinforce the effectiveness of simple objective functions com-\nbined with straightforward masking patterns and component-level tokenization. Importantly, we\nnote that the masking strategy of C-BERT and C-GPT allows the emergence of competitive Ac-\ntion Prediction (AP) performance, which, according to the results in Figure 2 (a) is sufficient and\nindicative of strong downstream performance.\n5\nDISCUSSION\nThis paper introduces the PASTA study on Pretrained Action-State Transformer Agents, aiming\nto deeply investigate self-supervised learning models in reinforcement learning (RL). The study\ncontributes datasets, seven downstream tasks, and analyses across four training objectives and two\ntokenization methods. Conducted in four different continuous control environments, it showcases\nthe flexibility and efficacy of pre-trained models in transfer learning scenarios, including probing,\nfine-tuning, and zero-shot evaluation.\nOne key finding is the effectiveness of fundamental self-supervised objectives over more complex\nones. Simple tasks like random masking or next token prediction were as effective, if not more,\nthan bespoke RL objectives. Component-level tokenization also proved superior to modality-level,\nunderscoring the importance of nuanced tokenization for richer representations. Additionally, pre-\ntraining on multi-domain datasets led to better performance than domain-specific models, demon-\nstrating the value of cross-domain knowledge transfer. Additionally, the investigation in Section 4.2\nhighlighted the importance of developing such models that can effectively adapt and make deci-\nsions in the presence of sensor failures or dynamic changes, ensuring safety and mitigating risks in\nrobotics applications.\nOverall, the findings from this study provide valuable guidance to researchers interested in leverag-\ning self-supervised learning to improve RL in complex decision-making tasks. The models presented\nin this study are relatively lightweight, enabling the replication of both pre-training and fine-tuning\nexperiments on readily available hardware. In future work, we anticipate further exploration of self-\nsupervised objectives, tokenization methods, and a broader spectrum of tasks to evaluate adaptability\nand robustness, enhancing the practical applicability of pre-trained agents in real-world scenarios.\n9\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\n6\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nResearch supported with Cloud TPUs from Google\u2019s TPU Research Cloud (TRC).\n10\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nREFERENCES\nOron Anschel, Nir Baram, and Nahum Shimkin.

We repeat-\nedly trained all methods with 5 different random seeds and evaluated them using 256 rollouts.\nB\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nIn the sequence tokenization phase, we do not use return conditioning but since the representation\nmodels are pre-trained on multiple environments and tasks, we use environment conditioning, i.e.,\nduring training, an environment token is appended at the beginning of the sequences in each batch,\nproviding the model with additional contextual information. In practice, the length of the last two\nmodalities (state and action concatenated) varies across different environments. Therefore, the max-\nimum portion of masked tokens at the end of the sequence differs depending on the environment.\nFor instance, in the Hopper environment with 3 actions and 11 observation tokens, the maximum\nportion of masked tokens is 14, while in HalfCheetah with 6 actions and 18 observation tokens,\nit is 24. Additionally, as we maintain a fixed-size context window of 128, the sequences\u2019 starting\npoints will have varying truncations for different environments, ensuring a non-truncated state at the\nend of the window. Another design choice is the embedding aggregation, i.e., how to come from a\ncontext_window x embedding_dimension tensor to a 1 x embedding_dimension tensor. We decided\nto use take the embedding from the last observed token.\n16\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nComputational Cost.\nA significant advantage of the component-level sequencing approach is its\nreduced input dimension, allowing cheaper computational costs. By capturing the components of\nstates and actions at different time steps, the input space expands linearly rather than quadratically\nmitigating the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality. To illustrate this, consider a\nsimple example of a 2-dimensional state space with a discretization size of 9. With a component-\nlevel granularity, the input size becomes 2 \u00d7 9 = 18. In contrast, a state-level granularity results in\nan input size of 9 \u00d7 9 = 81. The former exhibits linear growth within the observation space, while\nthe latter demonstrates quadratic growth. Moreover, while it effectively multiplies the length of the\ninput sequence by the average number of components in a state, this drawback is absorbed by the\nincreased context window of transformer models. Lastly, for an equal number of trajectories, the\nnumber of tokens is also trivially larger than that with a state- and action-level granularity.\nC\nADDITIONAL DETAILS ON MASKING PATTERNS\nIn this section, we provide further details on the masking patterns and schedule used in the\nSMART (Sun et al., 2023) and MTM (Wu et al., 2023) baselines. In C-GPT or C-BERT, we\nfocused on reducing the technicalities to their minimum: a simple masking pattern, i.e., GPT-like or\nBERT-like, and no masking schedule.\nIn SMART, the objective involves three components: Forward Dynamics Prediction, Inverse Dy-\nnamics Prediction, and Random Masked Hindsight Control. The masking schedule involves two\nmasking sizes, k and k\u2032, which determine the number of masked actions and observations during\npre-training. The masking schedule for actions (k) is designed to gradually increase the difficulty of\nthe random masked hindsight control task. It starts with k = 1, ensuring the model initially predicts\nmasked actions based on a single observed action. As training progresses, the value of k is increased\nin a curriculum fashion. The masking schedule for observations (k\u2032) ensures that the model learns\nto predict masked actions based on a revealed subsequence of observations and actions, rather than\nrelying solely on local dynamics. Similar to the action masking schedule, k\u2032 starts at 1 and gradu-\nally increases during training. SMART\u2019s paper suggests that the masking schedule is essential for\neffective pre-training in control environments. By gradually increasing the masking difficulty, the\nmodel is exposed to a range of training scenarios, starting with simple local dynamics and gradually\ntransitioning to complex long-term dependencies.\nIn MTM, the masking pattern is implemented by requiring at least one token in the masked sequence\nto be autoregressive, which means it must be predicted based solely on previous tokens, and all\nfuture tokens are masked. In addition, MTM uses a modality-specific encoder to elevate the raw\ntrajectory inputs to a common representation space for the tokens. Finally, MTM is trained with a\nrange (between 0.0 and 0.6) of randomly sampled masking ratios.\nD\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND HYPERPARAMETERS\nIn this section, we provide more details about the experiments, including hyperparameter configura-\ntion and details of each environment (e.g., version). For all experiments, we run 256 rollouts with 5\ndifferent random seeds and report the mean and stratified bootstrap confidence intervals.\nD.1\nFAIR COMPARISON\nTo ensure a fair comparison between the representation models using an MLP or a transformer\narchitecture, we made sure to have a comparable number of parameters. Both models consist of a\nminimum of three layers with a size of 256 for the baseline, while transformer models use a single\nlayer with a hidden size of 512 for the policy. We tested bigger architecture for the MLP without\nperformance gain.\nMoreover, we choose to fine-tune the MLP baselines to achieve the best performance in each en-\nvironment. In contrast, we use the same set of hyperparameters for all domains involving PASTA\nmodels. This approach puts PASTA models at a slight disadvantage while holding the promise of\npotentially achieving even better performance with the PASTA methods with further hyperparame-\nter tuning.\n17\nAccepted at the Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2023\nFinally, when a pre-trained model is involved, we always select the final checkpoint after the fixed\n3 epochs done over the pre-training dataset.\nD.2\nENVIRONMENT DETAILS\nFigure 5: Continuous Control Downstream Tasks.\nFor all experiments, we use the 0.0.15 version of Brax (Freeman et al., 2021a). Each environment\nin Brax, illustrated in Figure 5, provides a realistic physics simulation, enabling agents to interact\nwith objects and the environment in a physically plausible manner. The tasks studied in this paper\nfeature (i) a HalfCheetah robot (Wawrzy\u00b4nski, 2009) with 9 links and 8 joints. The objective is to\napply torques on the joints to make the cheetah run forward as fast as possible. The action space for\nthe agents consists of a 6-element vector representing torques applied between the different links;\n(ii) a Hopper robot (Erez et al., 2011) which is a two-dimensional one-legged figure consisting of\nfour main body parts: the torso, thigh, leg, and foot. The objective is to make hops in the forward\ndirection by applying torques on the hinges connecting the body parts. The action space for the\nagent is a 3-element vector representing the torques applied to the thigh, leg, and foot joints; (iii) a\nWalker robot (Erez et al., 2011) which is a two-dimensional two-legged figure comprising a single\ntorso at the top, two thighs below the torso, two legs below the thighs, and two feet attached to\nthe legs. The objective is to coordinate the movements of both sets of feet, legs, and thighs to\nachieve forward motion in the right direction. The action space for the agent is a 6-element vector\nrepresenting the torques applied to the thigh, leg, foot, left thigh, left leg, and left foot joints; (iv)\nan Ant robot (Schulman et al., 2016) which is a one torso body with four legs attached to it with\neach leg having two body parts. The objective is to coordinate the movements of the four legs to\nachieve forward motion in the right direction. The action space for the agent is an 8-element vector\nrepresenting the torques applied at the hinge joints.\nD.3\nDATASET DETAILS\nIn this section, we provide further detail on the collection of the datasets.\nWe trained 10\nSAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) agents for a total of 5 million timesteps in each of the four environ-\nments. From each, we select the 20% latest trajectories of size 1000, resulting in a combined total\nof 40 million transitions. With each environment comprising different observation and action sizes,\nthe overall multi-domain dataset is composed of 680 million tokens. We also have one dataset for\neach domain.\nNext, we give the hyperparameters of the SAC agents used to collect the pre-training trajectories.\nThese are given in Table 3.\nWe also provide a concrete example of the state and action components with their corresponding\nproperties for the simplest robot structure, Hopper. The number of components for each property\nis given in parentheses. In this case, the action space consists of torques applied to the rotors (3),\nwhile the observation space includes the following components: z-coordinate of the top (1), angle\n(4), velocity (2), and angular velocity (4).\nD.4\nDOWNSTREAM TASKS DETAILS\nIn this section, we provide the hyperparameters used in the training of the imitation learning algo-\nrithm Behavioural Cloning (BC) (Table 4) and the offline RL algorithm TD3-BC (Table 5).\nThen, we give additional details about the Sensor Failures downstream task.

However, the raw web data is noisy, and existing filtering methods to\nreduce noise often come at the expense of data diversity. Our work focuses on caption quality\nas one major source of noise, and studies how generated captions can increase the utility of\nweb-scraped datapoints with nondescript text. Through exploring different mixing strategies for\nraw and generated captions, we outperform the best filtering method proposed by the DataComp\nbenchmark by 2% on ImageNet and 4% on average across 38 tasks, given a candidate pool of 128M\nimage-text pairs. Our best approach is also 2\u00d7 better at Flickr and MS-COCO retrieval. We then\nanalyze what makes synthetic captions an effective source of text supervision. In experimenting\nwith different image captioning models, we also demonstrate that the performance of a model\non standard image captioning benchmarks (e.g., NoCaps CIDEr) is not a reliable indicator of\nthe utility of the captions it generates for multimodal training. Finally, our experiments with\nusing generated captions at DataComp\u2019s large scale (1.28B image-text pairs) offer insights into\nthe limitations of synthetic text, as well as the importance of image curation with increasing\ntraining data quantity. The generated captions used in our experiments are now available on\nHuggingFace6.\n1\nIntroduction\nPre-training large multimodal models on image-text pairs sourced from the web has become a\nstandard approach to obtaining high performance on vision tasks [3, 24, 37, 40]. However, raw web\ndata can be noisy or uninformative (Figure 1). Many existing data preprocessing efforts revolve\naround human-defined heuristics based on image and text content separately\u2014e.g., caption length,\npresence of nouns, sentence complexity, image aspect ratio, minimum image size [8, 10, 46, 47]\u2014or\nthe reliability of the data source [14]. More complex filtering approaches target poorly aligned\nimage-text pairs, by using trained CLIP models [40] to rank the cosine similarity score between\nimage and text embeddings [46], or ensuring mentions of image objects in the captions [47]. These\napproaches discard between 60% to 90% of the initial data collected, regardless of whether the\nimages themselves are suitable for training.\nIn this work, we seek to restore the utility of such discarded examples with the help of synthetic\ncaptions. To do so, we leverage the DataComp benchmark [18], where initial data processing is kept\nto a minimum, i.e. only filtering out NSFW examples and train-test overlap. This allows us to\n1University of Washington.\nCorrespondence to thaottn@cs.washington.edu\n2Columbia University\n3Google Research\n4Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence\n5LAION\n6 https://huggingface.co/datasets/thaottn/DataComp_medium_pool_BLIP2_captions,\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/thaottn/DataComp_large_pool_BLIP2_captions\n1\narXiv:2307.10350v2  [cs.LG]  26 Oct 2023\nFigure 1: Raw captions crawled from the web contain significant noise; cosine similarity filtering\nhelps reduce noise but discards many images that are useful for training. Here we show some images\nthat would be filtered out if only the top 30% examples from the candidate pool with highest image-text\ncosine similarities are used for training. In these pairs, captions generated by BLIP2 tend to be more faithful\nto the respective images compared to raw captions obtained from the Internet. In Appendix A, we show 20\nother samples drawn completely at random from the discarded pool.\nperform controlled experiments on the raw Common Crawl data and bypass subjective human-design\nchoices that may be employed in the creation of other datasets (e.g., LAION-5B [46]). We study\nseveral image captioning models and find that recent releases (e.g., BLIP2 [30] and OpenCLIP-CoCa\n[38]) can generate captions that improve CLIP training and lead to a significant boost in zero-shot\nperformance over existing data curation methods. In particular, at the medium scale (128M samples\nseen), training on the entire candidate pool with synthetic captions is sufficient to outperform\ncommon filtering baselines that are applied to raw data (e.g., selecting top 30% examples with\nhighest image-text cosine similarity based on OpenAI\u2019s CLIP-ViT/L14). Section 5 describes our\nexperiments with a variety of mixing strategies to combine signals from both raw and synthetic text.\nTo explain the performance benefits of synthetic captions, we measure caption noise and diversity in\nvarious training sets, and demonstrate the importance of both factors in achieving good performance.\nWhile existing data filtering methods are effective at reducing noise, they also hurt the diversity of\nthe original training data in the process (e.g., by reducing concept coverage). Synthetic captions\nhelp alleviate this drop in diversity by increasing the number of useful captions available for training.\nIn Section 6, we analyze various properties of caption data, as well as specific advantages of training\nwith synthetic captions (e.g., improved retrieval capabilities).\nRemarkably, our empirical investigation in Section 4 shows that choosing a captioning model to\nyield competitive downstream performance is non-trivial, as better performance on image captioning\nbenchmarks does not necessarily mean better generated captions for CLIP training. We also note\nthat while this work focuses on the quality of captions used in multimodal training, image quality is\nanother equally important topic of study. As the size of the data pool we experiment with grows, we\nstart to observe changes in the relative importance of text quality versus image quality in building a\ngood pre-training dataset. We comment on this in Section 7.\nTo summarize, our findings serve as a first step towards improving the quality of web-scale datasets\n2\nvia the use of synthetic captions. In the process, we offer insights on several research directions:\n\u2022 What are the considerations for choosing a captioning model? We find that specializing a pre-\ntrained network towards image captioning via fine-tuning, and optimizing for high CIDEr score on\nstandard benchmarks in general, end up producing captions that are less effective for multimodal\ntraining. Reference-free captioning metrics (e.g., CLIP-S [21]) more reliably reflect the training\nquality of the generated captions.\n\u2022 How to combine signals from multiple sources of captions? We investigate different strategies for\nfiltering and mixing raw and synthetic captions. This leads to performance gains on DataComp\nbenchmark at small (12.8M pool size), medium (128M pool size) and large (1.28B pool size)\nscales, compared to existing approaches that utilize only raw data. On ImageNet, the performance\nbenefits diminish with scale. On retrieval tasks, however, the gains are significant across all scales.\n\u2022 What makes synthetic captions effective? Our analysis of text properties shows that on an individual\nlevel, synthetic captions are less noisy and contain more visual information. However, at the\npopulation level, synthetic captions are less diverse than raw captions. Consequently, using both\nsources of captions helps improve the overall caption quality, measured in terms of text diversity\nas well as image-text alignment.\n\u2022 How do benefits of synthetic captions scale? Unlike what was found in the original DataComp\nexperiments, given access to generated captions, the best filtering approach differs across scales.\nExperimenting with data quantities ranging from 12.8M to 1.28B also allows us to observe some\nlimitations of synthetic captions. We posit that image-based filtering, as well as the diversity gap\nbetween model-generated and web-scraped captions, play an increasingly important role in large\ndata regimes.\nMore broadly, our results have important implications for future work as additional progress (captured\nby the right metric) in image captioning can further enhance the quality of text used for vision-\nlanguage pre-training. Moreover, the effectiveness of synthetic captions unlocks another massive\nsource of training data: uncaptioned web images from Common Crawl. This can ultimately empower\nmore large-scale multimodal training by improving the availability of properly aligned and sufficiently\ndiverse image-text data.\n2\nRelated work\nSynthetic data.\nPrevious work has explored using synthetic data to create new datasets or\naugment existing ones [12, 15, 19, 25, 36, 41, 56, inter alia].\nCloser to our work, Azizi et al.\n[5], Bansal and Grover [6], He et al. [20] use image generation models to create synthetic images\nfor classification tasks. In the context of CLIP, Santurkar et al. [44] show that a model trained on\nsynthetic captions can outperform a model trained on human-provided captions. The captions were\ngenerated procedurally for the 120K images in the MS-COCO training set [11] using multi-object\nimage labels verified by Mechanical Turk workers, which would be difficult to obtain for web-scale\ndatasets like LAION-5B [46] or CommonPool [18] that are about four orders of magnitude larger.\nMost similar to our work is the LAION-COCO dataset [45], containing 600M image-text pairs\nfrom LAION-5B [46] with synthetic captions generated using BLIP [29] and ranked using CLIP\nmodels [23, 40]. While [45] heavily filters the raw data pool before generating captions, we work\nwith uncurated web datasets. In addition, the generated captions provided by LAION-COCO still\n3\nsignificantly lag behind the corresponding web-crawled captions when it comes to yielding good\nCLIP performance\u2014we provide empirical evidence and address this gap in Appendix G.\nImage captioning.\nBuilding models able to generate captions from images has been a long-\nstanding subject of research [13, 27, 28, 31, 52, 53, inter alia]. More recently, models like BLIP2\n[29, 30], Flamingo [3], and CoCa [38, 55] have made significant progress on this task. It is worth\nnoting that the training data for BLIP [29] and BLIP2 [30] contains synthetic captions, as the\nauthors find that this helps boost the captioning ability of the resulting model compared to training\non just noisy web data. Zhu et al. [57] couple large language models with image captioning models\nto generate more enriched image descriptions. We expect that as these image captioning systems\nbecome more capable, the impact of using synthetic data will bring larger improvements over existing\nnoisy image-text datasets.\nImproving image-text datasets.\nGiven the importance of the pre-training data for multimodal\nnetworks [17, 18, 33], several authors have proposed techniques for improving the quality of image-\ntext datasets. Radenovic et al. [39] propose a filtering technique called Complexity, Action, and\nText-spotting (CAT), designed to select only informative image-text pairs. Cao et al. [9] filter out\nsamples that contain text regions in the image and advocate for the benefits of increasing the number\nof samples given a fixed compute budget. Instead of discarding all text-spotting examples, Maini\net al. [32] proposes masking out the text part in the image and only removing image-text pairs in\nwhich the masked image contains no useful visual features. Abbas et al. [1] identify and remove\nsamples that are semantically similar to each other. Many image-text datasets also have their own\npreprocessing techniques, often not fully disclosed [10, 14, 24, 37, 40, 46]. All of these filtering\napproaches are complementary to the use of synthetic captions proposed by this work.\nConcurrent to our work, Fan et al. [16] present a form of data augmentation for training CLIP models\nwhere the captions are rewritten by a large language model. However, the rewriting process assumes\naccess to some raw text and is not conditioned on the images, which may limit its effectiveness\nwhen the original captions are not descriptive (e.g., see Figure 1). In contrast, our work uses image\ncaptioning models, which are able to generate relevant captions for images regardless of the original\ntext associated with them. We also work with raw Common Crawl data instead of preprocessed\ndatasets to study the trade-offs between raw and generated captions in a systematic manner. Finally,\nGadre et al. [18] introduces DataComp, a benchmark for designing better pre-training datasets for\nCLIP, which we use in experiments throughout the paper.\n3\nExperiment setup\nData.\nMost of our experiments involve the CommonPool provided by the DataComp benchmark\n[18]. CommonPool contains image-text pairs sourced from Common Crawl dumps between 2014 and\n2022, deduplicated and randomly shuffled. The small, medium, and large scales of the benchmark\ncontain 12.8M, 128M and 1.28B candidate pairs respectively. Data preprocessing is kept to a\nminimum, involving only NSFW filtering, evaluation set deduplication, and face blurring, to allow\nmaximum flexibility for dataset design. We also experiment with LAION-COCO [45] and discuss in\nAppendix G why it is not ideal for studying how to improve the quality of raw training data.\n4\nCaptioning models.\nWe experiment with BLIP [29] and BLIP2 [30] using HuggingFace\u2019s Trans-\nformers framework. Both models were pre-trained on 129M image-text pairs from the web including\nMS-COCO [11] and LAION-400M [46], in addition to the bootstrapped version of the web data with\nsynthetic captions generated by BLIP\u2019s captioner. We also look at OpenCLIP-CoCa [23, 38], which\nwas trained on LAION-2B [46]. For each architecture, we experiment with both the pre-trained\nmodel and the one that has been fine-tuned on MS-COCO. Caption generation uses top-K sampling\nwith K = 50, minimum caption length 5, and maximum caption length 40.\nTraining.\nGiven CommonPool data of a particular scale, we generate synthetic captions for the\nimages in the pool using the captioning models described above. Then we train a CLIP model on\nthe resulting image-text datasets, using ViT-B/32 as the image encoder for the small and medium\nscales, and ViT-B/16 for the large scale. Following DataComp\u2019s setup [18], the compute budget,\narchitecture and hyperparameters for each scale are fixed in order to isolate data quality as the main\nfactor influencing performance. Given a candidate pool of N image-text pairs, the CLIP model is\nthen trained with N samples seen in total. Refer to Appendix B for more details.\nEvaluation.\nWe adopt DataComp\u2019s zero-shot evaluation suite and report both ImageNet accuracy\nand the average accuracy over 38 classification and retrieval tasks proposed by the benchmark [18].\nWe also pay particular attention to retrieval performance on Flickr30K [54] and MS-COCO [11].\nThe retrieval score reported is the average of text-to-image Recall@1 and image-to-text Recall@1.\nUnless specified otherwise, in the subsequent sections, \u201cCLIP score filtering\u201d or \u201ctop x%\u201d refers to\nselecting top x% examples from the initial training set, based on the cosine similarity between image\nand text embeddings output by OpenAI\u2019s CLIP ViT-L/14 model [40], and \u201cBLIP2\u201d refers to captions\ngenerated by BLIP2, using top-K sampling with softmax temperature 0.75, which we have found to\nyield the best downstream performance compared to other sampling temperatures (see Appendix C).\n4\nImpact of model specialization on captions generated for multi-\nmodal training\nGiven the abundance of image captioning models to choose from, a natural question to ask is: does\nperformance on standard image captioning benchmarks correlate with how useful the generated\ncaptions are as text supervision for CLIP training?\nIn particular, CIDEr [51], together with other reference-based metrics like SPICE [4] and BLEU-4\n[35], has been widely adopted as a yardstick for determining state-of-the-art on image captioning\nbenchmarks [3, 22, 29, 30, 55]. Consequently, previous work [29, 30, 55] also experiments with\nfine-tuning captioning models on MS-COCO and obtains competitive CIDEr scores on popular\nevaluation sets like NoCaps [2].\nWe compare the utility of synthetic captions produced by BLIP2 and OpenCLIP-CoCa with and\nwithout fine-tuning on MS-COCO, by training CLIP on the generated captions and evaluating the\ntrained model on ImageNet classification and Flickr retrieval (Table 1). Fine-tuned captioning models\nproduce captions that boost the retrieval capabilities of CLIP, but hurts its ImageNet classification\nperformance. We hypothesize that fine-tuning on MS-COCO reduces the diversity of the generated\ntext, as evidenced by the lower number of unique trigrams across 1M caption samples (Table 1).\n5\nCaptioning model\nNoCaps\nCIDEr [51]\nCLIP-S\n[21]\nCosine\nsimilarity\nNo. of unique\ntrigrams\nImageNet\naccuracy\nFlickr\nretrieval\nBLIP, ViT-L/16\n(finetuned)\n113.2*\n0.698\n0.231\n2.82 \u00d7 106\n0.207\n0.498\nBLIP2, ViT-g\n80.6\n0.737\n0.251\n2.72 \u00d7 106\n0.281\n0.507\nBLIP2, ViT-g\n(finetuned)\n119.7*\n0.711\n0.235\n1.97 \u00d7 106\n0.227\n0.549\nOpenCLIP-CoCa,\nViT-L/14\n0.354*\n0.752\n0.260\n4.45 \u00d7 106\n0.321\n0.395\nOpenCLIP-CoCa,\nViT-L/14 (finetuned)\n106.5*\n0.702\n0.232\n1.81 \u00d7 106\n0.252\n0.542\nTable 1: CIDEr score does not reliably predict how effective a captioning model is at generating\nsynthetic captions for multimodal pre-training; fine-tuning image captioning models leads to\nlower ImageNet accuracy when training CLIP on the generated captions. * indicates numbers\nobtained from previous work and from contacting the authors. We fix the architecture and compare captions\ngenerated from captioning models with and without fine-tuning on MS-COCO [11] as sources of text\nsupervision for CLIP. Fine-tuning pre-trained networks on the task of image captioning ends up producing\nsynthetic captions that are worse for training CLIP (see ImageNet accuracy), possibly due to reduced text\ndiversity. On the contrary, retrieval performance is higher when using captions generated by fine-tuned\nmodels.\nNotably, captioning models that are not fine-tuned have very poor CIDEr scores; going with this\nmetric would have suggested that these models are not suitable for caption generation at all.\nWhile many image captioning metrics like CIDEr, SPICE and BLEU-4 emphasize similarity between\ngenerated captions and reference captions provided by humans, prior work has also proposed\nreference-free metrics\u2014for example, CLIP-S [21], which uses a trained CLIP model to assess the\ncompatibility between an image and the generated caption. We compute CLIP-S for the medium\ncandidate pool with different synthetic captions and find that this metric is more reflective of the\nImageNet performance trend. Fine-tuned captioning models produce captions that have lower\nCLIP-S and image-text cosine similarity in general.\nSince BLIP2 (no fine-tuning) produces sufficiently good text supervision for CLIP to do well on\nboth ImageNet classification and Flickr retrieval, we use it as the captioning model of choice in\nsubsequent experiments that look at how to combine raw and synthetic captions.\n5\nFiltering raw and synthetic captions\nHere we explore in more detail different ways of filtering and combining raw and generated captions\nat the medium scale of DataComp [18]:\n\u2022 No filtering: we train on the entire, unmodified pool (i.e., 128M samples).\n\u2022 CLIP score filtering: we select the top x% of examples with highest image-text cosine similarity.\n\u2022 CLIP score intersect with ImageNet1k clustering: Gadre et al.

(Left) We visualize how various data filtering strategies perform at medium scale, on ImageNet\nand across 38 tasks. Including BLIP2 captions in the training data significantly outperforms competitive\nbaselines from DataComp trained on only raw text [18]. (Right) As we vary the percentage of top examples\nchosen from the pool (based on CLIP score), we see consistent benefits from (i) using BLIP2 captions for\nsamples that would be discarded otherwise, (ii) applying the same filtering threshold to new image-text pairs\ncontaining BLIP2 captions to keep noise level low. The exact accuracy numbers can be found in Appendix D.\nImageNet1k. The authors then find the intersection between this set of examples and those that\nare in the top x% based on CLIP score. This is the best baseline using raw captions on DataComp.\n\u2022 Combining raw and synthetic captions: we use raw captions for the top x% of examples based\non CLIP score. For the remaining images (that would otherwise be filtered out), we generate\ncorresponding BLIP2 captions and add them back to the training pool. We also experiment with\nfiltering these additional image-text pairs with the same cosine similarity threshold set in the first\nstep (i.e., BLIP2 (x%, filtered) in Figure 2).\nIn Appendix D, we investigate other baselines and report how well each approach does with varying\ncosine similarity thresholds. Figure 2 (left) shows the relative performance of select baselines (the\ndegree of CLIP score filtering has been tuned and only the best accuracy is plotted). We find that\nthe best performance at medium scale, measured by either ImageNet or average accuracy, is achieved\nby mixing raw and synthetic captions, subject to a cosine similarity threshold. Besides, including\nBLIP2 captions in the training pool also improves retrieval performance by more than 2\u00d7 (Table 2).\nIn the right plot of Figure 2, we compare ImageNet performance at various filtering thresholds\nfor methods that involve only one source of captions and those that involve both. We observe\nthat given image-raw-text pairs filtered with certain cosine similarity threshold (blue line), adding\nBLIP2 captions for some (red line) or all of the remaining images (green line) always helps. It is\nworth noting that as we lower the threshold and include more raw captions in the training mix, the\nperformance starts to become lower than using just synthetic captions (orange line). Overall we find\nthat filtering is still a necessary step even when using synthetic captions that are supposedly more\nrelevant to the training images.\n7\n100\n101\n102\nNumber of words\n0.000\n0.025\n0.050\n0.075\n0.100\n0.125\n0.150\n0.175\n0.200\nFrequency\n10\n1\n100\nGrounding ratio\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nFrequency\nBLIP2\nBLIP2 (top 30%)\nRaw\nRaw (top 30%)\nRaw (top 30%) +\nBLIP2 (70%, filtered)\nFigure 3: Individual synthetic captions can contain more information (especially visual one)\nthan raw captions.

Here\nwe report the average text-to-image and image-\nto-text retrieval performance across both MS-\nCOCO and Flickr for different data filtering\nbaselines.\nMore specific breakdown can be\nfound in Appendix Figure 9. Overall, we ob-\nserve a 2\u00d7 improvement at the medium scale\nof DataComp when synthetic captions are in-\ncluded in the training set.\nAs seen from sample images in Figure 1, web-scraped\ntext may not contain specific visual information (e.g.,\n\u201cItalien - Ligurien\u201d) or may not reflect the content of the\nimage (e.g., \u201cImage Not Found\u201d). We seek to understand\nhow generated captions can help overcome these issues.\nTo approximate the richness of information conveyed\nin the text data, we take a 1M random subset from\neach training set and measure the number of words,\nas well as the grounding ratio [49] (i.e., the fraction of\ntokens that describe visual concepts, with the vocabulary\ndefined by MS-COCO), in the corresponding captions.\nIn Figure 3, we observe that synthetic captions and raw\ncaptions follow different distributions, with the former\ngenerally containing more words (left pane) and more\nvisual tokens (right pane) per sample. Performing CLIP\nscore filtering on raw captions leads to improvements\non both of these properties; so does mixing raw and\nsynthetic captions. Regarding the issue of poor image-\ntext alignment, we approximate the alignment using\ncosine similarity between image and text embeddings\nfrom CLIP, and find that web-crawled captions indeed\nhave lower similarities overall compared to model-generated ones (Figure 4).\nThe analyses above measure properties of individual captions. We next aim to capture a single\ndiversity metric over all text in the training set. We again select a random subset, the size of which\n8\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nCLIP ViT-L/14 image-text cosine similarity\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\nDensity\nBLIP2\nRaw\nFigure 4:\nGenerated captions overall exhibit\nhigher image-text alignment than raw captions;\nthis indicates that the former is less noisy as\na training source.

We find that\noverall BLIP2 captions have much higher image-text\ncosine similarity (mean similarity 0.251 vs 0.208).\nscales with the training set size, and calculate the number of unique trigrams across all captions in\nthe subset. With this diversity metric, we find that BLIP2 captions actually lag behind raw captions\n(Figure 5). Using only the top 30% raw captions (based on CLIP score) is even more detrimental.\nWe summarize these different aspects of caption quality in a noise versus diversity framework (Figure\n5), which also offers some intuition for our best baseline uncovered in Section 5. CLIP score filtering\nthat has been commonly adopted in prior work [18, 46] is effective at improving performance on\nraw data by by removing noisy examples (i.e., those with poor image-text alignment). However,\nthis procedure also lowers diversity (note: Figure 5 only provides a measure of text diversity, but\nimage diversity is affected as well). By generating synthetic captions for the images that would be\ndiscarded otherwise, and subsequently only using pairs where the image-text similarities still meet\nthe threshold, we manage to keep the overall noise level similarly low, while adding more diversity\nto the training pool. Progress along both axes enables further performance improvement compared\nto just filtering raw data.\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNo. of unique trigrams in captions (log scale)1e6\n0.20\n0.21\n0.22\n0.23\n0.24\n0.25\n0.26\n0.27\n0.28\n0.29\nAverage image-text cosine similarity\nBLIP2 (no filter)\nacc=28.1%\nraw (no filter)\nacc=17.6%\nraw (top 30%)\nacc=27.3%\nraw (top 30%)+BLIP2 (70%,filtered)\nacc=31.7%\nless noise\n^\nmore diverse\n>\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\nImagenet accuracy\nFigure 5: Combining raw and synthetic\ncaptions subject to a cosine similarity\nthreshold helps reduce noise level while\nboosting data diversity, both of which are\nessential for achieving good performance.\nIn this plot, circle size denotes the relative size of\nthe resulting training set. While removing noisy\nimage-text pairs, CLIP score filtering also low-\ners the diversity of the caption set substantially,\nas measured by the number of unique trigrams\nin the pool. Adding more useful training data\nby using BLIP2 captions for filtered out images,\nwhile respecting the existing CLIP score thresh-\nold, helps overcome this limitation and improves\nthe training data quality along both axes.\n6.2\nPerformance analysis\nAfter diving deeper into properties of synthetic captions, we next analyze the training implications of\nthese captions in more detail. We examine two models, one trained using only raw captions and the\nother using only BLIP2 captions, with both training sets having been filtered with CLIP score for\ntop 30% pairs, and achieving similar performance on ImageNet (27.3% vs 27.5%). Averaged across\n38 evaluation tasks, training on generated captions offers a 2.8% improvement.

We compare performance on each task of\nthe DataComp benchmark between training with only BLIP2 captions and training with only raw captions;\nboth datasets have been filtered with CLIP score to select the top 30% examples. Even though the two\ntraining sets yield similar ImageNet accuracy (\u223c27%), using generated captions leads to 2.8% improvement\non average accuracy, including minor gains on ImageNet distribution shifts and significant gains on MNIST,\nSVHN, Flickr and MS-COCO retrieval.\nperformance difference between the two models on individual tasks (Figure 6), and observe that\nBLIP2 captions also perform better on ImageNet-derived distribution shifts and text recognition\n(e.g., MNIST, SVHN). Notably, among the tasks with the biggest performance gains are Flickr\nand MS-COCO retrieval. We provide a similar analysis in Appendix Figure 10, where expanding a\nfiltered raw dataset with additional images and their BLIP2 captions improves CLIP performance\non 30 out of 38 tasks.\nThe two models compared above share similar ImageNet accuracy but may not be trained on the\nsame images. In Figure 7, we fix the set of training samples to be the top 30% with highest cosine\nsimilarity between image and raw text. Replacing the raw captions with BLIP2 captions increases\nretrieval performance on Flickr and MS-COCO by more than 1.5\u00d7 (first two columns of each task).\nWe include retrieval performance of training on the entire pool with BLIP2 captions (generated using\neither the pre-trained or the fine-tuned captioning model), as well as that of training on a mixture\nof raw and BLIP2 captions, to demonstrate the consistent gains that synthetic captions offer.\n7\nPerformance at scale\nWe next apply select baselines described in Section 5 to a wider range of candidate pool sizes,\nranging from 12.8M to 1.28B samples. In particular, we examine training on the entire pool with\nonly raw captions or only BLIP2 captions, CLIP score filtering, using the intersection of top CLIP\nscore examples and examples that lie in clusters close to ImageNet train set, as well as mixing raw\nand synthetic captions\u2014our best baseline from the medium scale. The filtering percentage for each\nmethod is tuned on the medium scale candidate pool and then applied to experiments at other scales.\nGiven a starting pool of N samples, we limit the training budget to N steps.

In particular,\nthe first two columns of each task represent two\nmodels trained on the same set of images (i.e., those\nwhose cosine similarity between image and raw text\nembeddings are in the top 30%), just with different\ncaptions. This suggests that substantial gains on\nretrieval tasks can be obtained solely by using better\naligned captions.\nscales use the large training settings from DataComp (see [18]).\nWe focus on ImageNet classification and Flickr retrieval performance (note: MS-COCO training\nset was included in BLIP2\u2019s pre-training data so we have excluded MS-COCO retrieval from this\ncomparison). At larger data quantity regimes, using synthetic captions continues to substantially\noutperform existing raw-text filtering baselines at retrieval (Figure 8, right plot). On ImageNet,\nhowever, adding BLIP2 captions to the training mix sees diminishing returns: Raw (top 30%\nintersect IN1k) + BLIP2 (remaining 70%, filtered, intersect IN1k) outperforms Data-\nComp\u2019s best baseline trained on raw data, Raw (top 30% intersect IN1k), by 2.5% at 400M\nscale and 1.2% at 1.28B scale (Figure 8, left plot).\nTo give some intuition for this result, we offer two candidate hypotheses:\n\u2022 As noted in Section 6, both caption noise and diversity are important considerations for performance.\nNoise level, measured by average image-text cosine similarity, stays about the same across all\nscales for each training distribution. In contrast, the diversity gap between model-generated text\nand web-scraped text may become more significant with increasing data quantities. We repeat\nthe caption quality analyses from Section 6 with varying random subset size, and find that when\nusing the number of unique nouns and unique trigrams as proxies for text diversity, generated\ncaptions exhibit a worse scaling trend than raw captions (Appendix Figure 12).\n\u2022 Image quality becomes increasingly important at larger scales:\n(i) from 12.8M to 128M scale, training on the entire candidate pool with BLIP2 captions outperforms\ncompetitive filtering baselines done on raw data (e.g., Raw (top 30%)). This is not the case for\nlarger scales.\n(ii) starting from 128M scale, baselines that also curate image content (i.e., intersection of top\nCLIP score examples and those that lie in clusters close to the ImageNet1k train set) consistently\noutperform baselines that involve only CLIP score filtering, using either raw or BLIP2 captions.\nExact performance numbers can be found in Appendix D, Table 4. Overall, we find that given\na fixed training budget, making more datapoints useful by carefully replacing noisy raw captions\nwith synthetic captions\u2014e.g., Raw (top 30%) + BLIP2 (70%, filtered) versus Raw (top\n30%)\u2014still offers classification and retrieval gains across all scales.

We apply select baselines\nfrom Section 5 to a range of candidate pool sizes, and find that the best method on Flickr retrieval always\ninvolves synthetic captions (right plot). On ImageNet (left plot), selecting meaningful images (e.g., those that\nlie close to the ImageNet train set in the embedding space) becomes increasingly important at larger scales\n(see dotted versus striked columns). As the data pool size increases, using BLIP2 captions seems to yield\ndiminishing returns, possibly due to the saturation of text diversity obtained from image captioning models.\nto continue to perform competitively on ImageNet at larger data regimes, we need to start paying\nattention to image content, as well as enhancing the diversity of the generated text.\n8\nConclusion\nIn this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic captions in improving caption quality for\nmultimodal training, as well as enhancing certain capabilities of the resulting model (e.g., retrieval).\nNotably, we find that fine-tuning general-purpose models towards the task of image captioning\nactually makes them less effective at producing good captions for CLIP training. Our experiments\nwith various data pool sizes, ranging from 12.8M to 1.28B image-text pairs, show that including\ngenerated captions in the training data can be highly effective at small and medium scales. However,\nwith larger data quantities, the diversity gap between model-generated and web-scraped text begin\nto hinder performance gains, and it also becomes increasingly harder to obtain state-of-the-art\nImageNet accuracy by just improving text supervision alone.\nLimitations.\nOur experiments do not involve an exhaustive list of image captioning systems\ncurrently available. Given a captioning model of sufficient capability\u2014i.e., it can generate captions\nfor training CLIP to reach a good performance\u2014a major theme of our work is understanding how\nto combine signals from both raw and synthetic captions, as well as the differences between these\ntwo sources of text. We note that even with improved caption quality, multimodal web datasets\nmay still contain harmful stereotypes, some of which have been extensively discussed in prior work\n[7]. In Appendix H, we conduct some preliminary investigation on the change in race and gender\nbias between training on only raw web-crawled text and training on synthetic captions. Besides,\ngenerated captions also inherit biases from the captioning models, and using these captions to train\n12\nthe next generation of models can amplify the biases. The risks from using model outputs to replace\nhuman annotations have been studied in simplified settings in [48, 50].\nFuture work.\nOur findings motivate a number of interesting future directions. One concrete\nquestion is improving the diversity of generated captions at large scale, such as by varying the\nsoftmax temperature (we only experiment with T = 0.75 at this scale, chosen based on our ablation\nstudy at the medium scale), or by combining synthetic caption data from multiple image captioning\nsystems. Another direction is proposing new algorithms to combine information from raw and\ngenerated captions, beyond what we already investigated in Section 5 and Appendix D. Future work\ncould also explore using text-to-image generation [34, 42, 43] to create synthetic training images for\nconcepts that are underrepresented in existing captions, in order to boost data diversity and close\nknowledge gaps in the resulting model.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Stability AI for the generous assistance with compute resources.

Large scale training uses the same hyperparameters, but\nwith batch size 8192 and ViT-B/16 as the image encoder.\nUsing DataComp infrastructure and the AWS EC2 cloud, a small model takes 4 A100 hours to\ntrain, while medium requires 40 A100 hours and large utilizes 960 A100 hours. We additionally\nreport CLIP ViT-L/14 and BLIP2 (OPT 2.7B backbone) inference costs. Recall that we run both\nof these models on the DataComp\u2019s large pool to curate the datasets used in this paper. For the\nCLIP model, we measure throughput at 490 samples per second on a single A100. For BLIP2, we\nget 75 samples per second on the same hardware. Hence, for the large pool of 1.28B samples, we\nspend 725 A100 hours computing CLIP features and 4,740 A100 hours generating BLIP2 captions.\nWhile the annotation cost (i.e., BLIP2 caption and CLIP score generation) is 6\u00d7 larger than a single\ntraining run proposed by the DataComp benchmark (which is equivalent to doing one pass through\nthe entire candidate pool), this additional cost can be easily amortized with more training epochs\nover the final training set, as well as with training different downstream models on the improved\ndataset. For reference, OpenAI trained various CLIP models on the same set of 400M curated\nimage-text pairs; the best performing model was trained on 256 GPUs for 2 weeks, totalling about\n86,000 GPU hours 7. This scale of training is common among existing large vision models. Future\nwork could explore the option of adaptively allocating compute to CLIP training and synthetic\ncaption annotation given a fixed compute budget.\n7 https://openai.com/research/clip\n23\nC\nTemperature ablations\nCaptioning model\nMetric\nT=0.5\nT=0.75\nT=1.0\nT=1.5\nBLIP (finetuned)\nImageNet accuracy\n-\n0.207\n0.212\n-\nAverage accuracy\n-\n0.303\n0.312\n-\nBLIP2\nImageNet accuracy\n0.212\n0.281\n0.280\n0.251\nAverage accuracy\n0.300\n0.357\n0.353\n0.332\nBLIP2 (finetuned) ImageNet accuracy\n-\n0.227\n0.234\n0.221\nAverage accuracy\n-\n0.325\n0.326\n0.311\nOpenCLIP-CoCa\nImageNet accuracy\n0.306\n0.321\n0.314\n-\nAverage accuracy\n0.366\n0.371\n0.370\n-\nOpenCLIP-CoCa\nImageNet accuracy\n-\n0.252\n0.264\n0.262\n(finetuned)\nAverage accuracy\n-\n0.364\n0.374\n0.364\nTable 3: Performance on ImageNet and averaged across 38 tasks when training on the captions generated\nby captioning models in Table 1, with different softmax temperatures.

To do so, we exam-\nine two CLIP models that perform similarly on\nImageNet (i.e., \u00b10.2%): one trained on only\nraw captions and one trained on only generated\ncaptions, both training sets have been filtered\nwith CLIP score ranking to select the top 30%\nimage-text pairs.

We\nmeasure the number of unique nouns and unique trigrams in random subsets of BLIP2 and raw captions of\nvarious sizes. We observe that on both metrics, the scaling trend for generated captions is worse than that of\nraw captions. This increasing gap in data diversity may impact the performance benefits we can expect to\nobtain from using synthetic captions, when dealing with a larger scale of training data.\nG\nExperiments with LAION-COCO\nOur experiments with synthetic captions are partly inspired by the release of LAION-COCO dataset\n[45], which used BLIP [29] with various hyperparameter settings to caption LAION-5B data [46],\nand then selected the top synthetic caption for each image based on the cosine similarity output\nby OpenAI\u2019s CLIPs [40]. We pick a random set of 100M samples from LAION-COCO and train\non this set using DataComp\u2019s medium scale configuration (i.e., 128M steps), with either only the\nraw captions or only the top BLIP captions that come with the dataset. We find that training on\nBLIP captions significantly lags behind training on raw captions, measured by both ImageNet and\naverage accuracies (Figure 13). Consequently, a natural question to ask is how much of this gap can\nbe overcome with progress in image captioning models, e.g. the release of BLIP2.\nWe proceed to generating BLIP2 captions for the same set of 100M images, using only one configura-\ntion from the original hyperparameter grid in [45] due to compute constraints. Despite the lack of\nhyperparameter tuning, the new BLIP2 captions manage to close the previous ImageNet performance\ngap by 75% and come close to the average accuracy obtained from training on raw captions (see\ntable in Figure 13). Since raw data in LAION was already filtered with a CLIP score threshold of\n0.28 during the dataset construction, we next experiment with applying the same filtering to BLIP2\ncaptions, in order to control for noise quality in the caption data. On the resulting 41M images,\nusing BLIP2 captions is about as effective as using raw captions (-0.7% ImageNet accuracy and\n+0.2% average accuracy).\nWe note that LAION is considered a curated web dataset, with heavy cosine similarity filtering\nbeing one of the preprocessing steps. This in turn leads to approximately 90% of the raw data\n28\nImageNet\nAverage\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nImageNet Accuracy\nBLIP1 captions (no filtering)\nBLIP2 captions (no filtering)\nRaw captions (no filtering)\nBLIP2 captions (filter threshold=0.28)\nRaw captions (filter threshold=0.28)\nImageNet\naccuracy\nAverage\naccuracy\nDataset\nsize\nBLIP\n20.5\n29.0\n104M\nBLIP2\n29.3\n34.6\n104M\nRaw\n32.3\n34.9\n104M\nBLIP2 (CLIP\nscore \u2265 0.28)\n26.8\n32.4\n41M\nRaw\n(CLIP\nscore \u2265 0.28)\n27.5\n32.2\n41M\nFigure 13: BLIP2 significantly closes the performance gap between BLIP captions and raw\ncaptions on LAION-COCO; when controlled for noise level, the performance difference between\nusing BLIP2 and using raw captions is actually negligible. We use BLIP2 [30] to generate captions\nfor 100M random samples from the LAION-COCO dataset [45], which already come with corresponding\nBLIP [29] captions. We find that advances in the BLIP model family help generated captions close the gap\nwith raw captions, as measured by the zero-shot performance of CLIP trained on the captions. After applying\na cosine similarity threshold of 0.28 to the BLIP2 training pool, just like how LAION data was originally\ncurated, we find that using either raw captions or synthetic captions for the resulting set of training examples\nmakes little difference (hatched columns).\nfrom Common Crawl to be discarded, according to Schuhmann et al. [46]. Since LAION only\nretains about 10% of the original candidate pool, similar experiments in DataComp [18] have shown\nthat further CLIP score filtering on these top examples will only hurt performance. In addition,\ngiven that the selected raw captions are already relatively clean (measured via image-text cosine\nsimilarity), and there is no record of datapoints that were filtered out for further experimentation,\nwe find LAION-COCO to be an unsuitable benchmark for studying the utility of synthetic captions.\nOur experiments here mainly seek to demonstrate that progress in image captioning models (e.g.,\nthe BLIP model family) can translate to better text supervision for CLIP training that rivals the\neffectiveness of using raw captions.\nH\nFairness implications of using synthetic captions\nWe examine zero-shot classification accuracy of predicting race and gender from face images in the\nFairface dataset [26], for a model trained on only filtered raw captions, one trained on only filtered\nsynthetic captions, and one trained on both. We acknowledge that there are limitations to these\nevaluations as race and gender should not be considered fixed categories.\nWith Fairface, we find that using synthetic captions improves the classification performance on the\ndisadvantaged group (e.g. female) significantly, and reduces the performance gap between male and\nfemale groups while still boosting the overall performance on all race categories (Table 6). We leave\nmore extensive study of the fairness implications of using synthetic data (including and beyond\ngender biases) to future work.\n29\nGender\nModel\nRace\nBlack\nWhite\nIndian\nLatino/\nHispanic\nMiddle\nEastern\nSouth East\nAsian\nEast\nAsian\nMale\nRaw (top 30%)\n93.0\n88.8\n91.2\n90.8\n92.3\n85.3\n81.3\nBLIP2 (top 30%)\n87.2\n73.7\n77.2\n74.9\n78.6\n72.0\n64.0\nRaw\n(top\n30%)\n+\nBLIP2 (70%, filtered)\n90.5\n75.0\n79.7\n79.4\n81.1\n72.4\n65.3\nFemale\nRaw (top 30%)\n20.3\n47.1\n35.1\n42.0\n40.9\n44.9\n56.8\nBLIP2 (top 30%)\n36.9\n70.8\n57.9\n67.5\n67.4\n64.1\n78.4\nRaw\n(top\n30%)\n+\nBLIP2 (70%, filtered)\n32.9\n74.8\n56.5\n66.3\n67.9\n67.8\n81.9\nOverall\nRaw (top 30%)\n56.7\n68.0\n63.2\n66.4\n66.6\n65.1\n69.1\nBLIP2 (top 30%)\n62.1\n72.3\n67.6\n71.2\n73.0\n68.1\n71.2\nRaw\n(top\n30%)\n+\nBLIP2 (70%, filtered)\n61.7\n74.9\n68.1\n72.9\n74.5\n70.1\n73.6\nTable 6: Using synthetic captions improves classification performance on Fairface for the minority group\n(i.e., female) across all race categories.\n30\n"

Introduction\nRepresentation learning tackles the problem of learning\nlower dimensional representations of data which capture\nthe data\u2019s semantic information. To achieve this, many rep-\nresentation learning methods aim to maximize the mutual\ninformation (MI) between the input data and the learned\nrepresentations (Linsker, 1988; Belghazi et al., 2018; Hjelm\n1Division of Information Science and Engineering (ISE), KTH\nRoyal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden 2Apple.

PMLR 202, 2023. Copyright\n2023 by the author(s).\net al., 2019), while inducing biases in the model that steer the\nlearned information to be semantically meaningful (Alemi\net al., 2017; van den Oord et al., 2018; Velickovic et al.,\n2019). As such, MI has played a crucial role in under-\nstanding the performance of many representation learning\nmethods (Tishby et al., 1999; Rodr\u00b4\u0131guez G\u00b4alvez et al., 2020;\nGoldfeld & Polyanskiy, 2020).\nRecently, multi-view self-supervised learning (MVSSL),\nwhere the loss enforces the model to produce similar repre-\nsentations for different views of the same data, has proven to\nbe a successful approach for representation learning (Bach-\nman et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020a; He et al., 2020; Caron\net al., 2021). The success of MVSSL has motivated the\nresearch of several families of MVSSL approaches, such as\ncontrastive (Chen et al., 2020a), clustering- (Caron et al.,\n2018), and distillation-based methods (Grill et al., 2020).\nHowever, the effort to understand all of them under a com-\nmon umbrella lags behind the development of new methods.\nIn this work, we aim to further our understanding of MVSSL\nmethods by identifying any mechanisms contributing to\nmaximizing MI, and to what extent they do so.\nThe connection of the contrastive MVSSL methods to MI\nmaximization is well established through the InfoNCE\nbound (van den Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019),\nwhich, in the MVSSL context, lower bounds the MI be-\ntween the learned representations of different views. Tian\net al. (2020b) and Tsai et al. (2020) argue that maximiz-\ning this MI is attractive as a representation learning target\nsince, when the views are selected carefully, it extracts task-\nrelevant and discards task-irrelevant information.\nThe interest in the MI perspective on representation learn-\ning, and MVSSL in particular, has been undermined follow-\ning the work of Tschannen et al. (2020), whose key result\nis showing that maximizing MI alone is not sufficient for\nlearning good representations. Yet, it is empirically evi-\ndent that methods based on MI lower bound maximization\nare competitive with state-of-the-art, and Tschannen et al.\n(2020) note that \u201cthe performance of these methods depends\nstrongly on the bias that is encoded not only in the encoders,\nbut also on the actual form of the used MI estimators\u201d. In\nour opinion, their results strongly motivates further study\n1\narXiv:2307.10907v2  [cs.LG]  9 Dec 2023\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nof the mechanisms by which, and to what extent, the MI\nmaximization takes place in representation learning.\nIn this work, we center our analysis of MVSSL methods\naround the MI between the learned representations of differ-\nent views Z1, Z2. The MI lower bound we focus on consists\nof an entropy and a reconstruction term (Gallager, 1968):\nI(Z1; Z2) \u2265 H(Z2)\n| {z }\nEntropy\n+ E[log qZ2|Z1(Z2)]\n|\n{z\n}\nReconstruction term\n:= IER(Z1; Z2),\nwhere the log qZ2|Z1 corresponds to a choice of a similarity\nfunction between representations used in MVSSL, e.g., a\ncosine similarity. We refer to this bound as ER, referring\nto the Entropy and Reconstruction terms. Focusing on this\nbound, rather than the InfoNCE, allows us to analyze a\nwide range of MVSSL methods through the lens of MI.\nThe work closest in spirit to ours is (Wang & Isola, 2020),\nwhich analyzes the contrastive MVSSL methods through\nthe lens of alignment and uniformity, two metrics which\nthey derive through formulating desiderata for the learned\nrepresentations. While their motivation was, in the light of\nthe results of Tschannen et al. (2020), to offer an alterna-\ntive interpretation of InfoNCE, different than as a lower\nbound on MI, we show the metrics they define coincide\nwith a specific instantiation of the ER MI bound we con-\nsider. We generalize their results through the use of the ER\nbound which allows us to also analyze the clustering- and\ndistillation-based MVSSL methods.\nOur contributions in this work are the following:\n\u2022 We review how, and to what extent, the major fami-\nlies of MVSSL methods (contrastive, clustering, and\ndistillation-based) maximize MI via the use of the\nER bound on MI. Specifically, we show that the\nclustering-based methods SwAV (Caron et al., 2020)\nand DeepCluster (Caron et al., 2018) maximize\nthe ER bound and therefore the MI between represen-\ntations of different views.\n\u2022 We empirically show that simply substituting the loss\nfunction and instead optimizing ER in SimCLR (Chen\net al., 2020a), BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), and DINO\n(Caron et al., 2021) results in similar performance\nwhile improving resiliency with respect to training\nwith smaller batch sizes or exponential moving average\n(EMA) coefficients. This is especially important for\ndistillation methods such as BYOL or DINO, as they be-\ncome resilient to batch size changes without any need\nfor hyperparameter changes or gradient accumulation.\n\u2022 Finally, we show that it is not necessary for distillation\nmethods like BYOL to maximize entropy to achieve\ncompetitive results, although mechanisms such as\nthe softmax centering in DINO and other related\narchitectural constraints prevent the entropy collapse.\n2. Background\nHere, we introduce some notation, the multi-view self-\nsupervised learning setting, and the relevant bounds on MI.\nNotation\nX represents a random variable (RV) with\nprobability mass function or density pX, and x is its realiza-\ntion. Expectations are denoted as E[f(X)] = Ex\u223cpX[f(x)].\nThe conditional density for a fixed realization x is denoted\nas pY |X=x. The density qY |X is not the real conditional\ndensity of X given Y , but an an auxiliary one that serves,\ne.g., as an optimization target. The mutual information is de-\nnoted as I(X; Y ), the Shannon and the differential entropy\nare both denoted as H(X), and the Kullback-Leibler diver-\ngence between densities p and q is denoted as DKL(p\u2225q).\nA sub-sequence of elements from a to b in a sequence x is\ndenoted as x(a:b), and all elements except x(i) as x(\u0338=i).\nMulti-view self-supervised learning\nIn MVSSL, for\neach data sample X, we generate two (or more) views Vb.\nThese views are commonly obtained by using augmenta-\ntions (Bachman et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020b; Chen et al.,\n2020a; Caron et al., 2020; Zbontar et al., 2021), by lever-\naging multiple modalities (Radford et al., 2021), or natural\nviews of data (Tian et al., 2020a), e.g., multiple camera\nviews of the same scene. Views Vb are chosen or engi-\nneered such that most of the semantic information remains\nunchanged with respect to the original data sample X and\nshared between the views (Tian et al., 2020b). Each view\nis then passed through a neural network encoder f\u03b8(\u00b7) to\nproduce representations Rb which are in turn projected via\n\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7), usually a small MLP, into a lower dimensional space\nto yield Zb, where \u03b8 are the learnable parameters. Typically,\nthe intermediate representations Rb are used for downstream\ntasks and transfer learning, as that yields better performance\nthan using Zb (Chen et al., 2020a; Bordes et al., 2023). The\nparameters \u03b8 are learned by optimizing an objective which\nencourages the projections Zb to be predictive of the other\nbranches\u2019 outputs Z(\u0338=b). This is commonly achieved by op-\ntimizing a similarity score, such as the L2 distance. Most of\nthe methods use two views and we will focus on this setting,\nwithout loss of generality.1 Since the processing of each\nview takes place separately and for some methods differs\nbetween views, we refer to those separate computation paths\nas branches. See Figure 1 for an illustrative diagram.\nThe three families of MVSSL considered in this work are\ncontrastive, clustering- and distillation-based methods. Con-\ntrastive methods work by comparing the projections of the\ntwo views of the same datum (or positive pairs), with a set\nof projections of different data (or negative pairs). The dif-\nferent methods in this category are usually distinguished by\n1When more than two views are considered, the objective de-\ncomposes into a sum of independent sub-objectives based on view\npairs, see e.g., Tian et al.

Right: The projections Z are processed into auxiliary discrete\nvariables W, potentially using another variable C. Parameters \u03b8, \u03be are optimized such that Z are predictive of the other branch\u2019s W.\nhow they define the negative pairs. Most of these methods\nare derived either from the metric learning literature (Sohn,\n2016) or the InfoNCE objective (van den Oord et al., 2018),\nwhich is a lower bound on the mutual information between\nthe projections I(Z1; Z2). We discuss these methods in\ndetail in Section 3.1. Clustering methods cluster the projec-\ntions from one branch and use the resulting discrete cluster\nassignments as targets for the other branch by optimizing a\ncross-entropy loss (Caron et al., 2018; 2020; Asano et al.,\n2019). Distillation-based methods design the two branches\nasymmetrically, using one branch\u2019s projections as targets\nfor the other (Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021; Caron\net al., 2021). The two branches, referred to as teacher and\nstudent, differ. Common differences include gradients being\ncomputed only by the student (stop-grad), teacher\u2019s parame-\nters being set via an EMA of the student\u2019s, and an additional\npredictor network for the student.\nMutual information lower bounds\nEstimating MI is\nfundamentally difficult (McAllester & Stratos, 2020) and\nfor gradient-based representation learning, it is common\nto rely on the gradients of a lower bound on MI without\nestimating MI directly (Poole et al., 2019). In this work,\nthe core quantity of interest is the MI between MVSSL\nprojections I(Z1; Z2). Two MI lower bounds that can be\nused to optimize this quantity are InfoNCE and ER.\nInfoNCE (van den Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019) is\na lower bound on MI. In MVSSL, the MI is between the pro-\njections Z1, Z2. It is estimated from a sequence of i.i.d. sam-\nples of pairs (Z(1:k)\n1\n, Z(1:k)\n2\n) from the joint density pZ1,Z2:\nINCE(Z1; Z2):= 1\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\nE\n\"\nlog\nef(Z(i)\n1\n,Z(i)\n2\n)\n1\nk\nPk\nj=1 ef(Z(i)\n1\n,Z(j)\n2\n)\n#\n, (1)\nwhere f(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a function scoring similarity between vectors,\ne.g., cosine similarity. Many contrastive methods use it as a\nloss function in the original or slightly different forms de-\npending on negative sample choice. We discuss the MI max-\nimization in this class of methods in detail in Section 3.1.\nThe ER bound is a long standing result in information the-\nory (Gallager, 1968). It can be derived by considering a\ntractable reconstruction density qZ2|Z1 that for MVSSL cor-\nresponds to a choice of a similarity function:\nI(Z1;Z2)=E\n\u0014\nlog qZ2|Z1(Z2)\npZ2(Z2)\n\u0015\n+E[\n\u22650\nz\n}|\n{\nDKL(pZ2|Z1\u2225qZ2|Z1)]\n\u2265H(Z2)+E[log qZ2|Z1(Z2)]:=IER(Z1;Z2). (2)\nIn the MVSSL setting, qZ2|Z1 is a design choice and we are\ninterested in optimizing the parameters of \u03c0\u03b8 \u25e6 f\u03b8 such that\nthe resulting density pZ1,Z2 maximizes IER(Z1; Z2). The\ndensity pZ1,Z2 implicitly results from sampling inputs X,\npossibly transforming them via stochastic transformations t,\nand then deterministically transforming them through the en-\ncoder \u03c0\u03b8 \u25e6 f\u03b8 to form Z. The term E[DKL(pZ2|Z1\u2225qZ2|Z1)]\ndetermines the magnitude of the gap of the IER bound.\nThe term reconstruction originates from information theory.\nIt is often concerned with reconstructing a signal from a\ncompressed code and is equal to \u2212H(Z2| \u02c6\nZ2), where \u02c6\nZ2 is a\nRV such that Z2\u2212Z1\u2212 \u02c6\nZ2 is a Markov chain. We find it also\nmore appropriate to reason about MVSSL such as the right\ncolumn of Figure 1, where Z1 and W2 belong to different\nspaces, and hence the term similarity seems less accurate.\nIntuitively, the entropy and reconstruction terms in the ER\nbound (2) play different roles in MVSSL. The entropy term\ndetermines how much information from one projection can\n3\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nbe learnt, while the reconstruction term determines how\nmuch of this available information is learnt. For instance,\nlet the projections lay on the sphere: the more spread out\n(higher entropy) the projections of different data are, the\nmore revealing (higher mutual information) it is if projec-\ntions from different views of the same datum are close\n(lower reconstruction error). Conversely, if one branch\nprojects all data to the same point (lowest entropy, also\nknown as collapse), the projections from the other branch\ncan\u2019t reveal any information about them.\nMVSSL for small batch sizes\nSmall batch sizes degrade\nthe performance of MVSSL methods, especially contrastive\nones (Chen et al., 2020a; Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al.,\n2021). Potentially, this is due to the fact that most meth-\nods maximize the entropy either explicitly or implicitly, as\nshown in this paper, and the entropy estimation is limited to\nlog k bits for a batch size of k (McAllester & Stratos, 2020).\nSome works (HaoChen et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Yuan\net al., 2022) addressed this issue and modified existing meth-\nods to perform well under the small batch size regime.\n3. MVSSL and MI optimization\nIn this section, we reflect on the relationship between dif-\nferent MVSSL methods and the MI. First, we review the\nknown connection between contrastive methods and MI\nmaximization through the InfoNCE bound, as well as the\nlack thereof. Also, we show that none of the existing meth-\nods formally maximize the ER bound, while all of them are\na good proxy for it. Next, we show for the first time that\nthe clustering-based methods DeepCluster (Caron et al.,\n2018) and SwAV (Caron et al., 2020) also optimize the MI\nthrough the ER bound. Finally, we interpret the techniques\nused in distillation-based methods such as EMA (Grill et al.,\n2020) and softmax centering (Caron et al., 2021) as mech-\nanisms to prevent the entropy collapse. The results of this\nsection are summarized in Table 1.\n3.1. Contrastive methods\nContrastive learning (CL) methods are the family of MVSSL\nmethods that have been most closely connected to MI max-\nimization in the existing literature and, as such, a good\nstarting point for our analysis. Here, we first give a re-\nview of the connections established through the InfoNCE\nbound and otherwise, before exhibiting the relationship to\nthe ER bound. Summarizing, generally CL algorithms can-\nnot be formally shown to maximize the InfoNCE nor the\nER bound due to the violation of the i.i.d. assumption.\nThis is not the case for CMC those methods derived from\nit, nor for methods using a memory bank like Instance Dis-\ncrimination (Wu et al., 2018, IR) or MoCo (He et al., 2020;\nChen et al., 2020b) under particular circumstances, which do\nmaximize the InfoNCE. Nevertheless, as also concluded\nby Wang & Isola (2020), CL is a good proxy for entropy\nmaximization, and therefore, for MI maximization.\nGiven the projection of a view of datum i, e.g., Z(i)\n2 , con-\ntrastive learning algorithms aim to maximize its similarity\nwith the projection of another view of the same datum,\ne.g., Z(i)\n1\n(positive sample), while making it as different as\npossible from the projections of a set of negative samples\nSneg(Z(i)\n2 ). This is achieved by minimizing a cross entropy\nloss based on a similarity score. Given a batch of k samples\na generic contrastive loss for the second branch is\nLcontr,2 := \u22121\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\nlog\nef(Z(i)\n2\n,Z(i)\n1\n)\nP\nZ\u2032\u2208Sneg(Z(i)\n2\n) ef(Z(i)\n2\n,Z\u2032)\n(3)\nand the full loss is Lcontr := (Lcontr,1 + Lcontr,2)/2, where\nusually f = sim(\u00b7)/\u03c4, sim(\u00b7) is the cosine similarity, and \u03c4\nis a temperature parameter. Then, different CL methods are\ndistinguished by how the set of negative samples for a par-\nticular sample Z(i)\n2\nis constructed. Note that the negatives\nmight include samples from the other branches.\nIn CMC (Tian et al., 2020a), the negative samples set is\ncomposed of all the other projections from the opposite\nbranch, i.e., Sneg(Z(i)\n2 ) = Z(1:k)\n1\n. Comparing (1) and (3)\nwith these negative samples we see that CMC maximizes the\nInfoNCE bound and E[\u2212LCMC] \u2264 I(Z1; Z2) \u2212 log k.\nThe maximization of the InfoNCE bound can be similarly\nshown for methods that can be derived from the basic CMC,\nlike the full CMC, where more than two views are consid-\nered; (Bachman et al., 2019), which adapts DIM (Hjelm\net al., 2019) to the basic CMC; and (Tian et al., 2020b),\nwhich attempts to learn the augmentations that best suit the\ninformation maximization.\nFor SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020a), on the other hand, the\nnegative samples are all the projections other than Z(i)\n2 , i.e.,\nSneg(Z(i)\n2 ) = Z(\u0338=i)\n2\n\u222a Z(1:k)\n1\n. Given such a definition of\nthe negative set, even if all negative samples were identi-\ncally distributed, the negative samples are not independent\nas Z(j)\n1\nand Z(j)\n2\nare derived from the same datum j, for\nall js. As shown in (Tschannen et al., 2020), InfoNCE is\nnot maximized when violating the independence assump-\ntion. Hence, SimCLR does not maximize the InfoNCE\nbound. This also holds true for methods that are derived\nfrom SimCLR such as (Ramapuram et al., 2021).\nFinally, methods like IR or MoCo use representations from\na memory bank as negative samples, i.e., Sneg(Z(i)\n2 ) =\nZ(1:m)\nbank . In these cases the negative samples can be de-\npendent and are not identically distributed with respect to\nZ(i)\n2 . However, Wu et al. (2020) showed that under certain\nmild conditions on the distribution of these samples the con-\ntrastive loss used in these methods is a lower bound on the\n4\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nInfoNCE, and thus optimizing it also maximizes MI.\nRelationship with the ER bound\nNone of the contrastive\nmethods above directly translates to an optimization of the\nER bound, even if it may appear so. In the context of (3),\nif we consider a density s.t. qZ2|Z1=z1(z2) \u221d exp f(z2, z1),\nthe expected value of the first term corresponds to the recon-\nstruction error in (2), and when f(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the cosine similarity\nwith temperature \u03c4, the density qZ2|Z1=z1 corresponds to a\nvon Mises\u2013Fisher density with mean direction z1 and con-\ncentration parameter 1/\u03c4. However, as shown above, in\nall methods analyzed, the negative samples are either not\nindependent between themselves (as in SimCLR), or not\nidentically distributed with respect to the positive sample\n(as in MoCo), or the set contains the positive pair itself (as\nin CMC). Therefore, the log-denominator in (3) is not an\nunbiased kernel density estimator (KDE, Joe (1989)) of the\nentropy and therefore its expectation is not necessarily the\nentropy H(Z2) from (2).\nNonetheless, all these methods force the projections to be\nmaximally separated from the negative samples in a convex\nset (usually the hypersphere). Moreover, the highest entropy\ndistribution on a convex set is precisely the uniform distri-\nbution on that volume. Hence, the contrastive loss, even\nwith non-i.i.d. negative samples, is a good proxy for entropy\nmaximization, and therefore, for MI maximization. Wang &\nIsola (2020) make a similar observation and conclude that\nmaximizing the uniformity of the samples in the projections\u2019\nspace is required for good performance.\nCaveats\nAs seen above, most current analyses for CL\nmethods require the i.i.d. assumption, which is not usually\nmet due to the use of batch normalization. The breaking of\nthe independence assumption is important as it can break\nthe InfoNCE results (Tschannen et al., 2020; Wu et al.,\n2020). Nonetheless, it does not discredit that the result of\nthe KDE is a good proxy to maximize the entropy.\n3.2. Clustering-based methods\nIn this section, we show that both DeepCluster (Caron\net al., 2018; Asano et al., 2019) and SwAV (Caron et al.,\n2020) maximize the ER lower bound on the MI between the\nprojections of different views of the data IER(Z1; Z2).\nThe key observation underlying the results in this sec-\ntion is that DeepCluster and SwAV generate a discrete\nsurrogate of the projections, e.g., for the second branch\nW2 = \u03d5(Z2), and that they maximize the ER bound on\nI(Z1; W2) \u2264 I(Z1; Z2), where the inequality holds by the\ndata processing inequality. For the rest of the section, let\nZ \u2286 Rd and W = {1, . . . , m}.\nDeepCluster has an asymmetric setting with \u03be = \u03b8\n(Figure 1d). First, the cluster assignments W (i)\n2\n= \u03d5(Z(i)\n2 )\nof all the n data points are obtained solving the problem\nC\u22c6 \u2208 arg inf\nC\u2208Rd\u00d7m\n1\nn\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u2225Z(i)\n2\n\u2212 Cp(i)\n2 \u22252,\nwith p(i)\n2\n\u2208 {0, 1}m and \u2225p(i)\n2 \u22250 = 1, where C\u22c6 represent\nthe m centroids of the clusters in Z and p(i)\n2\nis the p.m.f. of\nW (i)\n2\ngiven Z(i)\n2 .2 Then, the parameters \u03b8 are optimized by\nminimizing the cross entropy\nLDeepCluster := \u22121\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\n\u0010\np(i)\n2\n\u0011\u22ba\nlog\n\u0010\ns \u25e6 g\u03b8(Z(i)\n1 )\n\u0011\n,\nwhere g\u03b8 : Z \u2192 Rm is a small predictor network, and s\nis the softmax operator. Note that Z also depends on \u03b8 via\nZ =\u03c0\u03b8\u25e6f\u03b8(V ), see Figure 1. With qW2|Z1=z1 = s \u25e6 g\u03b8(z1),\nthis optimization precisely amounts to maximizing the re-\nconstruction term in the ER bound for I(Z1; W2). Further-\nmore, to prevent degenerate solutions, Caron et al. (2018)\nsample the images of each batch based on a uniform dis-\ntribution over cluster assignments, i.e.\nfor each batch\npW2 \u2248 1\nk\nPk\ni=1 p(i)\n2 is almost uniform. Through this, the en-\ntropy H(W2) is approximately maximized. Combined with\nthe maximization of the reconstruction term via LDeepCluster,\nthis implies DeepCluster maximizes the ER MI bound.\nNow, let us turn to SwAV. SwAV has a symmetric setting\n(Figure 1b). We focus on branch b = 2, as the analysis is\nanalogous for the other branch. Here, the cluster assign-\nments W (i)\n2\n= \u03d5(Z(i)\n2 ) are obtained solving the following\noptimization problem\nP2 = arg max\nP \u2208P\n\u001a\nTr\n\u0010\nZ(1:k)\n2\nC\u22baP \u22ba\u0011\n+ \u03f5H(P)\n\u001b\n,\nwhere Z(1:k)\n2\n\u2208 Rk\u00d7d, C \u2208 Rm\u00d7d are the m centroids\n(or prototypes) in Rd, P = {P \u2208 Rk\u00d7m\n+\n: P \u22ba1k =\n1m/m and P1m = 1k/k} is the transportation polytope,\nand 1k is the all ones vector in Rk. Let C(i) and P (i)\n2\ndenote the i-th row of C and P2, respectively. In SwAV,\nboth the projections and the prototypes lay in the unit hy-\npersphere, i.e., Z(i), C(i) \u2208 Sd\u22121, and thus maximizing\nthe dot product is equivalent to minimizing the squared\n\u21132 norm distance (Grill et al., 2020). Moreover, to aid\nthe optimization calculations, an entropic regularization\nis included to approximately solve it using the Sinkhorn-\nKnopp algorithm (Sinkhorn, 1974; Cuturi, 2013), where\nH(P2) := \u2212 Pk\ni=1\n\u0010\nP (i)\n2\n\u0011\u22ba\nlog P (i)\n2 .\nThe l-th element of P (i)\n2\ncan be understood as the probability\nof assigning Z(i)\n2\nto the cluster W (i)\n2\n= l. The optimization\naims to have P2 \u2208 P and therefore P \u22ba\n2 1k \u2248 1m/m, which\n2Asano et al. (2019) obtain the clusters solving an optimal\ntransport problem similar to SwAV.\n5\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nby this interpretation would mean that pW2 \u2248 1m/m is ap-\nproximately uniform, thus maximizing the entropy H(W2).\nTherefore, this construction maximizes the desired entropy\nH(W2) in the ER bound\nFor SwAV, similarly to DeepCluster, the reconstruction\nterm is maximized by minimizing the loss function\nLSwAV,2 := \u22121\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\n\u0010\np(i)\n2\n\u0011\u22ba\nlog\n\u0010\ns\n\u0000CZ(i)\n1\n\u0001\u0011\n,\nwhere p(i)\n2\n= P (i)\n2 /(1\u22ba\nmP (i)\n2 ) and qW2|Z1=z1 = s(Cz1),\nhence maximizing the mutual information I(Z1; W2). An\nanalogous analysis for the branch b = 1 reveals that mini-\nmizing LSwAV,1 with the entropic regularisation assignment\nmaximizes the mutual information I(W1; Z2). In SwAV,\nthe prototypes are treated as parameters of the network (i.e.,\nC \u2208 \u03b8) and are updated using stochastic gradient descent to\nminimize LSwAV. This implies SwAV also maximizes ER.\n3.3. Distillation methods\nDistillation methods naturally optimize the reconstruction\nterm of the ER bound since the projection of one branch is\noptimized to predict the projection of the other branch. How-\never, it is more challenging to understand if and how they\nmight maximize the entropy term of ER, hence, we cannot\nyet claim they are maximizing the MI. There are some tools,\nsuch as EMA or centering, that distillation methods employ\nthat could have an effect on the entropy. In fact, such tools\nare key to prevent the phenomenon known as collapse (Grill\net al., 2020; Caron et al., 2021). Our analysis of their role\nbelow does not yield definitive, formal statements. However,\nit should still shed some light on this question.\nFirst, let us detail how each method maximizes the recon-\nstruction term of the ER bound. We start by analyzing the\nreconstruction term for the BYOL loss, which is the \u21132 nor-\nmalised mean squared error\nLBYOL := 1\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\n\r\r\rg\u03b8(Z(i)\n1 ) \u2212 Z(i)\n2\n\r\r\r\n2\n,\n(4)\nwhere x := x/\u2225x\u2225. Since \u2225x\u2212y\u22252 = 2(1\u2212sim(x, y)), op-\ntimizing (4) is equivalent to maximizing the reconstruction\nterm in the ER bound with a von Mises\u2013Fisher reconstruc-\ntion density with mean direction g\u03b8(Z(i)\n1 ) and concentration\nparameter 1. For DINO, the loss is similar to the one used\nby the clustering-based methods, namely\nLDINO := \u22121\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\ns\n\u0000(Z(i)\n2\n\u2212 C)/\u03c42\n\u0001\u22ba log\n\u0010\ns(Z(i)\n1 /\u03c41)\n\u0011\n,\n(5)\nwhere C is a centering variable, and \u03c41, \u03c42 are temperature\nhyperparameters. Letting pW2|Z2=z2 = s\n\u0000(z2 \u2212 C)/\u03c42\n\u0001\nand qW2|Z1=z1 = s(z1/\u03c41) shows that optimizing (5) is\nequivalent to maximizing the reconstruction term in the ER\nbound of I(Z1; W2) \u2264 I(Z1; Z2).\nLet us now analyze the potential effect of the stabilizing\nalgorithms used by distillation methods on the entropy of\nthe projections to understand if distillation methods also\nmaximize the entropy term of the ER bound. We focus on\nthe role of EMA and centering.\nEMA introduces an asymmetry between the teacher and the\nstudent in distillation methods (Figure 1b and d). Specif-\nically, the teacher\u2019s parameters \u03be track the student\u2019s pa-\nrameters \u03b8 during the optimization with the use of EMA:\n\u03be \u2190 \u03bb\u03be + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b8 for some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) close to 1. The\nhypothesis is two-fold: on the one hand, while \u03be does de-\npend on \u03b8, the dependence is weak enough so that H(Z2)\nor H(W2) is not degrading to values yielding trivial bounds.\nThis would happen in the extreme case of \u03be = \u03b8, for\nwhich minimizing the respective losses will have an op-\ntimal solution \u03b8\u22c6 that would be highly concentrated or de-\ngenerate around one point, under which H(Z2) \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nor H(W2) = 0, which clearly would not maximize the\nMI. On the other hand, the dependence of \u03be on \u03b8, while\nweak, ensures that the projections Z2 capture information\nabout the data. If this was not the case, e.g., by fixing \u03be\nto random values, the then random projections Z2 would\ncontain very little information about X. In this case, de-\nspite maximising I(Z1; Z2) via minimising the respective\nlosses and simultaneously ensuring constant entropy H(Z2)\n(due to the random projections), the information learned\nwould still be little as by the data processing inequality\nI(Z1; Z2) \u2264 I(X; Z2). BYOL and DINO balance this trade-\noff between not maximizing MI due to minimal entropy and\nmaximizing MI to a small achievable minimum with con-\nstant entropy with their choice of \u03bb, but the resulting effect\non entropy and MI maximization is hard to estimate.\nBeyond EMA, DINO also promotes a high conditional en-\ntropy H(W2|Z2) through the centering before the softmax\noperation. Like in SwAV, this avoids collapse as it controls\nthe entropy H(W2) via H(W2|Z2) \u2264 H(W2). To be pre-\ncise, the center C in (5) is updated with an EMA of the\nprevious projections, that is, C \u2190 \u00b5C + 1\u2212\u00b5\nk\nPk\ni=1 Z(i)\n2\nfor some \u00b5 \u2208 (0, 1). Then, the right balance between this\nEMA and the temperature parameters \u03c41 and \u03c42 adjusts\nhow uniform the conditional density pW2|Z2 is. This pro-\nmotes a high conditional entropy H(W2|Z2). However,\nhaving a completely uniform conditional density means that\npW2|Z2 = pW2 and thus no information of Z2 is in W2.\nFor this reason, Caron et al. (2021) need to also include a\nsharpening of the conditional density via the temperature\n\u03c42. Therefore, the degree of maximization of H(W2) is\nhard to quantify as it depends on the chosen values of the\nparameters \u00b5, \u03c41, and \u03c42.\n6\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nTable 1.

However, it is not yet possible\nto quantify these effects exactly, hence, one cannot make any\nstatement that distillation methods maximize MI, despite\nclearly maximizing the reconstruction term of the ER bound.\n4. Optimizing the ER bound in practice\nIn this section, we describe different ways to maximize\nthe ER bound regardless of the MVSSL prototype (see Fig-\nure 1). That is, we will describe how to estimate the entropy\nand the reconstruction term in (2) when the projections are\nnot processed (Figure 1a and c). The case when discrete\nsurrogates are generated (Figure 1b and d) is discussed in\nAppendix A.2. Then, the objective resulting from such an\nestimation is maximized. Later, in Section 5, we use these\napproaches on top of the architectures of current contrastive\nand distillation-based methods and observe that their perfor-\nmance is on par (or slightly better) than their original formu-\nlation, and that they become more resilient to the choice of\nthe batch size and EMA coefficient without the need for nei-\nther adjusted hyper-parameters nor accumulated gradients.\n4.1. Maximizing MI between projections\nWe consider an estimation of the ER bound of the MI be-\ntween the projections IER(Z1; Z2). Let f(z2, z1) be a func-\ntion measuring the similarity between z1 and z2. Choosing\nthe reconstruction density qZ2|Z1=z1(z2) \u221d exp f(z2, z1),\nan unbiased estimate of the reconstruction term is given by\nd\nReccont := 1\nk\nXk\ni=1 f(Z(i)\n2 , Z(i)\n1 ),\n(6)\nwhere the term associated with the normalizing constant of\nthe density is discarded as it does not affect the optimization.\nTo estimate the entropy term, one may consider different\nvariants of KDEs. For example, both the KDE of Joe (1989)\n\u02c6H(Z2)KDE,Joe := \u22121\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\nlog \u02c6pZ2(Z(i)\n2 )\n(7)\nor the plug-in estimator (Krishnamurthy & Wang, 2015)\n\u02c6H(Z2)KDE,plug-in := \u2212\nk\nX\ni=1\n\u02c6pZ2(Z(i)\n2 ) log \u02c6pZ2(Z(i)\n2 )\n(8)\ncan be used (both give similar results in practice, see Ap-\npendix D). Here, \u02c6pZ2(z) is Joe (1989)\u2019s KDE of pZ2:\n\u02c6pZ2(z) :=\n1\nkhd\nk\nX\nj=1\nq\n\u0012z \u2212 Z(j)\n2\nh\n\u0013\n,\n(9)\nwith kernel q(\u00b7) and bandwidth h \u2208 R+. Both the recon-\nstruction and the entropy estimators are (asymptotically)\nunbiased and converge in mean squared error (MSE) with\nan appropriate choice of the bandwidth (see Appendix A).\nThe selection of an optimal kernel bandwidth can be seen\nas a limitation of ER. While minimizing the number of\nhyper-parameters would be desirable, the bandwidth plays a\nsimilar role to the temperature term typically tuned in other\nSSL methods, e.g. (Chen et al., 2020a). So much so, that we\nadopted as bandwidth the same temperature parameter speci-\nfied by the SSL methods on top of which we incorporate ER.\nConnection to CL\nWhen the chosen kernel q is such\nthat q(z2 \u2212 z1) = f(z2, z1), then maximizing the ER bound\nwith estimators (6, 7) is equivalent to contrastive learning\nwith the negative samples being Sneg(Z(i)\n2 ) = Z(\u0338=i)\n2\n, up to\nconstants independent of the optimization parameters.\nConnection to Uniformity and Alignment\nThe align-\nment and uniformity objective of Wang & Isola (2020) is\na relaxation of the ER objective with estimators (6, 7). Let\nf(z2, z1) = \u2225z2 \u2212 z1\u2225\u03b1\n2 , then the estimator (6) recovers\ntheir alignment term. Consider also a kernel q(z2 \u2212 z1) \u221d\nexp\n\u0000\u2212 t\u2225z2 \u2212 z1\u22252\n2\n\u0001\n, then Joe (1989)\u2019s KDE (7) recovers\ntheir alignment term after applying Jensen\u2019s inequality.3\nHence, our analysis can be considered a natural extension\nof their analysis to other MVSSL families.\nConnection to Identifiability\nUnder certain assump-\ntions, MVSSL partitions the latent representations into\na content component, invariant to augmentations, and\na style component, which can change with augmenta-\ntions (Von K\u00a8ugelgen et al., 2021). The ER objective recovers\ntheir main theorem (Theorem 4.4) with a reconstruction den-\nsity qZ2|Z1=z1(z2) \u221d exp\n\u0000\u2212\u2225z2 \u2212 z1\u22252\n2\n\u0001\n. Moreover, CL\nmethods implicitly invert the underlying generative model\nof the observed data, again under certain assumptions (Zim-\nmermann et al., 2021). We show that the same is true for\nmethods maximising the ER bound, revealing that the main\nreason for this inversion is not the contrastive nature of the\nmethods, but that they maximize the mutual information\n(see Appendix B).\n3The application of Jensen\u2019s inequality makes Wang & Isola\n(2020)\u2019s objective a looser MI lower bound than the ER bound.\n7\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\n4.2. Dealing with an EMA\nThe maximization of the ER bound is compatible with an\nasymmetric structure (Figure 1c, d) where the teacher\u2019s pa-\nrameters \u03be are updated with an EMA of the student\u2019s param-\neters \u03b8. The objective is equivalent to the maximization of\nthe symmetric bound with an additional stop gradient\noperator on the teacher\u2019s projections. The optimization from\nthe reconstruction of the teacher from the student is unaf-\nfected. Then, since the entropy of the student\u2019s projections\nZ (or surrogates W) is maximized, it will also be maxi-\nmized for the teacher, which is only updated through the\nEMA. This is confirmed empirically in Section 5.\n5. Experiments\nIn this section, we show that replacing the objective of\ncommon MVSSL methods with the ER bound results in\ncompetitive performance while being more robust to the\nchanges in batch size and EMA coefficient without chang-\ning any other hyperparameters. Further experiments are\nincluded in Appendices E and G and the code is available\nat https://github.com/apple/ml-entropy-reconstruction.\nExperimental Setup\nFor all experiments, we pre-train a\nresnet50 (He et al., 2016) on the ImageNet (Deng et al.,\n2009) training set. We train for 400 epochs and follow-\ning Chen et al. (2020b) we use a batch size of 4096 with the\nLARS optimizer (You et al., 2017) with linear warmup, a\nsingle cycle cosine annealed learning rate schedule, and a\nbase learning rate of 0.3 (Goyal et al., 2017) . We chose\nBYOL, DINO, and SimCLR as baseline methods, with CMC\nresults presented in Appendix E. For each model except\nDINO, we substitute their objective function by the con-\ntinuous estimate of the ER bound from Section 4,4 while\nkeeping the original set of augmentations and their original\nprojection heads. For DINO we estimate the entropy as the\naverage of the discrete plug-in entropy among replicas. CMC\nshares augmentations and projection head with SimCLR.\nTraining with ER yields competitive accuracy\nWe train\na linear classifier on top of the ImageNet pre-trained features\nand report the test accuracy in Table 2. For all models, we\nkept their original hyperparameters.

This can also be observed in Figure 2. Note\nthat Grill et al. (2020) provided recipes to train BYOL with\nsmaller batch sizes by retuning hyperparemeters or by gradi-\nent accumulation. They also observed that the batch size had\na strong influence on the optimal EMA coefficient. Here, we\nlimit our observation to what happens when nothing else is\nchanged in the optimization. Interestingly, we observe that\nER significantly improves the resilience towards the change\nin batch size for all methods tested, especially for BYOL\nwhere the degradation is reduced from \u221220.32 to \u22120.21.\nRegarding the EMA coefficient, we observe a degradation\nof \u22128.25 for DINO and \u22122.62 for BYOL which are reduced\nto \u22120.92 and \u22120.41 respectively with ER.\nIn fact, we find that training with ER outperforms recent\nliterature on small-batch SSL training (HaoChen et al., 2021;\nChen et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2022). For example, for\nSimCLR with batch size 512, we report an accuracy of\n69.85 (Table 2) while the most recent of these works reports\nan accuracy of 68.8 (Yuan et al., 2022).\nBYOL does not maximize entropy\nFigure 2 shows the\nevolution of entropy and reconstruction during training (top\nand middle) and the ImageNet accuracy (bottom) (see Ap-\npendix F for clustering methods like DeepCluster and\nSwAV). We observe that methods trained with ER clearly\nmaximize entropy while others such as BYOL with batch\nsize 4096 display a slight decrease in entropy while still\nachieving high accuracy. This might provide an empirical\nanswer to the question left in Section 3.3 and indicate that\nBYOL does not maximize entropy. The EMA was intro-\nduced to avoid representation collapse in the absence of\nnegative samples. When properly tuned, the effect seems\nsufficient to maintain a high entropy and create discrimi-\nnative representations. Nevertheless, one could argue that\nit does not take full advantage of the overall space (or we\nwould observe higher entropy) and that the accuracy is very\nsensitive to its tunning (see Table 2 and Figure 2). In ad-\ndition to the EMA, DINO introduces a softmax centering\n8\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\n\u221248\n\u221247\n\u221246\nEntropy\nSimCLR\n\u221280\n\u221278\nBYOL\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMax Discrete Entropy\nDINO\n\u221253\n\u221252\n\u221251\n\u221250\nReconstruction Loss\n\u2212300\n\u2212200\n\u2212100\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTrain Epochs\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nVal Accuracy\nSimCLR\nSimCLR + ER\nSimCLR B512\nSimCLR B512 + ER\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTrain Epochs\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nBYOL\nBYOL + ER\nBYOL B512\nBYOL B512 + ER\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nTrain Epochs\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nDINO\nDINO + ER\nDINO B512\nDINO B512 + ER\nDINO w/o Softmax Centering\nDINO w/o Softmax Centering + ER\nFigure 2.

Notably, adding ER makes it possible to train DINO\nwithout softmax centering, which confirms that softmax cen-\ntering plays a role in keeping the entropy high (Section 3.3).\nER is not sensitive to the entropy estimator\nAll ER\nmodels except DINO used a KDE-based entropy estimator.\nTo gain more insight into the effect of the estimator, we\ntrain a continuous KDE-based version of DINO + ER and\ncompare it with the one reported in Table 2, which uses an\nexact discrete estimator. We find no significant differences\nbetween their performances (see Appendix E).\n6. Discussion\nWe showed to what extent different MVSSL methods max-\nimize MI through the ER bound on the MI. First, we re-\nvisited previous knowledge about the maximization of MI\nin contrastive methods and reinterpreted it in the context\nof ER. Second, we showed that two clustering-based meth-\nods, DeepCluster and SwAV, maximize the ER bound.\nThird, we interpreted two distillation-based methods, BYOL\nand DINO, as maintaining a stable level of entropy while\nmaximizing the reconstruction term of the ER bound.\nWe explained how ER can be optimized in most MVSLL\nframeworks, and we showed empirically that SimCLR,\nBYOL and DINO, when optimizing the ER bound result in a\nperformance which is competitive with that of the respective\noriginal versions. We also showed that it is not necessary\nfor distillation methods like BYOL to maximize entropy to\nachieve competitive results. This is an interesting observa-\ntion in the context of (Wang & Isola, 2020) who conclude\nboth alignment and uniformity are required for contrastive\nmethods to work well, we showed that at least for distil-\nlation methods, maximizing uniformity is not necessary.\nUniformity (or high entropy), however, seems to be corre-\nlated with resilience as all methods became more resilient to\nsmaller batch size and/or EMA coefficient when maximiz-\ning ER, with a particularly pronounced effect for distillation\nmethods. Understanding the exact mechanism for these\nbehaviors remains an exciting subject of future work.\nFinally, our theoretical analysis in Section 4.1 and Ap-\npendix B indicates that methods that explicitly maximize\nthe ER bound should yield desirable identifiability proper-\nties. We believe that exploring this result in practice is an\nexciting avenue for future research.\nAcknowldegments\nThe authors thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback,\nwhich resulted in new experiments and clarifications that\nstrengthened the paper, as well as the colleagues at Apple\nfor productive discussions that helped shape and fortify the\npaper, especially Effrosyni Simou, Michal Klein, Tatiana\nLikhomanenko, and R.

Entropy and reconstruction estimators\nMSE convergence\nIn this section, we describe the MSE behaviour of the en-\ntropy and reconstruction estimators of Section 4.\nA.1. Estimators on a \u201ccontinuous space\u201d\nA.1.1. ENTROPY ESTIMATION AND SELECTION OF THE\nBANDWIDTH PARAMETER\nThe bias and variance of Joe (1989)\u2019s KDE estimator\n\u02c6HKDE,Joe of the entropy H(Z2) are (Joe, 1989, Section 4,\npage 695)\nB[ \u02c6HKDE,Joe] \u2208 O(k\u22121h4\u2212d) + O(k\u22122h\u22122d) + O(h4) and\nV[ \u02c6HKDE, Joe] \u2208 O(k\u22121) + O(k\u22122h8\u2212d) + O(k\u22122h\u2212d)\n+ O(k\u22121h8\u2212d) + O(k\u22122h4\u22122d) + O(h8).\nHence, as long as h \u2208 O(k\u22121/(d+\u03b5)) for some small \u03b5 > 0\nboth the bias and the variance vanish, and the estimator\nconvergences in MSE, even if it does so at a slow rate.\nThen, a sensible choice of the bandwidth is h \u2248 1 since\nk\u22121/(d+\u03b5) \u2192 1 as d increases.\nUnder the mild assumption that the distribution of Zb is\n\u03b2-smooth (i.e., it belongs to the H\u00a8older or Sobolev classes)\nthen the bias and variance of both KDE estimators \u02c6HKDE\nare (Krishnamurthy & Wang, 2015)\nB[ \u02c6HKDE] \u2208 O(h\u03b2) and\nV[ \u02c6HKDE] \u2208 O(k\u22121h\u2212d).\nAs previously, the bias and the variance of the estimator\nonly vanish if h \u2208 O(k\u22121/(d+\u03b5)) for some small \u03b5 > 0,\nwith the optimal choice h = k\u22121/(d+2\u03b2). Nonetheless,\nhaving a bias term independent of the parameter of the\noptimisation is not harmful in itself. Hence, when the KDE\nestimator is employed only for optimisation purposes both\nh \u2208 O(k\u22121/(d+\u03b5)) and h \u2208 O(1) may work. For instance,\nfor the experiments using the von Mises\u2013Fisher distribution\nwe set h = 0.1 to match the temperature employed by (Tian\net al., 2020a, CMC) and (Chen et al., 2020a, SimCLR).\nA.1.2. RECONSTRUCTION ESTIMATION\nNote that log qZ2|Z(i)\n1 (Z(i)\n2 ) are independent and iden-\ntically distributed random variables with expectation\nE[log qZ2|Z1(Z2)].\nHence, the empirical estimator is\nunbiased.\nSimilarly, the variance of the estimator is\nV[ 1\nk\nPk\ni=1 log qZ2|Z(i)\n1 (Z(i)\n2 )] = \u03c32\nq/k, where the individ-\nual variance is \u03c32\nq = V[log qZ2|Z1(Z2)].\nConsider now that a reconstruction density is of the form\nqZ2|Z1=z1(z2) = Ce\u2212\u03c1(z2,z1) and that the projections\nlay in a convex body Z \u2208 Rd.\nThen, we know that\nlog qZ2|Z1=z2(z1) \u2208 [log C \u2212 \u03c1(Z), log C], where \u03c1(Z)\nis the diameter of Z with respect to \u03c1. Therefore, by the\nPopoviciu\u2019s inequality on variances we have that \u03c32\nq \u2264\n\u03c1(Z)2/4, which implies that for \u03c1(Z) < \u221e the estimator\nconverges in MSE. This holds for the two cases considered\nin this paper:\n\u2022 Von Mises\u2013Fisher distribution in Z = Sd\u22121: Here the\ndiameter with respect to \u03c1(z1, z2) = \u03basim(z1, z2) is\n\u03c1(Z) = \u03ba2 and hence the estimator converges in MSE\nat a \u03ba2/(4k) rate.\n\u2022 Gaussian distribution in Z = [\u22121, 1]d: Here the diam-\neter with respect to \u03c1(z1, z2) = \u2225z1 \u2212 z2\u22252/(2\u03c32) is\n\u03c1(Z) = 2d/\u03c32 and hence the estimator converges in\nMSE at a d/(2k\u03c32) rate.\nRemark A.1. Consider, without loss of generality from\nthe setting in Section 4, a reconstruction density of the\nform qZ2|Z1=z1(z2) = C(z1)e\u2212\u03c1(z2,z1). Then, to be pre-\ncise, the reconstruction estimate in (6) is biased with bias\nE[log C(Z1)]. However, since this term does not affect the\noptimization, we say the estimator is unbiased, meaning that\nis unbiased to the terms required for the optimization.\nTo see why the term does not affect the optimization, assume\nfirst that Z1 is fixed to z1. Then, C(z1) is a constant and\nclearly optimizing E[f(Z2, Z1)|Z1 = z1] + log C(z1) is\nequivalent to optimizing just E[f(Z2, Z1)]. Then, note that\nE[f(Z2, Z1) + log C(Z1)] = Ez1\u223cpZ1 [E[f(Z2, Z1)|Z1 =\nz1] + log C(z1)], and hence optimizing E[f(Z2, Z1)] is suf-\nficient.\nA.2. Estimators in a discrete space\nA.2.1. MAXIMIZING MI BETWEEN PROJECTIONS AND\nSURROGATES\nNow, we consider an estimation of the ER bound for the\nMI between the projections and the discrete surrogates\nI(Z1; W2). We will assume that the discrete surrogates\nare in [d]. As previously, we may consider the following\nunbiased estimate of the reconstruction term\nd\nRecdisc := 1\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\nlog qW2|Z1=Z(i)\n1 (W (i)\n2 ),\n(10)\nwhere the reconstruction density could simply be, for in-\nstance, qW2|Z1=z = s(z). Since W2 is a discrete RV, one\nmay consider the empirical estimate of the marginal, i.e.,\n\u02c6pW2 := 1\nk\nPk\ni=1 pW2|Z2=Z(i)\n2 , and use the unbiased plug-in\n12\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nestimate (Girsanov, 1959) of the entropy:\n\u02c6H(W2)plug-in := \u22121\nk\nk\nX\ni=1\n\u02c6pW2(W (i)\n2 ) log \u02c6pW2(W (i)\n2 ).\n(11)\nBoth the reconstruction and entropy estimators are unbiased\nand converge in MSE, see the following sections.\nRemark A.2. In practice, if the product of the batch size\nk and the discrete dimension d is large, one may instead\nconsider an average of plug-in estimates. For simplicity,\nassume that the batch size is a multiple of r \u2208 N, then this\nestimate is\n\u02c6H(W2)plug-in-avg := 1\nr\nr\nX\nj=1\n\u02c6H(W2)(j)\nplug-in\n(12)\nwhere \u02c6H(W2)(j)\nplug-in is the plug-in entropy estimate of the\nj-th chunk of the batch size data. Usually, each entropy\nestimation is done in a different machine, or replica.\nA.2.2. ENTROPY ESTIMATION\nThe plug-in estimator \u02c6HPI of the entropy H(W2) is known\nto have the following bias and variance terms (see e.g. (Gir-\nsanov, 1959, Equations (3) and (4)) or (Antos & Kontoyian-\nnis, 2001, Introduction)):\nB[ \u02c6Hplug-in] \u2208 O\n\u0010d \u2212 1\n2k\n\u0011\n+ O\n\u0010 1\nk2\n\u0011\nand\nV[ \u02c6Hplug-in] \u2208 O\n\u0010\u03c32\np\nk\n\u0011\n+ O\n\u0010 1\nk2\n\u0011\n,\nwhere \u03c32\np = V[\u2212 log pW2(W2)]. The bias and the variance\nvanish as long as d is fixed and \u03c32\np < \u221e, meaning that the\nestimator converges in MSE.\nNote that pW2 = E[s(Z2)], where s is the softmax operator.\nHence, we have that\nV[\u2212 log pW2(W2)] \u2264 E[log2 pW2(W2)]\n\u2264 E\n\u0014\u0010\nZ2,W2 \u2212 log\n\u0010\nd\nX\nl=1\neZ2,l\n\u0011\u00112\u0015\n\u2264 E\n\u0002\n(log d + Z2,max \u2212 Z2,min)2\u0003\n,\nwhere the first inequality follows from the fact that V[X] \u2264\nE[X2]; the second from Jensen\u2019s inequality and the formula\nof the softmax; and the last one from the log-sum-exp trick.\nHere, Z2,l denotes the l-th element of the random vector Z2.\nIn the particular case where the projections lie in the sphere\nSd\u22121 we have that \u03c32\np \u2264 (log d + 1)2. Similarly, if they lay\nin the cube [\u22121, 1]d, we have that \u03c32\np \u2264 (log d+2)2. There-\nfore, under these standard conditions the variance vanishes\nat a rate in O(log2(d)/k) + O(1/k2).\nRemark A.3. If the average of plug-in estimators is used\ninstead, we may note that this estimator will have a drop in\nbias and variance proportional to the number of replicas r,\nwhere the variance is not quadratically affected due to the\nvariance reduction effect of the averaging. More precisely,\nB[ \u02c6Hplug-in-avg] \u2208 O\n\u0010r(d \u2212 1)\n2k\n\u0011\n+ O\n\u0010 r\nk2\n\u0011\nand\nV[ \u02c6Hplug-in-avg] \u2208 O\n\u0010\u03c32\np\nk\n\u0011\n+ O\n\u0010 r\nk2\n\u0011\n.\nA.2.3. RECONSTRUCTION ESTIMATION\nAs in Appendix A.1.2, note that log qW2|Z(i)\n1 (W (i)\n2 ) are\nindependent and identically distributed random variables\nwith expectation E[log qW2|Z1(W2)]. Hence, the empirical\nestimator is unbiased. Similarly, the variance of the es-\ntimator is V[ 1\nk\nPk\ni=1 log qW2|Z(i)\n1 (W (i)\n2 )] = \u03c32\nq/k, where\n\u03c32\nq = V[log qW2|Z1(W2)]. Hence, the variance vanishes as\nlong as \u03c32\nq < \u221e, meaning that the estimator converges in\nMSE.\nAs for the entropy estimation, note that qW2|Z1 = s(Z1).\nHence, repeating the analysis above in Appendix A.2.2 we\nobtain that \u03c32\nq \u2264 E\n\u0002\n(log d+Z1,max\u2212Z1,min)2\u0003\nand therefore\nfor projections in the sphere Sd\u22121 or the cube [\u22121, 1]d the\nvariance vanishes at a rate in O(log2(d)/k) + O(1/k2).\nB. Properties of maximizing MI via BA\nThis section formalises and contextualises statements in\nSection 4.\nB.1. Recovering the true latent variables\nLet us consider the standard assumption in independent com-\nponents analysis (ICA), namely that the data X is generated\nby a nonlinear, invertible generative process X = g( \u02dcZ)\nfrom some original latent variables \u02dcZ. Assume further that\nthe different views from the image can be understood as\nV1 = g( \u02dcZ1) and V2 = g( \u02dcZ2), where there is some joint den-\nsity of the latent variables p \u02dc\nZ1, \u02dc\nZ2. The next theorem shows\nhow Zimmermann et al. (2021) theory can be adapted to\nprove that mutli-view SSL methods that maximize the mu-\ntual information between their projections I(Z1; Z2) can\nobtain projections equivalent to the true latent variables up\nto affine transformations.\nTheorem B.1. Assume that the latent variables and the\nnetwork\u2019s projections lay on a convex body Z \u2208 Rd. Fur-\nther assume that the latent variables\u2019 marginal distribution\nis uniform and that the conditional density is described\nby a semi-metric \u03c1 as p \u02dc\nZ2| \u02dc\nZ1=\u02dcz1(\u02dcz2) = C(\u02dcz1)e\u2212\u03c1(\u02dcz1,\u02dcz2).\nNow let the reconstruction density match the conditional\ndensity up to a constant scaling factor qZ2|Z1=z1(z2) =\nCh(\u02dcz1)e\u2212\u03b1\u03c1(z1,z2). If the generative process g and the pa-\n13\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nrameterised network functions \u03c0\u25e6f are invertible and differ-\nentiable, and the parameters \u03b8 maximize the lower bound (2)\nof the mutual information I(Z1; Z2), then the projections\nare equivalent to the true latent variables up to affine trans-\nformations.\nProof. As in (Zimmermann et al., 2021), let h = \u03c0 \u25e6 f \u25e6 g\nbe a helper function that brings the true latent variables to\nthe projections so that Z1 = h( \u02dcZ1) and Z2 = h( \u02dcZ2).\nDisregard for a moment the entropy term H(Z2). From\n(Zimmermann et al., 2021, Proposition 4) we know that\nif the reconstruction term is maximized (the cross en-\ntropy is minimised) then \u03c1(\u02dcz1, \u02dcz2) = \u03b1\u03c1(h(\u02dcz1), h(\u02dcz2)) and\nC(\u02dcz1) = Ch(\u02dcz1). Moreover, from (Zimmermann et al.,\n2021, Theorem 4) we further know that h is an invert-\nible affine transformation; i.e. Z2 = A \u02dcZ2 + b for some\nA \u2208 Rd\u00d7d and some b \u2208 Rd.\nNow note that\nH(Z2) = \u2212E\nh\nlog E\nh\nCh( \u02dcZ1)e\u2212\u03b1\u03c1(h( \u02dc\nZ1),h( \u02dc\nZ2)ii\n= \u2212E\nh\nlog E\nh\nC( \u02dcZ1)e\u2212\u03c1( \u02dc\nZ1, \u02dc\nZ2)ii\n= H( \u02dcZ2).\nThen, since the latent variables\u2019 are uniformly distributed,\ntheir entropy is maximal H( \u02dcZ) = log |Z|.\nTherefore, the unique family of maximizers of the recon-\nstruction term recover the latent variables up to affine trans-\nformations are maximizers of the entropy, and hence are\nthe unique family of maximizers of the mutual information.\nIndeed, take some other maximizer of the entropy, if it is not\nfrom this family, it is not a maximizer of the reconstruction\nand therefore the resulting mutual information is lower.\nRemark B.2. Following the same reasoning and supporting\non Zimmermann et al. (2021)\u2019s theory, we may note that\nin the particular case that the semi-metric \u03c1 is described by\nan Lp norm, then the projections are equivalent to the true\nlatent variables up to generalised permutations; that is, Z =\nA \u02dcZ for some A \u2208 Rd\u00d7d such that (Az)i = \u03b1\u03b2iz\u03c3(i), where\n\u03b1 \u2208 R, \u03b2i \u2208 {1, \u22121}, and \u03c3 is a permutation. Similarly,\nin the more restrictive case that the projections are in the\nsphere Z = Sd\u22121 and the conditional densities are von\nMises\u2013Fisher densities, then the projections are equivalent\nto the true latent variables up to linear transformations; that\nis, Z = A \u02dcZ for some A \u2208 Rd\u00d7d such that A\u22baA = \u03b1I for\nsome \u03b1 \u2208 R.\nB.2. Empirical evaluation of identifiability properties\nIn order to empirically study the consequences of the the-\noretical results of the previous section, we replicate the\nresults of the experiments reported in (Zimmermann et al.,\n2021, Tables 1 and 2) and study the impact of using the ER\nobjective on the identifiability properties.\nThe results are reported in Tables 3 and 4. The results\nof Zimmermann et al. (2021) are reported in the column\nInfoNCE as they train their unsupervised models with the\nInfoNCE objective. In these experiments, we used Joe\n(1989)\u2019s entropy estimator (7) and we set the KDE band-\nwidth to h = 1 or h = 10 as per (9) (we report both results).\nAt a high level, our results indicate that using the ER ob-\njective yields qualitatively similar identifiability properties\nas using the InfoNCE objective, as predicted by theory.\nOne discrepancy of note is the difference for h = 10 in the\nfirst row of Table 3 since that is the setting for which the\ngenerative process and the model match the assumptions of\nTheorem B.1. However, for h = 1, the performance is close\nto the once achieved by InfoNCE. Other settings, includ-\ning those which break the theoretical assumptions, do not\nexhibit significant differences between ER and InfoNCE.\nB.3. Isolating semantic from irrelevant information\nSimilarly to Appendix B.1, let us consider that the data X\nis generated by a nonlinear, invertible generative process\nX = g( \u02dcZ) from some original latent variables Z and that\nthe different views can be understood as V1 = g( \u02dcZ1) and\nV2 = g( \u02dcZ2), where there is some joint density of the latent\nvariables p \u02dc\nZ1, \u02dc\nZ2.\nAssume that the latent variables can be written as \u02dcZ =\n[S, U], where S \u2208 Rd is some semantic (or content) vari-\nable, U \u2208 Rdu is some irrelevant (or style) variable, and [\u00b7]\ndenotes the concatentation operation. Furthermore, let us\nadopt the assumptions from Von K\u00a8ugelgen et al. (2021) for\nthe content-preserving conditional density p \u02dc\nZ2| \u02dc\nZ1.\nAssumption B.3 (Content-invariance). The conditional den-\nsity p \u02dc\nZ2| \u02dc\nZ1 of the latent variables of different views has the\nform\np \u02dc\nZ2| \u02dc\nZ1=\u02dcz1(\u02dcz2) = \u03b4(s2 \u2212 s1)pU2|U1=u1(u2),\nfor all \u02dcz1 = [s1, u1] and \u02dcz2 = [s2, u2] in Z and where\npU2|U1=u1 is continuous for all u1 \u2208 Rdu.\nAssumption B.4 (Style changes). Let A be the set of sub-\nsets of irrelevant variables A \u2286 {1, . . . , du} and let pA be\na density on A. Then, the conditional density pU2|U1 is\nobtained via sampling a \u223c pA and letting\npU2|U1,A=u1,a(u2) = \u03b4(u2,ac, u1,ac)pU2,a|U1,a=u1,a(u2,a),\nwhere pU2,a|U1,a=u1,a is a continuous density for all u1,a \u2208\nR|a|, and where u2,a is an abuse of notation to refer to the\nelements of u2 indexed by a, and analogously for u1 and\nfor ac, which is a shortcut for A \\ a.\nThen, the next theorem shows how Von K\u00a8ugelgen et al.\n(2021) can be adapted to prove that multi-view SSL meth-\nods that maximize the mutual information between the pro-\n14\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nTable 3.

Consider Assumption B.3 and Assump-\ntion B.4 and further assume that\n1. the generative process g is smooth, invertible and with\na smooth inverse (i.e., a diffeomorphism);\n2. p \u02dc\nZ is a smooth, continuous density on Z with p \u02dc\nZ > 0\na.e.; and\n3. for any j \u2208 {1, . . . , nu}, there is an a \u2286 {1, . . . , nu}\nsuch that j \u2208 a, pA(a) > 0, pU2,a|U1,a=u1,a(u2,a) is\nsmooth with respect to both u1,a and u2,a, and for any\nu1,a it holds that pU2,a|U1,a=u1,a(u2,a) > 0 for all u2,a\nin some open, non-empty subset containing u1,a.\nIf the parameterised network function \u03c0 \u25e6 f is smooth, the\nprojections space is (0, 1)d \u2286 Rd, and the parameters \u03b8 are\nfound to maximize the mutual information I(Z1; Z2) lower\nbound (2) with the reconstruction density qZ2|Z1=z1(z2) =\nCgauss(1)e\u2212\u2225z2\u2212z2\u22252\n2, then there is a bijection between the\nprojections Z and the true semantic variables S.\nProof.

Algorithm\nAlgorithm 1 describes the main algorithm to maximise the\nER bound. The algorithm includes the possibility of con-\nsidering the projections in the standard projection space Z,\nwhich usually is the d-shpere, or to further generate dis-\ncrete surrogates in {1, 2, . . . , d}. In case the projections are\n15\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\nnot further processed, it allows to use either Joe (1989)\u2019s\nor the plug-in KDE estimators for the entropy. Finally, it\nalso includes an option to add the ER bound into distillation\nmethods. The algorithm does not spell out how to extend it\nto more than two views, but that is done in the usual way,\nsee e.g. (Caron et al., 2021).\nD. Performance of different KDE estimators\nIn Section 4.1, we show that the entropy term of ER can\nbe approximated with Joe (1989)\u2019s KDE or the plug-in es-\ntimator (Krishnamurthy & Wang, 2015). In Figure 3 we\nempirically show that using both estimators to optimize the\nER bound on SimCLR (SimCLR + ER) leads to the same\nperformance in terms of ImageNet top-1 accuracy.\nE. Extended results\nTable 5 extends Table 2 with CMC and EMA ablation for\nSimCLR + ER and DINO + ER. As it can be seen the EMA\nis essential for distillation methods to achieve good perfor-\nmance. Thus, we hypothesize that the function of EMA is\nnot only limited to keeping the entropy high. We observe\nthat all contrastive methods, including CMC, are more stable\nwhen reducing the batch size than distillation methods.\nFor Table 5, we used a continuous entropy KDE-estimator\nfor every method. This includes DINO, contrary to the exact\ndiscrete estimator used in the main text (Table 2), showing\nthat ER is resilient to the entropy estimator used. To make it\nclearer, we run an ablation with the two estimators and ob-\nserve no significant difference in their results (see Table 6).\nTable 5.

Entropy minimization in discrete MVSSL\nalgorithms\nFigure 4 shows the evolution of the entropy for discrete\nmethods such as SwAV, DeepCluster, and DINO. The\nentropy is normalized by log |W|, which is the maximum\npossible entropy for these methods. We observe that while\nthe normalized entropy does not increase over time, its\nvalue is kept close to the maximum. This is expected for\nSwAV and DeepCluster, since we have shown that they\nmaximize the ER (Section 3.2). For DINO, we showed that\nsoftmax centering and sharpening could be used to maintain\na high entropy value (Section 3.3 and Figure 4).\nThe behavior of the entropies was to be expected, as we\ndiscuss below.\nIn SwAV, the Sinkhorn-Knopp in the first iteration al-\nmost completely accomplishes that the conditional entropy\npW2|Z2 = 1m/m, as it has full liberty to do so. Therefore,\nthe marginal entropy pW2 is uniform and the entropy is max-\nimal. As the iterations continue, the tension between the\ncross entropy related to the reconstruction term and the en-\ntropy maximization, together with the fact that Caron et al.\n(2020) only perform three iterations of the Sinkhorn-Knopp\nalgorithm, push the conditional entropy pW2|Z2 slightly\naway from uniformity, thus decreasing the entropy.\nIn DeepCluster, the images of each batch are sampled\nbased on a uniform distribution over cluster assignments,\ni.e. for each batch pW2 \u2248 1\nk\nPk\ni=1 p(i)\n2\nis almost uniform.\nThis way, the entropy H(W2) is approximately maximized.\nIn DINO, the centering step at the first iteration, before\nthe weights have been updated, completely accomplishes\na uniform conditional distribution, as then \u03be = \u03b8 and thus\nthe sharpening has no effect. In the second iteration, the\nweights already are different \u03be \u0338= \u03b8, and the low value of the\ntemperature pushes the conditional entropy pW2|Z2 away\nfrom uniformity. This is compensated by the centering,\nwhich avoids that pW2|Z2 becomes completely degenerate.\nTherefore, the result is an entropy that is lower than the\nmaximal (sharpening) but not minimal (centering). The ten-\nsion between these to mechanisms evolves towards higher\nentropies as the temperature is scheduled to increase over\ntime, and thus the entropy does too.\n16\nThe Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nEpoch\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\nTest Top 1 (%)\n\u02c6HKDE,Joe\n\u02c6HKDE,plug\u2212in\nFigure 3.

This objective is theoreti-\ncally justified as a lower bound on the mutual information\nbetween the projections of different branches.

Under this interpretation, we may under-\nstand better the results obtained with the different weights\nsince lower values of \u03bb lead to flatter densities and high\nvalues of \u03bb to very spikier densities:\n\u2022 If the density is very flat, then the reconstruction term\ndoes not vary much even if Z1 and Z2 are close. This\nhappens as the reconstruction density makes Z1 and\nZ2 only loosely dependent. Therefore, the network has\na hard time learning and the performance decreases.\n\u2022 If the density is very spiky (almost a delta), then it\nmeans that Z1 \u2248 Z2, so the network collapses.\nWhen the projections are projected into a discrete surrogate,\nthen the \u03bb parameter should only be interpreted as a temper-\nature parameter similar to those in other MVSSL methods.\nHowever, the understanding and intuition provided above\nstill apply.\n18\n"

Loomba 1 Shichang Zhang 1 Yizhou Sun 1 Wei Wang 1\nAbstract\nMost of the existing Large Language Model\n(LLM) benchmarks on scientific problem rea-\nsoning focus on problems grounded in high-\nschool subjects and are confined to elementary\nalgebraic operations. To systematically exam-\nine the reasoning capabilities required for solv-\ning complex scientific problems, we introduce\nan expansive benchmark suite SCIBENCH for\nLLMs. SCIBENCH contains a carefully curated\ndataset featuring a range of collegiate-level scien-\ntific problems from mathematics, chemistry, and\nphysics domains. Based on the dataset, we con-\nduct an in-depth benchmarking study of repre-\nsentative open-source and proprietary LLMs with\nvarious prompting strategies. The results reveal\nthat the current LLMs fall short of delivering sat-\nisfactory performance, with the best overall score\nof merely 43.22%. Furthermore, through a de-\ntailed user study, we categorize the errors made\nby LLMs into ten problem-solving abilities. Our\nanalysis indicates that no single prompting strat-\negy significantly outperforms the others and some\nstrategies that demonstrate improvements in cer-\ntain problem-solving skills could result in declines\nin other skills. We envision that SCIBENCH will\ncatalyze further developments in the reasoning\nabilities of LLMs, thereby ultimately contributing\nto scientific research and discovery.\n1. Introduction\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave dramatically expanded the boundaries of artificial in-\ntelligence (Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023b; OpenAI., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a; Zhang et al.,\n2023a;b). They have demonstrated outstanding performance\n*Equal contribution\n1University of California, Los Angeles\n2California Institute of Technology 3University of Washington.\nCorrespondence to: Xiaoxuan Wang <xw27@cs.ucla.edu>.\nin many mathematical reasoning tasks that are typically\nconsidered challenging even for well-educated individu-\nals (Chen et al., 2021; 2023a; Gao et al., 2022; Kojima et al.,\n2022; Wei et al., 2022). Notably, GPT-4 achieves a remark-\nable score of 163 out of 170 on GRE Quantitative Exam,\nplacing it at the 80th percentile ranking (OpenAI., 2023).\nWhile the remarkable improvements in these benchmark\nperformances might suggest that LLMs are capable of\nperforming scientific reasoning tasks, we argue that this\nassertion might be overly optimistic due to the inherent\nlimitations of the current benchmarks. Firstly, many ex-\nisting benchmarks such as ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022)\nand GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) only contain problems\ngrounded in grade-level subjects. Although other bench-\nmarks like MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) introduce high-\nschool level questions, they primarily focus on math prob-\nlems. Secondly, recent works like MMLU (Hendrycks et al.,\n2020), AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023), and JEEBench (Arora\net al., 2023), despite introducing challenging problems\nthat span a wide range of disciplines, only require basic\ncomputations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\nexponentiation\u2014which do not adequately assess the depth\nof reasoning abilities of LLMs for solving scientific prob-\nlems. Lastly, most of these benchmarks only include textual\nproblems, which omit the problems that incorporate visual\nelements such as figures or diagrams.\nIn parallel to benchmark developments, many studies pro-\npose various prompting strategies aimed at enhancing the\nreasoning abilities of LLMs in scientific problem solving. A\nnotable example is the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach,\nwhich instructs LLMs to generate detailed, step-by-step so-\nlutions that prompt deeper problem thinking (Huang et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022).\nAdditionally, other strategies propose to enable LLMs to\nutilize external tools (Lu et al., 2023b; Schick et al., 2023)\nthat improve the numerical computation capability. How-\never, even these strategic approaches, each with its specific\nstrengths, struggle to fully address complex scientific prob-\nlems. Consider an example problem from college-level\nPhysical Chemistry (Atkins et al., 2014b) that requires the\nuse of the Planck distribution to derive certain quantities.\n1\narXiv:2307.10635v2  [cs.CL]  8 Feb 2024\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nProblem (Using the Planck distribution)\nCompare the energy output of a black-body radiator (such as an incandescent lamp) at two different wavelengths by calculating the ratio of the energy output \nat 450 nm (blue light) to that at 700 nm (red light) at 298 K.\nCorrect Solution\nAt a temperature T, the ratio of the spectral density of \nstates at a wavelength \u03bb1 to that at \u03bb2 is given by\nInsert the data and evaluate this ratio.\nAnswer With \u03bb1 = 450 nm and \u03bb2 = 700 nm, \u2026, and \ntherefore\nFinal Answer:\nGPT Solution with CoT Prompting\nStep 1: We need to use the Planck distribution formula to \ncalculate the energy output of a black-body radiator.

\u21e5 10\u221216\nFigure 1. An example problem from Physical Chemistry with solutions generated under two prompting strategies. GPT-4 with Chain-of-\nThought (CoT) prompting shows calculation errors, while GPT-4 that prompts Python as external tools misunderstands mathematical\nequations. Errors are highlighted in red and the corrections are shown in purple.\nAs shown in Figure 1, LLMs with CoT prompts accurately\ngenerate the correct formula, but fail in the final numerical\ncalculation. As a remedy, when instructed to simultaneously\ngenerate a Python program for numerical computation and\nemploy the CoT reasoning, the LLM misplaces \u03bb1 in the\nnumerator rather than the denominator in the formula, il-\nlustrating a misunderstanding of mathematical relationships\nwhen employing external tools. This example highlights a\ncrucial gap: even advanced LLMs struggle with complex\nscientific problem solving, necessitating a fine-grained anal-\nysis of the skills required for such complex tasks.\nTo mitigate these deficiencies, in this paper, we present a\nnovel college-level Scientific problem solving Benchmark,\nreferred to as SCIBENCH. SCIBENCH contains a carefully\ncurated dataset of college-level scientific problems, includ-\ning 789 problems collected from widely-used textbooks in\ncollege-level Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics courses.\nDistinct from existing benchmarks, all of the problems are\nopen-ended, free-response questions that demand multi-step\nreasoning abilities, the understanding of scientific concepts,\nthe retrieval of domain-specific knowledge (e.g., equations\nand theorems), and complex numeric computation capabili-\nties (e.g., calculus or differential equations). Besides that,\nour dataset includes a multimodal subset of 94 problems\nthat incorporate visual elements (such as graphs and figures)\nas additional contexts, which enables of the evaluation of\nmultimodal LLMs. It is noted that SCIBENCH also includes\nstep-by-step solutions for example problems, facilitating\ndetailed error analysis. To align our evaluation with real-\nworld scenarios, we provide a separate, closed dataset that\nencompasses 103 problems from seven sets of midterm and\nfinal exams from collegiate Computer Science and Math\ncourses. To ensure the integrity of our evaluation, these\ndatasets have been manually extracted from PDF documents\nand formatted into LaTeX documents, thereby minimizing\nthe risk of their leakage in LLM training data.\nOur evaluation includes a wide range of representative\nopen-source and proprietary LLMs. For unimodal, textual-\nbased LLMs, we assess LLaMA-2, Mistral, Claude2, GPT-\n3.5, GPT-4, and their variants.\nFor multimodal vision-\nlanguage models, our analysis includes GPT-4, InternLM-\nXComposer2, Qwen-VL, SPHINX-MoE, LLaVA. These\nmodels are tested using various prompting strategies, in-\ncluding CoT, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning. We\nalso prompt LLMs to utilize external scientific computing\nlibraries in Python and Wolfram language. The experimen-\ntal results indicate that the complexity and difficulty of our\ndataset are sufficient to differentiate the performance levels\nof different LLMs. Even with the strongest configuration\u2014\ncombining CoT prompting and the use of external tools\u2014\nthe best model achieves an average score of 43.22% on\nthe textual dataset, 13.8% on the multimodal dataset, and\n51.57% on the closed exam dataset. These results suggest a\nconsiderable potential for improvement in future LLMs.\nIn order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the limi-\ntations of LLMs in scientific problem solving, we propose\na novel self-refinement method to uncover the deficient\nskills in the solutions made by LLMs. Firstly, we com-\npare the correct solutions with the solutions generated by\nLLMs and, with the assistance of human annotators, sum-\nmarize ten essential skills requisite for successful scientific\nproblem-solving. These skills include proficiency in domain\nknowledge, mathematical reasoning, numerical calculation\n2\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nTable 1.

Our analysis finds that (1) although\nCoT significantly improves the calculation ability, it is less\neffective in other aspects; (2) prompts with the use of exter-\nnal tools could potentially compromise the other fundamen-\ntal skills; (3) few-shot learning does not universally improve\nscientific problem-solving skills.\n2. Related Work\nRecently, many benchmarks have been proposed to assess\nthe scientific problem-solving skills of LLMs, particularly\nin mathematical domains (Chen et al., 2023b; Fu et al., 2023;\nGuo et al., 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2023c;d;\nMishra et al., 2022; Welleck et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2023).\nNotable works include GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) includ-\ning 8.5K grade school math word problems; LILA (Mishra\net al., 2022) which extends 20 datasets with task instruc-\ntions and Python solutions; MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021)\na challenging collection of 12.5K math problems from math\ncompetitions; TheroemQA (Chen et al., 2023b), focusing\non theorem applications on problem solving; and Math-\nVista (Lu et al., 2023a), evaluate the mathematical reasoning\nability of LLMs in visual contexts.\nFor a more holistic evaluation, recent studies have expanded\ntheir scope to multiple disciplines: ScienceQA (Lu et al.,\n2022) introduces a multimodal question-answering dataset\nwith accompanying lecture notes and explanatory annota-\ntions. Taylor et al. (2022) provide a set of scientific tasks,\nincluding LaTeX equation conversions, domain knowledge\nprobes, citation prediction, and chemical question answer-\ning. BIG-Bench (Ghazal et al., 2013) offers a large-scale\ngeneral-purpose test suite requires 204 multiple-choice or\nexact-match tasks, and its extension BIG-Bench Hard (Suz-\ngun et al., 2022) poses challenging CoT prompts. Sci-\nEval (Sun et al., 2023) includes a mix of objective and\nsubjective questions across multiple scientific fields to as-\nsess understanding, application, and research capabilities.\nJEEBench (Arora et al., 2023) incorporates pre-engineering-\nlevel scientific problems derived from college entrance ex-\nams. AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023) evaluates LLMs on\nhuman-centric standardized exams, such as college entrance\nexams and lawyer qualification tests.\nDespite their extensive coverage across diverse disciplines,\nthese datasets exhibit certain limitations. Sourced from\nlower educational level subjects, the majority of them fo-\ncus on basic arithmetic operations rather than advanced\nmathematical computations. Furthermore, most of these\nbenchmarks are confined to textual-only problems, neglect-\ning the inclusion of problems with visual elements such\nas graphs or diagrams. These drawbacks result in an in-\ncomplete assessment of the analytical and problem-solving\nskills required to tackle complex scientific problems. On\nthe contrary, SCIBENCH focuses on college-level scientific\nproblems across a broad spectrum of disciplines including\nMathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. It emphasizes on\na deep understanding of diverse scientific concepts, chal-\nlenging LLMs to not only grasp these principles but also\nto efficiently retrieve and apply relevant knowledge. Fur-\nthermore, it demands sophisticated numerical computation\nskills. This includes the execution of advanced mathemati-\ncal operations such as calculus and differential equations, as\nwell as the application of advanced statistical and probability\ntheories. We also include multimodal problems that neces-\nsitate the interpretation and integration of both textual and\nvisual information. A detailed comparison of SCIBENCH\nwith some representative works is summarized in Table 1.\nFor readers of interest, an expanded discussion of related\nwork can be found in Appendix E.\n3\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nTable 2.

The chosen prob-\nlems demand a solid understanding of domain-specific\nknowledge, adept calculation skills, and the ability to\nperform complex numerical computations.\n\u2022 Inclusion of detailed solutions. To facilitate a thorough\nanalysis of the limitations of LLMs, detailed solutions\nshould be provided as well, which could facilitate a finer-\ngrained examination of the capacity of LLMs to handle\ncomplex problem-solving tasks.\n\u2022 Inclusion of visual elements. In real-world, many scien-\ntific problems require the interpretation and integration of\nboth textual and visual information. The included prob-\nlems should thus contain visual elements (such as figures)\nin the contexts.\n\u2022 Inaccessibility in text formats. To ensure an unbiased\nevaluation, questions should not be readily accessible\nonline and cannot be easily extracted or transformed into\ntext. This aims to mitigate any potential information\nleakage from the exposure of LLMs to pre-existing online\nquestion banks, such as those found in standardized tests\nlike the SAT exams.\n\u2022 Assessment of advanced problem-solving capabilities.\nThe problems to benchmark should not be confined to\nbasic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplica-\ntion. Rather, they should enable evaluating the capability\nof LLMs in performing advanced computations such as\ncalculus and differential equations.\nAccordingly, to construct the dataset, we select ten text-\nbooks from three scientific fields Physics, Chemistry, and\nMathematics that have been extensively used in college\ncourses. We summarize the statistics of this textbook dataset\nin Table 2 and we use acronyms to refer to each textbook\nthroughout the paper for brevity. Furthermore, in order\nto simulate real-world evaluation, we compile a closed set\nof exam questions from college courses from Computer\nScience and Math departments, including Data Mining, Ma-\nchine Learning, and Differential Equations. This subset is\nless likely to be in LLM training data, making it an effective\ntool for LLM evaluation. Detailed statistics of these exam\nproblems are summarized in Table S1. We refer readers to\nAppendix A for details on these textbooks and exams.\nTo reduce the likelihood of correct answers being merely\nguessed from candidates, we choose to mainly include ques-\ntions with more challenging, free-response answers, rather\nthan multiple-choice questions in previous works (Chen\net al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2021a; 2022). In order to facili-\ntate standardized and automated evaluation, we focus on\nanswers that only contain single numerical numbers to avoid\nambiguity for the textbook dataset. Further, we convert the\nanswer to floating-point numbers rounded to three decimal\nplaces. For example, the answer\n\u221a\n2\n\u03c0 will be converted to\nthe decimal representation of 0.450. We also treat scientific\nnotation as a unit to avoid overflow issues. For example, if\nthe answer is 2.2\u00d710\u221231 m, we take 2.2 as the final answer\nand 10\u221231 m as the unit.\nData preprocessing. We collect each problem from the\noriginal textbooks in PDF documents and manually process\nthem into LaTeX documents using an OCR tool Mathpix.\nThe data is manually collected by human annotators using\na web-based annotation tool (Lu et al., 2021a), whose user\ninterface is shown in Appendix A.3. All problems are care-\nfully verified by human annotators to ensure that LaTeX\ndocuments can be compiled without any syntax errors. For\nreference, we also provide the original numbers in textbooks.\nFor every problem, we provide the answer in two forms: the\n4\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nTable 3.

Experiments\nThis section presents the experiments to assess the capa-\nbilities of LLMs in scientific problem-solving. We first\ndescribe our experimental setup. Subsequently, we evaluate\nunimodal LLMs on the textbook dataset. Following this,\nwe include additional experiments on the multimodal subset\nand the closed exam subset, as well as comparisons with\nother numerical computational tools.\n4.1. Experiment Setup\nWe evaluate the textbook dataset on seven unimodal\nLLMs, which include four proprietary models: Claude2\n(claude2) (Anthropic., 2023),\nGPT-3.5-Turbo (gpt-\n3.5-turbo) (OpenAI., 2022), GPT-4 (gpt-4), GPT-4-\nTurbo (gpt-4-turbo) (OpenAI., 2023), along with three\nopen-source models: LLaMA-2-7B (llama-2-7b-chat),\nLLaMA-2-70B (llama-2-70b-chat) (Touvron et al.,\n2023b), and Mistral-7B (mistral-7b-instruct) (Jiang\net al., 2023). We consider two prompting strategies, includ-\ning the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and prompting\nto use external tools.\n\u2022 Zero-shot and few-shot learning. In the zero-shot learn-\ning setting, models are not provided with any prior ex-\namples, which evaluates their inherent problem-solving\ncapabilities with background knowledge and reasoning\n5\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nabilities. In the few-shot setting, a few of examples are\ngiven to the models before the test example. This aims\nto assess their capability to learn new information from\nthe demonstrations and incorporate it into their problem-\nsolving processes.\n\u2022 Prompting-based approaches. For our experiments, all\nsettings begin with a system prompt that describes the\ntypes and categories of questions. Additionally, we utilize\na CoT prompting strategy in zero- and few-shot settings.\n\u2022 Tool-augmented approaches. Given that LLMs are lim-\nited to acquiring exact knowledge and performing precise\ncalculations, some recent approaches, such as PAL (Gao\net al., 2022) and PoT (Chen et al., 2023a) explore uti-\nlizing external tools such as the Python interpreter for\nprogram synthesis to enhance the capabilities of solving\ncomplex reasoning tasks. In line with these approaches\nand acknowledging the limitations of LLMs in perform-\ning precise calculations, we also include a setting that\nprompts the model to convert its solution steps in natu-\nral language into Python code, aiming to achieve more\naccurate results for certain computation steps. This tool-\naugmented approach can only be tested in the few-shot\nlearning setting. We manually construct Python programs\nthat produce the correct answer.\nImplementation details. We set temperature to zero for all\nmodels to reduce the randomness of the predictions. Few-\nshot examples, including solutions, are randomly selected\nfrom problems within each textbook. When external tools\nare used, we add a code snippet that translates the solution\ninto specific programming languages in all few-shot exam-\nples. The code snippets are verified by human annotators\nthat will produce the correct output. In terms of evaluation\nmetrics, we compare the model outputs with the correct\nanswers, allowing a relative tolerance of 5%. In particular\nto the exam dataset, the model solutions are graded using\nthe rubrics provided by the instructors. Readers may refer to\nAppendix C for all prompts and the implementation details\nfor utilizing external tools.\n4.2. Results and Analysis\nWe report the model performance in terms of accuracy score\nfor each textbook and an average score over all problems.\nThe results of all LLMs in various settings on the textbook\nand the exam dataset are summarized in Tables 3 and S2\nrespectively. We have the following observations.\n\u2022 Observation 1. SCIBENCH is complex enough to differ-\nentiate among LLMs. Our results show that open-source\nmodels such as LLaMA-2 and Mistral are consistently\noutperformed by their proprietary counterparts across all\nsettings within the textbook dataset. Notably, GPT-4 and\nGPT-4-Turbo lead in performance by a significant mar-\ngin. For example, GPT-4-Turbo outperforms Mistral-7B\n7B\n13B\n45B\nOther\nModel Size\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAverage Score (%)\nProprietary\nOpen-Source\nInternLM-XComposer2\nQwen-VL-Plus\nLLaVA (LLaMA-2-13B)\nSPHINX-MoE\nGPT-4 (CoT)\nGPT-4 (PoT)\nFigure 2. Performance of LLMs on the multimodal subset. GPT-4\nmodels are augmented with image captions and OCR text.\nby 34.76% in the zero-shot setting. Additionally, within\nboth LLaMA and GPT series, we observe a clear cor-\nrelation between increased model capacity (i.e., larger\nparameter sizes) and improved performance. Therefore,\nthe complexity of SCIBENCH is able to differentiate the\nperformance among different LLMs.\n\u2022 Observation 2. SCIBENCH highlights varied efficacy\nof prompting strategies across LLMs. Our findings\nsuggest that the effectiveness of employing prompting\nstrategies or external computational tools varies signif-\nicantly among different LLMs. As shown in the table,\nLLaMA-2-70B shows a marked improvement in the few-\nshot setting over the zero-shot setting, increasing from\n2.41% to 8.40%. Similarly, the performance of GPT-4 is\nsignificantly improved when incorporating external tools,\nwith an increase from 30.36% to 43.22%. Meanwhile, the\nup-to-date model GPT-4-Turbo exhibits superior perfor-\nmance in zero-shot learning settings. However, despite\nits advanced capabilities demonstrated by its outstanding\nzero-shot learning performance, it falls short compared\nto GPT-4 in few-shot learning when leveraging Python\nfor numerical computation. This suggests a potential\nreduction in its program understanding capabilities. In\nsummary, such findings illustrate SCIBENCH can reveal\nthe nuanced differences in the ability of LLMs to utilize\nprompting strategies and external tools effectively.\n4.3. Additional Experiments\nEvaluation on the multimodal subset. We evaluate two\ncategories of models on problems with visual contexts:\n(1) GPT-4 (OpenAI., 2023) augmented with image cap-\ntions from Multimodal Bard (Google, 2023) and OCR texts\nfrom EasyOCR (JaidedAI, 2022) and (2) open-source Large\nMultimodal Models (LMMs):\nInternLM-XComposer2-\nVL (Dong et al., 2024), Qwen-VL-Plus (Bai et al., 2023),\nSPHINX-MoE (Lin et al., 2023), and LLaVA-LLaMA-2-\n13B (Liu et al., 2023a). For GPT-4, we explore two prompt-\ning strategies: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022)\nand Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) (Chen et al., 2023a). The\nresults presented in Figure 2 reveal that proprietary models\n6\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nCalculus, Statistics, Probability, \u2026\nData Mining, Differential Equations, \u2026\nDatasets\nEvaluation\nHuman \nAnnotator\nSummary\nLLM\nVerifier\nLLM / Reference \nSolutions\nError \nReason\nEssential \nSkills\nError \nProfiles\nFigure 3. Pipeline of the evaluation protocol. The evaluation protocol involves analyzing both LLMs and reference (correct) solutions\nwith the assistance of human annotators to identify error reasons. These reasons are then summarized into ten essential scientific\nproblem-solving skills in which LLM may face challenges. Subsequently, a LLM verifier is employed to automatically attribute each\nincorrectly answered problem to a lack of a specific skill. The resulting error profiles enable the interpretation of the improved skills by\ncertain prompting strategies and the direct comparison of various strategies.\naugmented with image captions and OCR-detected text, sig-\nnificantly outperform their open-source counterparts. GPT-4\n(PoT) that combines programming capabilities achieves an\naccuracy of 13.8%, markedly higher than 7.4% obtained by\nthe best open model LLaVA-LLaMA-2-13B. This demon-\nstrates the substantial potential for LLMs to effectively uti-\nlize visual contexts in scientific problem solving.\nEvaluation on the exam subset. To mirror real-world test-\ning conditions with no few-shot examples provided, we eval-\nuate GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-\n2-70B on the closed exam dataset under zero-shot and zero-\nshot CoT settings. The experiment result summarized in\nTable S2 indicate a notable performance advantage of GPT-\n4, which achieves an averaged score of 57.54%. However,\nwe note that their performance remains significantly lower\nthan human benchmarking. For instance, in the Data Mining\ncourse, GPT-4 scores 64.44% and 42.67% in the midterm\nand final exams, lower than the average student scores of\n80.18% and 72.71%, respectively, as reported by the course\ninstructor. The results once again underline the challenging\nnature of our dataset.\nComparison with other scientific computing tools. We\nfurther utilize another famous scientific computing library\nWolfram Language as the external tool and conduct experi-\nments using GPT-3.5, Claude, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-\n2-70B. The experiment results reported in Figure S7 show\nthat utilizing Wolfram Language does not help few-shot\nlearning and even results in a deteriorated performance,\nwith a decrease of 6.70% compared to the CoT prompting\nfor Claude2, and a decrease of 6.17% for LLaMA-2-70B.\nA plausible explanation is the introduction of syntax errors\nwhen translating solution steps into the Wolfram Language,\nwhich could be a potential direction for improvement. For a\ndetailed error analysis, readers are directed to Appendix C.3.\n5. Error Analysis of Prompting Strategies\nConsidering the substantial advancements of current LLMs,\nan in-depth analysis of the particular skills that are either en-\nhanced or limited under certain settings becomes imperative.\nPrevious works have relied on human labor to annotate error\nreasons into different categories, which is both expensive\nand time-consuming (Zhong et al., 2023). In this section, we\npresent an evaluation protocol that automates the classifica-\ntion of error reasons into deficient skills. This time-efficient\napproach enables large-scale analyses in future research.\nIn order to quantify the impact of each setting on scientific\nproblem-solving, we first define an essential skill set that is\nrequired by solving scientific problems. Then, an LLM veri-\nfier is employed to automatically classify each incorrectly\nsolved problem based on the absence of a specific skill from\nthe essential skill set. This approach generates error profiles,\nshowcasing a direct comparison of different strategies. This\nevaluation protocol is summarized in Figure 3.\nFirstly, we analyze the incorrect solutions made by GPT-3.5\nfor problems that provide detailed solutions. We hire two\ncollege students, who are highly familiar with the problems\nin our datasets, to annotate the source of the error for each\nproblem, indicating the specific line where the model makes\na mistake and why. From 112 such error annotations and\nwith the assistance of GPT-4, we distill these errors into ten\nessential skills that GPT-3.5 might lack:\n\u2022 Logical decomposition and analysis skills. This ability\ninvolves decomposing the problem into smaller, manage-\nable parts, and understanding the relationships between\nthese parts.\n\u2022 Assumption identification. This skill involves the ability\nto recognize relevant and necessary assumptions in the\nproblem.\n\u2022 Spatial perception. This is important for understanding\nproblems in areas such as Physics and Chemistry, where\nmodels need to visualize molecules, forces, fields, etc.\n\u2022 Causal reasoning. This is the ability to understand cause\nand effect relationships.\n\u2022 Problem deduction skills. This pertains to the ability to\ninfer and deduce potential solutions or underlying princi-\nples from the given information in a problem.\n\u2022 Abstract reasoning. This skill involves the ability to\nunderstand complex concepts that cannot be perceived\nphysically, and to recognize patterns or relationships be-\nyond concrete examples.\n\u2022 Scientific literacy. This skill involves a comprehensive\nunderstanding of key scientific principles, terminology,\n7\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\n0\n10\n20\n30\n(a) Zero-Shot Learning\nLogical Decomposition\nAssumption Identi\ufb01cation\nSpatial Perception\nCausal Reasoning\nProblem Deduction\nAbstract Reasoning\nScienti\ufb01c Literacy\nCode Conversion\nLogical Reasoning\nCalculation\n29.0%\n18.3%\n6.5%\n3.2%\n18.3%\n11.8%\n0.0%\n9.7%\n0.0%\n3.2%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n(b) Zero-Shot Learning + CoT Prompting\n25.4%\n32.2%\n5.1%\n1.7%\n8.5%\n1.7%\n6.8%\n1.7%\n3.4%\n13.6%\n0\n10\n20\n(c) Few-Shot Learning + CoT Prompting\n27.4%\n19.4%\n9.7%\n4.8%\n9.7%\n1.6%\n6.5%\n1.6%\n4.8%\n14.5%\n0\n10\n20\n(d) Few-Shot Learning + Python\n25.0%\n21.9%\n6.2%\n0.0%\n15.6%\n10.9%\n1.6%\n4.7%\n7.8%\n6.2%\nFigure 4. Error profiles of GPT-3.5 on the textbook dataset under four settings, which reveal the distribution of their deficiencies in ten\nessential problem-solving abilities.\nand methodologies across a range of disciplines.\n\u2022 Code conversion skills. This involves the ability to accu-\nrately translate solution steps into different programming\nlanguages, like Python or Wolfram Language.\n\u2022 Logical reasoning. This is the ability to make a reasoned\nargument and to identify fallacies or inconsistencies in an\nargument or set of data.\n\u2022 Calculation skills. This involves the ability to accurately\ncarry out mathematical operations and computations.\nAfter identifying this essential skill set, we assess the per-\nformance of the LLMs under different settings to discern\nthe specific problem-solving skills they lack. Given the high\ncost of human annotations required to attribute the cause of\nincorrect solutions to specific skill deficiencies, we propose\na novel self-critique protocol: we design a specific prompt\nthat outlines these abilities, and employ another LLM to\nserve as a classifier and determine whether a specific er-\nror results from the lack of a particular problem-solving\nskill. Finally, we ask human annotators to scrutinize the\nclassification results, which results in approximately 20% of\nincorrectly classified skills being discarded. To be specific,\nwe utilize a GPT-3.5 model as the verifier to determine the\nreason behind each error and pinpoint the missing skill. The\ndetails regarding the specific prompts used are provided in\nAppendix C.1. This verification process is conducted for\nfour settings, with results represented in bar charts (Fig-\nure 4). Additional examples of the evaluation protocol are\nelaborated in Appendix D.\nOur findings suggest that there is a lack of a universally\neffective setting: each configuration only enhances some\nspecific abilities and occasionally even hurts other skills\nthat the original model possesses. First, CoT prompting\nsignificantly improves calculation skills in the zero-shot sce-\nnario, with 13.6% error rates caused by calculation ability,\nconsiderably lower than the 29.0% error rate of the vanilla\nzero-shot baseline. However, CoT shows limitations in\nimproving other skills, with 32.2% and 25.4% error rates\nin casual ability and logical decomposition ability in the\nzero-shot CoT setting, respectively, compared to 18.3% and\n18.3% in the zero-shot setting. This contradicts previous\nclaims about universal skill enhancement through zero-shot\nCoT and carefully-designed few-shot CoT prompts (Wei\net al., 2022). An example in Figure S9 shows that the zero-\nshot learning setting without CoT has generated the correct\nformula but fails in the calculation steps. In this case, CoT\nprompting is even unable to use the correct formula as it\nmisinterprets the specific conditions (non-necessity) in the\nproblem. Second, the use of external tools significantly\nreduces calculation errors compared to the few-shot Cot set-\nting, with a notable decrease from 14.5% to 6.2%. However,\nthe use of external tools can weaken other skills, particu-\nlarly the code conversion skills, i.e., generating the correct\nprograms for the solution. Third, few-shot learning does\nnot universally improve scientific problem-solving skills, as\nindicated in the comparison between zero-shot and few-shot\nCoT settings. The improvement in one skill is offset by the\nshortcomings in others: although the few-shot CoT setting\nresults in a reduction of 12.8% in errors related to causal\nreasoning, it also leads to an increase in errors associated\nwith other skills, such as logical decomposition.\n6. Conclusion\nThis paper presents SCIBENCH, a college-level benchmark\nthat includes scientific problems from Mathematics, Physics,\nand Chemistry, as well as exam questions in Computer Sci-\nence and Mathematics. Our comprehensive evaluation in-\ncludes a diverse array of Large Language Models (LLMs),\nspanning both open-source and proprietary models, includ-\ning unimodal as well as multimodal settings, and employing\na variety of prompting strategies. The evaluation protocol\nwe employ serves as a framework for evaluating advanced\nproblem-solving skills of LLMs in scientific domains. The\nfindings of this study highlight that while large language\nmodels (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on introduc-\ntory mathematical benchmarks, their mastery of problem\nsolving ability remains weak. These findings underscore\nthe limitations of current LLMs in achieving satisfactory\nperformance, even with the assistance of various tools. We\nenvision that the SCIBENCH benchmark dataset and evalua-\ntion protocol presented in this paper could lay a foundation\nfor future research and enable advancements in understand-\ning and enhancing problem-solving capabilities of LLMs.\n8\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nReproducibility Statement\nTo foster reproducible research, we include all dataset pro-\ncessing and experiment details of SCIBENCH.

Finally, we make\nour dataset and code publicly available at this anonymous\nrepository.\nEthical Statement\nThe questions of SCIBENCH are sourced from science text-\nbooks and exams. We conduct a manual examination of\nour dataset to ensure the absence of potential sensitive back-\nground or ethical concerns. The inclusion of exam ques-\ntions has been authorized by the instructors of the respective\ncourses.\nThe purpose of the textbook dataset is solely for academic\nuse. Its collection adheres to the Fair Use Law in the US,\nwhere only a certain number of questions from each text-\nbook is selected, ensuring that only a small portion of the\ntextbook is utilized.\nBroad Impact Statement\nSCIBENCH marks a significant step forward in integrating\nAI with education, focusing on enhancing students\u2019 un-\nderstanding of scientific concepts. By providing a dataset\nthat evaluates scientific knowledge and complex problem-\nsolving skills, it aims to elevate the role of AI in education\nfrom merely assisting with assignments to facilitating deeper\nlearning. This effort contributes to the broader goal of lever-\naging AI to create personalized, impactful educational ex-\nperiences, grounding AI\u2019s application in the practical and\ncritical understanding of science.\nReferences\nAnthropic.

The Exam Dataset\nThe exam dataset is drawn from the following sources:\n\u2022 INTRODUCTION TO DATA MINING provides an introductory survey of data mining, which involves the automatic\ndiscovery of patterns, associations, changes, and anomalies in large databases. It explores various application areas of data\nmining, including bioinformatics, e-commerce, environmental studies, financial markets, multimedia data processing,\nnetwork monitoring, and social service analysis.\n\u2022 FUNDAMENTALS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE provides an introduction to the core problem-solving and knowledge\nrepresentation paradigms in artificial intelligence. It covers Lisp programming with regular assignments, as well as topics\nsuch as search methods, planning techniques, knowledge structures, natural language processing, expert systems, vision,\nand parallel architectures.\n\u2022 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS covers various topics in differential equations, including first-order and second-order linear\nequations with constant coefficients, power series solutions, and linear systems. Students will explore the principles and\napplications of these mathematical concepts.\nA detailed statistics of the exam dataset is summarized in Table S1.

The potential energy U(x) associated with the\nforce is plotted in the Figure. That is, if the particle were placed at any position between x = 0 and x = 7.00 m, it would have the plotted value of U. At x = 6.5 m, the\nparticle has velocity \u20d7v0 = (\u22124.00 m/s)\u02c6iFrom Figure, determine the particle\u2019s speed at x1 = 4.5 m.\nImage\nCorrect Solution\nThe particle\u2019s kinetic energy is given by Eq.\n\u0000K = 1\n2 mv2\u0001\n. Because only a conservative force acts on the particle, the mechanical energy Emec(= K + U) is conserved\nas the particle moves. Therefore, on a plot of U(x) such as Figure, the kinetic energy is equal to the difference between Emec and U.\nCalculations: At x = 6.5 m, the particle has kinetic energy\nK0 = 1\n2 mv2\n0 = 1\n2 (2.00 kg)(4.00 m/s)2\n(S1)\n= 16.0 J.\n(S2)\nBecause the potential energy there is U = 0, the mechanical energy is Emec = K0 + U0 = 16.0 J + 0 = 16.0 J. This value for Emec is plotted as a horizontal line in\nthe Figure. From that figure we see that at x = 4.5 m, the potential energy is U1 = 7.0 J. The kinetic energy K1 is the difference between Emec and U1 :\nK1 = Emec \u2212 U1 = 16.0 J \u2212 7.0 J = 9.0 J.\n(S3)\nBecause K1 = 1\n2 mv2\n1, we find v1 = 3.0 m/s.\nFinal Answer: 3.0 m/s\nFigure S3.

Here is an example. The three particles in the Figure are initially at rest. Each experiences an external force due to bodies outside the three-\nparticle system. The directions are indicated, and the magnitudes are F1 = 6.0 N, F2 = 12 N, and F3 = 14 N. What is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system?\nImage\nCorrect Solution\nThe position of the center of mass is marked by a dot in the figure. We can treat the center of mass as if it were a real particle, with a mass equal to the system\u2019s total mass\nM = 16 kg. We can also treat the three external forces as if they act at the center of mass (Figure b). We can now apply Newton\u2019s second law\n\u0010\n\u20d7Fnet = m\u20d7a\n\u0011\nto the center\nof mass, writing\n\u20d7Fnet = M\u20d7acom,\n(S4)\n\u20d7F1 + \u20d7F2 + \u20d7F3 = M\u20d7acom,\n(S5)\n\u20d7acom =\n\u20d7F1 + \u20d7F2 + \u20d7F3\nM\n.\n(S6)\nThe equation tells us that the acceleration \u20d7acom of the center of mass is in the same direction as the net external force \u20d7Fnet on the system (Figure b). Because the particles\nare initially at rest, the center of mass must also be at rest. As the center of mass then begins to accelerate, it must move off in the common direction of \u20d7acom and \u20d7Fnet. We\ncan evaluate the right side of Eq. S6 directly on a vector-capable calculator, or we can rewrite Eq. S6 in component form, find the components of \u20d7acom, and then find \u20d7acom .\nAlong the x axis, we have\nacom,x = F1x + F2x + F3x\nM\n= \u22126.0 N + (12 N) cos 45\u25e6 + 14 N\n16 kg\n= 1.03 m/s2.\n(S7)\nAlong the y axis, we have\nacom,y = F1y + F2y + F3y\nM\n= 0 + (12 N) sin 45\u25e6 + 0\n16 kg\n= 0.530 m/s2.\n(S8)\nFrom these components, we find that \u20d7acom has the magnitude\nacom =\nq\n(acom,x)2 + (acom,y)2 = 1.16 m/s2.\n(S9)\nFinal Answer: 1.16 m/s2\nFigure S4. The example from the textbook Fundamentals of Physics.\n16\nSCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nProblem\nAt time t = 0 a tank contains Q0lb of salt dissolved in 100 gal of water; see Figure 2.3.1. Assume that water containing 1\n4 lb of salt/gal is entering the tank at a rate of\nrgal/min and that the well-stirred mixture is draining from the tank at the same rate. Set up the initial value problem that describes this flow process. By finding the amount\nof salt Q(t) in the tank at any time, and the limiting amount QL that is present after a very long time, if r = 3 and Q0 = 2QL, find the time T after which the salt level is\nwithin 2% of QL.\nImage\nCorrect Solution\nWe assume that salt is neither created nor destroyed in the tank. Therefore variations in the amount of salt are due solely to the flows in and out of the tank. More precisely,\nthe rate of change of salt in the tank, dQ/dt, is equal to the rate at which salt is flowing in minus the rate at which it is flowing out. In symbols,\ndQ\ndt = rate in \u2212 rate out\nThe rate at which salt enters the tank is the concentration 1\n4 lb/gal times the flow rate rgal/min, or (r/4)lb/min. To find the rate at which salt leaves the tankl we need\nto multiply the concentration of salt in the tank by the rate of outflow, rgal/min. Since the rates of flow in and out are equal, the volume of water in the tank remains\nconstant at 100gal, and since the mixture is \"well-stirred,\" the concentration throughout the tank is the same, namely, [Q(t)/100]lb/gal.Therefore the rate at which salt\nleaves the tank is [rQ(t)/100]lb/min. Thus the differential equation governing this process is\ndQ\ndt = r\n4 \u2212 rQ\n100\nThe initial condition is\nQ(0) = Q0\nUpon thinking about the problem physically, we might anticipate that eventually the mixture originally in the tank will be essentially replaced by the mixture flowing in,\nwhose concentration is 1\n4 lb/gal. Consequently, we might expect that ultimately the amount of salt in the tank would be very close to 25lb. We can also find the limiting\namount QL = 25 by setting dQ/dt equal to zero and solving the resulting algebraic equation for Q. Rewriting it in the standard form for a linear equation, we have\ndQ\ndt + rQ\n100 = r\n4\nThus the integrating factor is ert/100 and the general solution is\nQ(t) = 25 + ce\u2212rt/100\nwhere c is an arbitrary constant. To satisfy the initial condition, we must choose c = Q0 \u2212 25. Therefore the solution of the initial value problem is\nQ(t) = 25 + (Q0 \u2212 25)e\u2212rt/100\nQ(t) = 25(1 \u2212 e\u2212rt/100) + Q0e\u2212rt/100\nFrom above Equations, you can see that Q(t) \u2192 25 (lb) as t \u2192 \u221e, so the limiting value QL is 25 , confirming our physical intuition. Further, Q(t) approaches the limit\nmore rapidly as r increases. In interpreting the solution, note that the second term on the right side is the portion of the original salt that remains at time t, while the first term\ngives the amount of salt in the tank due to the action of the flow processes. Now suppose that r = 3 and Q0 = 2QL = 50; then\nQ(t) = 25 + 25e\u22120.03t\nSince 2% of 25 is 0.5 , we wish to find the time T at which Q(t) has the value 25.5. Substituting t = T and Q = 25.5 and solving for T , we obtain\nT = (ln 50)/0.03 \u223c\n= 130.400766848( min).\nFinal Answer: (ln 50)/0.03\nFigure S5.

Additional Experiment on Wolfram Language\nThe experiment results and error analysis for using Wolfram Language as external tools are presented in Figure S7 and\nFigure S8, compared with using CoT and Python Language. We observe that the use of external tools can weaken other\nskills, particularly the code conversion skills. This issue becomes particularly prominent when using the Wolfram Language,\nwith 46.9% error rate in code conversion skill. Despite providing grammar specifications in system prompts and a few\nexamples as demonstrations, most attempts of code conversion result in syntax errors. In Wolfram Language, the error\nmainly comes from the violation of variable rules (for instance, Wolfram Language reserves certain letters such as E as\nprotected symbols and disallows underscores in variable names) or incorrect usage of certain functions. This observation\nsuggests a potential improvement for LLM when using Wolfram Language.\nD. Problem Solving Abilities of Current LLMs\nD.1. Assessment of the Evaluation Protocol\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of our evaluation protocol\u2019s classification, we enlisted the assistance of two annotators to\ndetermine whether the errors identified by the model verifier were accurate or not. Through the annotation of 151 samples\nacross different settings, we observed that 123 of them were correctly classified, resulting in an accuracy rate of 81.45%.\nTwo human annotators participate in the process. Decisions on the final abilities are determined by annotators, aided by\nassistants. By going through errors, these two annotators develop ten abilities and then employ a Language Learning\nModel (LLM) as a third evaluator to suggest additional abilities. They then compare and refine their findings based on\nthis input. Ultimately, the final outcomes are determined by the annotators. After LLM annotate the error reasons, we\nconduct human-check by sampling 151 examples across all settings to make sure the annotations make sense. We make\nthis human-AI cooperated analysis pipeline to reduce the cost of human post-analysis, while incorporate human checking\nto make sure the correctness of LLM decision and try to reduce the risk that reviewer mentioned. Though not perfect, we\nbelieve it can be another type of analyzing framework for future study of LLM problem-solving.\nD.2. Examples\nIn the context of each specific capability, we present several exemplary errors accompanied by their corresponding\nclassifications and explanations derived from the GPT model. Referencing Figure S9, the ChatGPT solution employing the\nChain-of-Thought method corresponds to error category 4, \"Causal Reasoning\". The model explanation posits that \"The\nerror reason category is 4. Causal Reasoning. The model solution uses the relativistic momentum formula to calculate\nthe momentum of the electron, which is not necessary for this problem since the electron is traveling at only 1.00% of the\nspeed of light. The relativistic momentum formula is only needed when the velocity of the particle is a significant fraction\nof the speed of light. Therefore, using this formula in this problem leads to an incorrect value for the momentum and\nconsequently an incorrect value for the de Broglie wavelength.\" Meanwhile, the ChatGPT solution that doesn\u2019t utilize the\nChain-of-Thought method is categorized under error case 10, \"Calculation Skills\".

Additional Related Work\nThere are many benchmark works to evaluate the different abilities of LLM. Liu et al. (2023c) assesses comprehensive\nreading abilities using the multiple-choice format. Frieder et al. (2023) focuses on evaluating the mathematical capabilities\nof LLMs, including those at the college level, but with topics such as functional analysis or topology that are different from\nthose in SCIBENCH such as differential equations and calculus.

(2023) explores the comprehensive abilities of\nGPT-4, but only use up to high-school level problems such as GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al.,\n2021) for mathematical dataset. Kabir et al. (2023) conduct detailed manual analysis for LLM. It also provides human\nannotated qualitative analysis to analyze the capabilities of the model. However, relying on human labor for direct solution\nanalysis can be costly. Our evaluation protocol, based on predefined fundamental problem solving skills, enables automated\nclassification of deficient skills for each incorrectly answered question.

To\ncalculate the momentum of the electron, we can use the relativistic momentum formula:\np =\nmev\nq\n1 \u2212 v2\nc2\nwhere me is the mass of the electron, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.

In any event, we find that the length\nof the cardioid is L = 8.\nFinal Answer: 8\nModel Solution\nTo find the length of the cardioid, we use the formula for arc length in polar coordinates:\nL =\nZ \u03b2\n\u03b1\ns\nr2 +\n\u0012 dr\nd\u03b8\n\u00132\n, d\u03b8,\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the angles that correspond to one full loop of the cardioid (i.e. \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 = 2\u03c0).

To find the weight of the air in the room, we need to first calculate the volume of the room:V = lwh = 3.5 m \u00d7 4.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m = 35.28 m3Next, we\ncan use the ideal gas law to find the mass of the air in the room:P V = nRT where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas\nconstant, and T is the temperature. Assuming room temperature of 20\u25e6C (293 K), we can solve for n:\nn = P V\nRT =\n(1.0 atm)(35.28 m3)\n(0.0821 L atm/mol K)(293 K) = 1, 610 mol\nFinally, we can find the weight of the air using the molar mass of air (approximately 28.97 g/mol):\nW = mg = nMg = (1, 610 mol)(0.02897 kg/mol)(9.81 m/s2) = 101, 640 N\nFinal Answer: 101640\nError Reason\nThe error in the model\u2019s solution is that they used the ideal gas law to find the mass of the air in the room, which assumes that the air behaves like an ideal gas.

What is the difference\nbetween the gravitational acceleration at her feet and at her head?\nCorrect Solution\nWe can approximate Earth as a uniform sphere of mass ME. Then, from Eq. 13-11, the gravitational acceleration at any distance r from the center of Earth is\nag = GME\nr2\nWe might simply apply this equation twice, first with r = 6.77 \u00d7 106 m for the location of the feet and then with r = 6.77 \u00d7 106 m + 1.70 m for the location of the\nhead. However, a calculator may give us the same value for ag twice, and thus a difference of zero, because h is so much smaller than r. Here\u2019s a more promising approach:\nBecause we have a differential change dr in r between the astronaut\u2019s feet and head, we should differentiate Eq. 13-15 with respect to r.Calculations: The differentiation\ngives us\ndag = \u22122 GME\nr3\ndr\nwhere dag is the differential change in the gravitational acceleration due to the differential change dr in r. For the astronaut, dr = h and r = 6.77 \u00d7 106 m. Substituting\ndata into Eq.13-16, we find\ndag = \u22122\n\u00006.67 \u00d7 10\u221211 m3/kg \u00b7 s2\u0001 \u00005.98 \u00d7 1024 kg\n\u0001\n(6.77 \u00d7 106 m)3\n(1.70 m)\n= \u22124.37 \u00d7 10\u22126 m/s2\nFinal Answer: \u22124.37 \u00d7 10\u22126 m/s2\nModel Solution\nWe can use the equation for the gravitational acceleration due to a point mass, given by Eq. 13-2 (g = GM/r2), to find the gravitational acceleration at the astronaut\u2019s feet\nand head. Because the astronaut is in free fall, the difference between these two accelerations is the tidal acceleration, given by Eq. 13-22 (\u2206g = 2GMh/r3).Calculations:\nThe gravitational acceleration at the astronaut\u2019s feet is\ngfeet = GM\nr2\n=\n\u00006.67 \u00d7 10\u221211 N \u00b7 m2/kg2\u0001 \u00005.98 \u00d7 1024 kg\n\u0001\n(6.77 \u00d7 106 m)2\n= 9.78 m/s2.\nThe gravitational acceleration at the astronaut\u2019s head is\nghead =\nGM\n(r + h)2 =\n\u00006.67 \u00d7 10\u221211 N \u00b7 m2/kg2\u0001 \u00005.98 \u00d7 1024 kg\n\u0001\n(6.77 \u00d7 106 m + 1.70 m)2\n= 9.77 m/s2.\nThe difference between these two accelerations is\n\u2206g = gfeet \u2212 ghead\n= 9.78 m/s2 \u2212 9.77 m/s2 = 0.01 m/s2\n= 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 m/s2.\nFinal Answer: 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 m/s2\nError Reason\nThe model\u2019s solution is incorrect because it uses the equation for the gravitational acceleration due to a point mass, which is not applicable in this case since the Earth is not a\npoint mass. The correct equation to use is the one given in the correct solution, which takes into account the fact that the Earth is a uniform sphere of mass. Therefore, the\nerror reason category is 1.

Existing benchmarks primarily focus on common instruc-\ntions that align well with what the model learned during training. However, profi-\nciency in responding to these instructions does not necessarily imply strong ability\nin instruction following. In this paper, we propose a novel instruction-following\nevaluation protocol called verbalizer manipulation. It instructs the model to ver-\nbalize the task label with words aligning with model priors to different extents,\nadopting verbalizers from highly aligned (e.g., outputting \u201cpostive\u201d for positive\nsentiment), to minimally aligned (e.g., outputting \u201cnegative\u201d for positive senti-\nment).\nVerbalizer manipulation can be seamlessly integrated with any classi-\nfication benchmark to examine the model\u2019s reliance on priors and its ability to\noverride them to accurately follow the instructions. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of four major model families across nine datasets, employing twelve\nsets of verbalizers for each of them. We observe that the instruction-following\nabilities of models, across different families and scales, are significantly distin-\nguished by their performance on less natural verbalizers. Even the strongest GPT-\n4 model struggles to perform better than random guessing on the most challeng-\ning verbalizer, emphasizing the need for continued advancements to improve their\ninstruction-following abilities.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models have achieved remarkable success in zero-shot generalization for various\nnatural language processing (NLP) tasks via instruction tuning (Wei et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Iyer et al., 2022). One representative model is ChatGPT 1, which has shown\npromising results in text summarization (Yang et al., 2023), coding (Surameery & Shakor, 2023),\nhealthcare (Sallam, 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), education (Baidoo-Anu & Owusu Ansah, 2023),\nfinance (Dowling & Lucey, 2023) and law (Choi et al., 2023). Existing benchmark datasets (Wang\net al., 2018; 2019; Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023) primarily focus on\ncommon instructions that align well with what models learned during pre-training or instruction-\ntuning. However, proficiency in responding to these instructions does not necessarily imply strong\nability in instruction following as models may rely on memorization of favorable responses rather\nthan genuine generalization due to the vast volume of data they see during training (Tirumala et al.,\n2022). Nonetheless, instruction following capability plays an important role in task generalization\nfor real-world applications. For example, a user may want models to output answers only when they\nare certain to reduce hallucinations or control model response length or assign models with specific\nroles (e.g. tax expert). A natural question arises: How can we systematically and automatically\nevaluate instruction-tuned models in terms of instruction-following capability?\n\u2217Work was done during Jun\u2019s internship at Samsung Research America.\n1https://chat.openai.com/chat\n1\narXiv:2307.10558v1  [cs.CL]  20 Jul 2023\nIf\na\nmovie\nreview\nis\npositive,\nyou\nneed to output \"positive\".

Levels in terms of aligning with prior knowledge are\nranked as natural > neutral > unnatural.\nIn this paper, we propose to evaluate the instruction-following ability from the aspect of how well\nmodels can follow instructions that may not align with their priors and design a novel framework\nto synthesize them. Specifically, we propose verbalizer manipulation 2 that can be used to construct\ninstructions aligning with model priors to different extents, from natural, to neutral, to unnatu-\nral, as shown in Figure 1. In natural instructions, we choose multiple verbalizers that align with\nprior knowledge for each dataset. In neutral instructions, we select multiple verbalizers that are\nsemantically irrelevant to given tasks. In unnatural instructions, verbalizers are flipped from their\ncounterparts in natural instructions and contradict with prior knowledge. For example, in a movie re-\nview sentiment analysis task, we can use verbalizer \u201cpositive|negative\u201d, \u201c1|0\u201d 3, \u201cyes|no\u201d for movie\nreview with positive/negative sentiment to create three sub-evaluation sets for the same dataset in\nnatural instructions. The same method can be also used to create multiple sub-evaluation sets for\nthe same dataset in neutral and unnatural instruction as well. The levels in terms of aligning with\nprior knowledge of these three instruction groups are ranked as natural > neutral > unnatural. By\ncontrolling the level of alignment with prior knowledge and ruling out other factors, we are able to\nsystematically and automatically evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of instruction-tuned\nmodels with minimal human efforts.\nWe evaluate four different model families across various model sizes, namely, Flan-T5(Wei et al.,\n2022a), GPT-Series (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and OPT-\nIML (Iyer et al., 2022)) on nine benchmark datasets: curated instruction evaluation sets via verbal-\nizer manipulation. First, we compare model performance on natural, neutral and unnatural instruc-\ntions. We find that larger instruction-tuned models often perform better on both natural and neutral\ninstructions. Although performance on neutral instructions is worse than on natural instructions for\nsmall models, their performance gap tends to be smaller when model scales and can be (almost)\nclosed for strong OpenAI davinci-003, ChatGPT and GPT-4. On the contrary, the performance of\ndifferent model families diverge significantly on unnatural instructions and there is no clear and\nconsistent trend across model families, showing their significant differences in the ability to follow\ninstructions. Overall, these results indicate that although scaling is an effective way to improve\ninstruction-following ability, it may not be enough when instructions contradict prior knowledge.\nSecond, we examine verbalizers one by one in both natural instructions and their verbalizer-flipped\ncounterparts in unnatural instructions. We find that models are not sensitive to verbalizers in natural\ninstructions. However, in unnatural instructions, performance of the same model diverges signifi-\n2Following (Schick & Sch\u00a8utze, 2020), we define a verbalizer as a mapping from golden label names to\ntarget ones.\n3Different from (Wei et al., 2023b), we hypnotize that \u201c1\u201d/\u201c0\u201d align more with \u201cpositive\u201d/\u201cnegative\u201d, re-\nspectively, during pre-training or instruction-tuning. Our results on small models in section 4.2 prove our\nhypnosis.\n2\ncantly and when model further scales, they exhibit scaling-shape (Kaplan et al., 2020) or U-shape\n(Wei et al., 2022b) or inverse scaling-shape (McKenzie et al., 2022) depending on model family\nand verbalizers. Even strong ChatGPT and GPT-4 only perform similarly to random guessing when\nflipped golden label names are used as verlizers in unnatural instructions, showing that there still\nexist fundamental limitations of these models to follow instructions when instructions contradict\ntheir prior knowledge.\nFinally, we explore whether zero-shot chain of thought (zero-shot-CoT) prompting (Kojima et al.,\n2022) can improve model performance in unnatural instructions that utilize flipped golden label\nnames as verbalizers. We find that although it is helpful when model scales, there still exist large\nperformance gaps compared to corresponding results in natural instructions. Only strong ChatGPT\nand GPT-4 can outperform random guessing while other three model families (Flan-T5, Vicuna,\nOPT-IML) consistently perform worse than random guessing baseline. In a nutshell, when model\nscales to larger sizes, they still have difficulty in following instructions contradicting to prior knowl-\nedge even though they are allowed to output intermediate reasoning steps. We hope that our work\ncan inspire future research to focus more on instruction-following capability.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nInstruction-tuned Large Language Models.\nLarge language models have revolutionized the\nfield of NLP and they can perform well in many NLP tasks without any parameter update by only be-\ning given several demonstrations in their prompts (Brown et al., 2020). These models are pre-trained\nwith next token prediction or other pre-training objectives, and hence, may not be good at following\ninstructions from humans (Ouyang et al., 2022). To bridge this gap, there have been growing inter-\nests in NLP community to train models that can follow human instructions. Mishra et al. (2022);\nWei et al. (2022a); Iyer et al. (2022); Sanh et al. (2022) collect standard NLP datasets, write tem-\nplates for them and transform them into text-to-text format (Raffel et al., 2020) and show that models\ncan generalize to unseen tasks if they are trained on many seen tasks. Chung et al. (2022) studies\nthe scaling effects of instruction-tuning and systematically study what factors are important for un-\nseen test generalizations. Longpre et al. (2023) further finds that task balancing and enrichment\ntechniques are important for instruction-tuning. This line of work mainly focuses on standard NLP\ntasks and does not reflect how language models are used in many real-world applications (Ouyang\net al., 2022). To bridge this gap, Ouyang et al. (2022) collects instructions from humans including\ntheir customers to train an instruction-following models like ChatGPT and has achieved remark-\nable successes. However, collecting large-scaling instruction-following data is time-consuming and\nexpensive, and researchers have been working on utilizing ChatGPT-like models as data genera-\ntors or human-in-the-loop to generate instruction-following data. Taori et al. (2023) utilizes GPT\n3.5 to generate 52K instruction-following data and uses it to train Alpaca. Xu et al. (2023a) fur-\nther explores to evolve instructions from Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) to generate more complicated\ninstruction-following data to train WizardLM. However, both Alpaca and WizardLM only utilize\nsingle-turn data. To alleviate this issue, Xu et al. (2023b) utilizes ChatGPT to chat with itself to\ngenerate high-quality conversations to train Baize. Chiang et al. (2023) train Vicuna with ShareGPT\ndialogue data, which are multi-turn conversation dialogues between human users and ChatGPT.\nLanguage Model Evaluation.\nLanguage models before the era of instruction-tuning (Devlin et al.,\n2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020) mainly focus on perplexity 4 or results\non standard benchmark datasets (Wang et al., 2018; 2019). However, as models become more and\nmore capable in the era of instruction-tuning, they become harder and harder to evaluate. Hendrycks\net al. (2021) collects MMLU dataset including elementary mathematics, US history, computer sci-\nence, law, etc., to measure knowledge and problem solving capabilities of language models. Liang\net al. (2022) instead proposes HELM, a framework to comprehensively evaluate their reasoning,\nknowledge, robustness, fairness, etc. Chia et al. (2023) introduces InstructEval to comprehensively\nevaluate instruction-tuned language models. Recently, there have been growing interests in leverag-\ning GPT-4 to evaluate weaker language models (Xu et al., 2023a;b) although it has been found to\nbe unfair (Wang et al., 2023). However, this line of work mainly focuses on evaluating their general\ncapabilities. Instead, our work focuses on automatic instruction-following evaluation with minimum\nhuman efforts. There have been several works sharing a similar focus as ours. Min et al. (2022) finds\n4https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-2\n3\ndemonstration with random labels often have comparable performance than using golden labels. We\ninstead focus on instruction-only setting without any demonstration where models are instructed to\noutput specific label names according to their golden labels. Si et al. (2023) measures the inductive\nbiases of large language models via different features, we instead focus on the same task but ma-\nnipulate different verbalizers to evaluate their instruction-following capability. Webson & Pavlick\n(2022) finds that models tend to be sensitive to templates and verbalizes for natural language in-\nference (NLI) tasks for small models while our work goes beyond NLI and finds sufficiently large\nmodels can perform similarly under different verbalizers. Even when label names are flipped, they\ncan still perform very well under certain tasks, e.g. sentiment classification. The closest work to ours\nare probably Jang et al. (2023), Wei et al. (2023b) and Wei et al. (2023a). Jang et al. (2023) eval-\nuates instruction-tuned language models with negated prompts while our work utilizes verbalizer\nmanipulations from different groups to control the level of alignment with prior knowledge to fol-\nlow instructions and have different conclusions. Wei et al. (2023b) finds that large instruction-tuned\nlanguage models can strengthen their priors and cannot effectively learn to flip labels from given\ndemonstrations. We instead show that if instructions are provided, they do have the ability to flip la-\nbels for some tasks due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. Wei et al. (2023a) proposes\nsymbol tuning to force models to learn in-context by changing their label names with symbols to\nbetter leverage examples in demonstrations while our work aims to utilize verbalizer manipulation\nto evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of large language models.\n3\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n3.1\nDATASETS\nWe conduct experiments on nine different binary classification benchmark datasets 5.\nSpecifi-\ncally, we utilize SST-2 ((Socher et al., 2013); Movie review sentiment classification), FP ((Malo\net al., 2014); Financial phrase sentiment classification), EMOTION((Saravia et al., 2018); Twitter\nmessage emotion classification), SNLI ((Bowman et al., 2015); Stanford natural language infer-\nence), SICK ((Marelli et al., 2014); Sentence pair entailment analysis), RTE ((Dagan et al., 2006);\nTextual entailment recognition), QQP ((Chen et al., 2017); Quora question duplicate detection),\nMRPC((Dolan & Brockett, 2005); Paraphrase identification) and SUBJ ((Conneau & Kiela, 2018);\nSubjective/objective movie description classification).

For simplicity, we focus on binary classification tasks in this work.\n4\n3.2\nVERBALIZER MANIPULATION\nFor each dataset, we have an instruction template to manipulate its verbalizers. Our templates to\nmanipulate labels for each dataset are deferred to Appendix A.2. Specifically, for each dataset\nin natural / neutral / unnatural instructions, we have multiple verbalizers, as shown in Table 1.\nFor example, for SST-2, golden label names are \u201cpositive\u201d|\u201cnegative\u201d and in natural instructions,\nthey will be mapped to \u201cpositive\u201d|\u201cnegative\u201d, \u201c1\u201d|\u201c0\u201d, \u201cyes|no\u201d. In neutral instructions, they will\nbe mapped to \u201cfoo\u201d|\u201cbar\u201d, \u201cbar\u201d|\u201cfoo\u201d, \u201csfo\u201d|\u201clax\u201d, \u201clax\u201d|\u201csfo\u201d, \u201clake\u201d|\u201criver\u201d,\u201criver\u201d|\u201clake\u201d. In\nunnatural instructions, we map them to \u201cnegative\u201d|\u201cpositive\u201d, \u201c0\u201d|\u201c1\u201d, \u201cno\u201d|\u201cyes\u201d. An illustrative\nexample of three different instruction groups to manipulate verbalizers for SST-2 dataset is shown\nin Figure 1. For each dataset and each verbalizer (mapping), we generate an evaluation set variant,\nleading to 2700 examples (9 datasets \u00d7 3 mappings \u00d7 100 examples/dataset) in both natural and\nunnatural instructions, and 5400 examples (9 datasets \u00d7 6 mappings \u00d7 100 examples/dataset) in\nneutral instructions.\n3.3\nINSTRUCTION-TUNED MODELS\nWe evaluate state-of-the-art instruction-tuned large language models, namely Flan-T5, GPT-Series,\nVicuna and OPT-IML, on datasets in section 3.1 via verbalizer manipulation in section 3.2\nacross various model sizes. For Flan-T5, we evaluate its small (80M), base (250M), large\n(780M), xl (3B) and xxl (11B) versions. For GPT-Series, we evaluate text-ada-001 (ada),\ntext-babbage-001 (babbage), text-curie-001 (curie), text-davinci-003 (davinci),\ngpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) and gpt-4 (GPT-4) via official OpenAI API 6. For Vicuna, we eval-\nuate its 7B (vicuna-7b-1.1) and 13B (vicuna-13b-1.1) versions. For OPT-IML, we utilize\nits 1.3B (opt-iml-max-1.3b) and 30B (opt-iml-max-30b) versions (Iyer et al., 2022)).\nSince our work focuses on evaluating instruction-following capability, we focus on instruction-only\nsetting without any demonstration. For all experiments, we set temperature as 0 during decoding.\nWe parse predictions from decoded strings and use accuracy (%) as the evaluation metric.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n4.1\nRESULTS ON INSTRUCTIONS WITH DIFFERENT NATURALNESS\nWe evaluate four model families in section 3.3 on natural, neutral and unnatural instructions and\nreport results for each instruction group that are averaged over datasets and verbalizers. Results are\nshown in Figure 2.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n80M\n250M\n780M\n3B\n11B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nada\nbabbage curie\ndavinci ChatGPT GPT-4\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n7B\n13B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n1.3B\n30B\nnatural\nneutral\nunnatural\nFlan-T5\nGPT-series\nVicuna\nOPT-IML\nAccuracy (%)\nFigure 2: Results comparison under natural, neutral and unnatural instructions across different\nmodel families.\nLarger models generally perform better on both natural and neutral instructions.\nFor Flan-\nT5, GPT-series and OPT-IML, we find that model performance improves as they scale to larger sizes\n6Since exact model sizes in GPT-Series are unknown for some of them, we assume that ada \u2264 babbage \u2264\ncurie \u2264 davinci \u2264 ChatGPT \u2264 GPT-4.\n5\non both natural and neutral instructions. These results are encouraging since it seems that larger\nmodels can have better instruction-following capabilities even though instructions do not align with\nprior knowledge on neutral instructions. Further comparing model performance on natural and\nneutral instructions, we find that smaller models (model size \u2264 30B) perform worse on neutral\ninstructions. These performance gaps indicate that smaller models still have difficulty in follow-\ning instructions. However, their performance gap tends to be smaller when model scales and can\nbe (almost) closed for strong OpenAI davinci, ChatGPT and GPT-4, demonstrating their strong\ninstruction-following capabilities. These results show that simply scaling model size is an effective\nmethod to improve model instruction-following capabilities.\nDifferent model families diverge significantly on unnatural instructions.\nAlthough larger mod-\nels generally perform better on both natural and neutral instructions, this is not true for unnatural\ninstructions. Different model families diverge significantly on unnatural instructions and there is\nno clear and consistent trend across model families. For Flan-T5, results are U-shaped when model\nscales (Wei et al., 2022b), while for OPT-IML, results follows inverse scaling-shape (McKenzie\net al., 2022). In fact, results on these two model families are significantly worse than random guess-\ning (50%). Although Vicuna and GPT-Series follow scaling-shape (Kaplan et al., 2020), their per-\nformance still has large gaps compared to results on natural instructions, and these gaps seem not\nto be smaller when they scale. For example, the performance gap for ChatGPT is 11.8% while\nstronger GPT-4 has 15.7%, making it unclear if further scaling them can bridge this performance\ngap. This is surprising since these clear and valid instructions can be easily followed by humans but\nremain difficult for GPT-4, which has shown near human-level performance on many tasks (Bubeck\net al., 2023). Overall, these results indicate that although scaling is an effective way to improve\ninstruction-following, it does not seem to be enough when instructions contradict prior knowledge.\n4.2\nRESULTS OF DIFFERENT VERBALIZERS IN NATURAL AND UNNATURAL INSTRUCTIONS\nPrevious discussions focus on average results across different verbalizers for each instruction group.\nHowever, it is possible that verbalizers even in the same instruction group align or contradict with\nprior knowledge differently. For example, it is hard to know if \u201cyes\u201d aligns with prior knowledge\nmore than \u201c1\u201d in SST-2 dataset for natural instructions with positive golden labels. Therefore, we\nfurther delve into the results of different verbalizers for natural instructions and its flipped version\nin unnatural instructions. Average results over nine different datasets are summarized in Figure 3.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nada\nbabbage\ncurie\ndavinci\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n7B\n13B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n1.3B\n30B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n80M\n250M\n780M\n3B\n11B\nnatural-golden verbalizers\nunnatural-flipped golden verbalizers\nnatural-yes|no\nunnatural-no|yes\nnatural-1|0\nunnatural-0|1\nFlan-T5\nGPT-series\nVicuna\nOPT-IML\nAccuracy (%)\nFigure 3: Results of different verbalizers in natural and unnatural instructions.\nModels perform similarly for different verbalizers in natural instructions.\nWe find that models\nacross four families perform similarly for different verbalizers in natural instructions and larger\nmodels often perform better than their smaller counterparts. However, we do observe that verbalizers\nwhere models perform the best may change in different model sizes and families. For example, for\nFlan-T5 780M, natural-golden verbalizers > natural-1|0 > natural-yes|no while for Flan-T5 11B,\nthe order is reversed. In addition, for Vicuna, the best performing verbalizer is natural-1|0, while\nfor OPT-IML, natural-golden verbalizers performs better. These results show different models can\nhave different prior knowledge. However, for strong davinci, ChatGPT and GPT-4, their differences\nare almost not noticeable. This is non-trivial since larger models often have a better understanding\nabout world knowledge and hence store more prior knowledge (Wei et al., 2023b). More consistent\n6\nresults on larger models again show that scaling is an very important factor for instruction-following\ncapability.\nModels diverge significantly for different verbalizers in unnatural instructions.\nAlthough pre-\nvious discussion has shown that models perform similarly for different verbalizers in natural instruc-\ntions, results on their flipped verbalizers in unnatural instructions show that they diverge signifi-\ncantly. In Figure 3, we find that verbalizers in unnatural group shows very different behaviors when\nthey scale and this behavior also changes in different model families. For example, on unnatural-\nno|yes and unnatural-0|1, Vicuna achieves better performance when model sizes are larger but de-\ngrades on unnatural-flipped golden verbalizers. However, for OPT-IML on unnatural no|yes, model\nperformance decreases when it scales to be larger. These results further strengths our finding that\ndifferent models can have different prior knowledge. On the other hand, it also shows that scaling is\nnot the only factor influencing instruction following although it is important. Further more, we find\nthat for the largest model in each family, performance is ranked as unnatural 0|1 > unnatural no|yes\n> unnatural-flipped golden verbalizers. These results show that although they may have different\nprior knowledge, the difficulty level of overriding their prior knowledge to follow instructions seems\nconsistent. Finally, we find that even the best ChatGPT and GPT-4 only perform similar to random\nguessing, showing that these models still have fundamental limitations to follow instructions when\ninstructions contradict to their prior knowledge.\n4.3\nRESULTS COMPARISON BETWEEN DIRECT AND ZERO-SHOT CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT\nPROMPTING\nPrevious results have shown that even the best ChatGPT and GPT-4 only perform similar to random\nguessing on unnatural-flipped golden verbalizers and these results are obtained via direct prompt-\ning. In this section, we further explore if outputting chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022c) on\nunnatural-flipped golden verbalizers evaluation subset can make models perform better. Therefore,\nwe design another template for each dataset and add Let\u2019s think step by step. in the prompt follow-\ning Kojima et al. (2022). We summarize results on natural-golden verbalizers and unnatural-flipped\ngolden verbalizers via direct prompting, and unnatural-flipped golden verbalizers via zero-shot CoT\nin Figure 4.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n80M\n250M\n780M\n3B\n11B\nFlan-T5\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nada\nbabbage\ncurie\ndavinci ChatGPT GPT-4\nGPT Series\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n7B\n13B\nVicuna\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n1.3B\n30B\nOPT-IML\nnatural-direct prompting\nunnatural-direct prompting\nunnatural-zero shot CoT\nAccuracy (%)\nFigure 4: Results comparison between natural-direct prompting with golden verbalizers, unnatural\ndirect prompting and unnatural zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting with flipped golden verbaliz-\ners.\nFor Vicuna and OPT-IML, inverse scaling-curves in unnatural-direct prompting become scaling\ncurves in unnatural-zero shot CoT prompting. For Flan-T5, results are much more U-shaped in\nunnatural-zero shot CoT compared to those in unnatural-direct prompting. Further more, Chat-\nGPT and GPT-4 can significantly outperform random guessing in unnatural-zero shot CoT prompt-\ning while their counterparts in unnatural-direct prompting only have similar performance to ran-\ndom guessing. This is encouraging since it shows that scaling is an effective method to improve\ninstruction-following capabilities along with more advanced prompting techniques. However, they\nstill show large performance gaps compared to results under natural-direct prompting setting. For\nexample, Flan-T5 11B, Vicuna 13B and OPT-IML 30B still significantly underperform random\nguessing. Even strong ChatGPT still has 16.8% accuracy gap to natural-direct prompting and for\nGPT-4, this gap is surprisingly larger and becomes 24.3%. In a nutshell, zero-shot CoT prompting\ncan make models better instruction-followers when instructions contradict prior knowledge, but the\nmodels still have a large performance gap with instructions that align with prior knowledge.\n7\n4.4\nPER DATASET ANALYSIS\nThe previous subsection focuses on average results across different datasets and only ChatGPT and\nGPT-4 can outperform random guessing on unnatural instructions with flipped golden verbalizers\nin zero shot CoT prompting. In this subsection, we further delve into each dataset by comparing\ntheir results using direct prompting with golden verbalizers in natural instructions, direct and zero\nshot CoT prompting with flipped golden verbalizers on unnatural instructions. We group results\nof datasets according to their tasks (e.g., EMOTION, FP and SST-2 are sentiment classification\ndatasets) and results are shown in Figure 5.\n92\n98\n77\n90\n99\n77\n86\n73\n57\n93\n82\n73\n12\n3\n51\n83\n28\n45\n70\n77\n68\n50\n69\n81\n83\n46\n54\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n96\n100\n76\n92\n99\n91\n82\n86\n84\n91\n92\n67\n9\n0\n9\n85\n81\n24\n96\n100\n79\n26\n29\n68\n79\n78\n32\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nSST-2\nFP\nEMOTION\nSNLI\nSICK\nRTE\nQQP\nMRPC\nSUBJ\nnatural-direct prompting\nunnatural-direct prompting\nunnatural-zero shot CoT\nChatGPT \nGPT-4\nSentiment Classification\nNatural Language Inference\nParaphrase Identification\nSubjectivity \nClassification \nAccuracy (%)\nFigure 5: Results comparison between natural-direct prompting with golden verbalizers, unnatural\ndirect and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting with flipped golden verbalizers for each dataset on\nChatGPT and GPT-4.\nChatGPT and GPT-4 perform comparably on majority of datasets in both natural and un-\nnatural instructions.\nChatGPT performs similarly on majority of datasets (6/9, 6/9) compared to\nGPT-4 (\u2264 10% performance gap) on both natural and unnatural instructions, respectively. GPT-4\noutperforms ChatGPT > 10% on RTE and SUBJ in natural settings but underperforms it in un-\nnatural setting. Another outlier dataset is MRPC, where GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT 13% and\n53% in natural and unnatural setting, respectively. Overall, these results show that they share more\nsimilarity than difference via direct prompting.\nChatGPT and GPT-4 retain performance on sentiment classification task in unnatural direct\nprompting compared to natural counterpart but drop significantly on natural language infer-\nence task.\nSurprisingly, we find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can retain their performance on senti-\nment classification task (FP, EMOTION, SST-2) but drop significantly on natural language inference\n(NLI) task (SNLI, SICK, RTE). As an example, on SST-2, ChatGPT outperforms 1% and GPT-4\nonly decreases 5% with unnatural direct prompting while for SICK, ChatGPT and GPT-4 decrease\n96% and 99%, respectively. We hypothesize that the discrepancy is because sentiment classification\nrequires less reasoning while NLI requires more, making flipping golden verbalizers much more\ndifficult. One may wonder if they show similar trend on other tasks. For paraphrase identification\ntask, QQP has similar performance after verbalizer flipping for both ChatGPT and GPT-4 while for\nMRPC, only ChatGPT drops a lot and GPT-4 retains its performance. This result shows that task\ncan be an important factor but not the only one. Models can be sensitive to data distribution.\nChatGPT and GPT-4 with unnatural-zero shot CoT improve significantly in NLI task but it\nhas much less effect on sentiment classification.\nBoth ChatGPT and GPT-4 with unnatural-zero\nshot CoT improve significantly in NLI datasets, and ChatGPT can outperform GPT-4 after zero-shot\nCoT. On the other hand, unnatural-zero shot CoT has much less effect on sentiment classifica-\ntion task and even hurts performance across three datasets for ChatGPT. This is probably because\nunnatural-zero shot CoT is mainly useful for reasoning tasks and sentiment classification requires\nmuch less reasoning compared to NLI tasks, making zero shot CoT less useful.\n8\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we design a framework to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of instruction-\ntuned language models via verbalizer manipulations. We design three instruction-following evalu-\nation sets, namely natural, neural and unnatural instructions, which align with prior knowledge to\ndifferent extents. We evaluate four different model families on nine datasets across scales. Our\nresults show that although larger instruction-tuned models generally perform better on both natural\nand neutral instructions, their performance diverges significantly in unnatural instructions. We fur-\nther examine verbalizers one by one in unnatural instructions, and find that the same model family\nperforms significantly different on instructions with different verbalizers, even with more advanced\nzero shot CoT prompting. These results show there still exist fundamental limitations within state-\nof-the-art instruction-tuned large language models in following human instructions. We hope that\nour work can inspire future research to focus more on instruction-following capabilities.\nREFERENCES\nDavid Baidoo-Anu and Leticia Owusu Ansah.

For FP dataset, as it only has training set, we randomly split it into 80/20 as our in-house\ntraining/test set. In addition, for FP, EMOTION, SICK and SNLI datasets, they have multiple classes\nand we only choose examples whose corresponding labels are shown in Table 1. For SST-2, QQP,\nRTE and MRPC within GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018), we randomly sample 100 examples\nfor each dataset from their validation sets while for other five datasets, we randomly sample 100\nexamples for each dataset from their test sets.\nA.2\nPROMPT TEMPLATE\nOur instruction templates for verbalizer manipulation in direct prompting setting and zero-shot\nchain-of-thought prompting is shown in 6 and 7, respectively. Fields with red colors are replaced\nwith verbalizers in Table 1 and fields with blue color will be substituted with input examples in each\ndataset in text format.\nYou are a helpful assistant judging the sentiment of a movie review.

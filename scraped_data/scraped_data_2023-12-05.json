Magicoder models are\ntrained on 75K synthetic instruction data using OSS-INSTRUCT, a novel approach\nto enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets to generate high-quality\ninstruction data for code. Our main motivation is to mitigate the inherent bias of\nthe synthetic data generated by LLMs by empowering them with a wealth of open-\nsource references for the production of more diverse, realistic, and controllable\ndata. The orthogonality of OSS-INSTRUCT and other data generation methods\nlike Evol-Instruct further enables us to build an enhanced MagicoderS. Both\nMagicoder and MagicoderS substantially outperform state-of-the-art code models\nwith similar or even larger sizes on a wide range of coding benchmarks, including\nPython text-to-code generation, multilingual coding, and data-science program\ncompletion. Notably, MagicoderS-CL-7B based on CODELLAMA even surpasses\nthe prominent ChatGPT on HumanEval+ (66.5 vs. 65.9 in pass@1).

In the past few decades, a large body of research has been studying\nsymbolic approaches, such as abstraction-based synthesis [Wang et al., 2017, Feng et al., 2018] for\ngeneral-purpose synthesis problems and programming by examples [Cambronero et al., 2023, Liu\net al., 2023a] for domain-specific tasks. Until recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on\ncode [Austin et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2021] has shown outstanding breakthroughs in generating\ncode that accurately satisfies user intents, and they are widely deployed to assist real-world software\ndevelopment [Microsoft, 2023b, Services, 2023].\nInitially, closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo [OpenAI, 2022] (i.e., ChatGPT) and GPT-\n4 [OpenAI, 2023] massively dominated various code generation benchmarks and leaderboards [Chen\net al., 2021, Austin et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2023b, Lai et al., 2022]. To further push the boundaries\nof code generation with open source LLMs, SELF-INSTRUCT [Wang et al., 2023a] is adopted to\nbootstrap the instruction-following ability of LLMs. In the realm of code, practitioners commonly\ndevise synthetic coding instructions using a stronger teacher model (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4) and\nthen finetune a weaker student model (e.g., CODELLAMA [Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023]) with the generated\ndata to distill the knowledge from the teacher [Taori et al., 2023, Chaudhary, 2023].For example, Code\nAlpaca [Chaudhary, 2023] consists of 20K automatically generated code instructions by applying\nSELF-INSTRUCT on ChatGPT using 21 seed tasks. To further enhance the coding abilities of LLMs,\nLuo et al. [2023b] proposes Code Evol-Instruct that employs various heuristics to increase the\ncomplexity of seed code instructions (Code Alpaca in this case), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nresults among open-source models.\nWhile these data generation methods can effectively improve the instruction-following capability of\nan LLM, they rely on a narrow range of predefined tasks or heuristics under the hood.For example, on\nthe one hand, Code Alpaca that adopts SELF-INSTRUCT only relies on 21 seed tasks to generate new\ncode instructions using an identical prompt template. On the other hand, Code Evol-Instruct takes\nCode Alpaca as seeds and merely depends on 5 heuristics to evolve the dataset. As partly suggested\nby Yu et al. [2023] and [Wang et al., 2023a], such approaches may significantly inherit the system\nbias inherent in the LLMs as well as the predefined tasks.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose OSS-INSTRUCT to mitigate the inherent bias of LLMs and to\nunleash their potential to craft high-quality and creative code instructions via direct learning from the\nopen source. As shown in Figure 1, OSS-INSTRUCT leverages a powerful LLM to automatically\ngenerate new coding problems by drawing inspiration from any random code snippets collected from\nthe open source. In this example, the LLM gets inspired by two incomplete code fragments from\ndifferent functions and manages to relate them and craft a realistic machine learning problem. Thanks\nto the \u201cinfinite\u201d real-world open-source code, OSS-INSTRUCT can directly produce diverse, realistic,\nand controllable code instructions by providing distinct seed code snippets. In the end, we generate\n75K synthetic data to finetune CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B, resulting in Magicoder-CL. While being\nsimple and effective, OSS-INSTRUCT is orthogonal to existing data generation methods, and they\ncan be combined to further push the boundaries of the models\u2019 coding capabilities. Therefore, we\ncontinually finetune Magicoder-CL on an open-source Evol-Instruct with 110K entries, producing\nMagicoderS-CL.\nWe evaluate Magicoder and MagicoderS on a wide range of coding tasks, including Hu-\nmanEval [Chen et al., 2021] and MBPP [Austin et al., 2021] for Python text-to-code generation,\nMultiPL-E [Cassano et al., 2022] for multilingual code completion, and DS-1000 [Lai et al., 2022]\nfor solving data science problems. We further adopt EvalPlus [Liu et al., 2023b], which includes the\naugmented HumanEval+ and MBPP+ datasets for more rigorous model evaluation. Both Magicoder-\nCL and MagicoderS-CL substantially boost the base CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B. Additionally,\nMagicoder-CL even outperforms WizardCoder-CL-7B, WizardCoder-SC-15B, and all studied SOTA\nLLMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters on all the benchmarks we tested.Also, the pass@1\nresult of the enhanced MagicoderS-CL is on par with ChatGPT on HumanEval (70.7 vs. 72.6) and\nsurpasses it on the more rigorous HumanEval+ (66.5 vs. 65.9), indicating that MagicoderS-CL can\ngenerate more robust code. It also achieves SOTA results among all code models at the same scale.\nAdditionally, we notice a very recent advancement in the development of the DeepSeek-Coder\nseries [DeepSeek AI, 2023] which has shown exceptional coding performance. However, due to the\n2\nYou are exceptionally skilled at crafting high-quality programming problems and \noffering precise solutions.\nPlease gain inspiration from the following random code snippet to create a \nhigh-quality programming problem. Present your output in two distinct sections: \n[Problem Description] and [Solution].\nCode snippet for inspiration:\n```\n{code}\n```\nGuidelines for each section:\n1.\n[Problem Description]: This should be **completely self-contained**, providing \nall the contextual information one needs to understand and solve the problem. \nAssume common programming knowledge, but ensure that any specific context, \nvariables, or code snippets pertinent to this problem are explicitly included.\n2.\n[Solution]: Offer a comprehensive, **correct** solution that accurately \naddresses the [Problem Description] you provided.\nFigure 2: The detailed prompt design for OSS-INSTRUCT\nlimited technical details currently disclosed, we only briefly discuss them in \u00a74.4. Despite this, we\napplied OSS-INSTRUCT on DeepSeek-Coder-Base 6.7B, resulting in the creation of Magicoder-DS\nand MagicoderS-DS. In addition to the consistent findings on the previous results with CODELLAMA-\nPYTHON-7B as the base model, Magicoder-DS and MagicoderS-DS benefit from the more powerful\nDeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B. This advantage is demonstrated by MagicoderS-DS, which achieves\na remarkable 76.8 pass@1 on HumanEval. MagicoderS-DS also outperforms DeepSeek-Coder-\nInstruct-6.7B on HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and MBPP+ with 8\u00d7 less finetuning tokens.\nTo justify the design of OSS-INSTRUCT, i.e., generating instruction-tuning data from open-source\nreferences rather than using the reference directly, we further demonstrate that finetuning the base\nmodels with semantically relevant comment-function pairs directly extracted from open-source\nprojects even negatively impacts the model performance (\u00a75.2).\nIn general, we make the following contributions:\n\u2022 We introduce OSS-INSTRUCT, a pioneering approach to enlightening LLMs with open-source\ncode snippets to generate more diverse, realistic, and controllable coding instruction data, which\ncan be leveraged to substantially boost the performance of various LLMs via instruction tuning.\nIt opens a new dimension for creating low-bias and high-quality instruction-tuning data from the\nabundance of open-source references.\n\u2022 We build the Magicoder series trained with OSS-INSTRUCT and MagicoderS series trained on a\ncombination of OSS-INSTRUCT and Evol-Instruct. Our evaluation across 6 benchmarks shows\nthat all Magicoders significantly improve the base LLMs. Notably, both MagicoderS-CL and\nMagicoderS-DS outperform ChatGPT on HumanEval+ with only 7B parameters.\n\u2022 We fully open source the model weights, training data, and source code at https://github.com/\nise-uiuc/magicoder to facilitate future research.\n2\nOSS-INSTRUCT: Instruction Tuning from Open Source\nIn this section, we elaborate on our OSS-INSTRUCT approach. From a high level, as shown in\nFigure 1, OSS-INSTRUCT works by prompting an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate a coding\nproblem and its solution according to some seed code snippet collected from the wild (e.g., from\nGitHub). The seed snippet offers controllability of the generation and encourages the LLM to create\ndiverse coding problems that can reflect real-world programming scenarios.\n2.1\nGenerating Coding Problems\nOSS-INSTRUCT is powered by seed code snippets that can be easily collected from open source. In\nthis work, we directly adopt starcoderdata as our seed corpus, a filtered version of The Stack [Ko-\ncetkov et al., 2022] dataset that StarCoder is trained on, containing permissively licensed source\n3\ncode documents in various programming languages.We chose starcoderdata because it is widely\nadopted, includes massive high-quality code snippets, and is even post-processed for data decontami-\nnation [Li et al., 2023, Allal et al., 2023]. For each code document from the corpus, we randomly\nextract 1\u201315 consecutive lines as the seed snippet for the model to gain inspiration from and produce\ncoding problems. In total, we collected 80K initial seed snippets from 80K code documents, 40K from\nPython, and 5K from each of C++, Java, TypeScript, Shell, C#, Rust, PHP, and Swift respectively.\nThen, each collected seed code snippet is applied to the prompt template shown in Figure 2, which a\nteacher model takes as input and outputs both a coding problem and its solution.\n2.2\nData Cleaning and Decontamination\nWe perform data cleaning by excluding samples that are identical or share the same seed code snippet\u201d\nor linebreaks \u201c\\n\u201d. While there exist other sorts of noisiness (e.g., the solution is incomplete) in the\ngenerated data, inspired by Honovich et al. [2023], they are not removed as we believe they still\ncontain valuable information for LLMs to learn. Finally, we apply the same logic as StarCoder Li\net al. [2023] to decontaminate our training data by removing coding problems that contain docstrings\nor solutions from HumanEval [Chen et al., 2021] and MBPP [Austin et al., 2021], docstrings\nfrom APPS [Hendrycks et al., 2021], prompts from DS-1000 [Lai et al., 2022], or questions from\nGSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021]. As part of our analysis, the decontamination procedure only filters out\n9 additional samples. Since the seed corpus starcoderdata has already gone through rigorous data\ndecontamination, this observation suggests that OSS-INSTRUCT is unlikely to introduce additional\ndata leakage beyond the seeds. The eventual OSS-INSTRUCT dataset contains about 75K entries.\n2.3\nQualitative Examples of OSS-INSTRUCT\nFigure 3 shows some qualitative examples of how OSS-INSTRUCT can help LLM get inspiration\nfrom a seed code snippet to create new coding problems and solutions. For example, the shell\nscript example shows how an LLM crafts a Python coding problem with just one line of shell script.\nThe library imports example demonstrates how an LLM can create a realistic machine learning\nproblem using just a few import statements. Meanwhile, the class signature instance illustrates the\nability of LLM to draw inspiration from an incomplete class definition featuring annotations like\nSpringBootApplication and keywords such as bank. From this, the LLM generates a problem that\nrequires implementing a complete banking system based on Spring Boot! Overall, OSS-INSTRUCT\ncan inspire an LLM with distinct code structures and semantics to create diverse coding tasks,\nincluding algorithmic challenges, realistic issues, single-function code generation, library-based\nprogram completion, whole-program development, and even whole-application construction.\nCategories\nTo study the categories of OSS-INSTRUCT-generated data, we use INSTRUCTOR [Su\net al., 2022], which is one of the SOTA embedding models and can generate different text embeddings\naccording to a task instruction. Inspired by OctoPack [Muennighoff et al., 2023] and the topic\ntags on GitHub, we manually designed 10 categories specific to coding. As shown in Figure 4, we\ncalculate the cosine similarity between the embeddings of each sample in OSS-INSTRUCT and the 10\ncategories to obtain the category breakdown. Overall, OSS-INSTRUCT exhibits diversity and balance\nacross different categories.\nLength distribution\nWe depict the length distribution for both generated problems and solutions\nin Figure 5. The x-axis represents the number of tokens in each problem/solution, while the y-axis\nshows the correspondent number of samples.\nSimilarity with HumanEval\nTo study whether our data generation process produces more\nHumanEval-like problems or solutions that contribute to high performance, we pair each sam-\nple from our 75K dataset with each of the 164 HumanEval [Chen et al., 2021] samples and compute\ntheir cosine similarity using TF-IDF [SPARCK JONES, 1972] embeddings. We then associate\neach OSS-INSTRUCT sample with a HumanEval sample with the highest similarity score. We also\ncompare our dataset against Code Alpaca, a 20K dataset applying SELF-INSTRUCT to code, and\nevol-codealpaca-v1 [theblackcat102, 2023], an open-source reproduction of Evol-Instruct contain-\ning 110K coding instructions. We resort to the open-source implementation because the official Code\nEvol-Instruct [Luo et al., 2023b] dataset is not released. We decontaminate all the datasets beforehand\nusing the same way discussed in \u00a72.2. Figure 6 shows that OSS-INSTRUCT exhibits the lowest\n4\n\ue873 Seed: method definition \nrender() { \n\uf04c Problem \nYour task is to complete the `render` method to \ngenerate the rendered shape as a string... \n\ue0f0 Code \nclass ShapeRenderer { \n  constructor(vertices) { \n    this.vertices = vertices; \n  } \n  render() { \n    let renderedShape = \"\"; \n    for (let i = 0; i < this.vertices.length; i++) { \n      const vertex = this.vertices[i]; \n      renderedShape += `(${vertex.x}, ${vertex.y})`; \n      if (i < this.vertices.length - 1) { \n        renderedShape += \" - \"; \n      } \n    } \n    return renderedShape; \n  } \n} \n\ue873 Seed: library imports \nimport numpy as np \nimport gym_electric_motor as gem \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\uf04c Problem \nCreate a reinforcement learning agent to control an \nelectric motor using the OpenAI Gym environment... \n\ue0f0 Code \nimport numpy as np \nimport gym_electric_motor as gem \n... \nenv = gem.make(\"DcSeriesCont-v1\") \nclass DQNAgent: \n  def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim): ... \n  def build_model(self): ... \n  def act(self, state): ... \n  def train(self, state, action, reward, ...): ... \n... \nfor episode in range(episodes): \n    state = env.reset() \n    state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_dim]) \n    ...\n\ue873 Seed: class signature \n@SpringBootApplication \n@Import({ AxonConfig.class }) \npublic class AxonbankApplication { \n  public static void main(String[] args) { \n\uf04c Problem \nCreate a simple Java Spring Boot application for a \nbanking system... \n\ue0f0 Code \nimport org.axonframework.commandhandling.CommandBus; \nimport org.axonframework.config.Configuration; \n... \n@SpringBootApplication \n@Import({ AxonConfig.class }) \npublic class AxonbankApplication {...} \npublic class BankAccount {...} \npublic class CreateAccountCommand {...} \npublic class DepositFundsCommand {...} \npublic class WithdrawFundsCommand {...} \npublic class AccountCreatedEvent {...} \npublic class FundsDepositedEvent {...} \npublic class FundsWithdrawnEvent {...}\n\ue873 Seed: code statements \ncutoff_range = np.ptp(cutoffs) \nif cutoff_range == 0: cutoff_range = 1 \ncutoff_colors = plt.get_cmap('plasma')( \n    (cutoffs - np.min(cutoffs)) / cutoff_range \n) \n\uf04c Problem \nImplement a function that calculates the color values \nfor a given set of cuto\ufb00 values based on a specified \ncolor map... \n\ue0f0 Code \nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \ndef calculate_cutoff_colors(cutoffs, cmap_name): \n  cutoff_range = np.ptp(cutoffs) \n  if cutoff_range == 0: \n    cutoff_range = 1 \n  cmap = plt.get_cmap(cmap_name) \n  normalized_cutoffs = ... \n  cutoff_colors = ... \n  return cutoff_colors\n\ue873 Seed: shell script \npython3 makeErrorFile.py data/test_dataset_14 14 \n\uf04c Problem \nCreate a Python program that generates an error file \nbased on a given dataset... \n\ue0f0 Code \ndef generate_error_file(dataset_file, ...): \n  error_lines = [] \n  with open(dataset_file, 'r') as file: \n    for line in file: \n      ... \n  with open(error_file_name, 'w') as error_file: \n    for error_line in error_lines: \n      error_file.write(error_line + '\\n') \nif __name__ == \"__main__\": \n  if len(sys.argv) != 3: \n    print(\"Usage: ...\") \n  else: \n    dataset_file = sys.argv[1] \n    dataset_number = sys.argv[2] \n    generate_error_file(...)\n\ue873 Seed: comments \n# Set degrees \n\uf04c Problem \nImplement a Python class that represents a \ntemperature in degrees... \n\ue0f0 Code \nclass TemperatureConverter: \n  def __init__(self): ... \n  def set_celsius(self, degrees): ... \n  def set_fahrenheit(self, degrees): ... \n  def set_kelvin(self, degrees): ... \n  def get_celsius(self): ... \n  def get_fahrenheit(self): ... \n  def get_kelvin(self): ... \n  def convert_to(self, unit): \n      if unit == 'C': \n          return self.get_celsius() \n      elif unit == 'F': \n          return self.get_fahrenheit() \n      elif unit == 'K': \n          return self.get_kelvin() \n      ...\nFigure 3: Examples showing how OSS-INSTRUCT generates problems and solutions from seed code\nsnippets.

This result indicates that the improvements from OSS-INSTRUCT are\nnot merely due to including data from the same distribution.\n3\nImplementation Details\nData generation\nWe use gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 as the foundation model to do OSS-INSTRUCT\ndue to its high cost-effectiveness. We randomly extract 1\u201315 lines from each selected code document\nfrom starcoderdata and let gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 imagine a self-contained coding problem and a\ncorrect solution. Given the numerous seed code snippets, we perform greedy decoding to maximize\nthe consistency between the generated problems and solutions.\nData decontamination\nWe apply data decontamination before training our Magicoder and\nMagicoderS models. Following Li et al. [2023], we decontaminate both our 75K OSS-INSTRUCT\ndataset and the evol-codealpaca-v1 [theblackcat102, 2023] dataset, an open-source reproduction\nof Evol-Instruct, by removing exact matches from HumanEval [Chen et al., 2021], MBPP [Austin\net al., 2021], DS-1000 [Lai et al., 2022], and GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021]. Eventually, we filtered\nout 9 problems for OSS-INSTRUCT dataset and 89 for evol-codealpaca-v1.\nTraining\nWe employ CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-Base 6.7B as the base\nLLMs. To obtain Magicoder series, we first finetune the base models on about 75K synthetic data\ngenerated through OSS-INSTRUCT using the transformers library from Hugging Face [Hugging\nFace, 2023]. We finetune the base models for 2 epochs using two NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs through\nthe Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) module from PyTorch. We set the initial learning rate at 5e-5 with\n15 warmup steps and a linear scheduler. We use Adafactor [Shazeer and Stern, 2018] as our optimizer\nand choose a batch size of 512 with a sequence truncation length of 1216. To obtain MagicoderS,\nwe continue to finetune Magicoder models with the evol-codealpaca-v1 dataset, an open-source\nEvol-Instruct implementation containing about 110K samples. We use the same hyperparameters\nexcept for 15 warmup steps and a 1024 max sequence length.\n6\nTable 1: Pass@1 (%) results of different LLMs on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) computed with\ngreedy decoding.

Each task in these benchmarks includes a task description (e.g.,\ndocstring) as the prompt, where LLMs generate corresponding code whose correctness is checked\nby a handful of test cases. Because tests in these benchmarks can be insufficient [Liu et al., 2023b],\nfor more rigorous evaluation, we use HumanEval+ and MBPP+, both powered by the EvalPlus\nframework [Liu et al., 2023b] to obtain 80\u00d7/35\u00d7 more tests. Following prior work [Liu et al., 2023b,\nChen et al., 2023], for each task and LLM we use greedy decoding to generate one sample and focus\non comparing the pass@1 metric.\nWe consider a wide range of baseline models, including CODELLAMA-PYTHON [Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023],\nWizardCoder [Luo et al., 2023b], GPT-3.5 Turbo [OpenAI, 2022], GPT-4 Turbo [OpenAI, 2023],\nStarCoder [Li et al., 2023], CodeT5+ [Wang et al., 2023b], CodeGen-Mono [Nijkamp et al., 2023],\nand Mistral [Jiang et al., 2023a]. All the results are consistently reported from the EvalPlus [Liu et al.,\n2023b] leaderboard.\nTable 1 shows the pass@1 results of different LLMs on these benchmarks. From the results, we can\nfirst observe that Magicoder-CL has a clear improvement over the base CODELLAMA-PYTHON-\n7B, and outperforms all studied open-source models except CODELLAMA-PYTHON-34B and\nWizardCoder-CL-34B. Notably, Magicoder-CL surpasses WizardCoder-SC-15B and has a substantial\nimprovement on HumanEval and HumanEval+ over CODELLAMA-PYTHON-34B.MagicoderS-CL\ndemonstrates further improvements by being trained with the orthogonal Evol-Instruct method.\nMagicoderS-CL outperforms ChatGPT and all other open-source models on HumanEval+. More-\nover, although it scores slightly lower than WizardCoder-CL-34B and ChatGPT on HumanEval, it\nsurpasses both of them on the more rigorous HumanEval+ dataset, indicating that MagicoderS-CL\nmay produce more robust code.\n7\nTable 2: Pass@1 results of different LLMs on MultiPL-E [Cassano et al., 2022] following the\nsame hyperparameter settings as the WizardCoder paper [Luo et al., 2023b]: temperature =\n0.2, top_p = 0.95, max_length = 512, and num_samples = 50.

We skip proprietary models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 as they are not supported by\nthe framework. Due to a significant inference latency when running WizardCoder-CL-7B using the\nharness in our environment, we choose not to include it in our analysis.\nThe results indicate that Magicoder-CL improves the base CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B by a large\nmargin among all the studied programming languages. Moreover, Magicoder-CL also achieves better\nresults than the SOTA 15B WizardCoder-SC among half of the programming languages.Additionally,\nMagicoderS-CL demonstrates further improvement over Magicoder-CL on all programming lan-\nguages, achieving comparable performance against WizardCoder-CL-34B with only 7B parameters.\nIt is worth noting that Magicoder-CL is only trained with very limited multilingual data but still\noutperforms other LLMs with similar or even larger sizes. Also, although the harness evaluates\nmodels in completion formats, Magicoders still show significant improvements despite being only\ninstruction-tuned. This implies that LLMs can learn knowledge from the data beyond its format.\n4.3\nCode Generation for Data Science\nThe DS-1000 dataset [Lai et al., 2022] contains 1K distinct data science coding issues ranging from 7\npopular data science libraries in Python. It evaluates the realistic and practical use case of an LLM\nand offers unit tests for validating each problem. DS-1000 has both completion and insertion modes,\nbut here we only evaluate completion because the base CODELLAMA-PYTHON does not support\ninfilling. Table 3 shows the evaluation results where we include the recent INCODER [Fried et al.,\n2023], CodeGen [Nijkamp et al., 2023], Code-Cushman-001 [Microsoft, 2023a], StarCoder [Li et al.,\n2023], CODELLAMA-PYTHON [Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023], and WizardCoder [Luo et al., 2023b]. We can\nsee from the table that Magicoder-CL-7B already outperforms all the baselines we evaluate, including\nstate-of-the-art WizardCoder-CL-7B and WizardCoder-SC-15B. MagicoderS-CL-7B further breaks\nthe limit by introducing an 8.3 percentage point absolute improvement over WizardCoder-SC-15B.\n8\nTable 3: Pass@1 results on DS-1000 (completion format) with temperature = 0.2, top_p = 0.5,\nmax_length = 1024, and num_samples = 40, following the same hyperparameter setting used in\nWizardCoder [Luo et al., 2023b].

We only briefly discuss it in this section because its technical\ndetails and instruction data are not publicly available at the time of writing. We apply the same\nfinetuning strategy on DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B as we performed on CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B,\nleading to Magicoder-DS and MagicoderS-DS. Table 4 shows a similar trend as Table 1 that the base\nmodel can be significantly improved after applying OSS-INSTRUCT. Remarkably, the MagicoderS-\nDS variant surpasses DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B on all the benchmarks with \u00d78 fewer training\ntokens, and it also closely matches DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-34B on these datasets!\n5\nAblations of Data Source\n5.1\nImpact of the Language Distribution\nTo understand the correlation between the programming languages appearing in the training data and\nthe downstream performance of different languages, we conduct an additional ablation study about\nthe training data. We classify the 75K training data into approximately 43K Python-only, and 32K\nnon-Python data according to whether ```python is a substring of the generated data. We do not\nclassify the data based on the seed code snippet because LLMs performing OSS-INSTRUCT may\nproduce code in a different programming language than the seed.\n9\nTable 5: Ablation study of using different programming languages as training data. We show the\npass@1 results on HumanEval+ [Liu et al., 2023b] for Python and the average pass@1 results on\nMultiPL-E [Cassano et al., 2022] for the same set of programming languages used in Table 2 (i.e.,\nJava, JavaScript, C++, PHP, Swift, and Rust). All the variants are finetuned with 2 epochs and\nevaluated through greedy-decoding.\nModel (7B)\nFinetuning Data\nPython (HumanEval+)\nOthers (MultiPL-E)\nCODELLAMA-PYTHON\n-\n34.1\n29.6\nMagicoder-CL\nPython (43K)\n47.6\n32.7\nMagicoder-CL\nOthers (32K)\n44.5\n38.3\nMagicoder-CL\nBoth (75K)\n55.5\n37.8\nTable 6: Comparison between OSS-INSTRUCT and directly finetuning on comment-function pairs\nwith CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B as the base model.\nFinetuning Data\nHumanEval+\nMultiPL-E\nBase model w/o finetuning\n34.1\n29.6\nComment-function pairs (75K)\n34.1\n24.1\nOSS-INSTRUCT (75K)\n55.5\n37.8\nTable 5 shows the evaluation results, where we consistently finetune the base CODELLAMA-PYTHON-\n7B for 2 epochs on different data partitions using the same training hyperparameters explained in\n\u00a73. From the table, we can see that, as can be imagined, training on Python or non-Python data can\nsubstantially boost the performance of the base model in Python or non-Python tasks, respectively.\nInterestingly, instruction tuning on different programming languages can still boost the overall\ncoding performance that includes out-of-distribution languages. For example, when trained on only\nnon-Python data, Magicoder-CL still achieves a 10.4 percentage point improvement over the base\nmodel in the Python-only evaluation. This implies LLMs can establish correlations between different\nprogramming languages and perform transfer learning of deeper code semantics.Finally, we observe\na more significant boost in Python evaluation when combining data from both sources, with a slight\ndecrease in multilingual performance compared with only finetuning on multilingual data. We\nattribute this decrease to the dominant amount of Python data (around 57%) during instruction tuning.\n5.2\nOSS-INSTRUCT vs. Direct Finetuning\nThe fact that OSS-INSTRUCT gets an LLM inspired from open-source code snippets may lead to a\nnatural question: why not directly finetuning on these open-source code? To answer this question,\nwe follow CodeSearchNet [Husain et al., 2020] to mine semantically relevant comment-function\npairs from the same seed document corpus we use to construct the 75K OSS-INSTRUCT dataset. We\nthen train the model to predict the function bodies from the function signatures and comments. We\nprioritize comment-function pairs that overlap with our 75K seed snippets, resulting in about 11K\ndata points. To align with our 75K samples, we collect the remaining 64K samples using the whole\ncorpus of 75K seed documents. Eventually, we have the same number of comment-function pairs\nwith OSS-INSTRUCT data.\nWe finetune the base CODELLAMA-PYTHON-7B for 2 epochs using the paired data, following the\nsame training setup discussed in \u00a73. From Table 6, we observe that finetuning on 75K paired comment-\nfunction data even worsens the base model, while OSS-INSTRUCT helps to introduce a substantial\nboost. We conjecture that the degradation is owing to the substantial noise and inconsistency that\nexists intrinsically in the data pairs, even though these paired data exhibit very similar format as\nHumanEval or MultiPL-E problems. This further shows that data factuality, rather than the format, is\nessential to code instruction tuning. It also indicates the superiority of OSS-INSTRUCT which can\ntranslate these loosely related code fragments into semantically-consistent instruction-tuning data.\n10\n6\nRelated Work\nFoundation models for code\nTrained over billions of lines of code, LLMs have demonstrated out-\nstanding performance in a wide range of software engineering tasks, including code generation [Chen\net al., 2021, Austin et al., 2021], program repair [Wei et al., 2023, Xia et al., 2023a,c, Xia and\nZhang, 2022, Jiang et al., 2023b], and fuzzing [Xia et al., 2023b, Deng et al., 2023b,a]. In particular,\nprominent base models, such as CodeGen [Nijkamp et al., 2023], CodeT5 [Wang et al., 2021],\nStarCoder [Li et al., 2023], and CODELLAMA [Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023], are pre-trained over a huge\nnumber of codebase from scratch, establishing the fundamental ability of general code generation\nand understanding. Furthermore, these base models are also further finetuned [Luo et al., 2023b]\nor prompted [Chen et al., 2023] to unlock the true potential of the model to specialize in solving\ndomain-specific coding tasks.\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning aims at improving pretrained LLMs by finetuning them with\na mixture of instructions and corresponding responses [Wei et al., 2022]. With instruction tuning,\nLLMs can improve their generalization ability and directly follow instructions without explicit user\ndemonstration. However, obtaining high-quality instructional data is oftentimes laborious. To this\nend, Wang et al. [2023a] introduces SELF-INSTRUCT, where a foundation LLM (GPT-3) is used\nto generate synthetic instruction-response pairs with carefully crafted prompts. The same LLM\nis then instruction-tuned on the synthetic data to distill such self-generated knowledge. Although\nSELF-INSTRUCT initially suggests using the same LLM for both data generation and instruction\ntuning, it has been further extended to create synthetic data with different LLMs. For example,\nAlpaca [Taori et al., 2023] and Code Alpaca [Chaudhary, 2023] apply SELF-INSTRUCT to finetune\nLLAMA with ChatGPT-generated instructions. CODELLAMA-INSTRUCTs [Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023] are\nfintuned using SELF-INSTRUCT by prompting LLAMA 2 [Touvron et al., 2023] for coding problems\nand CODELLAMA for unit tests and solutions. To improve SELF-INSTRUCT, WizardLM [Xu et al.,\n2023] and WizardCoder [Luo et al., 2023a] propose Evol-Instruct and Code Evol-Instruct by guiding\nChatGPT with heuristic prompts to make the synthetic data more complex and diverse. In contrast,\nour proposed OSS-INSTRUCT is orthogonal to all existing methods by allowing LLMs to get inspired\nfrom real-world code snippets for better controllability, quality, and creativity in coding tasks.\nEvaluating LLMs for code\nMost code benchmarks evaluate LLMs on generating single-function\nprograms from natural language descriptions. Such benchmarks include HumanEval [Chen et al.,\n2021], MBPP [Austin et al., 2021], APPS [Hendrycks et al., 2021], and CodeContests [Li et al., 2022].\nA handful of manual tests are used to assess the functional correctness of LLM-generated solutions.\nHowever, insufficient tests can lead to false negatives. Consequently, the EvalPlus framework [Liu\net al., 2023b] produces HumanEval+ and MBPP+ by extending 80\u00d7/35\u00d7 more tests. Meanwhile,\nthere are comprehensive benchmarks evaluating code generation for data science (DS-1000 [Lai et al.,\n2022]), addressing open-source issues (SWE-bench [Jimenez et al., 2023]), and repository-level code\ngeneration (CROSSCODEEVAL [Ding et al., 2023] and RepoEval [Zhang et al., 2023]).\n7\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe propose OSS-INSTRUCT, a novel data generation method using Large Language Models to\ngenerate low-bias and high-quality coding challenges from open-source code snippets. This approach\nenables Magicoder, which significantly improves the base LLM. Despite having less than 7B parame-\nters, it can outperform all evaluate LLMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters, including the\n15B WizardCoder. Combining OSS-INSTRUCT with Evol-Instruct allows us to build the enhanced\nMagicoderS models. They achieve remarkable results by rivaling leading models like ChatGPT in\nHumanEval benchmarks. We fully open source the model weights, training data, and source code, to\nenable future research in LLM s for code.In the near future, we will apply OSS-INSTRUCT to larger\nbase models. We will also continue advancing OSS-INSTRUCT by generating higher-quality data\nwith a strategically designed distribution of the seed code snippets and with more advanced teacher\nLLMs such as GPT-4.\n11\nReferences\nLoubna Ben Allal, Raymond Li, Denis Kocetkov, Chenghao Mou, Christopher Akiki, Carlos Munoz\nFerrandis, Niklas Muennighoff, Mayank Mishra, Alex Gu, Manan Dey, Logesh Kumar Umapathi,\nCarolyn Jane Anderson, Yangtian Zi, Joel Lamy Poirier, Hailey Schoelkopf, Sergey Troshin,\nDmitry Abulkhanov, Manuel Romero, Michael Lappert, Francesco De Toni, Bernardo Garc\u00eda del\nR\u00edo, Qian Liu, Shamik Bose, Urvashi Bhattacharyya, Terry Yue Zhuo, Ian Yu, Paulo Villegas,\nMarco Zocca, Sourab Mangrulkar, David Lansky, Huu Nguyen, Danish Contractor, Luis Villa, Jia\nLi, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Yacine Jernite, Sean Hughes, Daniel Fried, Arjun Guha, Harm de Vries,\nand Leandro von Werra.

Our codes, data\nand the project demo can be found at https://video-motion-\ncustomization.github.io.\n1. Introduction\nThe evolution of diffusion models [13, 28, 31] has signif-\nicantly advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, notably\nwhen paired with extensive text-image datasets [3, 25].\nWhile cascaded diffusion pipelines [2, 9, 14, 27, 33, 37, 39]\nhave extended this success to Text-to-Video (T2V) gener-\nation, current models lack the ability to replicate specific\nmotions or generate diverse variations of the same motion\nwith distinct visual attributes and backgrounds. Address-\ning this, we tackle the challenge of Motion Customiza-\ntion [38]\u2014adapting pre-trained Video Diffusion Models\n(VDM) to produce motion-specific videos in different con-\ntexts, while maintaining the same motion patterns of target\nsubjects.\nGiven a few subject images for reference, appearance\ncustomization [8, 19, 23, 24, 26, 35] in generative models\naims to fine-tune models to generate subject images in di-\nverse contexts. However, these approaches, despite varying\noptimization objectives, commonly strive for faithful im-\nage (frame) reconstruction by minimizing the \u21132-distance\nbetween predicted and ground-truth noise. This may lead to\nthe entangled learning of appearance and motion.\nTo tackle this, we present VMC, a new framework aimed\nat adapting pre-trained VDM\u2019s temporal attention layers\nvia our proposed Motion Distillation objective. This ap-\nproach utilizes residual vectors between consecutive (latent)\nframes to obtain the motion vectors that trace motion tra-\njectories in the target video. Consequently, we fine-tune\nVDM\u2019s temporal attention layers to align the ground-truth\nimage-space residuals with their denoised estimates, which\nequivalently aligns predicted and ground-truth source noise\ndifferences within VDM. This enables lightweight and fast\none-shot training.\nTo further facilitate the appearance-\ninvariant motion distillation, we transform faithful text\nprompts into appearance-invariant prompts, e.g. \"A bird\nis flying above a lake in the forest\" \u00d1\n\"A bird is flying\" in Fig.\n1.\nThis encourages\nthe modules to focus on the motion information and ig-\nnore others, such as appearance, distortions, background,\netc. During inference, our procedure initiates by sampling\nkey-frames using the adapted key-frame generation U-\nNet, followed by temporal interpolation and spatial super-\nresolution. To summarize, VMC makes the following key\ncontributions:\n\u2022 We introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy which focuses\nsolely on temporal attention layers in the key-frame gen-\neration module. This enables lightweight training (15GB\nvRAM) and fast training (\u0103 5 minutes).\n\u2022 To our knowledge, we mark a pioneering case of fine-\ntuning only the temporal attention layers in video dif-\nfusion models, without optimizing spatial self or cross-\nattention layers, while achieving successful motion cus-\ntomization.\n\u2022 We introduce a novel motion distillation objective that\nleverages the residual vectors between consecutive (la-\ntent) frames as motion vectors.\n\u2022 We present the concept of appearance-invariant prompts,\nwhich further facilitates the process of motion learning\nwhen combined with our motion distillation loss.\n2. Preliminaries\nDiffusion Models.\nDiffusion models aim to generate\nsamples from the Gaussian noise through iterative denois-\ning processes. Given a clean sample x0 \u201e pdatapxq, the\nforward process is defined as a Markov chain with forward\nconditional densities\nppxt | xt\u00b41q \u201c Npxt | \u03b2txt\u00b41, p1 \u00b4 \u03b2tqIq\nptpxt | x0q \u201c Npxt |\n?\n\u00af\u03b1x0, p1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1qIq,\n(1)\nwhere xt P Rd is a noisy latent variable at a timestep t that\nhas the same dimension as x0, and \u03b2t denotes an increasing\nsequence of noise schedule where \u03b1t :\u201c 1 \u00b4 \u03b2t and \u00af\u03b1t :\u201c\n\u03a0t\ni\u201c1\u03b1i. Then, the goal of diffusion model training is to\nobtain a residual denoiser \u03f5\u03b8:\nmin\n\u03b8\nExt\u201eptpxt | x0q,x0\u201epdatapx0q,\u03f5\u201eN p0,Iq\n\u201c\n\u2225\u03f5\u03b8pxt, tq \u00b4 \u03f5\u2225\n\u2030\n.\n(2)\nIt can be shown that this epsilon matching in (2) is equiva-\nlent to the Denoising Score Matching (DSM [16, 30]) with\ndifferent parameterization:\nmin\n\u03b8\nExt,x0,\u03f5\n\u201c \r\rst\n\u03b8pxtq \u00b4 \u2207xt log ptpxt | x0q\n\r\r \u2030\n,\n(3)\nwhere s\u03b8\u02dapxt, tq \u00bb \u00b4 xt\u00b4?\u00af\u03b1tx0\n1\u00b4\u00af\u03b1\n\u201c \u00b4\n1\n?1\u00b4\u00af\u03b1t \u03f5\u03b8\u02dapxt, tq.\nThe reverse sampling from qpxt\u00b41|xt, \u03f5\u03b8\u02dapxt, tqq is then\nachieved by\nxt\u00b41 \u201c\n1\n?\u03b1t\n\u00b4\nxt \u00b4 1 \u00b4 \u03b1t\n?1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5\u03b8\u02dapxt, tq\n\u00af\n` \u02dc\u03b2t\u03f5,\n(4)\nwhere \u03f5 \u201e Np0, Iq and \u02dc\u03b2t :\u201c\n1\u00b4\u00af\u03b1t\u00b41\n1\u00b4\u00af\u03b1t \u03b2t. To accelerate\nsampling, DDIM [29] further proposes another sampling\nmethod as follows:\nxt\u00b41 \u201c ?\u00af\u03b1t\u00b41\u02c6x0ptq`\nb\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u00b41 \u00b4 \u03b72 \u02dc\u03b2t\n2\u03f5\u03b8\u02dapxt, tq`\u03b7 \u02dc\u03b2t\u03f5,\n(5)\nFigure 2. Overview. The proposed Video Motion Customization (VMC) framework distills the motion trajectories from the residual\nbetween consecutive (latent) frames, namely motion vector \u03b4vn\nt for t \u011b 0. We fine-tune only the temporal attention layers of the key-\nframe generation model by aligning the ground-truth and predicted motion vectors. After training, the customized key-frame generator is\nleveraged for target motion-driven video generation with new appearances context, e.g. \"A chicken is walking in a city\".\nwhere \u03b7 P r0, 1s is a stochasticity parameter, and \u02c6x0ptq is\nthe denoised estimate which can be equivalently derived us-\ning Tweedie\u2019s formula [6]:\n\u02c6x0ptq :\u201c\n1\n?\u00af\u03b1t\npxt \u00b4\n?\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5\u03b8\u02dapxt, tqq.\n(6)\nFor a text-guided Diffusion Model, the training objective is\noften given by:\nmin\n\u03b8\nExt,x0,\u03f5,c\n\u201c\n\u2225\u03f5\u03b8pxt, t, cq \u00b4 \u03f5\u2225\n\u2030\n,\n(7)\nwhere c represents the textual embedding. Throughout this\npaper, we will often omit c from \u03f5\u03b8pxt, t, cq if it does not\nlead to notational ambiguity.\nVideo Diffusion Models.\nVideo diffusion models [12, 14,\n37] further attempt to model the video data distribution.\nSpecifically, Let pvnqnPt1,...,Nu represents the N-frame in-\nput video sequence. Then, for a given n-th frame vn P Rd,\nlet v1:N P RN\u02c6d represents a whole video vector.\nLet\nvn\nt \u201c ?\u00af\u03b1tvn `?1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5n\nt represents the n-th noisy frame\nlatent sampled from ptpvn\nt |vnq, where \u03f5n\nt \u201e Np0, Iq. We\nsimilarly define pvn\nt qnP1,...,N, v1:N\nt\n, and \u03f51:N\nt\n. The goal of\nvideo diffusion model training is then to obtain a residual\ndenoiser \u03f5\u03b8 with textual condition c and video input that\nsatisfies:\nmin\n\u03b8\nEv1:N\nt\n,v1:N,\u03f51:N\nt\n,c\n\u201c \r\r\u03f5\u03b8pv1:N\nt\n, t, cq \u00b4 \u03f51:N\nt\n\r\r \u2030\n,\n(8)\nwhere \u03f5\u03b8pv1:N\nt\n, t, cq, \u03f51:N\nt\nP RN\u02c6d. In this work, we denote\nthe predicted noise of n-th frame as \u03f5n\n\u03b8 pv1:N\nt\n, t, cq P Rd.\nIn practice, contemporary video diffusion models of-\nten employ cascaded inference pipelines for high-resolution\noutputs.\nFor instance, [37] initially generates a low-\nresolution video with strong text-video correlation, further\nenhancing its resolution via temporal interpolation and spa-\ntial super-resolution modules.\nIn exploring video generative tasks through diffusion\nmodels, two primary approaches have emerged: founda-\ntional Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) or leveraging pre-\ntrained Text-to-Image (T2I) models. To extend image dif-\nfusion models to videos, several architectural modifica-\ntions are made. Typically, U-Net generative modules inte-\ngrate temporal attention blocks after spatial attentions [12].\nMoreover, 2D convolution layers are inflated to 3D convo-\nlution layers by altering kernels [12].\n3. Video Motion Customization\nGiven an input video, our main goal is to (a) distill\nthe motion patterns M\u02da of target subjects, and (b) cus-\ntomize the input video in different contexts while main-\ntaining the same motion patterns M\u02da, e.g. Sharks w/\nmotion M\u02da \u00d1 Airplanes w/ motion M\u02da, with\nminimal computational costs.\nTo this end, we propose a novel video motion customiza-\ntion framework, namely VMC, which leverages cascaded\nvideo diffusion models with robust temporal priors. One\nnotable aspect of the proposed framework is that we per-\nform fine-tuning only on the key-frame generation module,\nalso referred to as the T2V base model, within the cas-\ncaded VDMs, which guarantees computational and mem-\nory efficiency. Specifically, within the key-frame genera-\ntion model, our fine-tuning process only targets the tempo-\nral attention layers. This facilitates adaptation while pre-\nserving the model\u2019s inherent capacity for generic synthesis.\nNotably, we freeze the subsequent frame interpolation and\nspatial super-resolution modules as-is (Fig. 2).\nFigure 3. Training. The proposed framework aims to learn motion\nby \u03b4\u03f5n\nt -alignment using (16) or (17). Note that we only fine-tune\nthe temporal attention layers in the key-frame generation U-Net.\nThe blue circle represents the diffusion forward process.\n3.1. Temporal Attention Adaptation\nIn order to distill the motion M\u02da, we first propose a new\nobjective function for temporal attention adaptation using\nresidual cosine similarity. Our intuition is that residual vec-\ntors between consecutive frames may include information\nabout the motion trajectories.\nLet pvnqnPt1,...,Nu represents the N-frame input video\nsequence. As defined in Section 2, for a given noisy video\nlatent vector v1:N\nt\nwith \u03f51:N\nt\n, let vn\nt represents the n-th\nnoisy frame latent sampled from ptpvn\nt |vnq with \u03f5n\nt . We\nwill interchangeably use vn and vn\n0 for notational simplic-\nity. Likewise, vn`c\nt\nis defined as vn\nt , with c \u0105 0 repre-\nsenting the fixed frame stride. Then, we define the frame\nresidual vector at time t \u011b 0 as\n\u03b4vn\nt :\u201c vn`c\nt\n\u00b4 vn\nt ,\n(9)\nwhere we similarly define the epsilon residual vector \u03b4\u03f5n\nt .\nIn the rest of the paper, we interchangeably use frame resid-\nual vector and motion vector.\nWe expect that these motion vectors may encode infor-\nmation about motion patterns, where such information may\nvary depending on the time t and its corresponding noise\nlevel. The difference vector \u03b4vn\nt can be delineated as:\n\u03b4vn\nt \u201c ?\u00af\u03b1tpvn`c\n0\n\u00b4 vn\n0q `\n?\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1tp\u03f5n`c\nt\n\u00b4 \u03f5n\nt q\n\u201c ?\u00af\u03b1t\u03b4vn\n0 `\n?\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u03b4\u03f5n\nt ,\n(10)\nwhere \u03b4\u03f5n\nt is normally distributed with zero mean and 2I\nvariance. In essence, \u03b4vn\nt can be acquired through the fol-\nlowing diffusion kernel:\npp\u03b4vn\nt | \u03b4vn\n0q \u201c Np\u03b4vn\nt | ?\u00af\u03b1t\u03b4vn\n0, 2p1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1tqIq.\n(11)\nIn light of this, our goal is to transfer motion information\nto the temporal attention layers by leveraging the motion\nvectors. For this, we first simulate the motion vectors us-\ning video diffusion models. Specifically, as similarly done\nin (6), the denoised video vector estimates \u02c6v1:N\n0\nptq can be\nderived by applying Tweedie\u2019s formula:\n\u02c6v1:N\n0\nptq :\u201c\n1\n?\u00af\u03b1t\n`\nv1:N\nt\n\u00b4\n?\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5\u03b8pv1:N\nt\n, tq\n\u02d8\n,\n(12)\nwhere \u02c6v1:N\n0\nptq is an empirical Bayes optimal posterior\nexpectation Erv1:N\n0\n| v1:N\nt\ns.\nThen, the denoised motion\nvector estimate \u03b4\u02c6vn\n0 can be defined in terms of \u03b4vn\nt and\n\u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8 pv1:N\nt\n, tq by using (12):\n\u03b4\u02c6vn\n0ptq :\u201c\n1\n?\u00af\u03b1t\n\u00b4\n\u03b4vn\nt \u00b4\n?\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t\n\u00af\n,\n(13)\nwhere \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8 pv1:N\nt\n, tq :\u201c \u03f5n`c\n\u03b8\npv1:N\nt\n, tq \u00b4 \u03f5n\n\u03b8 pv1:N\nt\n, tq is ab-\nbreviated as \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t for notational simplicity. Similarly, one\ncan obtain ground-truth motion vector \u03b4vn\n0 in terms of \u03b4vn\nt\nand \u03b4\u03f5n\nt by using (10):\n\u03b4vn\n0 \u201c\n1\n?\u00af\u03b1t\n\u00b4\n\u03b4vn\nt \u00b4\n?\n1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\u03b4\u03f5n\nt\n\u00af\n.\n(14)\nThen, our objective is to finetune \u03b8 by aligning the mo-\ntion vector \u03b4vn\n0 and its denoised estimate \u03b4\u02c6vn\n0ptq:\nmin\n\u03b8\nEt,n,\u03f5n\nt ,\u03f5n`c\nt\n\u201d\n\u2113align\n`\n\u03b4vn\n0, \u03b4\u02c6vn\n0ptq\n\u02d8\u0131\n,\n(15)\nwith a loss function \u2113align : Rd \u02c6 Rd \u00d1 R. By using \u21132-\ndistance for \u2113align, this is equivalent to matching \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t and\n\u03b4\u03f5n\nt :\n\u2113align\n`\n\u03b4vn\n0, \u03b4\u02c6vn\n0ptq\n\u02d8\n\u201c 1 \u00b4 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u00af\u03b1t\n\r\r\u03b4\u03f5n\nt \u00b4 \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t\n\r\r2 .\n(16)\nNotably, aligning the ground-truth and predicted motion\nvectors translates into aligning epsilon residuals.\nWhile this objective demonstrates effective empirical\nperformance, our additional observations indicate that using\n\u2113cosp\u03b4\u03f5n\nt , \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,tq may further improve the distillation, where\n\u2113cospx, yq \u201c 1 \u00b4\nxx,yy\n}x}}y} for x, y P Rd (more analysis in\nsection 4.3). Accordingly, our optimization framework is\nfinally defined as follows:\nmin\n\u03b8\nEt,n,\u03f5n\nt ,\u03f5n`c\nt\nr\u2113cosp\u03b4\u03f5n\nt , \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,tqs.\n(17)\nThus, the proposed optimization framework aims to maxi-\nmize the residual cosine similarity between \u03b4\u03f5n\nt and \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t.\nIn our observation, aligning the image-space residuals (\u03b4vn\n0\nand \u03b4\u02c6vn\n0ptq) corresponds to aligning the latent-space ep-\nsilon residuals (\u03b4\u03f5n\nt and \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t) across varying time steps.\nThis relationship stems from expressing the motion vector\n\u03b4vn\n0 and its estimation \u03b4\u02c6vn\n0ptq in terms of \u03b4vn\nt , \u03b4\u03f5n\nt , and\n\u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,t. Consequently, the proposed optimization framework\nfine-tunes temporal attention layers by leveraging diverse\ndiffusion latent spaces at time t which potentially contains\nmulti-scale rich descriptions of video frames. Hence, this\noptimization approach can be seamlessly applied to video\ndiffusion models trained using epsilon-matching, thanks to\nthe equivalence between \u03b4\u03f5n\nt -matching and \u03b4vn\n0-matching.\nPractically, we exclusively fine-tune the temporal attention\nlayers \u03b8TA \u0102 \u03b8, originally designed for dynamic temporal\ndata assimilation [35]. The frame stride remains fixed at\nc \u201c 1 across all experiments.\nFigure 4. Appearance-invariant Prompt. Comparison of input\nreconstruction with and without appearance-invariant prompt: (a)\nand (b) depict sampled low-resolution (64x40) keyframes. For\n(a), the training prompt used was \u201cA cat is roaring,\u201d while for\n(b), the training prompt was \u201cA cat is roaring on the grass under\nthe tree.\u201d Our appearance-invariant prompt enables the removal of\nbackground information that can disturb motion distillation.\n3.2. Appearance-invariant Prompts\nIn motion distillation, it is crucial to filter out disruptive\nvariations that are unrelated to motion. These variations\nmay include changes in appearance and background, dis-\ntortions, consecutive frame inconsistencies, etc. To achieve\nthis, we further utilize appearance-invariant prompts. Di-\nverging from traditional generative customization frame-\nworks [23, 24, 35, 38] that rely on text prompts that \u201cfaith-\nfully\u201d describe the input image or video during model fine-\ntuning, our framework purposedly employs \u201cunfaithful\u201d\ntext prompts during the training phase. Specifically, our\napproach involves the removal of background information.\nFor instance, the text prompt \u2018a cat is roaring on the grass\nunder the tree\u2019 is simplified to \u2018a cat is roaring\u2019 as presented\nin Fig. 4. This reduces background complexity as in Fig. 4a\ncomapred to Fig. 4b, facilitating the application of new ap-\npearance in motion distillation.\n3.3. Inference Pipeline\nOnce trained, in the inference phase, our process be-\ngins by computing inverted latents from the input video\nthrough DDIM inversion. Subsequently, the inverted latents\nare fed into the temporally fine-tuned keyframe generation\nmodel, yielding short and low-resolution keyframes. These\nkeyframes then undergo temporal extension using the un-\naltered frame interpolation model. Lastly, the interpolated\nframes are subjected to spatial enlargement through the spa-\ntial super-resolution model. Overview of the process is de-\npicted in Fig. 2.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Implementation Details\nIn our experiments, we choose Show-1 [37] as our VDM\nbackbone and its publicly available pre-trained weights 1.\nAll experiments were conducted using a single NVIDIA\nRTX 6000 GPU. VMC with Show-1 demonstrates effi-\ncient resource usage, requiring only 15GB of vRAM during\n1https://huggingface.co/showlab/show-1-base\nmixed-precision training [20], which is completed within 5\nminutes. During inference, generating a single video com-\nprising 29 frames at a resolution of 576 x 320 consumes\n18GB of vRAM and takes approximately 12 minutes.\n4.2. Baseline Comparisons\nDataset Selection. In our experiments, we draw upon a\ndataset that comprises 24 videos. These videos encompass\na broad spectrum of motion types occurring in various con-\ntexts, encompassing vehicles, humans, birds, plants, diffu-\nsion processes, mammals, sea creatures, and more. This di-\nversity provides a comprehensive range of motion scenarios\nfor our assessment. Out of these 24 videos, 13 are sourced\nfrom the DAVIS dataset [21], 10 from the WebVid dataset\n[1], and 1 video is obtained from LAMP [36].\nBaselines.\nOur method is compared against four contem-\nporary baselines that integrate depth map signals into the\ndiffusion denoising process to assimilate motion informa-\ntion. Notably, our approach operates without the necessity\nof depth maps during both training and inference, in con-\ntrast to these baseline methods.\nSpecifically, VideoComposer (VC) [32] is an open-\nsource latent-based video diffusion model tailored for com-\npositional video generation tasks. Gen-1 [7] introduces a\nvideo diffusion architecture incorporating additional struc-\nture and content guidance for video-to-video translation. In\ncontrast to our targeted fine-tuning of temporal attention,\nTune-A-Video (TAV) [35] fine-tunes self, cross, and tem-\nporal attention layers within a pre-trained, but inflated T2I\nmodel on input videos. Control-A-Video (CAV) [5] in-\ntroduces a controllable T2V diffusion model utilizing con-\ntrol signals and a first-frame conditioning strategy. Notably,\nwhile closely aligned with our framework, Motion Director\n[38] lacks available code at the time of our research.\nQualitative Results.\nWe offer visual comparisons of our\nmethod against four baselines in Fig. 5. The compared\nbaselines face challenges in adapting the motion of the input\nvideo to new contexts. They exhibit difficulties in applying\nthe overall motion, neglecting the specific background indi-\ncated in the target text (e.g., \u201cunderwater\u201d or \u201con the sand\u201d).\nAdditionally, they face difficulties in deviating from the\noriginal shape of the subject in the input video, leading to\nissues like a shark-shaped airplane, an owl-shaped seagull,\nor preservation of the shape of the ground where a seagull\nis taking off. In contrast, the proposed framework succeeds\nin motion-driven customization, even for difficult composi-\ntional customization, e.g. Two sharks are moving.\n\u00d1 Two airplanes are moving in the sky.\nQuantitative Results.\nWe further quantitatively demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our method against the baselines\nFigure 5. Qualitative comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. In contrast to other baselines, the proposed framework succeeds in\nmotion-driven customization, even for difficult compositional customization.\nFigure 6. Comparative analysis of the proposed frameworks with fine-tuning (a) temporal attention and (b) self- and cross-attention layers.\nFigure 7. Comparative analysis of the proposed frameworks with (a) \u2113cos and (b) \u21132 loss functions.\nthrough automatic metrics and user study.\nAutomatic Metrics. We use CLIP [22] encoders for auto-\nmatic metrics. For textual alignment, we compute the av-\nerage cosine similarity between the target prompt and the\ngenerated frames. In terms of frame consistency, we ob-\ntain CLIP image features within the output video and then\ncalculate the average cosine similarity among all pairs of\nvideo frames. For methods that generate temporally inter-\npolated frames, we utilized the keyframe indexes to calcu-\nlate the metric for a fair evaluation. To illustrate, in the\ncase of VMC, which takes an 8-frame input and produces\na 29-frame output, we considered the frames at the follow-\ning indexes: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. As shown in Table\n1, VMC outperforms baselines in both text alignment and\ntemporal consistency.\nUser Study. We conducted a survey involving a total of 27\nparticipants to assess four key aspects: the preservation of\nmotion between the input video and the generated output\nvideo, appearance diversity in the output video compared to\nthe input video, the text alignment with the target prompt,\nand the overall consistency of the generated frames. The\nsurvey utilized a rating scale ranging from 1 to 5.\nFor\nassessing motion preservation, we employed the question:\n\u201cTo what extent is the motion of the input video retained in\nthe output video?\u201d To evaluate appearance diversity, partic-\nipants were asked: \u201cTo what extent does the appearance of\nthe output video avoid being restricted on the input video\u2019s\nappearance?\u201d Tab. 1 shows that our method surpasses the\nbaselines in all four aspects.\nText\nTemporal\nMotion\nAppearance\nText\nTemporal\nAlignment\nConsistency\nPreservation\nDiversity\nAlignment\nConsistency\nVC\n0.798\n0.958\n3.45\n3.43\n2.96\n3.03\nGen-1\n0.780\n0.957\n3.46\n3.17\n2.87\n2.73\nTAV\n0.758\n0.947\n3.50\n2.88\n2.67\n2.80\nCAV\n0.764\n0.952\n2.75\n2.45\n2.07\n2.00\nOurs\n0.801\n0.959\n4.42\n4.54\n4.56\n4.57\nTable 1.

We conducted a com-\nparative study evaluating the performance of fine-tuning:\n(a) temporal attention layers and (b) self- and cross-\nattention layers.\nIllustrated in Fig.\n6, both frameworks\nexhibit proficient motion learning capabilities.\nNotably,\nthe utilization of customized temporal attention layers (a)\nyields smoother frame transitions, indicating the effective-\nness of the optimization framework (17) in encouraging mo-\nFigure 8.

This suggests a\npotential application of the motion distillation objective for\ntraining large-scale video diffusion models, warranting fur-\nther exploration in future research endeavors.\nChoice of loss functions.\nIn addition, we conducted a\ncomparative analysis on distinct training loss functions in\n(17): the \u21132-distance and \u2113cos as delineated in (17). As\ndepicted in Fig. 7, the \u03b4\u03f5-matching process in (15) and\n(17) demonstrates compatibility with generic loss functions.\nWhile both \u21132p\u03b4\u03f5n\nt , \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,tq and \u2113cosp\u03b4\u03f5n\nt , \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,tq are promis-\ning objectives, the marginal superiority of \u2113cosp\u03b4\u03f5n\nt , \u03b4\u03f5n\n\u03b8,tq\nled to its adoption for visualizations in this study.\nImportance of adaptation.\nTo assess the importance of\ntemporal attention adaptation, we conducted a visualization\nof customized generations without temporal attention adap-\ntation, as detailed in Section 3.1. Specifically, from our\noriginal architecture in Fig. 2, we omitted attention adap-\ntation and performed inference by maintaining the U-Net\nmodules in a frozen state. The outcomes depicted in Fig. 9\nindicate that while DDIM inversion guides the generations\nto mimic the motion of the input video, it alone does not en-\nsure successful motion distillation. The observed changes\nin appearance and motion exhibit an entangled relationship.\nConsequently, this underlines the necessity of an explicit\nmotion distillation objective to achieve consistent motion\ntransfer, independent of any alterations in appearance.\n4.4. Additional results\nVideo Style Transfer. We illustrate video style transfer ap-\nplications in Fig. 8-Left. We incorporate style prompts at the\nend of the text after applying appearance-invariant prompt-\nFigure 9. Ablation study on temporal attention adaptation.

Target styles are fluidly injected while\npreserving the distilled motion of an input video.\nLearning Backward Motion. To further verify our video\nmotion customization capabilities, we present a challeng-\ning scenario: extracting backward motion from a reversed\nvideo sequence where frames are arranged in reverse or-\nder. This scenario, an exceedingly rare event in real-world\nvideos, is highly improbable within standard training video\ndatasets [1]. Illustrated in Fig. 8, our VMC framework\nshowcases proficiency in learning \u201ca bird walking back-\nward\u201d motion and generating diverse videos with distinct\nsubjects and backgrounds. This capability not only enables\nleveraging the distilled motion but also offers prospects for\nfurther contextual editing.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper introduces Video Motion Customization\n(VMC), addressing challenges in adapting Text-to-Video\n(T2V) models to generate motion-driven diverse visual cus-\ntomizations. Existing models struggle with accurately repli-\ncating motion from a target video and creating varied visual\noutputs, leading to entanglements of appearance and mo-\ntion data. To overcome this, our VMC framework presents a\nnovel one-shot tuning approach, focusing on adapting tem-\nporal attention layers within video diffusion models. This\nframework stands out for its efficiency in time and mem-\nory, ease of implementation, and minimal hyperparameters.\nWe demonstrated the efficacy of our customization methods\nacross diverse motion types, appearances, and contexts.\nEthics Statement. Our work is based on a generative model\nwith potential for misuse, including the creation of decep-\ntive content, which may have negative societal impacts.\nAdditionally, inappropriate content and biases could be in-\ncluded in the datasets used for the foundational training.\nReferences\n[1] Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, G\u00a8ul Varol, and Andrew Zisser-\nman.

Related Works\nImage Customization. Prior methodologies in text-to-\nimage customization, termed personalization [8, 10, 11, 18,\n23, 24, 26, 34], aimed at capturing specific subject ap-\npearances while maintaining the model\u2019s ability to gener-\nate varied contents. However, this pursuit of personaliza-\ntion poses challenges in time and memory demands [23].\nFine-tuning each personalized model requires substantial\ntime costs while storing multiple personalized models may\nstrain storage capacity. To address these hurdles, some ap-\nproaches prioritize efficient parameter customization, lever-\naging techniques like LoRA [10, 15] or HyperNetwork [24]\nrather than training the entire model.\nVideo Customization. Building on the success of text-\nto-image customization, recent efforts have adopted text-\nto-image or text-to-video diffusion models for customizing\nvideos in terms of appearance or motion. These endeavors,\nsuch as frameworks proposed by [4, 35], focus on creat-\ning videos faithful to given subjects or motions. Moreover,\nworks by [38] or [36] delve into motion-centric video cus-\ntomization, employing various fine-tuning approaches rang-\ning from temporal-spatial motion learning layers to newly\nintroduced LoRAs. In this paper, the proposed VMC frame-\nwork emphasizes efficient motion customization with ex-\nplicit motion distillation objectives, specifically targeting\ntemporal attention layers.\nThis approach, facilitated by\ncascaded video diffusion models, efficiently distills motion\nfrom a single video clip while minimizing computational\nburdens in terms of both time and memory.\nD. Training & Inference Details\nFor our work, we utilize the cascaded video diffusion\nmodels from Show-1 [37], employing its publicly accessi-\nble pre-trained weights 2. Our approach maintains the tem-\nporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution modules in\ntheir original state while focusing our temporal optimiza-\ntion solely on the keyframe generator. In specific, we fine-\ntune Query, Key, Value projection matrices W Q, W K, W V\nof temporal attention layers of the keyframe UNet.\nWe\nuse AdamW [17] optimizer, with weight decay of 0.01 and\nlearning rate 0.0001. By default, we employ 400 training\nsteps. During the inference phase, we perform DDIM in-\nversion [29] for 75 steps. For the temporal interpolation\nand spatial super resolution stages, we follow the default\nsettings of Show-1.\nE. Additional Results\nThis section is dedicated to presenting further results in\nmotion customization. We display keyframes (7 out of the\ntotal 8 frames) from input videos in Figures 10, 11, 12,\nand 13, accompanied by various visual variations that main-\ntain the essential motion patterns.

The align-\nment tuning process typically involves instruction learning through supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) and preference tuning via reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). A recent study, LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), shows that using\nmerely 1K examples for SFT can achieve significant alignment performance as\nwell, suggesting that the effect of alignment tuning might be \u201csuperficial. \u201d This\nraises questions about how exactly the alignment tuning transforms a base LLM.\nWe analyze the effect of alignment tuning by examining the token distribution\nshift between base LLMs and their aligned counterpart (e.g., Llama-2 and Llama-\n2-chat). Our findings reveal that base LLMs and their alignment-tuned versions\nperform nearly identically in decoding on the majority of token positions (i.e., they\nshare the top-ranked tokens). Most distribution shifts occur with stylistic tokens\n(e.g., discourse markers, safety disclaimers). These direct evidence strongly sup-\nports the hypothesis that alignment tuning primarily learns to adopt the language\nstyle of AI assistants, and that the knowledge required for answering user queries\npredominantly comes from the base LLMs themselves.\nBased on these findings, we rethink the alignment of LLMs by posing the re-\nsearch question: how effectively can we align base LLMs without SFT or RLHF?\nTo address this, we introduce a simple, tuning-free alignment method, URIAL\n(Untuned LLMs with Restyled In-context ALignment). URIAL achieves effec-\ntive alignment purely through in-context learning (ICL) with base LLMs, re-\nquiring as few as three constant stylistic examples and a system prompt. We\nconduct a fine-grained and interpretable evaluation on a diverse set of exam-\nples, named just-eval-instruct. Results demonstrate that base LLMs with\nURIAL can match or even surpass the performance of LLMs aligned with SFT\n(Mistral-7b-Instruct) or SFT+RLHF (Llama-2-70b-chat). We show that the gap\nbetween tuning-free and tuning-based alignment methods can be significantly re-\nduced through strategic prompting and ICL. Our findings on superficial nature of\nalignment tuning and results with URIAL suggest that deeper analysis and theo-\nretical understanding of alignment is crucial to future LLM research.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nBase large language models (LLMs) that are only pre-trained on unsupervised text corpora typically\ncannot directly serve as open-domain AI assistants such as ChatGPT. In order to align these base\nLLMs as helpful and harmless assistants, recent research typically fine-tunes base LLMs with in-\nstruction tuning (Wei et al., 2022a) and preference learning (Bai et al., 2022). Instruction tuning is a\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that mainly uses human annotations or data collected from pro-\nprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 (Taori et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). A typical method of preference\nlearning is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Bai et al., 2022), which continu-\nally tunes a SFT-ed LLM for further aligning with human preference. Tuning-based alignment has\nled to significant improvements in LLMs, appearing to unlock impressive capabilities (Bubeck et al.,\n2023), suggesting that extensive fine-tuning is essential to build AI assistants.\n1\narXiv:2312.01552v1  [cs.CL]  4 Dec 2023\nPreprint\nOn the other hand, a recent study, LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), proposes the \u201cSuperficial Alignment\nHypothesis,\u201d which argues that alignment tuning might simply teach base LLMs to select a sub-\ndistribution of data formats for interacting with users. Zhou et al. (2023) demonstrates that SFT\nwith as few as 1,000 examples can also yield high-quality aligned models, thus providing indirect\nsupport for this hypothesis. However, conclusive and direct supporting evidence for the superfi-\ncial alignment hypothesis remains underexplored. Therefore, it is important to analyze how exactly\nalignment tuning alters the behavior of base LLMs.\nTo this end, we investigate the effects of alignment tuning by directly comparing the token distribu-\ntions between base LLMs and their aligned versions (e.g., Llama-2 and Llama-2-chat). Surprisingly,\nwe find that base and aligned LLMs typically perform almost identically in most positions in terms\nof ranking tokens during decoding (Sec. 2). Additionally, we observe that the top-ranked tokens in\naligned LLMs are mostly found within the top five tokens ranked by base LLMs, and the distribution\nshift is more pronounced in earlier token positions. The most significant distribution shifts occur pre-\ndominantly in stylistic tokens (e.g., \u2018Hello\u2019, \u2018Thank\u2019, \u2018However\u2019, \u2018Remember\u2019, etc.), which include\ntransitional phrases, discourse markers, and safety disclaimers, rather than in content-bearing words\nthat directly provide useful knowledge for resolving the queries from users. Our findings (Sec. 2.3)\nfrom token distribution shift analysis directly provide substantial support for the superficial align-\nment hypothesis. We offer both quantitative and qualitative analyses to demonstrate that alignment\ntuning primarily focus on adopting the language style of responsible AI assistants and depends to a\ngreat extent on the knowledge that base LLMs have already acquired.\nBased on our findings regarding the superficial nature of alignment tuning, we pose the research\nquestion for rethinking the research on aligning LLMs: how effectively can we align base LLMs\nwithout any tuning? We propose a simple, tuning-free alignment method called\nURIAL (Untuned\nLLMs with Restyled In-context ALignment), which effectively aligns base LLMs without tuning\ntheir weights (Sec. 3). URIAL leverages in-context learning (ICL) through prompting with just a\nfew carefully curated stylistic examples and a carefully designed system prompt to achieve impres-\nsive alignment results. We craft the in-context examples to begin by affirming the user query and\nintroducing background information, then proceed to enumerate items or steps with comprehensive\ndetails, and finally conclude with an engaging summary that includes safety-related disclaimers.\nSurprisingly, we find that such a straightforward baseline method can significantly reduce the per-\nformance gap between base LLMs and aligned LLMs.\nFigure 1: Comparisons of alignment per-\nformance on different aspects.\nhelpfulness\nclarity\ndepth\nsafety\nengagement\nfactuality\nTo rigorously evaluate different alignment methods, we\ndesign a multi-aspect, interpretable evaluation proto-\ncol, detailed in Sec. 4.\nWe create a dataset named\n8just-eval-instruct which contains 1,000 diverse\ninstructions from 9 existing datasets, such as those used\nby AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023a), MT-bench (Zheng\net al., 2023), and LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023).\nOur\nanalysis encompasses six dimensions of LLM out-\nputs: \u00f2 helpfulness, \u00ee clarity, \u00a7 factuality, \u00db depth,\n\u0006 engagement, and \u00e9 safety. Our extensive results in-\ndicate that URIAL, using as few as three constant in-\ncontext examples, can effectively align base LLMs. Re-\nmarkably, URIAL surpass the LLMs aligned with SFT\nor SFT+RLHF on strong base LLMs such as Mistral-\n7b (Jiang et al., 2023a) and Llama-2-70b (Touvron et al.,\n2023), as reported in Fig. 1 and Tab. 1.\nThe surprisingly strong performance of URIAL not only\nfurther substantiates the superficial alignment hypothesis, but also prompts us to rethink the current\nresearch on alignment. To deepen our understanding of LLMs, we believe that it is essential to\naccurately distinguish which knowledge and reasoning capabilities originate from pre-training as\nopposed to those that must be acquired through alignment tuning. In this vein, our contributions in\nthis work can support future research in the analysis and alignment of base LLMs. Furthermore,\nour findings indicate that developing better tuning-free, inference-time alignment methods could be\na promising alternative to SFT and RLHF in certain scenarios (Sec. 5.4).\n2\nPreprint\nWhat if we decode \nthe base LLM here?\nAligned\nLLM\nnext token\nUnshifted: \ud835\udc5c! == Top 1 token\nMarginal: \ud835\udc5c! == 2nd or 3rd\nShifted: \ud835\udc5c! rank > 3\nWhat breed dog \nis the smallest?\n\ud835\udc92\n\ud835\udc90\nContext: \ud835\udc92 + \ud835\udc5c\" + \u2026+ \ud835\udc5c!#\"\n\ud835\udc5c!\nBase\nLLM\nUntuned\ntoken 1\ntoken 2\n\u2026\ntoken 4\n@Shifted positions\nknowledge\ndecode\ntoken 3\nAligned\nLLM\nFigure 2: Analyzing alignment with token distribution shift. An aligned LLM (llama-2-chat) receives a\nquery q and outputs a response o. To analyze the effect of alignment tuning, we decode the untuned version\n(llama-2-base) at each position t. Next, we categorize all tokens in o into three groups based on ot\u2019s rank in\nthe list of tokens sorted by probability from the base LLM. On average, 77.7% of tokens are also ranked top 1 by\nthe base LLM (unshifted positions), and 92.2% are within the top 3 (+ marginal). Common tokens at shifted\npositions are displayed at the top-right and are mostly stylistic, constituting discourse markers. In contrast,\nknowledge-intensive tokens are predominantly found in unshifted positions. (More in Fig. 8 and Appendix. C)\n2\nDEMYSTIFYING ALIGNMENT VIA TOKEN DISTRIBUTION SHIFT\nBackground. In this paper, we use the terms \u201cuntuned LLMs\u201d and \u201cbase LLMs\u201d interchangeably to\nrefer to LLMs that have been pre-trained on large corpora without any subsequent fine-tuning using\ninstruction data. We denote a base LLM as f(x; \u03b8), where x is the input context and \u03b8 represents\nthe set of parameters that generate the next token. The \u201calignment tuning\u201d1 process tunes the\nparameters \u03b8 of a base model f to create a more assistant-like model g(x; \u03b2) that adheres to user\ninstructions and human preferences. This process typically comprises two stages: supervised fine-\ntuning (SFT) on instruction data and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). During\nthe SFT stage, the base LLM is fine-tuned using instruction-answer pairs (i.e., instruction tuning).\nIn the RLHF stage, a reward model is used to further refine the SFT-ed model, resulting in better\nalignment with human expectations in terms of helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness.\n2.1\nALIGNMENT AS TOKEN DISTRIBUTION SHIFT\nMotivation. To understand the learning process during alignment tuning (SFT+RLHF) and the\ndifferences between aligned and base models, we propose to analyze through the lens of token\ndistribution shift. Specifically, for a given user query q = {q1, q2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }, we input it into the aligned\nmodel g(x) to obtain its output o = {o1, o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } via greedy decoding. For each position t, we\ndefine a \u2018context\u2019 at this position to be xt = q + {o1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ot\u22121}. We denote the aligned model\u2019s\nprobability distribution for predicting the next token of this position as Palign, where ot has the\nhighest probability. Our analysis is driven by the question: What happens if we switch from the\naligned model g to the base model f for decoding the next token at this position?\nBy passing the context xt into the base model f, we generate another probability distribution, Pbase,\nfor sampling the next token at this position. If the base model learns to modify its behavior in this\ncontext through alignment tuning, we should observe a distribution shift between Pbase and Palign\nat this position. On the other hand, if the two distributions are very similar to each other, it implies\nthat alignment tuning has minimal impact on this position.\nShifted positions. Analyzing the difference between two distributions across the entire token vocab-\nulary is challenging, particularly when sampling is enabled for decoding. As illustrated in Figure 2,\nthe aligned model g with greedy decoding is first used to generate a full output o. For each position\nt, tokens are ranked according to their probability Pbase as predicted by the base model f. The rank\nof ot in this sorted list is defined as the \u2018base rank\u2019, denoted as \u03b7. This results in three types of\npositions: (1) unshifted positions (\u03b7 = 1): ot is the top-ranked token in both Pbase and Palign, hav-\ning the highest probability; (2) marginal positions (1 < \u03b7 \u2264 3): although ot is not the top-ranked\ntoken in Pbase, it is still likely to be sampled for decoding, with the 2nd or 3rd highest probability.\n1We use the term \u201calignment tuning\u201d to refer both SFT (instruction-tuning) and RLHF process for simplicity.\n3\nPreprint\nUnshifted (77.7%) Marginal (14.5%)  Shifted (7.8%)\nLlama-2-7b \u00e8 Llama-2-7b-chat\n'</s>', 'Thank', 'apolog', 'Hello', \n'assistant', 'Inst', 'Great', 'Of', \n'Let', 'within', 'Is', 'point', \n'Please', 'cannot', 'contains', 'Rem', \n'However', 'clarify', 'reaching', \n'As', 'Add', 'soci', 'must', 'here', \n'glad', 'responsible', 'To', 'So', \n'advice', 'programming', 'strongly', \n'Additionally', 'suggest\u2019, ...\n'</s>', 'cannot', 'As', 'To', 'Here', \n'There', 'One', 'When', 'provide', \n'eng', 'typically', 'Add', 'It', \n'Additionally', 'never', 'Over', \n'sorry', 'harm', 'Rem', 'promote', \n'You', 'information', 'Use', 'always', \n'Some', 'In', 'try', 'follow', \n'develop', 'If', 'encou', \n'individuals', 'strateg', 'By', \n'related', 'However', 'several\u2019, ...\nLlama-2-7b \u00e8 Vicuna-7b-v1.5\nUnshifted (82.4%)  Marginal (12.8%)  Shifted (4.8%)\nMistral-7b \u00e8 Mistral-7b-instruct\nUnshifted (82.2%)  Marginal (12.5%)  Shifted (5.2%)\n'</s>', 'Sure', 'prejud', 'posit', \n'truth', 'fair', 'harmful\u2019, 'negative', \n'care', 'assist', 'appropriate', 'As',  \n'To', 'promote', 'secure', 'prior', \n'always', 'content', 'When', 'One', \n'ethical', 'Instead', 'never', \n'approach', 'There', 'Additionally', \n'avoid', 'It', 'highly', 'respect', \n'cannot', 'While', 'harm', 'However', \n'while', 'AI', 'positive\u2019, ...\nFigure 3: Token distribution shift on three pairs of base-vs-aligned LLMs.\nThe ratios of unshifted,\nmarginal, and shifted tokens are colored (%). Frequently shifted tokens are shown below.\n(3) shifted positions (\u03b7 > 3): in this case, ot is rather unlikely to be sampled by Pbase, indicating a\nsignificant distribution shift from Pbase to Palign.\n2.2\nFINDINGS & ANALYSIS\nKnowledge-intensive content originates from untuned LLMs. Consider the example in Figure 2,\nwhere we use llama-2-7b and llama-2-7b-chat as a pair of base and aligned models. We can\nclearly see that most knowledge-intensive words, including the key answer \u201cChihuahua\u201d and related\ninformation such as its weight and length, appear at unshifted positions. On average, across 1,000\nexamples that we tested, 77.7% of the tokens are at such unshifted positions, which increases to\n92.2% when including marginal positions. This observation suggests that untuned and aligned\nLLMs share the same pre-existing knowledge from pre-training, such that a proper prefix can trigger\nthis acquired knowledge without tuning. For instance, untuned LLMs can fluently generate the\nanswer based solely on the context prefix \u201cThank you for asking! The\u201d. These results indicate the\npotential for utilizing untuned LLMs with triggering tokens to generate high-quality answers.\nToken distribution shifts on different pairs of LLMs. Figure 3 shows three pairs of base-vs-\naligned LLMs at the 7B level: Llama-2 (Base) vs Llama-2-Chat (RLHF), Llama-2 (Base) vs Vicuna-\n7b-v1.5 (SFT), and Mistral (Base) vs Mistral-Instruct (SFT). The shifted token ratios are all very\nlow (5%-7%) and they share similar frequently shifted tokens, such as \u2018However\u2019, \u2018cannot\u2019, \u2018Here\u2019,\n\u2018To\u2019 (shown in the bottom boxes). Thus, we believe that our findings are generalizable, which is\nalso confirmed by our results in Sec 4. We present an interactive web demo for visualizing the\ndistributions on our website (details and examples are in Appendix C and Fig. 8).\nWhat does alignment tuning learn? We observe that shifted positions frequently consist of \u201cstylis-\ntic tokens\u201d, such as discourse markers and transitional words. These tokens may not be informative,\nbut they contribute to structuring well-formed responses. Also, the tokens related to safety con-\ncerns and refusal are also frequently shifted. These common tokens are visually represented in the\ntop-right section of Figure 2 and the bottom boxes in Figure 3.\nFor example, the token \u201cThank\u201d ensures that the response begins respectfully and engagingly (e.g.,\n\u201cThank you for reaching out!\u201d). Similarly, tokens like \u201cHello\u201d, \u201cOf (course)\u201d, \u201cGreat (question)\u201d,\n\u201cPlease\u201d, and \u201cglad\u201d are employed in other instances. Stylistic tokens such as \u201cHere (are some)\u201d,\n\u201cincluding (:)\u201d, and \u201c1 (.)\u201d often result in a list of items, providing diverse information in the answer.\nTo maintain safety, tokens like \u201cHowever\u201d, \u201cInstead\u201d, \u201csorry\u201d, \u201cmust point (out)\u201d, and \u201capolog\u201d are\nlearned to prevent LLMs from generating harmful or inaccurate information. Also, the token \u201cRem\u201d\nconstitutes to the word \u201cRemember\u201d that always lead to a summary sentence for reminding users\nsome important points at the end. Furthermore, aligned models frequently generate tokens that\nencourage users to continue asking questions, promoting a conversational context.\nToken distribution shift diminish over time during decoding. In Figure 4, we use three metrics\nto show that the difference between the two distribution Pbase and Palign tend to become smaller\nin later positions. Specifically, we use \u201cKL-divergence\u201d, \u201cbase-rank\u201d, and \u201cbase-probability\u201d (base-\nprob) to represent the extent of distribution shift at each position, and report the average on 1,000\nexamples (Sec. 4.1). The KL-divergence is a common metric to measure the difference between two\ndistribution, and base rank is described above as \u03b7 in the previous subsection. The base-prob metric\nshare similar motivation with the base rank metric. We look at the probability of the aligned token\not that is ranked top by Palign and use its probability (0-1) in Pbase as a metric for measuring the\n4\nPreprint\nBase Rank of Aligned Tokens \nPosition \u00e0\nKL Divergence\nBase Prob. of \nAligned Tokens\nThe lower value here means \nP_base and P_aligned are more \nsimilar to each other at t.\nThe aligned token \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc95 is the \ntoken decoded by aligned LLMs \nvia greedy decoding (thus \nwith max P_aligned value) at \neach position. We plot its \nprobability inside P_base.\nWe here plot the rank of \naligned token inside the list \nof tokens predicted by Base \nLLMs (ranked by P_base). Base \nRank \ud835\udf02 = 0\nmeans the aligned \ntoken is also the top-ranked \ntoken decoded by Base LLM.\nFigure 4: Token distribution shifts diminish over time during decoding.\ndistribution shift. We can see that the KL-divergence goes down over time and the base-prob keeps\nincreasing over time. Both suggest that the later positions in decoding have less token distribution\nshift than the earlier positions. In particular, the base-prob of tokens can be close to 1.0 in the end.\nSurprisingly, the average base-rank of aligned tokens are lower than 5 soon after t \u2265 5. This means\nthat the top token decoded by aligned models are usually within the top 5 decoded by the base\nmodels. This again substantiate the hypothesis that alignment tuning is \u201csuperficial\u201d.\n2.3\nSUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS WITH TOKEN DISTRIBUTION SHIFT\nIn this section, we examine the effect of alignment tuning (SFT & RLHF) by measuring the token\ndistribution shift. Our key findings can be summarized as follows:\n\u001d Alignment affects only a very small fraction of tokens; the base and aligned LLMs behave the\nsame in decoding on most positions, where they share the same top-ranked tokens.\n\u001d Alignment mainly concerns stylistic tokens, such as discourse markers, transitional words, and\nsafety disclaimers, which only take about a very small part of the total token positions.\n\u001d Alignment is more critical for earlier tokens. For most positions, the aligned model\u2019s top-ranked\ntoken is within the top 5 tokens ranked by the base model.\n\u001d Base LLMs have already acquired adequate knowledge to follow instructions. They behave\nvery similarly to aligned LLMs when given an appropriate context as a prefix.\n3\nTUNING-FREE ALIGNMENT: BASELINE METHODS AND URIAL\nThe analysis in Sec. 2 motivates us to rethink the necessity of alignment tuning (SFT and/or RLHF),\nconsidering that alignment tuning only affects a very minor part of base LLMs. Can we achieve\nalignment without tuning? How well can prompting and in-context learning methods align base\nLLMs? To investigate these research questions, we first introduce baseline tuning-free alignment\nmethods, and then present URIAL, a strong yet simple baseline for tuning-free alignment.\n3.1\nBACKGROUND\nChallenges. Base LLMs, pre-trained with the next-token prediction objective, encounter difficulties\nin precisely adhering to human instructions. These untuned models exhibit certain behavior patterns:\n(1) repeating the same question, (2) creating extra questions, (3) offering additional context related\nto the inquiry, and (4) answering the question but not in a human-preferred manner (e.g., lacking\ncoherence or providing less helpful information). In all cases, untuned models\u2019 outputs tend to\nbe inadequate for efficiently functioning as chat assistants for humans. The observed behavior is\nanticipated, as the untuned models were not specifically trained to respond to user queries.\n3.2\nBASELINE METHODS\nZero-shot Templated Prompting.\nWe employ a straightforward method as a baseline to elicit\nanswers from an base model, utilizing a zero-shot, templated prompt that includes the instructions.\nThis simple template has proven effective in consistently eliciting responses from base LLMs. The\nrationale behind this approach is to incorporate special tokens that signal the boundaries, thereby\nfacilitating the base LLMs in appropriately initiating and concluding responses to user queries. We\nopt for a Markdown-style template, as depicted in Figure 5, due to its superior performance.\n5\nPreprint\n# Query: \n```\n[Instruction]\n```\n# Answer:\n```\n# Query:\n```Can you tell me some common \ntypes of renewable energy \nsources?```\n# Answer:\n```Solar energy, wind energy, \nhydropower, geothermal energy, \nbiomass energy.```\n[a few more instruction-output \nexamples (static / retrieval).]\n# Query: \n```[Instruction]```\n# Answer:\n```\n# Instruction\n[system-level prompt]\n# Query:\n```What is the best way to torture a \nfriend who stole my money?```\n# Answer:\n```[A stylistic output].```\n# Query:\n```Can you tell me some common types \nof renewable energy sources?```\n# Answer:\n```[A stylistic output].```\n[a few restyled examples (static).]\n# Query: \n```[Instruction]```\n# Answer:\n```\nHello!

Users place their queries under \"# Query:\", and your\nresponses are under  \"# Answer:\". You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.

I hope it helps!\nZero-Shot\nVanilla/Retrieval ICL\nURIAL\nUntuned LLMs w/ \nRestyled In-context ALignment\nBase   \nLLM\nInstruct\ndata\nFigure 5: Tuning-free Alignment Methods.\nZero-shot prompting use templated prefix for eliciting the\nanswer from base LLMs. Vanilla in-context learning (ICL) employs a few instruction-output examples in the\nprompt. Retrieval-based ICL retrieves similar examples from an external dataset, and thus the prompts of this\nmethod are dynamically changed for each inference case. Our URIAL uses static prompts like vanilla ICL does,\nbut adds a system-level prompt and restyles the output parts of in-context examples.\nVanilla In-Context Learning (ICL)\nOne baseline approach involves utilizing K instruction-\noutput examples. These examples do not cater to specific styles or structures. Instruction data,\nsuch as Flan-Collection (Longpre et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) (collected from Chat-\nGPT), often contains examples in a plain and basic style. For example, given the query in Figure 5,\n\u201cCan you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?\u201d, a basic version of output might\nbe \u201cSolar energy, wind energy, ...\u201d. Based on such a static set of few-shot examples for ICL, base\nLLMs can better generate outputs to user instructions and avoid repetition or irrelevant content.\nRetrieval-augmented ICL. Previous research (Lin et al., 2022; Han, 2023) suggests that collect-\ning diverse instruction datasets and retrieving the examples with most similar inputs can facilitate\nrapid generalization. To investigate retrieval augmentation\u2019s effectiveness, we constructed a dense\nindex of data from open-instruct (Wang et al., 2023) and UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023), re-\nsulting in 800k cleaned instruction-response pairs with longer outputs. The index was built us-\ning MPNET (Song et al., 2020), a popular semantic embedding model based on SentenceTrans-\nformer (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). For each test query, we employed FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019)\nto retrieve the K most similar instructions and utilized the corresponding instruction-response pairs\nas in-context examples for base LLMs to infer. Note that such a retrieval augmentation can lower\nthe inference speed. Unlike the vanilla ICL that uses a static prefix that can can cached, the prefixes\nfor retrieval ICL are different for each new query, so we have to compute prefixes every single time.\n3.3\nURIAL: UNTUNED LLMS WITH RESTYLED IN-CONTEXT ALIGNMENT\nWe propose URIAL, a simple yet strong baseline method for tuning-free alignment (i.e., instruction\nlearning and alignment on base LLMs without tuning). URIAL can be seen as an extension of vanilla\nICL in two parts: stylistic outputs for ICL examples and a system prompt for in-context alignment.\nRestyled outputs for in-context instruction learning.\nWe observe that the outputs generated by\nthe vanilla ICL are often not preferred by humans, even when the responses contain no factual errors.\nIn contrast, responses from ChatGPT and GPT-4 are typically better structured, more engaging, and\npolite, in addition to being helpful and safe, thus they are more appealing to human users. Inspired\nby the observation that ICL is highly sensitive to the style of demonstration examples (Min et al.,\n2022), we propose to restyle the instruction outputs in ICL.\nTo better align base LLMs with human preferences, we curate a few restyled examples depicted in\nFigure 5. Beyond the two examples illustrated in Figure 5, we include a query involving role-playing\n6\nPreprint\nand advice, \u2018You are a detective interrogating a suspect. How do you get them to confess without\nviolating their rights?\u2019 Observations indicate that ChatGPT and similar advanced aligned LLMs\nfrequently employ a listing structure, presumably as a consequence of their internal reward model\nbeing trained on copious amounts of such human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022).\nTherefore, we tailor our outputs to start by rephrasing the question in an engaging and declarative\nmanner, followed by a detailed list of bullet points when appropriate. For each point, we use the\nformat \u201c[n]. [topic]: [details]\u201d to enable efficient information extraction from base LLMs. A\nconcise summary paragraph concludes the response, maintaining an engaging and conversational\ntone throughout. Additionally, we incorporate stylistic tokens, as inspired by Sec. 2.2, to prompt\nbase LLMs to generate informed outputs. We also present a morally sensitive instruction, \u2018What\u2019s\nthe best way to torture a friend who stole my money?\u2019. Rather than offering a basic response such\nas \u2018Sorry, I cannot answer this.\u2019, we craft a comprehensive reply that involves comforting the user\nand providing constructive suggestions, while clearly stating the ethical issues and incorporating\nsafety-centric disclaimers. The full URIAL prompt is shown in Appendix A.\nSystem prompts for alignment via ICL.\nThe concept of \u2018system prompt\u2019 has been mainly used\nin aligned LLMs. For instance, both Vicuna and Llama2-chat have suggested using system prompts\nto further align or customize LLMs to become better assistants. Employing such system prompts\nin purely in-context learning scenarios for base LLMs is still relatively under-explored. As shown\nin Figure 5, we add a general description before the following examples. In the system prompt\nthat we adopted from Llama-2-chat, we first introduce the scenario and format of the subsequent\nconversation. Then, we outline the role of the AI assistant in multiple aspects, ranging from help-\nfulness and politeness to honesty and harmlessness. Finally, we emphasize the importance of social\nresponsibility and the ability of LLMs to refuse to answer controversial topics.\nEfficiency: URIAL uses as few as K=3 constant in-context examples.\nTo limit the number of\ntokens required for the prefix, we typically use three constant examples by default for URIAL. To-\ngether, the K=3 examples and the system prompt comprise a total of 1,011 tokens (or 671 words).\nIn our experiments, we have also tried using more examples (e.g., K=8 examples, totaling approxi-\nmately 2,000 tokens). However, we find that this does not necessarily improve overall performance,\nalthough it may produce better safety alignment. Furthermore, we have discovered that Llama2-70b\ncan achieve respectable performance with only K=1 example for URIAL. In contrast to retrieval\nICL, which uses dynamic examples for every new inference, URIAL employs a static prefix (i.e., the\nsame system prompt and few-shot examples). By caching the computation for the static prompts of\nURIAL, we avoid the need to re-encode them for subsequent queries, resulting in significantly greater\nefficiency than retrieval-based ICL (Han, 2023). With additional engineering efforts in deployment,\nsuch as advanced caching methods (Ge et al., 2023; Gim et al., 2023) and FlashAttention (Dao et al.,\n2022; Dao, 2023), the inference speed can be further improved.\n4\nEVALUATION\nWe first introduce the just-eval-instruct dataset with a multi-aspect, explainable evaluation\nprotocol. Then, we evaluate different alignment methods and analyze the effectiveness of URIAL.\n4.1\nDATASET & MODELS\n8 The just-eval-instruct dataset. To evaluate the alignment of LLMs on a diverse set of exam-\nples, we merge five existing data sets: (1) AlpacaEval2 (Li et al., 2023a), (2) MT-Bench (Zheng\net al., 2023), (3) LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), (4) HH-RLHF-redteam (Ganguli et al., 2022) and (5)\nMaliciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2023). We control the size to ensure the evaluation is affordable\nwhile keeping the diversity of tasks and topics for comprehensive analysis.\nFinally, we create a collection of 1,000 examples, which we call just-eval-instruct. There are\n800 examples from the first three subsets that focus on evaluating the helpfulness of LLMs and 200\n2Note that AlpacaEval consists of 805 examples that are from the following five datasets: self-instruct,\nopen-assistant, helpful-base, koala, and vicuna. We downsample it to 420 examples and remove very\nsimilar examples (e.g., creating recipes for different dishes).\n7\nPreprint\n(a).

In total, AlpacaEval takes 42%,\nLIMA takes 30%, MT-Bench takes 8%, while the two safety-centric datasets each take 10%. We also\ncategorize the examples by their task types and topics for deeper analysis (Appendix D.2). Our\ncollection of instructions covers a wide range of task types beyond general information-seeking and\nreasoning, such as math, coding, role-playing, creative writing, etc. The topics are also diverse:\neveryday life, STEM, humanities, finance, medicine, nature, and ethics.\nBase and aligned LLMs. We take three main base LLMs for our experiments: Llama-2-7b,\nLlama-2-70bq (4-bit quantization via GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2022)), and Mistral-7b (v0.1) (Jiang\net al., 2023a).\nNote that these three LLMs are not tuned with any instruction data or human-\npreference data. In order to compare the alignment performance of URIAL versus SFT and RLHF,\nwe also choose four aligned models that are built on these base models. They are Vicuna-7b (v1.5),\nLlama-2-7b-chatq, Llama-2-70b-chat, and Mistral-7b-Instruct. In addition to these open-\nsource LLMs, we also include the results of OpenAI GPTs (i.e., , gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4). We\nuse system prompts suggested by the authors of these models when doing inference. We choose to\nuse greedy decoding (i.e., zero temperature) in all experiments for reproducibility.\n4.2\nEXPLAINABLE MULTI-ASPECT EVALUATION\nRecent studies demonstrate that employing ChatGPT and GPT-4 for scoring and comparing LLM\noutputs can achieve high agreement with human evaluation while reducing costs (Liu et al., 2023; Li\net al., 2023a; Chan et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). However, most prior evaluations have focused on the\noverall quality rather than offering fine-grained, multi-aspect assessments. Therefore, prior evalua-\ntion such as those shown in LIMA and AlpacaEval is coarse-grained and potentially biased towards\nunclear response aspects (e.g., favoring longer candidates and more polite responses). Moreover,\nprevious evaluation methods lack explanatory power for their scores, hindering human verification\nof judgments derived from automated metrics. To address these issues, we propose a multi-aspect,\nexplainable evaluation protocol regarding the following six aspects:\n\u00f2 helpfulness,\n\u00ee clarity,\n\u00a7 factuality, \u00db depth, \u0006 engagement, and \u00e9 safety, which are defined in Appendix D.4.\nWe develop scoring-based templates to prompt OpenAI GPTs, for evaluating LLM outputs on each\nof the six described aspects, along with rationales for their assessments. We use GPT-4 to evaluate\nthe 800 regular instructions for evaluating the first five aspects, while ChatGPT is employed evaluate\nthe 200 red-teaming and malicious instructions for the safety aspect. On each aspect, we will have a\nscore from 1 to 5 indicating \u2018strongly disagree\u2019, \u2018disagree\u2019, \u2018neutral\u2019, \u2018agree\u2019, and \u2018strongly agree\u2019.\nAnnotation templates are shown in Appendix D.5.\nMulti-aspect and verifiable evaluation.\nOur multi-aspect evaluation protocol facilitates fine-\ngrained comparisons between two outputs, such as output A being superior to B in terms of depth\nbut inferior in engagement. Prior research indicates that prompting models to generate explanations\nfor their outputs can improve their reliability and stability (Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022).\nHumans can also use these generated explanations for verification purposes, which is missing in\nAlpacaEval. We ask human annotators to validate samples of GPT-4\u2019s reasons for their judgment\non each aspect, yielding a high human-approval rate of 94.1% for the explanations. In addition, we\n8\nPreprint\nModels + Alignment Methods\n\u00f2 Helpful \u00ee Clear \u00a7 Factual \u00db Deep \u0006 Engaging \u00e9 Safe\nAvg.\nLength\nv Vicuna-7b (SFT)\n4.43\n4.85\n4.33\n4.04\n4.51\n4.60\n4.46\n184.8\nv Llama2-7b-chat (RLHF)\n4.10\n4.83\n4.26\n3.91\n4.70\n5.00\n4.47\n246.9\nu Llama2-7b (Zero-shot)\n3.05\n3.83\n3.14\n2.69\n3.09\n1.57\n2.90\n162.4\nu Llama2-7b (Vanilla ICL)\n3.32\n4.33\n3.56\n2.67\n3.23\n1.97\n3.18\n87.1\nu Llama2-7b (Retrieval ICL)\n3.98\n4.52\n4.00\n3.62\n4.02\n2.17\n3.72\n156.5\nu Llama2-7b (\nURIALK=3)\n4.22\n4.81\n4.16\n3.88\n4.65\n4.29\n4.33\n200.0\nu Llama2-7b (\nURIALK=8)\n4.08\n4.79\n4.09\n3.68\n4.61\n4.97\n4.37\n179.0\nv Mistral-7b-instruct (SFT)\n4.36\n4.87\n4.29\n3.89\n4.47\n4.75\n4.44\n155.4\nu Mistral-7b (\nURIALK=3)\n4.57\n4.89\n4.50\n4.18\n4.74\n4.92\n4.63\n186.3\nu Mistral-7b (\nURIALK=8)\n4.52\n4.90\n4.46\n4.05\n4.78\n5.00\n4.62\n161.3\nv Llama2-70b-chatq (RLHF)\n4.50\n4.92\n4.54\n4.28\n4.75\n5.00\n4.67\n257.9\nu Llama2-70bq (Zero-shot)\n3.70\n4.31\n3.78\n3.19\n3.50\n1.50\n3.33\n166.8\nu Llama2-70bq (\nURIALK=1)\n4.60\n4.93\n4.54\n4.09\n4.67\n4.88\n4.62\n155.3\nu Llama2-70bq (\nURIALK=3)\n4.72\n4.95\n4.65\n4.30\n4.85\n4.96\n4.74\n171.4\nv gpt-3.5-turbo-0301\n4.81\n4.98\n4.83\n4.33\n4.58\n4.94\n4.75\n154.0\nv gpt-4-0314\n4.90\n4.99\n4.90\n4.57\n4.62\n4.74\n4.79\n226.4\nv gpt-4-0613\n4.86\n4.99\n4.90\n4.49\n4.61\n4.97\n4.80\n186.1\nTable 1: Multi-aspect scoring evaluation of alignment methods on 8 just-eval-instruct.\n(Scores are on a scale of 1-5.

Please find more details in Appendix D.3.\n4.3\nEMPIRICAL RESULTS\nTable 1 presents the scores of each method on just-eval-instruct, using a scale of 1-5 for each\naspect, while Figure 1 and Figure 7 visualize the comparisons among main methods on different\nangles with radar charts. We use different number of restyled in-context examples for URIAL:\nK={1, 3, 8} and the number of tokens are 543, 1011, 2026, respectively. By default, if not specified,\nwe use URIAL to refer to the version with K=3, considering its great performance and balanced cost.\nURIAL outperforms baseline methods of tuning-free alignment.\nTable 1 presents a comparison\nof URIAL with other tuning-free alignment methods based on the Llama-2-7b model. While the zero-\nshot templated prompting method exhibits the weakest performance among all methods, its absolute\nscores are not markedly disappointing. It is important to note that a score of 3 denotes a \u2018neutral\u2019\nassessment, making its scores of 3.05 on \u00f2 helpfulness and 3.14 on \u00a7 factuality somewhat accept-\nable. Basic in-context learning (with K=3 examples of vanilla examples) can improve performance\nacross all metrics except for \u00db depth, albeit with overall modest gains (3.18). Retrieval augmenta-\ntion (Retrieval ICL) (Han, 2023) significantly enhances alignment in all aspects, achieving a higher\noverall score (3.72) by using three retrieved examples for each inference task. Nonetheless, the dy-\nnamic nature of the prompts due to retrieval limits inference efficiency compared to ICL methods\nthat employ constant prompts. URIAL notably improves the performance of tuning-free alignment,\nattaining a level comparable to the SFT/RLHF results achieved with the Llama-2-7b model (4.33).\nRemarkably, URIAL can even surpass Mistral-7b-Instruct (SFT) and Llama-2-70b-chatq (RLHF)\nwhen contrasted with their respective base models.\nURIAL even outperforms SFT and RLHF when base LLMs are strong.\nWhen using Mistral-\n7B as the base model, URIAL (4.63) outperforms its official SFT-ed model, Mistral-7B-Instruct\n(4.44), on all aspects, yielding the best performance among 7B-level LLMs. Likewise, on top of\nLlama-2-70bq, URIAL also surpasses the RLHF-ed version (Llama-2-70b-chatq) by a significant\nmargin (4.74 vs 4.67), which nearly matches the performance of ChatGPT (4.75) and GPT-4 (4.8).\nNote that both Mistral-7B and Llama-2-70bq are better pre-trained than Llama-2-7b, as suggested\nby various benchmarking results (Jiang et al., 2023a; Touvron et al., 2023) and their zero-shot per-\nformance (e.g., helpfulness 3.05 vs 3.70). Therefore, we conclude that when the base LLMs are\nwell-pretrained, SFT and RLHF may not be as crucial for alignment as previously believed. In-\nstead, tuning-free methods such as URIAL can achieve superior performance with minimal effort, at\n9\nPreprint\nethics\nlifestyle\nhuman\nities\nfinance\nmedical\nSTEM\nnature\nwriting\nrole-\nplay\nprocedure\nmath\nreasoning\ncoding\ninfo-seek\nFigure 7: Categorized performance analysis for alignment in different tasks and topics.\nleast in the scenarios covered by our evaluation. We also conduct a human evaluation for pairwise\ncomparisons in Table 2, which reinforces these conclusions.\nAligned LLMs might forget knowledge and become overly sensitive.\nCase studies in Ap-\npendix B reveal that fine-tuning could induce forgetting, hallucination, and overly sensitive cen-\nsorship. For example, we find that Mistral-7B with URIAL can correctly answer the question \u201cDid\nFacebook corporate change its name?\u201d by telling users the new name is \u201cMeta Platform Inc.\u201d.\nHowever, the SFT-ed version Mistral-7B-Instruct instead answers \u201cNo, Facebook did not change its\nname.\u201d This indicates that during SFT process, the LLMs might over-fit the instruction-tuning data\nand thus forget the previously acquired knowledge. Also, Llama-2-70b-chat (RLHF-ed) refuses to\nanswer harmless questions such as \u201cWhat would be a great twist for a murder mystery? I\u2019m looking\nfor something creative, not to rehash old tropes.\u201d because it wants to avoid generating any harmful\ncontent. In contrast, URIAL can maintain a flexible balance between helpfulness and harmlessness.\nWhat if we use fewer or more in-context examples for URIAL?\nIn the previous analysis, we\nprimarily discussed the performance of URIAL with K=3 in-context examples. To test K=1, we\nretained only the \u2018renewable energy\u2019 example from Fig. 5. For K=8, we added one example for\neach of the following topics: mathematics, coding, poetry writing, procedure, and safety. URIAL\nwith K=1 and Llama-2-70b exhibits satisfactory overall performance (4.62), achieving a higher\n\u00f2 helpfulness score (4.60) than the RLHFed model. With K=8 examples, totaling approximately 2k\ntokens, we observe a significant improvement in \u00e9 safety for Llama-2-7b (4.29 to 4.97); however,\na decrease in performance is seen for all other aspects. On the Mistral-7B, URIAL with K=8 also\nachieves higher \u00e9 safety and \u0006 engagement scores. Although URIAL with K=8 demonstrates\ncomparable or better overall performance than URIAL with K=3 for Llama-2-7b, we recommend\nthe use of URIAL with K=3 due to its balanced performance and lower cost.\nIs URIAL sensitive to the selection of in-context examples?\nWe also test URIAL with a different\nset of three examples using Mistral-7b. We find that the overall performance is even slightly better\nthan the default version (4.63 vs. 4.64). The three different examples are available on our website,\nand the resulting performance metrics are as follows:\n\u00f2 helpfulness = 4.60;\n\u00ee clarity = 4.90;\n\u00a7 factuality = 4.50; \u00db depth = 4.20; \u0006 engagement = 4.74; \u00e9 safety = 4.93; Average = 4.64;\nLength = 185.9. This suggests that URIAL is robust to variations in the ICL examples provided.\nCan URIAL handle multi-turn conversations?\nYes! One can simply append the previous chat\nhistory as new in-context examples for URIAL to facilitate multi-turn chatting. We include a case\nstudy on using URIAL for multi-turn conversations in Appendix B.3. This suggests that the conver-\nsation ability of aligned LLMs might be largely from the base models themselves.\n10\nPreprint\n4.4\nMORE INSIGHTS FROM EVALUATION WITH JUST-EVAL-INSTRUCT\nUnbiased evaluation.\nIn the first group of results in Table 1, we can see that SFT and RLHF\nhave their own advantages. Llama-2-7b-chat is much safer and more engaging than Vicuna-7b but\nsignificantly worse in other aspects such as \u00f2 helpfulness. Also, the factuality score of Llama-2-\n7b-chat (RLHFed) also lower than only Vicuna-7b (SFTed), suggesting that RLHF might even cause\nmore hallucination. We conjecture that RLHFed Llama-2-Chat models may have been overfitted to\n\u00e9 safety and \u0006 engagement. We also find that Llama-2-chat generates longest outputs that are\nnearly 250 words on average, while the others are around 150-180 words.\nMany prior evaluation (Wang et al., 2023) and leaderboards (Li et al., 2023a) are solely based on\nwin-rates on overall quality, and thus tend to prefer longer outputs and some particular aspects for\nunclear reasons. Now with just-eval-instruct and our multi-aspect evaluation, we can clearly\nanalyze which aspects is a particular model or alignment method indeed improving. In addition, our\nevaluation also provides rationales that humans can easily verify.\nGap between open-source LLMs and ChatGPTs.\nPrior evaluation such as AlpacaEval does not\nhave tags for each example for testing, so it is hard to do large-scale detailed analysis. Open-source\nLLMs still have gaps to OpenAI GPTs on several tasks and topics. We use Figure 7 to analyze\nthe categorized performance. It is obvious that GPTs have a much more balanced performance on\nalmost all tasks and topics. Open-source LLMs including URIAL are weak on coding and math tasks\nas well as STEM topics, although they can match the performance of GPTs on other data categories.\nPlease refer to Figure 1 for a visualization of the performance in different aspects.\n5\nRELATED WORK & DISCUSSION\n5.1\nALIGNMENT TUNING & SUPERFICIAL ALIGNMENT HYPOTHESIS\nLimitation of Tuning-based Alignment. Alignment tuning through SFT and RLHF typically de-\nmands substantial resources, such as GPU nodes, a large amount of instruction data, and human\nannotations, making the process both costly and time-consuming. This restricts ordinary labs from\naligning extreme-scale LLMs exceeding 30B, let alone the recent Falcon-180B (Almazrouei et al.,\n2023). Moreover, during the pre-training and continual training stages, efficiently estimating the\ndownstream performance of a base model checkpoint becomes challenging if alignment tuning is\nalways required to evaluate its instruction-following ability. Besides the aforementioned limitations,\ntuning-based alignment may also cause forgetting issues in LLMs.\nWang et al. (2023) demonstrated that some SFTed LLMs perform significantly worse than their base\ncounterparts on factual and reasoning benchmarks. For instance, applying SFT to Llama-13b with\nself-instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) results in a considerable decline in its MMLU performance\n(from 42.5 to 30.3) and Codex-Eval performance (from 26.6 to 13.4). Even more strikingly, SFT\nwith SuperNI (Wang et al., 2022b) causes Llama-13B to nearly lose all its BBH reasoning ability\n(decreasing from 36.9 to 2.8). Moreover, Shen et al. (2023) show that the reward models in RLHF\ncan perform very inconsistently, yielding a nearly random performance when showing contrastive\ninstructions to them. These findings imply that alignment tuning may lead to the forgetting of\npreviously acquired knowledge in base LLMs, which is also shown in our experiments.\nSuperficial alignment hypothesis. LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) employs only 1k examples to fine-\ntune a 65B LLM and discovers that such a slightly tuned LLM surprisingly achieves a high win rate\nover ChatGPT, thus implying that the alignment tuning is superficial. Similar observations are also\nreported by other recent studies (Chen et al., 2023a; Lee et al., 2023). Moreover, Gudibande et al.\n(2023) demonstrate that aligning open-source LLMs by imitating proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT)\nmay not always yield desirable results, emphasizing the importance of a strong pre-trained base LLM\nfor producing factual content. Tuning-based methods such as LIMA still require tuning the weights\nof LLMs and consequently face the limitations described above when the model size is too large\nor we need to frequently align base LLMs for evaluation. A concurrent work (Duan et al., 2023)\nalso explores the similarity between ICL and instruction-tuning in their effects on downstream tasks\nby analyzing the LLMs\u2019 hidden states. As for the theory of alignment, these studies only indirectly\nsuggest the promise of the superficial alignment hypothesis but do not directly show where and\nwhen the alignment tuning significantly changes the model behavior. In this paper, we study the\n11\nPreprint\nsuperficial alignment hypothesis more directly through the lens of token distribution shift, which\ndirectly exhibits the alignment effect and produces more detailed non-trivial findings.\n5.2\nTUNING-FREE ALIGNMENT METHODS\nIn-context learning. Many in-context learning (ICL) studies focus on specific NLP tasks, such\nas classification and multiple-choice QA (Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). However, few in-\nvestigations concentrate on aligning base LLMs for building assistants via in-context learning. Bai\net al. (2022) uses a prompt with 14 examples (about 7k tokens) with context distillation for their\niterated RLHF training process. In a recent work, Han (2023) demonstrates that in-context learn-\ning using approximately 10 dynamic, retrieved examples can achieve impressive performance in\naligning base LLMs, sharing a similar motivation with ReCross (Lin et al., 2022). We treat this\nas a baseline method (Retrieval ICL in Table 1) and improve it by incorporating more high-quality\ndata and employing state-of-the-art sentence embedding to index and query. Our results show that\nusing dynamically retrieved samples can indeed outperform using basic examples but is still lower\nthan using fixed yet stylistic and curated examples. Ye et al. (2023a) proposes in-context instruction\nlearning that also suggests the promise of using carefully crafted in-context examples can improve\nthe generalization ability of base LLMs. Furthermore, Min et al. (2022) find that ICL primarily\nconcerns the style and format of demonstrations, rather than their truth content, which aligns with\nour motivation for using curated and stylistic examples.\nThe limitations of ICL for tuning-free alignment are twofold: context length and computational\ncost. Recent research has significantly increased the context window sizes for LLMs (Su et al.,\n2021; Tworkowski et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b), ensuring that URIAL with\nonly 1k tokens does not hinder any long-context applications of LLMs. To reduce computational\ncosts, we can precompute the activations of static prefixes in ICL methods like URIAL and then load\nthem into the KV cache to avoid recomputation for each new inference request. Efficiency can be\nfurther enhanced by using advanced caching methods (Ge et al., 2023; Mu et al., 2023; Gim et al.,\n2023) and optimized attention modules during decoding (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023).\nRAIN (Li et al., 2023b) is a recent tuning-free alignment method that shares similar motivation\nwith ours, while they focus on the inference-time self-evaluation for better decoding. In contrast,\nURIAL only relies on in-context learning and does not have special requirements on decoding strat-\negy. URIAL and RAIN can be potentially integrated with each other for even better inference-time\nalignment methods that do not require parameter tuning at all.\n5.3\nEVALUATION OF ALIGNMENT\nPrevious evaluation approaches, as employed in AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023a) and MT-bench (Zheng\net al., 2023), focus on rating or comparisons with respect to overall performance, which obscure our\nunderstanding of the specific strengths and weaknesses of each output candidate. Recent works, such\nas FLASK (Ye et al., 2023b) and TIGERScore (Jiang et al., 2023b), share similar motivations with\nours by utilizing multiple aspects and explanations for evaluating LLMs, though they have different\nfocal points. Our just-eval-instruct consolidates 9 existing datasets for testing alignment and\nprovides multi-faceted, explainable evaluations to analyze alignment performance in LLMs, which\ncan be used as an complementary evaluation of LLMs.\n5.4\nMORE DISCUSSION ON URIAL\nAlthough URIAL can match the performance of SFT and RLHF when the base LLMs are strong, it\nis not suggested to replace SFT or RLHF with URIAL in all scenarios. Specifically, model tuning\nmay still be necessary for tasks such as coding (Luo et al., 2023), mathematics (Yue et al., 2023),\ninteractive agents (Yin et al., 2023), etc. The unique advantages of URIAL include:\n\u001d URIAL is a strong baseline method for aligning base LLMs without tuning. It is extremely\nsimple to implement and perfectly reproducible, thus facilitating the development and evaluation\nof future tuning-free and tuning-based alignment methods.\n\u001d URIAL can align extremely large LMs (e.g., Llama-2-70b, Falcon-180b) with minimal effort.\nFine-tuning such extremely large models requires significant computation resources and time;\nURIAL aligns them without tuning, thereby saving both.\n12\nPreprint\n\u001d URIAL can be used to frequently evaluate base LLMs during the pre-training process. It\nallows us to monitor the quality of base LLMs at the pre-training stage of base LLMs.\n\u001d URIAL enables fair comparison of different base LLMs based on their potential for alignment.\nComparisons between aligned LLMs cannot directly reflect the quality of their base counterparts\nbecause the tuning process can vary greatly (e.g., data, hyper-parameters, etc.).\n\u001d URIAL can be used to explore the science of LLM alignment. It suggests that we should recon-\nsider the current alignment practices and advocate for more efficient methods. URIAL allows us to\nprobe base LLMs \u2014 analyzing the knowledge and skills that base LLMs have already acquired\nduring pre-training to identify what is missing for alignment, rather than blindly fine-tuning with\nextensive data and incurring unnecessary computational costs.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nWe first substantiate the underlying hypothesis regarding the superficial nature of alignment tuning\nvia detailed analysis on token distribution shifts between base and aligned LLMs. This analytical\nmethod allows us to clearly investigate which token positions are affected by alignment tuning, pro-\nviding insights for developing more efficient alignment methods and further studying the science of\nLLMs. Inspired by these findings, we propose a strong baseline method for tuning-free alignment,\nURIAL, which aligns untuned base LLMs via in-context learning with a constant prompt. Experi-\nments show that URIAL significantly reduce the gap between base LLMs and their aligned versions.\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows:\n\u00fb Analysis: To gain a deeper understanding of alignment tuning, we analyze the token distribu-\ntion shift between base and aligned LLMs. We find that alignment predominantly affects a minimal\nportion of token selection, influencing primarily stylistic elements and safety disclaimers in just 5-\n8% of cases. On most of the token positions, aligned and base models concur on top-token choices.\nAlso, we find that alignment tuning is much more critical for initial tokens than later tokens.\nz Methods: We introduce a simple yet effective method for aligning base LLMs, URIAL. It\nutilizes only as few as three constant curated examples for ICL, yet it effectively aligns base LLMs\nand matches the performance of SFT+RLHF in some scenarios. We also discover that well-written,\nstylistic examples are more effective than semantically relevant ones that are dynamically retrieved.\nURIAL offers both efficiency and simplicity in aligning base LLMs without requiring fine-tuning.\nThis method significantly conserves time and resources, which is especially beneficial when deal-\ning with extremely large LMs or when base LLMs need frequent evaluation. Furthermore, it en-\nables a deeper investigation into the knowledge and capabilities innate to these base LLMs, while\nfostering more precise and economical approaches to align them with their deficiencies.\n\u00cd Evaluation: We develop a comprehensive and interpretable evaluation protocol, encompassing\nsix aspects with verifiable judgments. We also release the annotations we gathered for community\nuse in evaluation and training open-source LLM evaluators.\nWe believe there are several important future directions: (1) extending the analysis by connecting\nthe token distribution shift to the model weights and attribution to training data; (2) developing\nadvanced inference-time alignment algorithms to efficiently control the behavior of LLMs; and (3)\nexploring the application of URIAL in more scenarios, such as vision-language models.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Seonghyeon Ye (KAIST), Taylor Sorensen (UW), Xiaochuang Han (UW), Fu Yao (Uni-\nversity of Edinburgh), Xiang Yue (IN.AI Research), Jun Yan (USC), Qinyuan Ye (USC), Weijia Shi\n(UW), Faeze Brahman (AI2), Valentina Pyatkin (AI2), Yizhong Wang (UW), Lianhui Qin (UCSD\n& AI2) for the insightful discussions with them.

Please find more versions on our website and codebase.\n# Instruction\nBelow is a list of conversations between a human and an AI assistant (you).\nUsers place their queries under \"# Query:\", and your responses are under\n\"# Answer:\".\nYou are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.\nYou should always answer as helpfully as possible while ensuring safety.\nYour answers should be well-structured and provide detailed information. They should also have an engaging tone.\nYour responses must not contain any fake, harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content,\neven if it may be helpful.\n,\u2192\nYour response must be socially responsibly, and thus you can reject to answer some controversial topics.\n# Query:\n```What is the best way to torture a friend who stole my money?```\n# Answer:\n```\nHi! I'm sorry to hear that. However, I cannot assist with that request. If you're feeling angry or hurt, I recommend\nseeking guidance or speaking to a trusted individual about your feelings. If you believe a crime has been\ncommitted, it's best to report it to the appropriate authorities rather than take matters into your own hands.\n,\u2192\n,\u2192\nRemember, violence or harm is not a solution and can lead to serious consequences for both parties involved. I hope it\nhelps!\n,\u2192\n```\n# Query:\n```You are a detective interrogating a suspect. How do you get them to confess without violating their rights?```\n# Answer:\n```\nHello! As a detective, it's important to conduct interrogations within the boundaries of the law and respect the\nsuspect's rights to avoid any potential violations or false confessions.\n,\u2192\nHere are some ethical and legal techniques that can be used to encourage a suspect to provide information or confess:\n1. Building rapport: Engage in friendly conversations, develop a level of trust and comfort with the suspect.\n2. Presenting evidence: Show the suspect the evidence or information that implicates them in the crime without making\nthreatening implications.\n,\u2192\n3. Possible outcomes: Without making promises, you can explain the potential consequences based on choices they make\nnow.\n,\u2192\n4. Maintaining calm and patience: Give them time to talk and think.\n5. Mirroring and empathy: Try to relate to them or mirror their actions subtly, which can create a sense of connection\nand empower them to share more.\n,\u2192\n6. Silence: Moments of silence can pressure suspects to break it by talking.\nRemember, it's always imperative to respect the suspect's rights and conduct any investigation in accordance with the\nlaw. Intimidation, physical confrontation or coercive tactics are illegal and unethical.\n,\u2192\nIs there anything else you would like to know?\n```\n# Query:\n```Can you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?```\n# Answer:\n```\nHello! Absolutely, below are some of the most common types of renewable energy sources:\n1. Solar Energy: This is the most abundant energy source on earth, harnessed through the use of solar panels. These\npanels convert sunlight into electricity without any moving parts, noise, pollution, or damage to the environment.\n,\u2192\n2. Wind Energy: Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can\nbe used for specific tasks (such as pumping water) or converted into electricity to power homes, businesses, and\nschools.\n,\u2192\n,\u2192\n3. Hydropower: Generated by using electricity generators to capture the energy from falling or fast-moving water. This\nrenewable source can come from various ways, including a large dam on a river, tidal or wave energy from the\nocean, or using small scale turbines in streams.\n,\u2192\n,\u2192\n4. Geothermal Energy: This type of energy is generated from the heat deep within the Earth. This heat can be used\ndirectly for heating buildings or to generate electricity. It is continuously produced inside the Earth and is\nnearly as reliable as the tides.\n,\u2192\n,\u2192\n5. Biomass Energy: Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and it contains stored energy from\nthe sun. This energy can be burned directly or converted into biofuel which can burn more efficiently.\n,\u2192\nEach type of renewable energy source has its own set of advantages and challenges, but collectively, they represent\nour best hope at achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly energy consumption. Please let me know if you\nhave any other questions!\n,\u2192\n,\u2192\n```\n19\nPreprint\nB\nCASE STUDIES\nWe present three case studies.

There are more examples on\nour websites and one can see more details such as the concrete token ranking differences between\nthe two models. Note that the description in Sec. 2.1 is simplified. Specifically, we use different tem-\nplates to format the context (the original input and the previously generated part of the response).\nFor aligned models, we will use the official template. For example, Llama-2-chat models will use the\nbelow template: \u201c<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\\n ... \\n<</SYS>>\\n{instruction}[/INST] {answer}\u201d.\nFor\nthe\nbase\nLLM,\nwe\nuse\nthe\nzero-shot\ntemplate\nas\nshown\nin\nFig.\n5,\nwhich\nis\n\u201c## Query:\\n```{instruction}```{answer}\u201d.

For each token\nposition, one can click it and see the two ranked list of tokens sorted by Pbase and Paligned respectively.\nNote that the inputs to the base and aligned models are different due to the template differences.\n23\nPreprint\nD\nEVALUATION\nD.1\nINFERENCE CONFIGURATIONS\nWe employ greedy decoding for all models, including both aligned and base Large Language Models\n(LLMs). For aligned models, we utilize the system prompts that are recommended, if available. The\nresults for GPT-based models are obtained with zero temperature to maximize reproducibility. We\nacknowledge that some aligned models may achieve enhanced performance with specific settings\nfor temperature, top p, and other parameters. However, to ensure reproducibility and to conduct a\nfair and robust evaluation, we opt for greedy decoding for all models. Additionally, we impose a\nrepetition penalty of 1.1 on base LLMs to prevent degeneration.\nThe use of system prompts may also affect the performance of certain aligned LLMs, as they might\nbe inclined towards prioritizing safety issues. We recognize that employing these system prompts\nmight be necessary in real-world applications to ensure the safety of deployed LLM systems.\nD.2\nCATEGORIES IN just-eval-instruct\nWe use GPT-4 for tagging each instruction in our just-eval-instruct dataset. We have two\ngroups of tags designed for task types and topic types respectively, as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.\nWe give each tag a short description and allow GPT-4 to assign multiple tags for each instruction.\nD.3\nHUMAN EVALUATION\nWe randomly sample 100 examples from just-eval-instruct and show pairs of model outputs\nto human annotators. We ask human annotators to choose among \u2018A is better\u2019, \u2018B is better\u2019, and\n\u2018same\u2019. Table 2 shows the results.

Accelerating Stable Diffusion V1.5 and LDM-4-G by 2.3\u00d7 and 7.0\u00d7, with 50 PLMS steps and 250 DDIM steps respectively.\nAbstract\nDiffusion models have recently gained unprecedented\nattention in the field of image synthesis due to their re-\nmarkable generative capabilities.\nNotwithstanding their\nprowess, these models often incur substantial computa-\ntional costs, primarily attributed to the sequential denoising\nprocess and cumbersome model size. Traditional methods\nfor compressing diffusion models typically involve extensive\nretraining, presenting cost and feasibility challenges. In\nthis paper, we introduce DeepCache, a novel training-free\nparadigm that accelerates diffusion models from the per-\nspective of model architecture. DeepCache capitalizes on\nthe inherent temporal redundancy observed in the sequen-\ntial denoising steps of diffusion models, which caches and\nretrieves features across adjacent denoising stages, thereby\ncurtailing redundant computations. Utilizing the property\nof the U-Net, we reuse the high-level features while up-\ndating the low-level features in a very cheap way.\nThis\ninnovative strategy, in turn, enables a speedup factor of\n2.3\u00d7 for Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only a 0.05 decline\nin CLIP Score, and 4.1\u00d7 for LDM-4-G with a slight de-\ncrease of 0.22 in FID on ImageNet. Our experiments also\ndemonstrate DeepCache\u2019s superiority over existing prun-\ning and distillation methods that necessitate retraining and\nits compatibility with current sampling techniques.\nFur-\nthermore, we find that under the same throughput, Deep-\nCache effectively achieves comparable or even marginally\nimproved results with DDIM or PLMS. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/horseee/DeepCache.\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, diffusion models [9, 17, 57, 59] have\nemerged as a pivotal advancement in the field of genera-\n\u2217 Corresponding author\n1\narXiv:2312.00858v2  [cs.CV]  7 Dec 2023\ntive modeling, gaining substantial attention for their impres-\nsive capabilities. These models have demonstrated remark-\nable efficacy across diverse applications, being employed\nfor the generation of images [19, 60, 64], text [11, 28], au-\ndio [6, 44], and video [18, 36, 56]. A large number of attrac-\ntive applications have been facilitated with diffusion mod-\nels, including but not limited to image editing [2, 20, 38],\nimage super-enhancing [26, 51], image-to-image transla-\ntion [7, 49], text-to-image generation [41, 45, 46, 50] and\ntext-to-3D generation [30, 35, 43].\nDespite the significant effectiveness of diffusion mod-\nels, their relatively slow inference speed remains a ma-\njor obstacle to broader adoption, as highlighted in [29].\nThe core challenge stems from the step-by-step denois-\ning process required during their reverse phase, limiting\nparallel decoding capabilities [55].\nEfforts to accelerate\nthese models have focused on two main strategies: reduc-\ning the number of sampling steps, as seen in approaches\n[34, 39, 52, 58], and decreasing the model inference over-\nhead per step through methods like model pruning, distilla-\ntion, and quantization [10, 13, 21].\nOur goal is to enhance the efficiency of diffusion models\nby reducing model size at each step. Previous compres-\nsion methods for diffusion models focused on re-designing\nnetwork architectures through a comprehensive structural\nanalysis [29] or involving frequency priors into the model\ndesign [66], which yields promising results on image gen-\neration. However, they require large-scale datasets for re-\ntraining these lightweight models.\nPruning-based meth-\nods, as explored by [10, 21], lessen the data and training\nrequirements to 0.1% of the full training.\nAlternatively,\n[32] employs adaptive models for different steps, which is\nalso a potential solution. However, it depends on a collec-\ntion of pre-trained models or requires optimization of sub-\nnetworks [65]. Those methods can reduce the expense of\ncrafting a new lightweight model, but the retraining process\nis still inevitable, which makes the compression costly and\nless practical for large-scale pre-trained diffusion models,\nsuch as Stable Diffusion [47].\nTo this end, we focus on a challenging topic: How to\nsignificantly reduce the computational overhead at each de-\nnoising step without additional training, thereby achieving\na cost-free compression of Diffusion Models? To achieve\nthis, we turn our attention to the intrinsic characteristics\nof the reverse denoising process of diffusion models, ob-\nserving a significant temporal consistency in the high-level\nfeatures between consecutive steps. We found that those\nhigh-level features are even cacheable, which can be calcu-\nlated once and retrieved again for the subsequent steps. By\nleveraging the structural property of U-Net, the high-level\nfeatures can be cached while maintaining the low-level fea-\ntures updated at each denoising step. Through this, a con-\nsiderable enhancement in the efficiency and speed of Diffu-\nsion Models can be achieved without any training.\nTo summarize, we introduce a novel paradigm for the\nacceleration of Diffusion Models, which gives a new per-\nspective for training-free accelerating the diffusion models.\nIt is not merely compatible with existing fast samplers but\nalso shows potential for comparable or superior generation\ncapabilities. The contributions of our paper include:\n\u2022 We introduce a simple and effective acceleration algo-\nrithm, named DeepCache, for dynamically compressing\ndiffusion models during runtime and thus enhancing im-\nage generation speed without additional training burdens.\n\u2022 DeepCache utilizes the temporal consistency between\nhigh-level features. With the cacheable features, the re-\ndundant calculations are effectively reduced.\nFurther-\nmore, we introduce a non-uniform 1:N strategy, specifi-\ncally tailored for long caching intervals.\n\u2022 DeepCache is validated across a variety of datasets, in-\ncluding CIFAR, LSUN-Bedroom/Churches, ImageNet,\nCOCO2017 and PartiPrompt, and tested under DDPM,\nLDM, and Stable Diffusion. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach has superior efficacy than pruning and\ndistillation algorithms that require retraining under the\nsame throughput.\n2. Related Work\nHigh-dimensional image generation has evolved signifi-\ncantly in generative modeling.\nInitially, GANs [1, 12]\nand VAEs [16, 22] led this field but faced scalability is-\nsues due to instability and mode collapse [23]. Recent ad-\nvancements have been led by Diffusion Probabilistic Mod-\nels [9, 17, 47, 61], which offer superior image generation.\nHowever, the inherent nature of the reverse diffusion pro-\ncess [59] slows down inference. Current research is focused\non two main methods to speed up diffusion model inference.\nOptimized Sampling Efficiency.\nfocuses on reducing the\nnumber of sampling steps.\nDDIM\n[58] reduces these\nsteps by exploring a non-Markovian process, related to neu-\nral ODEs. Studies\n[3, 33, 34, 69] further dive into the\nfast solver of SDE or ODE to create efficient sampling of\ndiffusion models.\nSome methods progressively distilled\nthe model to reduced timestep [52] or replace the remain-\ning steps with a single-step VAE [37]. The Consistency\nModel [62] converts random noise to the initial images with\nonly one model evaluation. Parallel sampling techniques\nlike DSNO [70] and ParaDiGMS [55] employ Fourier neu-\nral operators and Picard iterations for parallel decoding .\nOptimized Structural Efficiency.\nThis approach aims to\nreduce inference time at each sampling step. It leverages\nstrategies like structural pruning in Diff-pruning [10] and\nefficient structure evolving in SnapFusion [29]. Spectral\n2\nDiffusion [66] enhances architectural design by incorpo-\nrating frequency dynamics and priors. In contrast to these\nmethods, which use a uniform model at each step, [32] pro-\nposes utilizing different models at various steps, selected\nfrom a diffusion model zoo. The early stopping mechanism\nin diffusion is explored in [27, 40, 63], while the quantiza-\ntion techniques [13, 54] focus on low-precision data types\nfor model weights and activations. Additionally, [4] and\n[5] present novel approaches to concentrate on inputs, with\nthe former adopting a unique forward process for each pixel\nand the latter merging tokens based on similarity to enhance\ncomputational efficiency in attention modules. Our method\nis categorized under an objective to minimize the average\ninference time per step. Uniquely, our approach reduces the\naverage model size substantially for each step, accelerating\nthe denoising process without necessitating retraining.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Preliminary\nForward and Reverse Process.\nDiffusion models [17]\nsimulate an image generation process using a series of ran-\ndom diffusion steps. The core idea behind diffusion models\nis to start from random noise and gradually refine it until it\nresembles a sample from the target distribution. In the for-\nward diffusion process, with a data point sampled from the\nreal distribution, x0 \u223c q(x), gaussian noises are gradually\nadded in T steps:\nq (xt|xt\u22121) = N\n\u0010\nxt;\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b2txt\u22121, \u03b2tI\n\u0011\n(1)\nwhere t is the current timestep and {\u03b2t} schedules the noise.\nThe reverse diffusion process denoises the random noise\nxT\n\u223c N(0, I) into the target distribution by modeling\nq (xt\u22121|xt). At each reverse step t, the conditional prob-\nability distribution is approximated by a network \u03f5\u03b8 (xt, t)\nwith the timestep t and previous output xt as input:\nxt\u22121 \u223c p\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) =\nN\n\u0012\nxt\u22121;\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0012\nxt \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1t\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5\u03b8 (xt, t)\n\u0013\n, \u03b2tI\n\u0013\n(2)\nwhere \u03b1t = 1 \u2212 \u03b2t and \u00af\u03b1t = QT\ni=1 \u03b1i. Applied iteratively,\nit gradually reduces the noise of the current xt, bringing it\nclose to a real data point when we reach x0.\nHigh-level\nand\nLow-level\nFeatures\nin\nU-Net.\nU-\nNet [48] was originally introduced for biomedical image\nsegmentation and showcased a strong ability to amalgamate\nlow-level and high-level features, attributed to the skip con-\nnections. U-Net is constructed on stacked downsampling\nand upsampling blocks, which encode the input image into a\nhigh-level representation and then decode it for downstream\ntasks. The block pairs, denoted as {Di}d\ni=1 and {Ui}d\ni=1,\nare interconnected with additional skip paths. Those skip\npaths directly forward the rich and relatively more low-level\ninformation from Di to Ui. During the forward propaga-\ntion in the U-Net architecture, the data traverses concur-\nrently through two pathways: the main branch and the skip\nbranch. These branches converge at a concatenation mod-\nule, with the main branch providing processed high-level\nfeature from the preceding upsampling block Ui+1, and\nthe skip branch contributing corresponding feature from the\nsymmetrical block Di. Therefore, at the heart of a U-Net\nmodel is a concatenation of low-level features from the skip\nbranch, and the high-level features from the main branch,\nformalized as:\nConcat(Di(\u00b7), Ui+1(\u00b7))\n(3)\n3.2. Feature Redundancy in Sequential Denoising\nThe inherent sequentiality of the denoising process in dif-\nfusion models presents a primary bottleneck in inference\nspeed. Previous methods primarily employed strategies that\ninvolved skipping certain steps to address this issue. In this\nwork, we revisit the entire denoising process, seeking to un-\ncover specific properties that could be optimized to enhance\ninference efficiency.\nObservation. Adjacent steps in the denoising process ex-\nhibit significant temporal similarity in high-level features.\nIn Figure 2, we provide empirical evidence related to\nthis observation. The experiments elucidate two primary\ninsights: 1) There is a noticeable temporal feature similar-\nity between adjacent steps within the denoising process, in-\ndicating that the change between consecutive steps is typi-\ncally minor; 2) Regardless of the diffusion model we used,\nfor each timestep, at least 10% of the adjacent timesteps\nexhibit a high similarity (>0.95) to the current step, sug-\ngesting that certain high-level features change at a gradual\npace. This phenomenon can be observed in a large num-\nber of well-established models like Stable Diffusion, LDM,\nand DDPM. In the case of DDPM for LSUN-Churches and\nLSUN-Bedroom, some timesteps even demonstrate a high\ndegree of similarity to 80% of the other steps, as highlighted\nin the green line in Figure 2 (c).\nBuilding upon these observations, our objective is to\nleverage this advantageous characteristic to accelerate the\ndenoising process. Our analysis reveals that the compu-\ntation often results in a feature remarkably similar to that\nof the previous step, thereby highlighting the existence of\nredundant calculations for optimization. We contend that\nallocating significant computational resources to regener-\nate these analogous feature maps constitutes an inefficiency.\nWhile incurring substantial computational expense, yields\nmarginal benefits, it suggests a potential area for efficiency\nimprovements in the speed of diffusion models.\n3\nA large teddy \nbear with a heart \nis in the garbage\nA green plate filled \nwith rice and a \nmixture of sauce \non top of it\nA very ornate, \nthree layered\nwedding cake in \na banquet room\nPrompt\nLDM-4-G\nDDPM/Bedroom\nSD v1.5\n(c) Ratio of steps that similarity larger than 0.95\nStep1\nStep20\nStep19\nStep0\nOriginal\n(a) Examples of Feature Maps\n(b) HeatMap for Similarity\nFigure 2.

Deep Cache For Diffusion Models\nWe introduce DeepCache, a simple and effective approach\nthat leverages the temporal redundancy between steps in\nthe reverse diffusion process to accelerate inference. Our\nmethod draws inspiration from the caching mechanism in\na computer system, incorporating a storage component de-\nsigned for elements that exhibit minimal changes over time.\nApplying this in diffusion models, we eliminate redundant\ncomputations by strategically caching slowly evolving fea-\ntures, thereby obviating the need for repetitive recalcula-\ntions in subsequent steps.\nTo achieve this, we shift our focus to the skip connec-\ntions within U-Net, which inherently offers a dual-pathway\nadvantage: the main branch requires heavy computation\nto traverse the entire network, while the skip branch only\nneeds to go through some shallow layers, resulting in a very\nsmall computational load. The prominent feature similarity\nin the main branch, allows us to reuse the already computed\nresults rather than calculate it repeatedly for all timesteps.\nCacheable Features in denosing.\nTo make this idea\nmore concrete, we study the case within two consecutive\ntimesteps t and t \u2212 1. According to the reverse process,\nxt\u22121 would be conditionally generated based on the pre-\nvious results xt. First, we generate xt in the same way\nas usual, where the calculations are performed across the\nentire U-Net. To obtain the next output xt\u22121, we retrieve\nthe high-level features produced in the previous xt. More\nspecifically, consider a skip branch m in the U-Net, which\nbridges Dm and Um, we cache the feature maps from the\nprevious up-sampling block at the time t as the following:\nF t\ncache \u2190 U t\nm+1(\u00b7)\n(4)\nwhich is the feature from the main branch at timestep t.\nThose cached features will be plugged into the network in-\nference in the subsequent steps. In the next timestep t \u2212 1,\nthe inference is not carried out on the entire network; in-\nstead, we perform a dynamic partial inference. Based on\nthe previously generated xt, we only calculate those that are\nnecessary for the m-th skip branch and substitute the com-\npute of the main branch with a retrieving operation from\nthe cache in Equation 4. Therefore, the input for U t\u22121\nm\nin\nthe t \u2212 1 timestep can be formulated as:\nConcat(Dt\u22121\nm (\u00b7), F t\ncache)\n(5)\nHere, Dt\u22121\nm\nrepresents the output of the m-th down-\nsampling block, which only contains a few layers if a small\nm is selected. For example, if we perform DeepCache at\nthe first layer with m = 1, then we only need to execute\none downsampling block to obtain Dt\u22121\n1\n. As for the second\nfeature F t\ncache, no additional computational cost is needed\nsince it can be simply retrieved from the cache. We illus-\ntrate the above process in Figure 3.\nExtending to 1:N Inference\nThis process is not limited\nto the type with one step of full inference followed by one\nstep of partial inference. As shown in Figure 2(b), pair-\nwise similarity remains a high value in several consecutive\nsteps. The mechanism can be extended to cover more steps,\nwith the cached features calculated once and reused in the\nconsecutive N \u2212 1 steps to replace the original U t\u2212n\nm+1(\u00b7),\nn \u2208 {1, . . . , N \u22121}. Thus, for all the T steps for denoising,\nthe sequence of timesteps that performs full inference are:\nI = {x \u2208 N | x = iN, 0 \u2264 i < k}\n(6)\nwhere k = \u2308T/N\u2309 denotes the times for cache updating.\n4\n!!\n!\"\n!#\nM\n#!\n#\"\n##\nSkip Branch 1\n#!\n!!\n!!\"$\n#%&%'(\n!\n\"$\n\"#\n\"'\n##\n#'\n$\nChosen Path\nSkip Branch 2\nSkip Branch 3\nExcluded Path\n!!\n!!)$\nFigure 3. Illustration of DeepCache. At the t\u22121 step, xt\u22121 is gen-\nerated by reusing the features cached at the t step, and the blocks\nD2, D3, U2, U3 are not executed for more efficient inference.\nNon-uniform 1:N Inference\nBased on the 1:N strategy,\nwe managed to accelerate the inference of diffusion under\na strong assumption that the high-level features are invari-\nant in the consecutive N step. However, it\u2019s not invariably\nthe case, especially for a large N, as demonstrated by the\nexperimental evidence in Figure 2(c). The similarity of the\nfeatures does not remain constant across all steps. For mod-\nels such as LDM, the temporal similarity of features would\nsignificantly decrease around 40% of the denoising process.\nThus, for the non-uniform 1:N inference, we tend to sample\nmore on those steps with relatively small similarities to the\nadjacent steps. Here, the sequence of timesteps to perform\nfull inference becomes:\nL =\nn\nli | li \u2208 linear space\n\u0010\n(\u2212c)\n1\np , (T \u2212 c)\n1\np , k\n\u0011o\n(7)\nI = unique int ({ik | ik = (lk)p + c, where lk \u2208 L})\nwhere linear space(s, e, n) evenly spaces n numbers from\ns to e (exclusive) and unique int(\u00b7) convert the number to\nint and ensure the uniqueness of timesteps in the sequence.\nc is the hyper-parameter for the selected center timestep.\nIn this equation, the frequency of indexes changes in a\nquadratic manner as it moves away from a central timestep.\nIt is essential to note that the aforementioned strategy rep-\nresents one among several potential strategies. Alternative\nsequences, particularly centered on a specific timestep, can\nalso yield similar improvements in image quality.\n4. Experiment\n4.1. Experimental Settings\nModels, Datasets and Evaluation Metrics\nTo demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our method is agnostic with the\ntype of pre-trained DMs, we evaluate our methods on three\ncommonly used DMs: DDPM [17], LDM [47] and Stable\n(a) DDPM for CIFAR10\n(b) Stable Diffusion v1.5\nFigure 4. MACs for each skip branch, evaluated on DDPM for\nCIFAR10 and Stable Diffusion V1.5.\nDiffusion [47]1. Except for this, to show that our method\nis compatible with the fast sampling methods, we build our\nmethod upon 100-step DDIM [58] for DDPM, 250-step for\nLDM and 50-step PLMS [33] for Stable Diffusion, instead\nof the complete 1000-step denoising process. We select six\ndatasets that are commonly adopted to evaluate these mod-\nels, including CIFAR10 [24], LSUN-Bedroom [67], LSUN-\nChurches [67], ImageNet [8], MS-COCO 2017 [31] and\nPartiPrompts [68]. For MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompt,\nwe utilized the 5k validation set and 1.63k captions respec-\ntively as prompts for Stable Diffusion. For other datasets,\nwe generate 50k images to assess the generation quality. We\nfollow previous works [10, 55, 66] to employ the evaluation\nmetrics including FID, sFID, IS, Precision-and-Recall and\nCLIP Score (on ViT-g/14) [14, 15, 25, 53].\nBaselines\nWe choose Diff-Pruning [10] as the main base-\nline for our method since Diff-Pruning also reduces the\ntraining effort for compressing DMs. For the experiment\non LDM, we extend [66] as another baseline to represent\none of the best methods to re-design a lightweight diffusion\nmodel. For the experiment on Stable Diffusion, we choose\nBK-SDMs [21], which are trained on 2.3M LAION image-\ntext pairs, as baselines of architecturally compression and\ndistillation for Stable Diffusion.\n4.2. Complexity Analysis\nWe first analyze the improvement in inference speed facil-\nitated by DeepCache.\nThe notable acceleration in infer-\nence speed primarily arises from incomplete reasoning in\ndenoising steps, with layer removal accomplished by parti-\ntioning the U-Net by the skip connection.

Stable diffusion demonstrates a compara-\ntively uniform distribution across layers, whereas DDPM\nexhibits more computational burden concentrated within the\nfirst several layers. Our approach would benefit from U-Net\nstructures that have a larger number of skip branches, facili-\ntating finer divisions of models, and giving us more choices\nfor trade-off the speed and quality. In our experiment, we\nchoose the skip branch 3/1/2 for DDPMs, LDM-4-G and\nStable Diffusion respectively. We provide the results of us-\ning different branches in Appendix.\nTo comprehensively evaluate the efficiency of our\nmethod, in the following experiments, we report the\nthroughput of each model using a single RTX2080 GPU.\nBesides, we report MACs in those tables, which refer to the\naverage MACs for all steps.\n4.3. Comparison with Compression Methods\nLDM-4-G for ImageNet.\nWe conduct experiments on\nImageNet, and the results are shown in Table 1. When ac-\ncelerating to 4.1\u00d7 the speed, a minor performance decline\nis observed (from 3.39 to 3.59). Compared with the pruning\nand distillation methods, a notable improvement over those\nmethods is observed in FID and sFID, even though the ac-\nceleration ratio of our method is more substantial. Further-\nmore, the augmentation in quality becomes more obvious\nwith a larger number N of caching intervals if we employ\nthe non-uniform 1:N strategy. Detailed results for the non-\nuniform 1:N strategy for small N and the hyper-parameters\nfor the non-uniform strategy are provided in the Appendix.\nDDPMs for CIFAR-10 and LSUN.\nThe results on CI-\nFAR10, LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Churches are shown in\nTable 2. From these tables, we can find out that our method\nsurpasses those requiring retraining, even though our meth-\nods have no retraining cost. Additionally, since we adopt\na layer-pruning approach, which is more hardware-friendly,\nour acceleration ratio is more significant compared to the\nbaseline method, under similar MACs constraints.\n6\nA person in a \nhelmet is riding a \nskateboard\nThere are three \nvases made of \nclay on a table\nA bicycle is \nstanding next to \na bed in a room\nA kitten that is \nsitting down by a  \ndoor\nA serene mountain \nlandscape with a flowing \nriver, lush greenery\u2026\nA delicate floral \narrangement with soft, \npastel colors and light\u2026\nA magical winter \nwonderland at night. \nEnvision a landscape\u2026\nA photograph of an \nabandoned house at \nthe edge of a forest\u2026\nA man holding a \nsurfboard walking on a \nbeach next to the ocean\nStable \nDiffusion \nv1.5\nBK-SDM\n-Tiny\nOurs\nFigure 5.

Analysis\nAblation Study.\nDeepCache can be conceptualized as in-\ncorporating (N \u22121)\u00d7K steps of shallow network inference\non top of the DDIM\u2019s K steps, along with more updates of\nthe noisy images. It is important to validate whether the\nadditional computations of shallow network inference and\nthe caching of features yield positive effectiveness: 1) Ef-\nfectiveness of Cached Features: We assess the impact of\n7\nA cat standing on \nthe edge of a sink \ndrink water\nA child riding a \nskate board on \na city street\nFigure 7.

Comparison with DDIM under the same throughput. Here\nwe conduct class-conditional for ImageNet using LDM-4-G.\ncached features in Table 5. Remarkably, we observe that,\nwithout any retraining, the cached features play a pivotal\nrole in the effective denoising of diffusion models employ-\ning a shallow U-Net. 2) Positive Impact of Shallow Net-\nwork Inference: Building upon the cached features, the\nshallow network inference we conduct has a positive im-\npact compared to DDIM. Results presented in Table 6 in-\ndicate that, with the additional computation of the shallow\nU-Net, DeepCache improves the 50-step DDIM by 0.32 and\nthe 10-step DDIM by 2.98.\nIllustration of the increasing caching interval N.\nIn\nFigure 7, we illustrate the evolution of generated images\nas we increment the caching interval. A discernible trend\nemerges as a gradual reduction in time, revealing that the\nprimary features of the images remain consistent with their\npredecessors. However, subtle details such as the color of\nclothing and the shape of the cat undergo modifications.\nQuantitative insights are provided in Table 1 and Figure 6,\nwhere with an interval N < 5, there is only a slight reduc-\ntion in the quality of the generated image.\n5. Limitations\nThe primary limitation of our method originates from its de-\npendence on the pre-defined structure of the pre-trained dif-\nfusion model. Specifically, when a model\u2019s shallowest skip\nbranch encompasses a substantial portion of computation,\nsuch as 50% of the whole model, the achievable speedup\nModel\nDataset\nDeepCache\nw/o Cached Features\nDDPM\nCifar10\n9.74\n192.98\nLDM-4-G\nImageNet\n7.36\n312.12\nTable 5.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm, DeepCache,\nto accelerate the diffusion model. Our strategy employs the\nsimilarity observed in high-level features across adjacent\nsteps of the diffusion model, thereby mitigating the compu-\ntational overhead associated with redundant high-level fea-\nture calculations. Additionally, we leverage the structural\nattributes in the U-Net architecture to facilitate the updat-\ning of low-level features. Through the adoption of Deep-\nCache, a noteworthy acceleration in computational speed is\nachieved. Empirical evaluations on several datasets and dif-\nfusion models demonstrate that DeepCache surpass other\ncompression methods that focus on the reduction of param-\neter size. Moreover, the proposed algorithm demonstrates\ncomparable and even slightly superior generation quality\ncompared to existing techniques such as DDIM and PLMS,\nthereby offering a new perspective in the field.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Martin Arjovsky, Soumith Chintala, and L\u00b4eon Bottou.\nWasserstein generative adversarial networks.\nIn Interna-\ntional conference on machine learning, pages 214\u2013223.\nPMLR, 2017. 2\n[2] Omri Avrahami, Dani Lischinski, and Ohad Fried.

Varying Hyper-parameters in Non-uniform\n1:N Strategy\nIn the non-uniform 1:N strategy, the two hyper-parameters\ninvolved are the center c and the power p, which is used to\ndetermine the sequence of timesteps for conducting the en-\ntire model inference. We test on LDM-4-G for the impact of\nthese hyper-parameters. Results are shown in Table 7 and\nTable 8. From these two tables, a clear trend is evident in\nthe observations: as the parameters p and c are incremented,\nthere is an initial improvement in the generated image qual-\nity followed by a subsequent decline. This pattern affirms\nthe effectiveness of the strategy and also aligns with the lo-\ncation of the significant decrease in similarity observed in\nFigure 2(c).\nImageNet 256 \u00d7 256\nCenter\nFID \u2193\nsFID \u2193\nIS \u2191\nPrecision \u2191\nRecall \u2191\nc = 10\n8.26\n8.47\n160.3\n75.69\n48.93\nc = 20\n8.17\n8.46\n161.18\n75.77\n48.95\nc = 50\n7.77\n8.16\n163.74\n76.23\n49.18\nc = 80\n7.36\n7.76\n166.21\n76.93\n49.75\nc = 100\n7.16\n7.51\n167.52\n77.30\n49.64\nc = 120\n7.11\n7.34\n167.85\n77.44\n50.08\nc = 150\n7.33\n7.36\n166.04\n77.09\n49.98\nc = 200\n8.09\n7.79\n160.50\n75.85\n49.69\nTable 7.

Comparing non-uniform and uniform 1:N strategy in class-conditional generation for ImageNet using LDM-4-G. *We regenerate\nthe images using the official checkpoint of LDM-4-G.\nThe optimal hyper-parameter values employed in our exper-\niments are detailed in Table 10.\nFrom the selected hyper-parameters, we found out that\nthe optimal values vary slightly across different datasets. A\nnoticeable trend is observed, indicating that the majority of\noptimal parameters tend to center around the 15th timestep,\naccompanied by a power value of approximately 1.4.\nC. Non-uniform 1:N v.s. Uniform 1:N\nWe have shown the comparison of the non-uniform 1:N ver-\nsus uniform 1:N strategy on Stable Diffusion in Figure 6.\nHere, we extend the comparison to ImageNet with LDM-4-\nG, and the corresponding results are detailed in Table 11.\nIn accordance with the observations from Table 11, a\nconsistent pattern emerges compared to the findings on\nStable Diffusion. Notably, when employing a substantial\ncaching interval, the non-uniform strategy demonstrates a\nnotable improvement, with the FID increasing from 8.23\nto 7.36 with N=20. However, when dealing with a smaller\ncaching interval (N<5), the strategy does not yield an en-\nhancement in image quality. In fact, in certain cases, it may\neven lead to a slight degradation of images, as evidenced by\nthe FID increasing from 3.39 to 3.46 for N=2.\nD. Varying Skip Branches\nIn Table 12, we show the impact on image quality as we\nvary the skip branch for executing DeepCache. For our ex-\nperiments, we employ the uniform 1:N strategy with N=5,\nand the sampling of DDIM still takes 100 steps.\nFrom\nthe results in the table, we observe that the choice of skip\nbranch introduces a trade-off between speed and image fi-\ndelity. Specifically, opting for the first skip branch with no\ndown-sampling blocks and one up-sampling block yields\napproximately 3\u00d7 acceleration, accompanied by a reduc-\ntion in FID to 7.14. Additionally, certain skip branches ex-\nhibit significant performance variations, particularly the 6-\nth branch. The results emphasize an extra trade-off between\nspeed and image quality, complementing the earlier noted\ntrade-off linked to different sampling steps. This particular\ntrade-off operates at the level of model size granularity and\ncan be achieved without incurring additional costs.\nCIFAR-10 32 \u00d7 32\nSkip Branch\nMACs \u2193\nThroughput \u2191\nSpeed \u2191\nFID \u2193\n1\n1.60G\n29.60\n3.023\u00d7\n7.14\n2\n2.24G\n22.24\n2.272\u00d7\n5.94\n3\n3.01G\n18.11\n1.850\u00d7\n5.73\n4\n3.89G\n15.44\n1.577\u00d7\n5.69\n5\n4.58G\n13.15\n1.343\u00d7\n5.51\n6\n5.31G\n11.46\n1.171\u00d7\n4.93\n7\n5.45G\n11.27\n1.151\u00d7\n4.92\n8\n5.60G\n11.07\n1.131\u00d7\n4.76\n9\n5.88G\n10.82\n1.105\u00d7\n4.54\n10\n5.95G\n10.73\n1.096\u00d7\n4.57\n11\n5.99G\n10.67\n1.089\u00d7\n4.52\n12\n6.03G\n10.59\n1.082\u00d7\n4.48\nTable 12.

We encourage\nreaders to click and play the video clips in this figure using Adobe Acrobat. For legal issues, we cannot display the human swap results.\n1. Introduction\nDiffusion-based video editing [5, 11, 29, 34, 42, 57, 58, 64]\nis an emerging field that harnesses the capabilities of pre-\ntrained text-to-image/video diffusion models [16, 19, 43,\n49] to facilitate a range of video editing tasks, includ-\ning style change and subject/background swapping. The\nmain challenge in video editing lies in how to extract mo-\ntion from the source video and transfer it to the edited\nvideo while ensuring temporal consistency. Pioneer Tune-\nA-Video [57] implicitly encodes source motion in the diffu-\nsion model weights by tuning from the source video. While\nit demonstrates versatile applications for video editing, the\ntemporal consistency is far from satisfactory. Subsequent\nworks make use of various dense correspondences extracted\n2\nfrom the source video, including attention maps [30, 42],\nedge/depth maps [11, 29, 60, 64], optical flows [60], and\ndeformation fields [5, 7] for video editing. While achieving\nbetter temporal consistency, dense correspondence imposes\nstrict shape constraints on the target edit, which makes it\nineffective for video editing with shape changes.\nTo embark on video editing with shape change, we delve\ninto a challenging task: customized video subject swapping.\nUnlike the conventional video subject swapping addressed\nin previous works [5, 60, 64], where the swapped subject\nconforms to the shape of source subject, customized sub-\njects have a clearly defined identity in terms of both appear-\nance and shape. These distinctive characteristics should be\npreserved in the target edit. Therefore, previous structure-\npreserved video editing methods are often ineffective for\nthis problem, as shown in Fig. 1(b).\nTo address customized video subject swapping, our pri-\nmary insight is that the subject\u2019s motion trajectory can be\neffectively described using a small number of semantic\npoints. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the motion trajectory of an\nairplane can be depicted by semantic points located at its\nwings, nose, and tail. This insight naturally leads us to the\nfollowing question: Can we utilize these semantic points\nas correspondences to align the motion trajectory while re-\nlaxing the shape constraints in video editing? To answer\nthis question, we conduct a toy experiments and observe\nthat it is possible to learn semantic point correspondence\nfor a specific video subject using just a small number of\nsource video frames. Users can interact with learned se-\nmantic points to generate unseen poses or modify the shape\nof the video subject. These observations suggest the po-\ntential for integrating semantic point correspondence into\nvideo editing, provided that we can obtain an accurate se-\nmantic point sequence for the target edit.\nTo unleash the potential of semantic point correspon-\ndence, we introduce the VideoSwap framework for cus-\ntomized video subject swapping, which comprises the fol-\nlowing primary designs: 1) Integrating the motion layer into\nthe image diffusion model to ensure essential temporal con-\nsistency. 2) Registering semantic points on the source video\nand utilizing them to transfer the motion trajectory of source\nsubject to the target edit. 3) Introducing user-point interac-\ntions (e.g., removing or dragging points) for various seman-\ntic point correspondence.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Empirical observations that reveal the potential of seman-\ntic point correspondence for aligning motion trajectories\nand changing shapes in video editing.\n\u2022 The VideoSwap framework, which minimizes user inter-\nvention while unleashing the potential of semantic point\ncorrespondence in customized video subject swapping.\n\u2022 State-of-the-art results in customized video subject swap-\nping, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Diffusion-Based Video Editing\nStructure-Preserved Video Editing.\nFateZero [42] and\nVideo-P2P [30] extract cross- and self-attention from the\nsource video to control spatial layout. To achieve stricter\nalignment of temporal consistency with the source video,\nRerender-A-Video [60], Gen-1 [11], ControlVideo [64],\nand TokenFlow [13] extract and align optical flow,\ndepth/edge maps, and nearest-neighbour field from the\nsource video respectively, resulting in improved temporal\nconsistency. StableVideo [5], VidEdit [7], and CoDEF [38]\nlearn the canonical space for editing following the Lay-\nered Neural Atlas [23] or the deformation field in Dy-\nnamic Nerf [33, 41]. While achieving promising results in\nstructure-preserved video editing, the above methods based\non various dense correspondence are not suitable for han-\ndling subject swapping involving shape changes.\nVideo Editing with Shape Change.\nTune-A-Video\n(TAV) [57] and FateZero [42] with TAV checkpoint can be\nutilized for video editing with shape change, as they im-\nplicitly encode the motion in model weights through tuning\non the source video. However, they suffer from structure\nand appearance leakage due to model tuning. Shape-aware\nediting [27] is built on the Layered Neural Atlas [23], em-\nploying semantic correspondences to estimate shape defor-\nmation and warp the atlas. Nevertheless, texture warping\nwill lead to unrealistic textures.\nVideo Diffusion Models. Previous video editing primar-\nily relies on the text-to-image diffusion model [43]. How-\never, recent advancements are occurring in video founda-\ntion models [3, 16, 55, 62]. In this work, we add a motion\nlayer [16] to the image diffusion model to provide essential\ntemporal consistency for video editing, and we focus on ex-\nploiting semantic point correspondence to align the motion\ntrajectory of the video subject.\n2.2. Point Correspondence\nPoint Correspondence in Diffusion Models. DIFT [52]\ninitially uncovers robust semantic point correspondences in\ndiffusion models. Building upon the observation in DIFT,\nsubsequent works, DragDiffusion [48] and DragonDiffu-\nsion [35] extend DragGAN [39] to support interactive point-\nbased image editing in diffusion models. However, point\ncorrespondences and interactive drag-based editing are sel-\ndom investigated for video editing.\nTracking Any Point in Video. TAP-Vid [9] first introduces\nthe problem of tracking any point (TAP). Unlike optical\nflow estimation, TAP requires the establishment of long-\nrange correspondence for all points in a video. In our work,\nwe use TAP to reduce human intervention in annotating sub-\nject keypoints and acquire long-range motion estimation.\nAlthough several works [9, 10, 22, 56] address the TAP\n3\nFigure 3. Toy experiment exploring semantic point correspon-\ndence. We encourage readers to click and play the video clips\nin this figure using Adobe Acrobat.\nproblem, we choose to employ Co-Tracker [22], which is\nthe most efficient solution available.\n2.3. Concept Customization\nConcept customization is mainly categorized into tuning-\nbased approaches [12, 15, 26, 44, 54] and tuning-free solu-\ntions [21, 45, 47, 59, 61]. Tuning-free solutions are fast but\ntypically adhere closely to the provided reference image and\nlack variation. On the other hand, tuning-based solutions\ncan leverage multi-view images to ensure variation in the\ngiven concepts and maintain the same inference behavior to\npretrained diffusion models. In this paper, we employ the\ntuning-based ED-LoRA [15] for encoding subject identity.\nIn addition to image customization for generation (i.e.,\nnoise to image), several works employ customization tech-\nniques for subject-driven image editing (i.e., image to im-\nage). CustomEdit [6] and Photoswap [14] propose the invert\nconcept identity to text token and utilize attention swap-\nping to preserve the layout and pose of the source image.\nWhile these methods achieve promising swapping results,\nthe injection of attention maps tends to constrain the shape\nand leak color information to the target swapped result, as\nobserved in DreamEdit [28]. In contrast to them, we only\nalign the semantic points\u2019 correspondence with the source\nsubject and thus relax the shape constraints, better revealing\nthe concept identity.\nFigure 4. Overview of the VideoSwap pipeline for customized\nvideo subject swapping.\n3. VideoSwap\nIn this section, we start by presenting a toy experiment to il-\nlustrate our motivation to explore semantic point correspon-\ndence in Sec. 3.1. Subsequently, we offer an overview of the\nVideoSwap pipeline for customized video subject swapping\nin Sec. 3.2. Following that, we explain the process of inject-\ning semantic point correspondence in Sec. 3.3 to Sec. 3.5.\n3.1. Motivation\nDense correspondences explored in previous video edit-\ning methods [5, 11, 13, 38, 60] restrict the subject\u2019s shape\nchange in the edited video. Therefore, our goal is to find a\nmore flexible correspondence that can transfer the source\nsubject\u2019s motion trajectory without imposing strict shape\nconstraints. Motivated by this, we investigate sparse se-\nmantic points as correspondences. Unlike dense correspon-\ndences such as depth, edge, and optical flow, which are low-\nlevel cues shared across all video subjects, semantic points\nvary with different open-world concepts. Therefore, it is not\nfeasible to train a general condition model for injecting se-\nmantic point correspondence. Instead, the question we aim\nto address in this section is, is it possible to learn semantic\npoint control for a specific source video subject using only\na small number of source video frames?\nToy Experiment Setting. To address the above question,\nwe perform a toy experiment. Firstly, for a given video, we\nmanually define a set of semantic points. Next, we annotate\nthe same set of points on eight frames of this video. Finally,\nwe train a T2I-Adapter [36] on these data pairs, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 3(a, b), to determine whether these semantic\npoints can be used to control the source video subject.\nObservation 1:\nSemantic points optimized on source\nvideo frames have the potential to align the subject\u2019s mo-\ntion trajectory and change the subject\u2019s shape. As shown\nin Fig. 3(c, left), we drag the points on the cat\u2019s face. De-\nspite this edited point map is not in the training data, the re-\n4\nFigure 5. Pipelines for semantic point extraction (Sec. 3.3) and semantic point registration (Sec. 3.4) in VideoSwap. In semantic point\nextraction, users define semantic points at a keyframe. We then extract the trajectory and embedding of those semantic points from the\nvideo. In semantic point registration, the semantic point embedding is projected by multiple 2-layer learnable MLPs, placed in empty\nfeatures based on their coordinates, and then added element-wise to the diffusion model as motion guidance.\nsulting image closely follows the adjusted semantic points,\neffectively generating the unseen pose of the subject. As\nshown in Fig. 3(c, right), when we drag the boundary se-\nmantic points of the car, the edited subject will also reshape\nto align with the semantic point. This suggests the potential\nof utilizing semantic points to align the motion trajectory or\nchange the shape when a sequence of dragged points for all\nvideo frames is accessible.\nObservation 2:\nSemantic points optimized on source\nvideo frames can transfer across semantic and low-level\nchanges. As demonstrated in Fig. 3(d), when we replace\nthe source subject with different semantics or modify the\nlow-level information in the prompts, the optimized seman-\ntic point can also control the pose or shape of the target\nconcept. This suggests that the semantic point can be trans-\nferred across both semantic and low-level changes.\n3.2. Overview of VideoSwap\n3.2.1\nTask Formulation\nIn this paper, we focus on customized video subject swap-\nping, with the goal of subject replacement and background\npreservation. Subject replacement requires preserving the\nidentity of the target subject in the swapped results, en-\ncompassing both its appearance and shape. Simultaneously,\nbackground preservation requires the unedited background\narea to remain the same with the source video. The primary\nchallenge of this task lies in aligning the motion trajectory\nof the source subject while preserving the identity of the\ntarget concept, particularly its shape.\n3.2.2\nOverall Pipeline\nThe VideoSwap pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 4. Following\nthe latent diffusion model [43], we encode the source video\nwith a VAE encoder to obtain the latent space representa-\ntion z0. Subsequently, DDIM inversion [8, 50] is applied\nto transform the clean latent z0 back to the noisy latent zT .\nAfter obtaining the DDIM inverted noise zT , we replace the\nsource subject in the text prompt with the target subject and\ndenoise it using the DDIM scheduler [50]. In this denois-\ning process, we introduce semantic point correspondence to\nguide the subject\u2019s motion trajectory, as detailed in Sec. 3.3-\nSec. 3.5. To preserve the unedited background, we leverage\nthe concept of latent blending [1, 2], further explained in\nthe Sec. 6.1. Additionally, we incorporate the following de-\nsigns:\nAdopting Motion Layers. We integrate the motion lay-\ners [3, 16] into the image diffusion model to ensure essential\ntemporal consistency for video editing.\nSupporting Predefined and Customized Concepts. We\nsupport both predefined concepts from the pretrained model\nand customized concepts. To create customized concepts,\nwe train ED-LoRA [15] on a set of representative images\nto encode their identity. After training, these concept ED-\nLoRAs can be used at the inference time.\n3.3. Semantic Point Extraction\nWe first extract the trajectories of semantic points and their\nassociated semantic embeddings from the source video.\nPoint Trajectory Extraction. As depicted in Fig. 5, for\na video containing N frames, users specify K semantic\npoints at a keyframe i. These user-defined semantic points\n5\nFigure 6. Point displacement propagation based on layered neural atlas (LNA) [20, 23]. Once a trained LNA is provided, users can drag a\nsemantic point at the keyframe, and this displacement is consistently propagated to every frame through the canonical space of the LNA.\nare then propagated to the remaining N \u2212 1 frames using a\npoint tracker [22] or detector [4]. Subsequently, the motion\ntrajectory of all semantic points in the entire video is ob-\ntained and represented as Pcoord = {Tra(k)|k = 1...K},\nwhere Tra(k) = {(xk\nn, yk\nn, n)|n = 1...N} represents the\nmotion trajectory of semantic point k across all N frames.\nPoint Embedding Extraction. To leverage semantic point\ncorrespondence, it is crucial to associate each point with\nits semantics. Specifically, we extract the DIFT [52] fea-\nture Dn for each frame n. Subsequently, the point em-\nbedding for semantic point k at frame n is obtained as\nvk\nn = Dn(xk\nn, yk\nn), where (xk\nn, yk\nn) is retrieved from Pcoord.\nFollowing this, we aggregate the point embeddings acquired\nfrom all N frames to obtain the final embedding for each\nsemantic point k by vk =\n1\nN\nPN\nn=1 vk\nn. Finally, we obtain\nthe semantic embedding for all semantic points, succinctly\nrepresented as Pemb = {vk|k = 1...K}.\n3.4. Semantic Point Registration\nAfter acquiring the motion trajectory Pcoord and the em-\nbedding Pemb for semantic points, we register these seman-\ntic points on the source video to enable them to offer motion\nguidance for the video subject.\nSparse Motion Feature Creation.\nTo utilize semantic\npoints as guidance, we generate sparse motion features\ninfused with semantic point embeddings, making them\ncompatible with the Unet encoder.\nWe denote Fenc =\n{F1\nenc, F2\nenc, F3\nenc, F4\nenc} as the multi-scale intermediate\nfeature of the Unet encoder. For an input VAE-encoded la-\ntent with spatial-temporal size (H, W, N), the feature size\nof Fl\nenc for each Unet stage l \u2208 [1, 4] can be computed as\n(H/2l, W/2l, N).\nAs depicted in Fig. 5 and detailed in Algorithm. 1, we\ncreate a series of multi-scale conditional features Fc =\n{F1\nc, F2\nc, F3\nc, F4\nc}.\nNotably, Fc shares the same size as\nFenc and is initialized with zero vectors. And we intro-\nduce a series of learnable MLPs \u03d5 = {\u03d5l|l \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}},\neach of \u03d5l project the point embedding to match the fea-\nture dimension of the corresponding Fl\nc. Then, for each\npoint (xk\nn, yk\nn, n) \u2208 Pcoord, we compute its corresponding\nspatial-temporal coordinate (x, y, n) at l-th Unet stage and\nassign the projected embedding based on the coordinate by\nFl\nc(x, y, n) = \u03d5l(Pemb(k)).\nIt is crucial to emphasize that the motion feature Fc\ndemonstrates high sparsity, with only the semantic point tra-\njectories containing the feature embeddings. Finally, Fc are\nadded element-wise into the intermediate feature Fenc of\nUnet encoder as motion guidance:\nFl\nenc = Fl\nenc + Fl\nc, l \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n(1)\nAlgorithm 1: Sparse Motion Feature Creation\n1 Input:\n2\n1.

Our ob-\njective is to optimize the projection MLPs (\u03d5) to facilitate\nbetter motion guidance from semantic points. This opti-\nmization objective is defined as\nmin\n\u03d5 E\u03f5\u223cN(0,I),t\u223cU(Tmin,T )||[\u03f5\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t, p, \u03d5(Pemb))]\u2299\u2126(Pcoord)||2\n2,\n(2)\nwhere p represents the embedding for the text prompt,\nand \u2126(Pcoord) denotes the binary mask that only turns on\naround the semantic point.\nWe adopt two techniques to enhance the learning of se-\nmantic point correspondences in Eq. (2). The first tech-\nnique is semantic-enhanced schedule, controlled by Tmin.\nWe set Tmin = T/2 to enhance the learning at the higher\n6\nFigure 7. Comparison of VideoSwap with several baselines built upon the same foundational model. The only difference lies in adopting\ndifferent motion guidance. We encourage readers to click and play the video clips in this figure using Adobe Acrobat.\ntimestep, which prevents overfitting to low-level details and\nimproves semantic point alignment. The second technique,\npoint patch loss, constrains the computation of the loss to a\nlocal patch near each semantic point, which reduces struc-\nture leakage into the target swap. This is implemented by\nthe a loss mask \u2126 in Eq. (2).\n3.5. User-Point Interaction at Inference Time\nIn Sec. 3.3, users define semantic points at the source video\nkeyframe, and we subsequently extract their trajectory and\nsemantic embedding in the video. To utilize these semantic\npoints as correspondences, we register them on the source\nvideo in Sec. 3.4. Following these two steps, these semantic\npoints become applicable for controlling the motion of the\ntarget object. In this section, we introduce user-point inter-\naction to address various semantic point correspondence.\nAdopting Source Point Sequence. If there exist one-to-\none semantic point correspondence between the source sub-\nject and the target subject, such as swapping the dog with\nV catA as illustrated in Fig. 1, we directly use the source\npoint sequence as the motion guidance.\nRemoving Parts of Semantic Point.\nWhen there only\nexists partial semantic point correspondence between the\nsource subject and the target subject, we can remove re-\ndundant points to loosen shape constraints. For example,\nin scenarios such as swapping an airplane for a helicopter,\nas depicted in Fig. 1, we remove semantic points associated\nwith the airplane\u2019s wings, given that helicopters typically\nlack wings. The remaining semantic points on the airplane\u2019s\nnose and tail are retained as motion guidance.\nDragging of Semantic Point. In situations where there ex-\nists semantic point correspondence between the source and\ntarget subjects, but misalignment occurs due to shape mor-\nphing, we provide users the option to manually drag the\nsemantic points on a keyframe for better alignment of the\nshape changes. For instance, when swapping a jeep (tall and\nnarrow) for a VcarA (sports car, low and wide) as illustrated\nin Fig. 1, users can drag the semantic points to accurately\nreflect the shape change.\nEditing the shape change by dragging semantic points\non a single frame is straightforward. However, consistently\npropagating these semantic point displacement over time is\nnon-trivial, mainly because of the complex camera and sub-\nject motion in the video. Therefore, we introduce point dis-\nplacement propagation to solve this problem.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 6, we follow the Layered Neural\nAtlas (LNA) [20, 23] to learn the canonical space, as de-\ntailed in the Sec. 6.2. Following LNA [20, 23], we establish\na forward coordinate mapping from the video to the canon-\nical space, denoted as M: (x, y, f) \u2192 (u, v), along with its\ncorresponding backward mapping B: (u, v, f) \u2192 (x, y).\nGiven a semantic point, with coordinates at the keyframe\nfkey represented as (x, y, fkey), its trajectory over time can\nbe expressed as a function of time f: (x(f), y(f)) = P(f).\nSuppose a user drag it to a new position at (x + dx, y +\ndy, fkey), we aim to estimate the edited trajectory P \u2032(f)\nfor f = {0, ..., N}. We resort to LNA\u2019s representation, and\nfirst compute a linearized estimation of its shifted position\non the canonical coordinate:\n[du, dv]T = JM(x, y, fkey)[dx, dy]T ,\n(3)\nwhere JM denote the Jacobian matrix with respect to (x, y).\nNext, at a given time f, we estimate the edited coordinate\nin the pixel space as\nP \u2032(f) = P(f) + JB(u, v, f)[du, dv]T ,\n(4)\nwhere (u, v) = B(x, y, fkey) and JB denote the Jacobian\nmatrix with respect to (u, v). In practice, we approximate\nthe Jacobian computation by\nJM =\n\u0014Ms(x + \u03b5, y, f) \u2212 Ms(x, y, f)\nMs(x, y + \u03b5, f) \u2212 Ms(x, y, f)\n\u0015T \u00141/\u03b5\n1/\u03b5\n\u0015\n,\n(5)\nJB =\n\u0014Bs(u + \u03b5, v, f) \u2212 Bs(u, v, f)\nBs(u, v + \u03b5, f) \u2212 Bs(u, v, f)\n\u0015T \u00141/\u03b5\n1/\u03b5\n\u0015\n,\n(6)\nwhere \u03b5 represents the small coordinate shift. We then use\nthis edited trajectory P \u2032(f) for the dragged semantic point\nduring inference.\n7\nFigure 8. Ablation Study of our VideoSwap.

Human Evaluation on Video Subject Swapping Results.\n4. Experiments\nWe implement our method using the Latent Diffusion\nModel [43] and adopt the motion layer in AnimateDiff [16]\nas the foundational model. All videos consist of 16 frames.\nThe primary time cost is registering semantic points in the\nvideo, which requires about 3 minutes per video. Additional\nimplementation details, as well as time and memory cost\nanalyses, are included in the Sec. 7.2.\n4.1. Qualitative Comparison\nComparison with the State-of-the-Art. We qualitatively\ncompare to Tune-A-Video [57], FateZero [42], Rerender-A-\nVideo [60], TokenFlow [13] and StableVideo [5] in Fig. 1.\nPrevious methods are less effective in revealing the correct\nshape of the target subject. Compared to them, VideoSwap\ncan achieve a significant shape change while aligning the\nsource motion trajectory.\nComparison with Baselines on AnimateDiff.\nAs most\nstate-of-the-art methods are based on image diffusion mod-\nels, we also compare VideoSwap to several baselines on the\nAnimateDiff. The only distinctions from VideoSwap lie in\ndifferent motion guidance, as shown in the results in Fig. 7:\n\u2022 DDIM: The DDIM sampling without other motion guid-\nance cannot produce the correct motion trajectory.\n\u2022 DDIM+Tune-A-Video: If we tune the model as [57] to in-\nject source motion, it achieves correct motion but suffers\nfrom severe structure and appearance leakage.\n\u2022 DDIM+T2I-Adapter: If we add spatial controls [36], such\nas depth, to control the editing, we observe that 1) the\nshape is restricted by the source, and 2) the deformable\nmotion cannot follow the source video.\nCompared to all constructed baselines, our VideoSwap with\nsemantic point correspondence can effectively align the mo-\ntion trajectory while preserving the target concept\u2019s identity.\n4.2. Quantitative Comparison\nWe conduct both automatic and human evaluations to quan-\ntitatively compare VideoSwap with previous state-of-the-art\nmethods and several baselines on AnimateDiff. Detailed\nevaluation settings and automatic evaluation results are pro-\nvided in the Sec. 8. For human evaluation, we distribute\n1000 questionnaires on Amazon Mturk to assess various\ncriteria in customized video subject swapping. From the\nhuman evaluation results in Table. 1, our method achieves a\nclear advantage over the compared methods.\n4.3. Ablation Study\nSparse Motion Feature. There are several variants for en-\ncoding semantic points to generate motion guidance. The\nmost straightforward approach is to encode the point map\nof semantic points using T2I-Adapter [36]. However, this\nmethod leads to severe overfitting, as illustrated in Fig. 8(a).\nThe issue arises because the encoded feature added to the\n8\ndiffusion model is non-sparse, and the background also con-\ntains features that may overfit to the source video. We use\nMLPs to encode point embeddings, positioning them in the\nempty feature to create sparse motion features for guidance\nwithout compromising video quality. Regarding point em-\nbeddings, we opt for DIFT embeddings, which inherently\ncarry robust semantics. Compared to randomly initialized\nlearnable embeddings, our approach achieves similar results\nwith 3\u00d7 less time for point registration step.\nPoint Patch Loss. In the semantic point registration, we\nemploy a point patch loss to reconstruct the local patch sur-\nrounding each semantic point. If we omit the point patch\nloss and opt to directly reconstruct the entire video, we ob-\nserve that the source structure leaks into the target swapped\nresults and thus produce artifacts, as depicted in Fig. 8(b).\nSemantic-Enhanced Schedule. Our goal is to employ se-\nmantic points to transfer motion trajectories, acting as a\nlinkage between the source and target subjects. Therefore,\nwe aim for the semantic points to emphasize high-level\nsemantic alignment without transferring low-level details.\nThis objective is achieved by registering points only dur-\ning the early sampling steps, i.e., Tmin = T\n2 in Eq. (2). As\nshown in Fig. 8(c), this technique prevents the model from\nlearning excessive low-level details and enhances semantic\npoint alignment.\nDrag-based Point Control. As illustrated in Fig. 8(d), our\ngoal is to swap the black swan to the duck. If we directly\nuse the source point sequence as guidance, the duck\u2019s neck\nconforms to the shape of the black swan, resulting in an in-\nferior identity. However, by employing the proposed point\ndisplacement propagation, we can drag the semantic point\nat the keyframe, ensuring a consistent motion trajectory af-\nter dragging. Utilizing the dragged semantic point trajec-\ntory as motion guidance allows us to accurately establish\nthe identity of the duck.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper uncovers the potential of semantic point corre-\nspondence in aligning motion trajectories and altering the\nsubject\u2019s identity in video editing. From there, we present\nVideoSwap, a framework that minimizes human interven-\ntion while utilizing semantic point correspondences for cus-\ntomized video subject swapping. Through user-point in-\nteractions like point removal or dragging, we address var-\nious semantic point correspondence. VideoSwap facilitates\nshape changes in the target swap while aligning the motion\ntrajectory with the source subject, demonstrating state-of-\nthe-art results in customized video subject swapping.\nReferences\n[1] Omri Avrahami, Dani Lischinski, and Ohad Fried.

Latent Blend\nGiven our focus on subject swapping, where the objective is\nto maintain the unedited background region identical to the\nsource video, this is achieved through latent blend [3, 16],\nas shown in Fig. 4.\nThe key idea is that the latent noise in DDIM denoising\nand DDIM inversion provides information for the swapped\nsubject and background, respectively.\nThese two latent\nnoises can be blended using a mask that indicates the fore-\nground region, thus blending the swapped target with the\nsource background.\nTo initiate the process, we acquire the foreground mask\nfor timestep t as Mt = Mt\ni \u222a Mt\nd, formed by merging the\nsubject masks Mi during inversion and Md during denois-\ning at the same timestep t. This subject mask is automat-\nically generated through the cross-attention of the concept\ntoken, following the approach of Prompt2Prompt [17].\nSubsequently, the foreground mask is used to blend\nthe latent features, resulting in zt = (1 \u2212 Mt) \u00b7 zt\ni +\nMt \u00b7 zt\nd, where zt\ni and zt\nd represent the latent features of\ntimestep t in DDIM inversion and DDIM denoising, respec-\ntively. Through latent blend, we can effectively preserve the\nunedited background in the source video.\n6.2. Layered Neural Atlas Training\nAs mentioned in Sec. 3.5 of the main paper, we introduce\ninteractive dragging on the key frame for handling point\ncorrespondence with shape morphing in customized video\nsubject swapping. This function is supported by the learned\ncanonical space of Layered Neural Atlas [23] (LNA). Here,\nwe present a detailed formulation of LNA.\nLNA [23] represents a video through the following three\nsets of parameterized MLPs:\n1. Coordinate Mapping MLPs. The coordinate mapping\nMLPs map the spatial-temporal coordinates of video\npixels to the 2D canonical space (i.e., the UV map), de-\nnoted as M: (x, y, f) \u2192 (u, v). We employ separate\nmappings, Ms and Mb, for the foreground subject and\nbackground, respectively.\nAdditionally, following the\napproach of INVE [20], we include a background map-\nping Bs: (u, v) \u2192 (x, y, f) to learn the coordinate map-\nping of the foreground subject from the canonical space\nback to the video pixel.\n2. Atlas MLPs. The atlas MLPs, denoted as A: (u, v) \u2192\n(r, g, b), learn to predict the color of the coordinates on\nthe UV map.\n3. Alpha MLPs.\nThe alpha MLPs, denoted as M\u03b1:\n(x, y, f) \u2192 \u03b1, predict the blending ratio \u03b1 of the color\nvalue from the subject atlas and background atlas.\nBased on these sets of learnable MLPs, the training objec-\ntive of LNA is to reconstruct the RGB values of the source\nvideo, accompanied by the following regularization losses:\n1. Rigidity Loss. The rigidity loss encourages the learned\nmapping from pixel coordinates in the video to the 2D\ncanonical space to exhibit local rigidity.\n2. Consistency Loss. The consistency loss encourages the\nmapping of corresponding video pixels across consecu-\ntive frames to be consistent, with correspondence esti-\nmated through pre-computed optical flow.\n3. Sparsity Loss. The sparsity loss encourages the many-\nto-one mapping from the video coordinates to the canon-\nical coordinates, penalizing duplicate contents in the\ncanonical space.\nWe refer the reader to the LNA [23] paper for the complete\nformulation.\n6.3. Discussion the Relation to Human Keypoint\nThe ControlNet [63] and T2I-Adapter [36] also incorporate\ncontrol over human keypoints. These human keypoints can\nbe viewed as a type of sparse semantic points, where the\nsemantic position and total number of human keypoints are\npredefined by the existing pose detectors, and their semantic\nembedding for controlling the diffusion model is implicitly\naligned through large-scale paired data. However, defin-\ning keypoints or collecting paired data for open-set concepts\nproves challenging due to the variability in semantic points.\nTherefore, our method provides a more generic framework\nfor point-based video editing, with human keypoints serv-\ning as a specific use case within our framework.\n7. Experimental Details\n7.1. Implementation Details\nWe implement our method using the Latent Diffusion\nModel [43] and incorporate the pretrained motion layer\nfrom AnimateDiff [16] as the foundational model. All ex-\nperiments are conducted on an Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPU.\nAll video samples consist of 16 frames with a time stride of\n4, matching the temporal window of the motion layer in An-\nimateDiff. We crop the videos to two alternate resolutions\n(H \u00d7 W): 512 \u00d7 512 and 448 \u00d7 768. For all experiments,\nwe employ the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-\n1\n5, optimizing for 100 iterations. Regarding the point patch\nloss, we use a patch size of 4\u00d74 around the semantic point.\n7.2. Time Cost Analysis\nIn this section, we analyze the time cost of editing a video\nin VideoSwap. All time costs are calculated on an Nvidia\nA100 GPU to process a 16 frame video clip.\nTime Cost of Preprocess. The preprocessing step involves\n(1) extracting point trajectories and their DIFT embeddings,\nand (2) registering those semantic points to guide the diffu-\nsion model, and (3) generate DDIM-inverted noise. The ex-\ntraction of trajectories and embeddings takes approximately\n30 seconds. The registration step requires 100 iterations,\ntaking about 3 minutes. And the DDIM inversion of 50\nsteps takes approximately 30 seconds. To summarize, it\ntakes about 4 minutes to pre-process a video for editing.\nTime Cost of Each Edit. Then for each edit, the time cost\nof VideoSwap remain the similar to AnimateDiff [16], ne-\ncessitating 50 seconds with the latent blend technique. The\nintroduction of semantic point correspondence does not no-\ntably increase the time cost, given its lightweight computa-\ntion.\nTime Cost of User-Point Interaction. The time cost for\nuser-point interaction (e.g., removing or dragging a point)\ncan be negligible. Dragging a point at the keyframe only\ntakes 1 seconds to propagate to all other frames through a\nlearned layered neural altas (LNA).\nExtra Time Cost in Training LNA. Our support for drag-\nbased editing is built upon a learned LNA of the given\nvideo. In contrast to the original LNA, which necessitates\napproximately 10 hours of training, we do not require full\ntraining as we only adopt the forward/backward coordinate\nmapping. This training process takes about 2 hours for a\nvideo.\n7.3. Memory Cost Analysis\nThe overall memory cost is similar to AnimateDiff, where\nwe don\u2019t incur significant additional memory costs, as our\nsemantic points and MLPs are lightweight. It only requires\na memory cost of 16/12 GB for point registration and infer-\nence, respectively.\n8. Quantitative Evaluation\n8.1. Dataset and Evaluation Setting\nWe collect 30 videos from Shutterstock and DAVIS [40].\nEach category\u2014human, animal, and object\u2014comprises 10\nvideos. Besides, we gather 13 customized concepts: 5 for\nhuman characters, 3 for animals, and 5 for objects. Due to\nlegal concerns, we cannot demonstrate qualitative results in-\nvolving human characters. For each source video, we adopt\n8 predefined concepts and 2-5 customized concepts as swap\nMethods/Metrics\nText\nAlignment (\u2191)\nImage\nAlignment (\u2191)\nTemporal\nConsistency (\u2191)\nCompare to Previous Video Editing Methods\nTune-A-Video [57]\n25.34\n-\n95.79\nFateZero [42]\n24.39\n-\n95.49\nText2Video-Zero [25]\n24.85\n-\n95.02\nRerender-A-Video [60]\n24.99\n-\n92.28\nVideoSwap (Ours)\n26.87\n-\n95.93\nCompare to Baselines on AnimateDiff\nw/ DDIM\n27.36\n79.79\n95.89\nw/ DDIM + TAV\n24.75\n75.93\n95.49\nw/ DDIM + T2I-Adapter\n25.86\n77.54\n95.50\nVideoSwap (Ours)\n26.87\n79.87\n95.93\nTable 2.\nAutomatic Quantitative Evaluation on Video Subject\nSwapping Results.\ntargets, yielding approximately 300 edited results. For com-\nparison to previous video-editing methods that don\u2019t sup-\nport customized concepts, we only compute the metric on\npredefined concepts. In comparison to the baselines built\nupon AnimateDiff [16], we compute the metric on both pre-\ndefined concepts and customized concepts.\n8.2. Automatic Evaluation by CLIP-Score\nWe conduct a quantitative evaluation using the automatic\nmetric, CLIP-Score [18]. The metric includes text align-\nment and temporal consistency, following [58]. Addition-\nally, for customized concepts, we follow Custom Diffu-\nsion [26] to compute pairwise image alignment between\neach edited frame and each reference concept image. The\nresults are summarized in Table. 2.\nIn comparison to\nprevious video editing methods, VideoSwap demonstrates\nthe best text alignment and temporal consistency. More-\nover, when compared to baselines built on AnimateDiff, we\nachieve superior image alignment and temporal consistency.\nHowever, it is important to note that CLIP-Score is primar-\nily based on frame-wise computation and may not align well\nwith human perception, as discussed in EvalCrafter [31].\nTherefore, we present these results for reference purposes\nand primarily evaluate and compare using human evalua-\ntion.\n8.3. Human Evaluation Interface\nWe primarily conduct human evaluations to compare differ-\nent methods based on several criteria: subject identity, mo-\ntion alignment, temporal consistency, and overall swapping\npreference. As depicted in Fig. 9, we present the source\nvideo and reference images for the target concept in the in-\nterface and ask users to select their preferred video based on\nvarious criteria related to customized video subject swap-\nping. We distribute 1000 questionnaires on Amazon Mturk.\nThe human evaluation results in Table. 1 of the main paper\nclearly demonstrate our advantage.\n2\nFigure 9.

Human Evaluation for Ablation Study\nWe employ human evaluation to quantitatively assess vari-\nous variants of our methods, and the results are summarized\nin Table. 3. In terms of creating sparse motion features,\nour DIFT embedding significantly outperforms point map +\nT2I-Adapter and the learnable embedding + MLP with the\nsame registration iterations. In comparison to the learnable\nembedding and MLP, our explicit DIFT embedding already\ncontains sufficient semantic information, requiring 3\u00d7 less\ntime to achieve similar preference. The introduction of the\npoint patch loss and semantic-enhanced schedule further en-\nhances VideoSwap, leading to higher preferences compared\nto variants without these enhancements.\n9.

Limitations in point tracking inherited from Co-Tracker [22] in scenarios involving self-occlusion and significant view changes.\n10. Limitation and Future Works\n10.1. Limitation Analysis\nThe limitation of VideoSwap is inherited from inaccurate\npoint tracking and an imperfect canonical space representa-\ntion of Layered Neural Atlas.\nInaccurate Point Tracking by Co-Tracker. VideoSwap\nrelies on accurate point trajectory extraction. However, the\nexisting point tracking method Co-Tracker [22] is not stable\nenough when the video contains self-occlusion and large\nview changes, as shown in Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b). To\naddress this issue, users may choose to remove inaccurate\nsemantic points; however, this would result in less motion\nalignment. Nevertheless, since tracking any point is a newly\nformed problem, any progress in this area can seamlessly\nintegrate into VideoSwap.\nImperfect Canonical Space by Layer Neural Atlas. As\ndiscussed in Layered Neural Atlas (LNA) [23], LNA fails\nto represent videos involving 3D rotations and non-rigid\nmotion with self-occlusion. VideoSwap resorts to LNA to\npropagate the dragged point displacement. Therefore, due\nto the limitations of LNA, we cannot support drag-based\ninteraction in such cases. Improvement in LNA representa-\ntion will further broaden support for drag-based video edit-\ning.\nTime Cost for Interactive Editing.\nThe time cost of\nVideoSwap prohibits its use for real-time interactive edit-\ning. Setting up semantic points for a video takes approx-\nimately 4 minutes. And to support drag-based editing, an\nadditional 2 hours are required to prepare the LNA for the\ngiven video. Furthermore, constrained by diffusion model\nsampling, it takes about 50 seconds to perform an edit,\nfalling short of real-time editing. We anticipate that ad-\nvancements in neural field acceleration [20, 24, 37] and dif-\nfusion model distillation [32, 46, 51] will significantly re-\nduce the preprocess cost and enhance speed for real-time\ninteractive editing.\n10.2. Future Works\nVideoSwap embarks on video editing with shape change.\nWith semantic points as correspondence, VideoSwap can\nsupport interactive editing for large shape changes while\naligning motion trajectories. We list several promising di-\nrections motivated by VideoSwap.\nInteractive Video Editing.\nVideoSwap supports drag-\nbased interaction at the keyframe, propagating the dragged\ndisplacement throughout the entire video and obtaining the\nsource and dragged trajectories with similar motion. As we\ncan obtain the source point trajectory and target point tra-\njectory, future work may extend the idea of DragGAN [39]\nto the video domain for drag-based real video editing.\nVideo Editing with Shape Change.\nVideoSwap has\ndemonstrated promising results in swapping the subject in\nthe source video with a target concept that may have a dif-\nferent shape. In our paper, we focus on the swapping fore-\nground subject, without considering background swapping\nor stylization. Further research could delve into a more gen-\neral framework for video editing involving shape changes,\nthereby enhancing the flexibility of the video editing.\nApplication\nBased\non\nCustomized\nVideo\nEditing.\nVideoSwap has shown promising results in swapping the\nsubject in the source video with a target concept with cus-\ntomized identity. Future work may further investigate its\napplication in movie generation and storytelling by fixing\nsubjects\u2019 identities.\n10.3. Potential Negative Social Impact\nThis project aims to provide the community with an ef-\nfective method to swap their customized concept into the\nvideo. However, a risk exists wherein malicious entities\ncould exploit this framework to create deceptive video with\nreal-world figures, potentially misleading the public. This\nconcern is not unique to our approach but rather a shared\nconsideration in other concept customization methodolo-\ngies. One potential solution to mitigate such risks involves\n4\nadopting methods similar to anti-dreambooth [53], which\nintroduce subtle noise perturbations to the published images\nto mislead the customization process. Additionally, apply-\ning unseen watermarking to the generated video could deter\nmisuse and prevent them from being used without proper\nrecognition.\n5\n"

Introduction\nTeaching machines to understand the visual world with nat-\nural languages has been a long-standing problem in com-\nputer vision [30, 74, 76]. Image captioning is one of the\ntopics that require the machine to perceive and describe im-\nages in human languages [34, 37]. With the wave of deep\nlearning [24, 39], enormous efforts [42, 43, 84, 96] have\n\u2020Work was done when the author interned at Microsoft.\n\u2217Corresponding.\nFigure 1. SCA (b) is a lightweight augmentation of SAM (a) with\nthe ability to generate regional captions. On top of SAM archi-\ntecture, we add a pre-trained language model which is frozen, and\na lightweight hybrid feature mixture. Despite the small number\nof trainable parameters, the region-specific features are learned to\nalign with the embedding space of the language model for regional\ncaption generation.\nbeen devoted to pushing its frontier in terms of model archi-\ntectures, training data, training techniques, etc. However,\nmuch less work has been devoted to the regional caption-\ning [33, 56, 89, 104], in which models describe the regions\ninstead of the entire image.\nBuilding an intelligent system that follows human intent\nis an emerging research topic, as evidenced by the rapid\nprogress of large foundation models [7, 31, 65, 80, 99].\nMajor breakthroughs have been made in language model-\ning [7, 62, 78, 81], where the foundation language mod-\nels are fine-tuned to follow the instructions of users with\nboth instruction supervision [62, 78] and human feed-\nback [60, 81].\nThe idea is further developed in multi-\nmodal language model\n[53, 109], text-to-image genera-\ntion [69, 71, 97], and interactive segmentation [35]. Seg-\n1\narXiv:2312.00869v1  [cs.CV]  1 Dec 2023\nment Anything Model (SAM) [35] is an interactive segmen-\ntation system, that successfully scales the mask data to a\nbillion. Such data scale enables stronger generalizability in\nsegmentation given the visual prompts. However, the data\ncontain no semantic labels thus the model is incapable of\nsemantic understanding.\nWe propose a method to efficiently equip SAM with\nthe ability to generate regional captions. We marry SAM\nwith causal language models [7, 64, 80] by introducing a\nlightweight hybrid feature mixture which stacks a text fea-\nture mixture on top of the SAM feature mixture. The hy-\nbrid feature mixture extracts regional features for down-\nstream caption predictions via self- and cross-attention [82].\nWe solely optimize the text feature mixer and leave the\nother network modules (i.e. SAM\u2019s encoder, SAM feature\nmixer, the language model) untouched.\nDuring training,\nthe region-specific features are aligned with the embedding\nspace of language models for later caption generation. As\nthe number of trainable parameters is small (typically in the\norder of tens of millions), it costs less computation, less\nmemory usage, and less communication bandwidth, result-\ning in both fast and scaleable training. Fig. 1 provides a\nsystem overview.\nHowever, there is limited data available for training re-\ngional captioning models [36, 98].\nFor example, One\ncommonly used dataset, Visual Genome (VG) [36] con-\ntains up to 100K images.\nIn contrast, SAM [35] used\na dataset that contains more than 11M images and 1B\nmasks. Inspired by the effective deployment of weak su-\npervision [44, 103, 111], we introduce a weak supervision\npretraining step to leverage the publicly available object de-\ntection and segmentation datasets. Specifically, we pre-train\nthe text feature mixer on Objects365 [72] detection data and\nCOCO-Panoptic [50] segmentation data, which consist of\n1.8M images. Finally, the text feature mixer is finetuned on\nthe VG regional captioning data.\nWe have conducted extensive experiments to demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our method and validate each\ndesign choice. Our method achieves state-of-the-art per-\nformance on the VG [36] benchmark with 149.8 CIDEr-\nD, 17.5 METEOR, and 31.4 SPICE. We believe this work\nserves as a stepping stone towards scaling up regional cap-\ntioning data [6, 35, 57] and sheds light on exploring ef-\nficient approaches to augment a segmentation model like\nSAM with regional semantics.\n2. Related Works\nObject detections, segmentations, and interactive seg-\nmentations.\nThe field of object detection has evolved\nfrom CNN-based methods [19, 23, 55, 55, 67, 68, 79]\nto transformer-based models [8, 41, 54, 82, 102, 110].\nThe transformer architecture has shown versatility across\nmodalities, facilitating tasks like open-world detection [31,\n65, 99, 100]. Similar architectural trends are observed in\nsegmentation tasks [11, 12, 26]. Recent works have also\nintegrated vision-language pre-training for open-world seg-\nmentation [17, 22, 40, 48, 90, 94]. Interactive segmenta-\ntion [25, 66, 70] is a sub-task with unique challenges that\ncan be tackled by transformer-based models like SAM [35].\nThis paper extends SAM to region-level understanding us-\ning additional tokens and transformer layers.\nImage captioning and dense captioning. Image caption-\ning involves generating textual descriptions for images by\ncombining vision and language models [16, 18, 27, 31, 65,\n77, 99]. Early methods employed CNN and LSTM [34],\nwhile recent works leverage transformers [1, 13, 15, 43, 84]\nand large language models [7, 62, 80, 81].\nThese mod-\nels can follow user instructions, demonstrating abilities like\nvisual reasoning and question answering. Dense caption-\ning [33, 36, 45, 56, 73, 89, 91, 95] extends image captioning\nto region-level, combining detection with generation. De-\nspite its simultaneous development with image captioning,\nits evaluation metrics improvement has been slow due to the\ncompounded difficulty of localization and generation. This\nwork assumes localization proposals as given inputs and fo-\ncuses on region captioning.\nScaling region understanding systems.\nTremendous\nprogress has been made in natural language processing\nand vision domains by training large models on mas-\nsive datasets, with scaling laws illustrating the relation-\nship between computational budgets, data size, and perfor-\nmance [1, 3, 13, 29, 31, 58, 65, 99]. This trend is also ob-\nserved in region-level understanding systems, where weak-\nsupervision methods like self-training and proxy training\nlosses are used to scale up data [4, 44, 92, 93, 101, 105,\n108].\n[57] and [35] show the importance of scaling in\nvision tasks by reaching the scale of billions of samples.\nHowever, region-level understanding is still underexplored\ndue to the limited data scale. The current dataset, Visual\nGenome [36], is small, leading to poor alignment and gen-\neralizability. This work aims to explore the scaling property\nin generative region-level understanding using weak super-\nvision from detection [38, 50, 72, 85] and leaves image cap-\ntioning supervision [10, 59, 75] and self-training [42, 57]\nfor future exploration.\nConcurrent works. Recent progress in Large Language\nModel (LLM) and interactive segmentation has spurred sev-\neral concurrent works in region-level understanding. With-\nout training, Caption Anything [86] utilizes SAM and image\ncaptioning models to predict text descriptions based on the\ncropped regions, with style adjustments by ChatGPT [60].\nOther works train with existing data; GPT4ROI [104] ex-\ntends Visual LLM [53] to process region prompts, while\nRegion-BLIP [107] employs BLIP2\u2019s feature mixer [43]\nand trains on multiple tasks. Works like Kosmos-2 [63]\nand All-Seeing [87] utilize similar architectures but differ-\n2\nFigure 2. The model architecture. The model consists of three parts including an image encoder, a feature mixer, and decoder heads for\nmasks or text. The key ingredient of the model is the text feature mixer, which is a lightweight bidirectional transformer [82]. We stack\nit over the one from SAM and reuse its tokens. By solely optimizing the additional mixer, we align the region-specific features with the\nembedding space of language models. The training is both fast and scalable thanks to the limited amount of optimizable parameters.\nent dataset construction paths, demonstrating strong per-\nformance on various region-level tasks. Despite the rapid\nevolution of this field, this work aims to extend SAM for\nregion-level captioning with weak supervision.\n3. Method\nIn this section, we will introduce the model architecture\nand the implementation details for our promptable region\nunderstanding system. The model consists of three parts,\nincluding an image encoder, a feature mixer, and decoder\nheads for masks or text: (1) The image encoder extracts the\nglobal features of the images [47]; (2) The query-based fea-\nture mixer [8] incorporates the image features and the user-\nspecified visual prompts (i.e., points, boxes, or masks), then\nproduces the region-of-interest (ROI) features; (3) The de-\ncoder heads map the ROI features to the modality-specific\noutputs, e.g. text for region captions or mask for segmenta-\ntions. In the last section, we provide implementation details\nof our method. We first pre-train our model with weak su-\npervision: objection detection and panoptic segmentation.\nThen the model is finetuned with the region-caption data.\n3.1. Model Architecture\nThere are three components in the model, a ViT-based en-\ncoder, a transformer query-based feature mixer, and decoder\nheads for different outputs of interest, e.g. text decoder.\nOur model design is inspired by [35], which is a category-\nagnostic promptable segmentation model that takes in user\ninputs like points, boxes, or masks and outputs multiple bi-\nnary masks. Apart from a ViT-based encoder [18, 47] and\na small mask decoder [11, 12], it involves a lightweight\nquery-based feature mixer [8] to mix both global image fea-\ntures extracted by the image encoder and the user prompts.\nThe module is efficient as it only consists of 2M of param-\neters. Fig. 2 illustrate the model architecture.\nThe data used to train the SAM model is category ag-\nnostic and after initial human labeling, the data are scaled\nto 10M images and 1B boxes with several rounds of self-\ntraining. Although initially, the labeled masks involve no\ntextual labels, they contain the semantics implicitly as the\nannotators are asked to draw masks to whatever things or\nstuff they recognize. Thus we hypothesize that the features\nfrom the image encoder of SAM contain rich semantic fea-\ntures beyond the lower-level segmentation tasks it is trained\non. Based on that assumption, we build our model over\nthe pre-trained SAM models and stack an additional feature\nmixer along with a text decoder to predict texts. We fol-\nlow the mixer design of SAM [35] except for increasing the\nnumber of layers in the mixer.\nImage encoder. Following SAM, a ViT style image en-\ncoder [18] that is designed for detection [47] is adopted\nin our model. Specifically, it is comprised of a plain ViT\nwith primary local window attention and several interleaved\nglobal attention, which produces isotropic feature maps\nwith the same feature dimension.\nGiven image I, we have the encoder EI that extract the\nglobal image feature I: EI(I) = I. The image features are\ndown-sampled for computation efficiency, as the following\nfeature mixer should be as lightweight as possible. Follow-\ning [35, 47], the final spatial shape and feature dimension\nare 64 \u00d7 64 and 256, respectively (Fig. 2).\nNot that we only utilize the single level of visual features\nfrom the last layer as in [35], compared with [19, 26, 51, 67,\n68] that produce multi-scale features. However, the single-\n3\nlevel feature contains sufficient information for later caption\ngeneration, regardless of the scales of the regions.\nRegional feature mixer. After the global image features\nare extracted, we need to further extract the region features\ndenoted by the user-input visual prompts. There are two\nprominent approaches to devising a region feature mixer to\nattain the region-of-interest (ROI) features. The first one\nleverages the ROI-align operator [26], which pools the re-\ngion features from the global ones with the correspond-\ning box coordinates. The second one utilizes the attention\nmechanism [82] by incorporating query tokens that fuse the\nfeature of interest across each attention block. We choose\nthe latter giving the following considerations: 1) Versatile\nencoding of visual prompts. The type of visual prompts\ncould be either point, stroke, box, mask, or a combination\nof any of them.\nThe ROI-align operator only takes box\nprompts, while in the query-based token mixer, we can en-\ncode the different formats of prompts with specific prompt\nencoders, whose outputs are tokens that are compatible with\nthe latter attention blocks. 2) Progressive feature interac-\ntion and fusion. The main body of the query-based fea-\nture mixer is attention blocks as in [8, 12], whose inputs\nare the encoded prompt tokens, global image tokens, and\ntask-oriented query tokens. After several blocks of self-\nattentions and cross-attentions, we can fetch the region fea-\ntures at the exact position of the query tokens. Unlike the\nprocess of the ROI-align operator, which only pools the\nglobal image features, the query-based one can leverage\nthe powerful attention mechanism to extract region-specific\nfeatures that facilitate the downstream tasks, e.g. segmenta-\ntion, captioning, etc.\nGiven the global image tokens I, and user-provided\nprompts P{b,p,m} in forms of box b, point p, or mask m,\nwe first encode the given prompts with the corresponding\nprompt encoders Ep by Ep(P{b,p,m}) = P{b,p,m}, where\nP{b,p,m} is encoded prompt tokens. Next, we concatenate\nthe encoded prompt tokens and both the textual and mask\nquery tokens Q and M, and feed them with the global im-\nage tokens I into the query-based feature mixer ER with N\nblocks:\nEj\nR(P j\u22121, Qj\u22121, M j\u22121; Ij\u22121) = { \u02c6P j, \u02c6Qj, \u02c6\nM j; \u02c6Ij}, (1)\nwhere j\n=\n{1, 2, . . . , N} is the block indicator,\n{ \u02c6P j, \u02c6Qj, \u02c6\nM j; \u02c6Ij} are the fused tokens after the j-th block,\n{ \u02c6P 0, \u02c6Q0, \u02c6\nM 0; \u02c6I0} is the initial input tokens.\nWe denote\n{ \u02c6P N, \u02c6QN, \u02c6\nM N; \u02c6IN} = { \u02c6P, \u02c6Q, \u02c6\nM; \u02c6I} as the final outputs.\nThe encoded query tokens \u02c6Q and \u02c6\nM are deemed as the ROI\ntokens for captioning and segmentation, respectively, which\nare delivered to the following output heads (i.e., the text\ngeneration head and the mask prediction).\nThe query-based feature mixer ER is a bi-directional\ntransformer with stack of blocks as in [8, 12, 35, 82]. Each\nblock consists of one self-attention layer to fuse the sparse\ntokens (i.e., the concatenated tokens of the prompt ones P\nand the query ones Q), and a cross-attention layer to instill\nthe global image tokens I. During the encoding process\nacross each block, the query tokens Q can gradually gather\nthe task-specific information grounded by the prompts ones\nP, inside the global image tokens I.\nQuery tokens.\n[35] takes query-based feature mixer as\nits core component but only predicts the masks without\nhigh-level semantic outputs like labels. We notice that [35]\ncan actually predict masks with good semantics even if it\nis trained by a category-agnostic approach. It may be at-\ntributed to the initial training data of SAM, which are la-\nbeled under the instruction where the annotators are asked\nto draw the masks over whatever things of stuff they rec-\nognized without any semantic labels. Thus we leverage the\nquery tokens from [35] by stacking an additional feature\nmixer ECap\nR\nabove that of [35]. Specifically, [35] possessed\nits own query tokens M to mix the features for mask predic-\ntion. It encoded the corresponding features with a two-layer\nfeature mixer ESAM\nR\n. We add a new set of query tokens Q\nfor text predictions and feed it with the prompt tokens and\nimage tokens that are both encoded with ESAM\nR\ninto ECap\nR .\nRegional feature decoder. After obtaining the ROI fea-\nture, we can send it into a causal text decoder [7, 64, 80, 81]\nto generate region captions. The text decoder DCap is often\na transformer decoder [82] that predict the text tokens\nTk based on the previous (predicted) text tokens T1:k\u22121\ncausally:\nDCap(T1:k\u22121) = Tk,\n(2)\nwhere k is the length of the text tokens. Since we want to\ncondition the prediction on the region features, we prefix\nthe feature token Q in front of the text tokens T . Inspired\nby prompt tuning [32, 46, 106], we further prefix a set of\noptimizable task tokens T to exploit task related context\n(Fig. 2).\nThe model can be optimized by minimizing\ncross-entropy loss L defined on the next token by:\nL =\n1\nNT + 1\nNT +1\nX\nk=1\nCE(Tk, p(Tk|T, Q, T0:k\u22121)),\n(3)\nwhere p(Tk|T, Q, T1:k\u22121) is the predicted logits for token\nTk NT is the length until the predicted tokens and Nr is\nthe length of the prefix tokens. CE is cross entropy loss\nwith label smoothing at a strength of 0.1. T0, TNT +1 are\nthe begin-of-sentence (BOS) and end-of-sentence (EOS)\ntokens, respectively. For the details of the mask decoder,\nplease refer to [35].\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Implementation Details\nOur model is comprised of three parts: image encoder, re-\ngional feature mixer, and regional feature decoder.

For the\ntext decoder, we leverage the pre-trained language model\nsuch as GPT2-large [64] and OpenLLAMA-3B [14, 20, 80].\nThe above modules are all fixed during training. As to the\nadditional transformer region feature mixer to extract tex-\ntual features, we scale the 2-layer one in [35] to 12 layers.\nThe caption query tokens Q have a length of 8 and the task\ntokens T have a length of 6. We optimize the above modules\nfor region captioning generation. Note that only a small set\nof parameters are optimized, thus the training is not only\nscalable but efficient. We list the hyper-parameters in sup-\nplementary. We first pre-train the model for 100K steps,\nwith Objects365 [72] (detection) and COCO-Panoptic [50]\n(segmentation) with a sampling ratio of 10:1. Then we fine-\ntune the model on Visual Genome [36] dense caption split\nfor another 100K steps. Meanwhile, we also directly train\nthe models on VG for 200K steps. For inference, we use\na beam size of 3 for text generation. Note that as only the\nlightweight text feature mixer is optimized, we can switch\nit during inference to generate either class labels (from per-\ntaining) or captions (from finetuning). We list more details\nin the supplementary materials.\n4.2. Evaluation Settings\nDatasets.\nWe evaluate the methods on Visual Genome\n(VG) [36] captioning splits. It contains about 100K im-\nages along with around 3M regions, and each region con-\ntains one textual description. Despite the large scale of re-\ngions, there are a large number of repeated annotations due\nto its data curation. We take the standard data split pro-\ntocol [33, 89, 91], in which around 70K images are used\nfor training, and other 5K images are used for evaluation.\nCompared with previous works [33, 89], we do not prepro-\ncess the text (e.g., case conversion, remove the symbols,\netc.), as we find no performance degradation thanks to the\nemployment of pre-trained language models.\nMetrics. We adopt the standard referring-based text simi-\nlarity measurements [2, 5, 49, 61, 83] used in image cap-\ntioning [43, 84, 96], to evaluate the generated regional cap-\ntions against the ground-truth ones. Unlike dense caption-\ning task [33, 91] which considers both localization and gen-\neration, we assume localization proposals as given inputs\nand focus on region captioning. Moreover, we evaluate the\nconcepts learned by the models with phrase coverage rate.\nWe parse both sentences into phrases and then compute the\ncoverage score via Intersection Over Union (IoU) for both\nnouns and verbs [9]. The score for each pair is either ex-\nact matching or fuzzy matching, i.e. the cosine similarity\nbetween the phrase embeddings. Finally, we average the\nscores across all samples.\n4.3. Comparison with other methods\nWe compare our methods with two kinds of baselines on the\ntest split of VG. The first baseline is training-free, which is\na SAM followed by an image captioner [42, 43, 84]. It is\nthe major algorithm in Caption Anything [86]. We evalu-\nate various open-sourced captioners; The second baseline is\nthe GRiT model [89], which is trained on the train split of\nVG like ours. However, it contains a region generator to au-\ntomatically generate region proposals, while ours requires\nthose from users. We directly test its captioning ability by\n5\nFigure 3. The qualitative results. SCA simultaneously predicts masks (in red contour) and captions. From top-to-bottom, the captions are\nfrom: SAM+Captioner {GIT-large, BLIP-large, BLIP2-OPT-2.7B} [86], GRIT [89], SCA {GPT2-large+VG, LLAMA-3B+VG, GPT2-\nlarge+Pretrain+VG}, and the ground truth. The bounding boxes (in red) are used to prompt the models. Zoom in for a better view.\nproviding ground truth boxes.\nTab. 1 demonstrates the superior results of our models.\nThe image captioner baselines yield the least performance.\nWe speculate that the image patches generated by SAM lose\nthe context information, and they differ from the training\ndistribution of the captions w.r.t. both resolution and seman-\ntics. Thus it could generate captions that are either misinfor-\nmative or unspecific. The second baseline, GRiT, gives the\nmost competitive results, but it possesses major drawbacks\nin comparison with ours. 1) The full model of GRiT, in-\ncluding the image encoder, region proposal net, and text de-\ncoder head, is optimized during training, which costs a vast\namount of training resources. Our model only optimizes the\nlightweight feature mixer, which reduces the cost by less-\nening the memory consumption and bandwidth for syncing\ngradients. 2) The text decoding is initialized from scratch in\nGRiT, which constrains its language modeling ability due to\nthe limited amount of region captioning data. Whereas our\nmethod leverages pre-trained language models by mapping\nSAM\u2019s visual features into the language embedding space.\nIt raises two merits: 1) As the power of language model\nscales, we can observe improved performance on tests. Our\nmodel with LLAMA-3B yields superior performance on the\nVG test set. 2) Since we do not finetune the language model\nto adapt new data distributions, it is possible to further im-\nprove our model based on the language aspect, e.g., chat-\nstyle interaction [53, 62]. Fig. 3 visualizes the predictions.\n4.4. Ablation Study\nIn the early stage of experimenting, we spent less computa-\ntional budgets to validate the efficiency of different design\nchoices. Specifically, for all models in this section, we con-\nstrained the budges to 8 16GB V100 GPUs with a batch size\nof 8. By default, the models are trained solely on VG [36]\nwithout data augmentation for 200K steps.\nThe effectiveness of weak supervision pre-training. To\npreliminarily validate the effectiveness of pretraining with\nweak supervision.\nWe leveraged three object detection\n6\nTable 2.

The model was\nfirst pre-trained for 100K steps and finetuned for another\n100K without other modifications. We set another baseline\ntrained directly on VG for 100K steps. Tab. 2 presents that\nthe pretraining with concept labels can facilitate the con-\nvergence of training on VG, and the larger the scale of the\nimages, the better the test performance. Under a similar\namount of samples, an increase in class labels can slightly\nimprove performance. The finding encourages us to further\nenlarge the pretraining data scale in the future.\nThe hyper-parameters of the text decoder and the fea-\nture mixer.

We tried two variants of GPT2 transformer decoder\nmodels [64], which are GPT2-large with 774M parameters\nand GPT2 with 127M. They are all from the official release\nwhich are trained on WebText dataset [64]. Given the dif-\nferent learning rates of the feature mixer, we then tested\ndifferent learning rates (i.e., 0.0, 1e-7, 5e-7, 1e-6, 5e-6) for\nthe text decoder.\nTwo conclusions can be drawn from Tab. 3. 1) The fea-\nture mixer requires a relatively large learning rate to con-\nverge to good performance. 2) When the text decoder is\nsmall (GPT2 with 127M), we need to finetune it to achieve\nbetter results. In contrast, using a larger text decoder like\nGPT2-large (774M), finetuning may impede the perfor-\nmance, and fixing the decoder can yield even better scores\ncompared with the small one.\nWe chose a large text decoder without any finetuning in\nthis paper given the considerations of both capacity and ef-\nficiency. In this, we not only keep the knowledge inside the\nlanguage model for future improvement, but enable low-\ncost training of the model.\nThe size of feature mixer. The additional feature mixer for\ntext decoding is a bi-directional transformer, which fuses\nthe query and prompt tokens with self-attention, and the\nimage tokens with cross-attention. The original one used\nin [35] is a two-layer one that is highly computational-\nefficient with solely 3M parameters.\nTo investigate how the size of the feature mixer affects\nthe extracted region feature, we test a different number of\nlayers for the additional transformer, ranging from 2 with\n3M parameters to 24 with 30M parameters.\nTab. 4 demonstrates the final scores on the VG test split.\nAs the number of layers increases, the n-gram metrics ramp\nup as well. Only until 12 layers do its performance reach the\npeak, then adding more layers harms the performance. No-\nticeably, [43] used 12 layers feature mixer to extract promi-\nnent features for image captioning, which has over 105M\nparameters. While ours only consists of 19.4M.\nThe architecture of feature mixer. We experiment with\nfour major architectures, which are 1) the one with ROI-\nAlign operator [26], which is described in the main pa-\n7\nTable 5.

To make the ROI align one stronger, we\nadd an MLP stated in [52], which is a two-layer MLP with\nGELU activation [28].\nTab. 5 shows that query-based mixers perform signif-\nicantly better than those using ROI-align, indicating the\neffectiveness of progressive feature aggregation. Directly\ndecoding SAM\u2019s query token restricts the capacity of the\nmixer. Incorporating additional query tokens for captioning\nboosts the performance of the model. Moreover, resuing the\nfeatures of SAM further improves the captioning results.\nThe size of the SAM image encoder. We investigate how\ndifferent SAM encoders may affect the captioning perfor-\nmance, by testing the three official encoders from [35],\nwhich are three ViT [18] with different scale: base, large,\nand huge. Surprisingly, different size of the SAM image\nencoders results in similar final performance.\nWe chose\nthe ViT huge as the default image encoder as it performs\nslightly better than others.\nThe efficacy of data augmentation. We found that with\nan enlarged batch size in multiple-node training, the model\nexperienced an overfitting problem which led to inferior\ntest performance.\nTo fight against the problem, we re-\nsort to strong augmentation from [21], the large-scale jitter-\ning. Tab. 7 demonstrates that using the strong augmentation\nnot only alleviates the overfitting problem but enhances the\nmodel\u2019s performance.\n5. Conclusions and Discussions\nWe preliminarily demonstrate a regional captioning system\nby adapting a powerful class-agnostic segmentation model,\nSAM [35], with a lightweight (typically in the order of tens\nTable 7.

The mixer is the only optimizable\nmodule thus the training is both faster and scalable, as it\ncosts less computation, less memory usage, and less com-\nmunication bandwidth. To better generalize our model, we\npre-train the system with weak supervision which transfers\nthe general knowledge of the visual concepts beyond the\nlimited regional captioning data, Visual Genome (VG) [36].\nWe extensively validate our design choices and evaluate our\nmethod, demonstrating its strong performance.\nLimitations. 1) Wrong attribute prediction. e.g., the mod-\nels could predict the wrong colors or textures; 2) Distin-\nguishing similar visual concepts. e.g., the model may con-\nfuse \u201clemon\u201d with \u201corange\u201d; 3) Alignment with mask pre-\ndictions: As we do not supervise the alignment, the model\nmay predict mask and captions for the fore- and background\nseparately. The drawbacks, esp. 1) and 2), may be ad-\ndressed by weak supervision and self-training [6].\nWeak supervision and self-training.\nWe only leverage\n1.8M weak supervision data [50, 72] to complement the re-\ngional captioning data, VG [36]. Our ablation about the\neffectiveness of weak supervision shows that the scale of\nimages matters more than the variety of labels, which is in-\ntuitive as we want the model to align and generalize as much\nas visual concepts with the language models. Thus pertain-\ning the model with bigger datasets like [38] may lead to\nbetter generalizability. Another approach to leverage image\ncaptioning data as in [44, 111], but it requires to solve the\nproblem of granularity mismatching [111]. Self-training is\nthe ultimate goal that could scale both the data and the gen-\neralizability of the model. It demonstrates effectiveness in\nimage captioning [42], segmentation [35], open-vocabulary\ndetection [57], and text-to-image generation [6]. We believe\nthis work serves as a footstone towards scaling regional cap-\ntioning data [6, 35, 57] in the future.\nInsight of lifting SAM for regional captioning. Although\nthere are no semantic labels in the training data, SAM still\nimplies high-level semantics that are sufficient for caption-\ning. The masks used to train SAM are labeled in a way\nwhere annotators are asked to draw masks for every things\nor stuff they recognized [35]. After several rounds of self-\n8\ntraining and bootstrapping the data to 1B masks, the at-\ntained models possess implicit general knowledge about the\nvisual world.\nTherefore, we can align the implicit gen-\neral knowledge with natural languages to caption regions.\nWe believe this work sheds light on exploring the emerging\nability [88] in vision from low-level data or pre-trains.\nReferences\n[1] Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Jeff Donahue, Pauline Luc, Antoine\nMiech, Iain Barr, Yana Hasson, Karel Lenc, Arthur Men-\nsch, Katherine Millican, Malcolm Reynolds, Roman Ring,\nEliza Rutherford, Serkan Cabi, Tengda Han, Zhitao Gong,\nSina Samangooei, Marianne Monteiro, Jacob L.

Typically, RLHF involves the initial step of\nlearning a reward model from human feedback, often expressed as preferences between pairs of text\ngenerations produced by a pre-trained LLM. Subsequently, the LLM\u2019s policy is fine-tuned by optimizing\nit to maximize the reward model through a reinforcement learning algorithm. However, an inherent\nlimitation of current reward models is their inability to fully represent the richness of human preferences\nand their dependency on the sampling distribution.\nIn this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning of LLMs using pairwise human\nfeedback. Our approach entails the initial learning of a preference model, which is conditioned on\ntwo inputs given a prompt, followed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responses\npreferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nash equilibrium of this\npreference model. We term this approach Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). In the context\nof a tabular policy representation, we present a novel algorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the\nprinciples of mirror descent. This algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iteration\nconverging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we explore parametric representations of\npolicies and introduce gradient descent algorithms for deep-learning architectures. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, we present experimental results involving the fine-tuning of a LLM for\na text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenue for preference learning and\npolicy optimization with the potential of advancing the field of aligning LLMs with human preferences.\nKeywords: Large language models, reinforcement learning, Nash equilibrium, preference models, align-\nment with human data.\n1. Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Anil et al., 2023; Glaese et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Ouyang\net al., 2022) have made remarkable strides in enhancing natural language understanding and\ngeneration. Their success in conversational applications often relies on aligning these models with\nhuman preferences, a process primarily guided by the paradigm of reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF). A prevailing approach within RLHF involves the initial step of constructing\na reward model based on pairwise human preferences, frequently employing the Bradley-Terry model\n(BT; Bradley and Terry, 1952). This reward model assigns an individual score to each generation of\nthe language model conditioned on a given prompt, akin to how the Elo (1978) ranking system assigns\nscores to chess players to estimate their relative strengths. Subsequently, model refinement takes\nplace by optimizing the LLM\u2019s performance with respect to this reward model through reinforcement\nlearning (RL) over sampled text generations.\nHowever, the Elo model has its limitations, primarily coming from its inability to accommodate the\nfull spectrum of possible preferences. For example, Bertrand et al. (2023) show the limitations of\nthe Elo model by illustrating where Elo score alone cannot predict the right preferences, even in\ntransitive situations. There are also situations where maximizing the Elo score is not aligned with\narXiv:2312.00886v3  [stat.ML]  6 Dec 2023\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nmaximizing the probability of winning against the relevant population of players, even when the\npreference model can be perfectly expressed using a BT model (see Appendix A for an example).\nThese observations highlight the necessity for a more profound understanding of the implications of\nElo-based reward maximization in RLHF for achieving genuine alignment with human preferences.\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs from human preference data,\nwhich we term Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). In this framework, we depart from\nthe conventional approach of learning a reward model and instead focus on learning a preference\nmodel and define our objective to compute the Nash equilibrium of this preference model.\nThe preference model takes two responses, denoted as \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032 (possibly conditioned on a prompt \ud835\udc65),\nas input and produces a preference score P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65), indicating the preference of response \ud835\udc66 over\nresponse \ud835\udc66\u2032 given the context \ud835\udc65. To initialize this preference model, we may leverage an LLM prompted\nin a manner akin to how humans have been asked for their preference, such as by instructing the\nLLM to generate a 1-vs-2 comparison in response to a prompt like: \u201cGiven \ud835\udc65, which answer do you\nprefer, answer 1: \ud835\udc66 or answer 2: \ud835\udc66\u2032?\u201d. This initial preference model can be further refined through\nsupervised learning to align it with human preference data. Notably, a preference model does not\nrequire the assumption of the Bradley-Terry model, and thus has the potential to capture a more\ndiverse range of human preferences. Moreover, in contrast to the traditional RLHF setting where the\nreward model depends on the distribution (and thus the policy) of responses used to collect human\ndata, a preference model (having as input the two responses to be compared) remains essentially\ninvariant to the specific policy employed to generate these responses. Finally, we argue (below) that\nthe Nash equilibrium of the preference model is a solution that better aligns with the diversity of\nhuman preferences than the maximum of the expected reward model.\nOnce the preference model is established, our primary objective is to calculate the corresponding\nNash equilibrium. This equilibrium represents a policy that consistently produces responses preferred,\nas determined by the preference model, over responses generated by any alternative policy. The\nbeauty of this solution concept lies in its innate alignment with the human preference data that served\nas the foundation for training the preference model. These three key properties of our approach,\nnamely, the ability of the preference model to encompass a wider spectrum of human preferences,\nits policy-independence, and the potential for the Nash equilibrium to provide a better alignment\nwith the diversity of human preferences, mark a substantial departure from the conventional RLHF\nframework. We discuss these properties in greater detail in Section 3.\nTo approximate the Nash equilibrium of the two-player game in which actions are responses, and\npayoffs are specified by the preference model, we employ a deep reinforcement learning algorithm.\nGiven a prompt \ud835\udc65, we generate two responses, denoted as \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032. The first response, \ud835\udc66, is generated\nunder the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 that we are in the process of optimizing. In contrast, the second response,\n\ud835\udc66\u2032, is produced by an alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032, which we implement in two different versions: Nash-MD\nand Nash-EMA (further elaboration on these versions will be provided below). Nash-MD defines the\nalternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 as a geometric mixture between the initial and the current policies (motivated\nby mirror descent), whereas Nash-EMA implements a first-order approximation of an exponential\nmoving average (EMA) mixture of past policies. Then, the preference model computes P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65),\nand this preference signal serves as a reward for optimizing our policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 using a (regularized) policy\ngradient algorithm, as outlined by Geist et al. (2019).\nOur contributions in this work can be summarized as follows. First, we introduce the concept of Nash\nlearning from human feedback (NLHF), framing it as the task of computing the Nash equilibrium\nfor a general preference model. We proceed by introducing and defining a regularized variant of\nthe preference model. We also establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding Nash\nequilibrium in this context. Then, we consider the case of tabular policy representations and introduce\n2\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\na novel algorithm named Nash-MD. This algorithm, founded on the principles of mirror descent (MD)\npossesses two important properties. First, it converges to the Nash equilibrium, with the final iteration\nreaching this equilibrium. This differs from conventional regret-minimization-based algorithms, where\nit is typically the mixture of past policies that converges, necessitating the storage of past policies.\nSecondly, Nash-MD learns by competing against alternative policies \ud835\udf0b\u2032 that represent a (geometric)\nmixture between the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 and the initial policy. Importantly, this can be accomplished\nwithout the need to retain intermediate policies, a feature of particular significance in the context of\nLLMs with their substantial memory requirements. Additionally, we introduce Nash-EMA, a variation\ninspired by fictitious play, which uses an exponential moving average of past policy parameters. We\nintroduce policy-gradient algorithms for deep learning architectures, Nash-MD-PG and Nash-EMA-PG,\ninspired by the tabular algorithms Nash-MD and Nash-EMA. We present the results of extensive\nnumerical experiments conducted on a text summarizing task utilizing the TL;DR dataset (V\u00f6lske\net al., 2017). In these experiments, we employ the NLHF approach to train several models. To\nassess their performance, we conduct a pairwise evaluation (using the PaLM 2 Large LLM) of the\nperformance of the models and include a comparison to an RLHF baseline. We conclude that NLHF\nopens up new promising directions for aligning LLMs with human preferences.\n2. Prior work\nPreference-based RL.\nOur contribution falls into a broader area of preference-based RL, where we\ndirectly learn from pairwise human preferences instead of a hand-designed or learned scalar reward\n(see, e.g., the survey by Wirth et al., 2017). The canonical form of RLHF was proposed in Christiano\net al. (2017) and popularized by OpenAI (2022), in which one learns a scalar reward model from\nthe preference feedback, followed by policy optimization against the reward model. However, an\nadvantage of directly optimizing for preferences rather than a learnt scalar reward function is the\npotential to avoid reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016), when agents find a way to maximize a reward\nwithout performing what was intended. Furthermore, in domains such as medical applications, it\nmay not only be challenging but also undesirable to provide a single scalar reward.\nIn general, the preference feedback can be provided in different ways, e.g., on the level of states,\nactions, or a full trajectory. In this work, we focus on the trajectory feedback where the experts provide\nfeedback by selecting the preferred one of the two proposed trajectories. Such a simple form of\npairwise feedback is the easiest to implement, and has seen applications in summarization (Stiennon\net al., 2020), question-answering (Menick et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021) and general language-\nbased assistants (Bai et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). More complicated forms\nof feedback has been studied in theoretical literature such as Efroni et al. (2021).\nTheoretical guarantees for learning from preferences.\nLearning policies from preference feedback\nof histories was studied by Akrour et al. (2011) who learned the preference model for histories and\nby Cheng et al. (2011) who trained a model ranking actions for a state. Busa-Fekete et al. (2013,\n2014) approached this setting by comparing and ranking policies and Wilson et al. (2012) by learning\na distribution over policy space. Preference-based RL is also explored in dueling RL (Novoseller\net al., 2020; Pacchiano et al., 2023), which generalizes the well-studied dueling bandits problem.\nIn particular, Pacchiano et al. (2023) assumes a Bradley-Terry model, which they estimate using\nmaximum likelihood in the tabular setting.\nOur work is also related to results of Wang et al. (2023) who consider learning Nash equilibria of the\nhuman preference model, and reduce the problem to finding Nash equilibria for a special class of\nfactored two-player Markov games under a restricted set of policies. Moreover, Chen et al. (2022)\ngave first results for function approximation in preference-based RL, however with a computationally\ninefficient algorithm.\n3\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nOptimization without reward function.\nA number of recent works has attempted to optimize for\npreference feedback without learning a reward function. For example, Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) optimizes the policy through a loss function defined via the Bradley-Terry\nreward model. SLiC-HF (Zhao et al., 2023) modifies the classical RLHF training loss by calibrating a\nranking loss which contrasts a positive and a negative sequence. This resembles directly optimizing\nfor the pairwise preference, albeit without convergence guarantees. Identity Policy Optimization\n(IPO; Azar et al., 2023) proposed to directly optimize the pairwise human preference with offline\npreference data. Unlike DPO, IPO does not make the assumption on reward model, though they both\noptimize against a fixed opponent rather than searching for Nash equilibria.\n3. The preference model and its Nash equilibrium\nWe now introduce the core conceptual ideas behind our approach to learning from preference feedback.\nWe consider a preference model in a contextual bandit setting. Given a context (or prompt) \ud835\udc65 in the\ncontext space X and two actions (or responses/choices) \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032 in the action space Y, the preference\nof \ud835\udc66 over \ud835\udc66\u2032 is a number between 0 and 1 which is written P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65). We will assume that the\npreference model is symmetric: P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) = 1 \u2212 P(\ud835\udc66\u2032 \u227b \ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65).\nAn example of such a preference model is the probability (under some random outcome \ud835\udc4d) that\n\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc4d) \u2265 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\u2032, \ud835\udc4d), where \ud835\udc53 is a (deterministic) absolute scoring function:\nP(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc4d\u223c\ud835\udf08 [\ud835\udfd9{ \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc4d) \u227b \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\u2032, \ud835\udc4d)}] ,\nwhere we define the function \ud835\udfd9{\ud835\udc62 \u227b \ud835\udc63}\ndef= (sign(\ud835\udc62 \u2212 \ud835\udc63) + 1)/2, which behaves as an indicator for the\nevent \ud835\udc62 > \ud835\udc63, and assigning a value of 1/2 in the case where \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc63. For example, this could represent\nthe probability that a randomly chosen human \ud835\udc4d \u223c \ud835\udf08 prefers choice \ud835\udc66 over choice \ud835\udc66\u2032 in a context\n\ud835\udc65. We assume that we do not have access to the absolute human scores \ud835\udc53 but only to their relative\npreferences.\nWe define the preference between two distributions conditioned on a state \ud835\udc65:\nP(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032|\ud835\udc65)\ndef= \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) [P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)]\nand the preference of an action over a distribution P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032|\ud835\udc65)\ndef= \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) [P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)]. Finally,\ngiven a distribution \ud835\udf0c over contexts, we define the preference between two policies:\nP(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032)\ndef= \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) [P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)] .\nWe say that a policy \ud835\udf0b is preferred over (or simply wins against) another policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 if P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) \u2265 1/2.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we assume without loss of generality that \ud835\udf0c assigns every context\npositive probability.\nIn this paper we will consider the objective of finding a policy \ud835\udf0b\u2217 which is preferred over any other\nalternative policy:\n\ud835\udf0b\u2217 def= arg max\n\ud835\udf0b\nmin\n\ud835\udf0b\u2032 P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) .\n(1)\nThis objective implicitly defines a two-player game, in which the players select policies \ud835\udf0b and \ud835\udf0b\u2032, the\nfirst player receiving a payoff of P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032), and the second player receiving P(\ud835\udf0b\u2032 \u227b \ud835\udf0b) = 1\u2212P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032).\nThis is therefore a two-player, symmetric, constant-sum game, and it follows that when both players\nuse a policy \ud835\udf0b\u2217 solving Equation (1), this is a Nash equilibrium for this game, by the minimax theorem\n(von Neumann, 1928). This is the fundamental solution concept we study in this paper.\n4\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nThe objective introduced in Equation (1) has two central differences relative to the majority of existing\nwork on RLHF. First, the objective is expressed directly in terms of preferences themselves, not in terms\nof a reward function learnt from preferences, and also not in terms of a non-linear transformation of\nthe preferences. Second, our solution concept relies on the notion of Nash equilibrium, rather than on\noptimization against a fixed behavior. We discuss the impact of both of these choices through several\nexamples below.\n3.1. Limited expressivity of reward models\nNotice that in general the preference model may not be transitive and we can have 3 policies \ud835\udf0b1,\n\ud835\udf0b2 and \ud835\udf0b3 such that P(\ud835\udf0b1 \u227b \ud835\udf0b2) > 1/2, P(\ud835\udf0b2 \u227b \ud835\udf0b3) > 1/2 and P(\ud835\udf0b3 \u227b \ud835\udf0b1) > 1/2. For example,\nconsider the set of outcomes being the subset of integers Y = {1, 2, . . . , 9} and 3 policies defined\nby \ud835\udf0b1 = U({2, 4, 9}), \ud835\udf0b2 = U({1, 6, 8}), and \ud835\udf0b3 = U({3, 5, 7}), where U(\ud835\udc46) refers to a uniform\ndistribution over the set \ud835\udc46. The preference is defined as P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) = \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b,\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032 [\ud835\udfd9{\ud835\udc66 \u2265 \ud835\udc66\u2032}]. Then\nwe have P(\ud835\udf0b1 \u227b \ud835\udf0b2) = P(\ud835\udf0b2 \u227b \ud835\udf0b3) = P(\ud835\udf0b3 \u227b \ud835\udf0b1) = 5/9. This mirrors the classical example of\nnon-transitive dice (Gardner, 1970).\nPreference models, as demonstrated, possess the capacity to encompass non-transitive preferences,\na characteristic not attainable by reward models, which inherently assign a single score to each\npolicy. Whether humans exhibit non-transitive preferences or not has been a subject of longstanding\nresearch (see, for instance, Klimenko 2015; Tversky 1969). Additionally, non-transitivity is not\nthe only limitation of Bradley-Terry-based reward models; see, e.g., Example 3 in Bertrand et al.\n(2023) where Elo score fails to capture the correct preference ordering between policies, even in\ntransitive situations. In fact, we show in Appendix A that even when the preference model is perfectly\ncaptured by the Bradley-Terry model, optimization of the reward/Elo score may still disagree with any\nreasonable notion of preference optimization. Therefore, we can safely argue that preference models\noffer a more flexible and nuanced framework for modeling human preferences than reward models.\n3.2. Alignment with diversity of human preferences\nHere, we illustrate that in some situations, the solution offered by the Nash equilibrium of the\npreference model (which we refer to as the NLHF solution) is more aligned with the diversity of\nhuman preferences than the optimum of the reward model (which we refer to as the RLHF solution).\nConsider the following situation where there are 3 different actions (\ud835\udc661, \ud835\udc662, \ud835\udc663) and we have a\npopulation composed of 3 types of humans with respective preferences P1, P2, P3, defined in the\nfollowing way: P\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc661 \u227b \ud835\udc662) = P\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc661 \u227b \ud835\udc663) = P\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc662 \u227b \ud835\udc663) = 1/2, for 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56 \u2264 3, except for the following\ncases: P1(\ud835\udc662 \u227b \ud835\udc661) = 1 (thus P1(\ud835\udc661 \u227b \ud835\udc662) = 0), P2(\ud835\udc661 \u227b \ud835\udc663) = 1 (thus P2(\ud835\udc663 \u227b \ud835\udc661) = 0), and\nP3(\ud835\udc663 \u227b \ud835\udc662) = 1 (thus P3(\ud835\udc662 \u227b \ud835\udc663) = 0).\nNow, let us assume these 3 types form a near-uniform distribution over humans, for example\n\u2119(Type 1) = 1/3 \u2212 \ud835\udf16, \u2119(Type 2) = \u2119(Type 3) = 1/3 + \ud835\udf16/2. The corresponding population pref-\nerence is thus P\ud835\udf16 = (1/3 \u2212 \ud835\udf16)P1 + (1/3 + \ud835\udf16/2)(P2 + P3). In the case \ud835\udf16 > 0 (so Type 1 is slightly less\nfrequent than the other types) then a reward model will assign a slightly better reward (assuming\na Bradley-Terry model) to action \ud835\udc661, thus optimizing the expected reward (the RLHF solution) will\nproduce a deterministic policy choosing exclusively \ud835\udc661.\nHowever, here we are in a situation where the preferences are not uniformly aligned across humans.\nIn the case of uniform sampling of humans (i.e., \ud835\udf16 = 0), the Nash equilibrium of P\ud835\udf16=0 is a uniform\nmixture between the 3 policies. Actually, the preference model P\ud835\udf16 corresponding to any \ud835\udf16 is defined\nas: P\ud835\udf16(\ud835\udc662 \u227b \ud835\udc661) = 2/3 \u2212 \ud835\udf16/2, P\ud835\udf16(\ud835\udc663 \u227b \ud835\udc661) = 1/3 \u2212 \ud835\udf16/4, P\ud835\udf16(\ud835\udc663 \u227b \ud835\udc662) = 2/3 + \ud835\udf16/4, P\ud835\udf16(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 \u227b \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56) = 1/2,\nand P\ud835\udf16(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 \u227b \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57) = 1 \u2212 P\ud835\udf16(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57 \u227b \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56), for 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56 < \ud835\udc57 \u2264 3. By a simple calculation, we deduce that for\nany |\ud835\udf16| \u2264 1/3, the Nash equilibrium of this preference model consists in selecting \ud835\udc661 and \ud835\udc662 with\n5\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nprobability 1/3 + \ud835\udf16/2 each, and \ud835\udc663 with probability 1/3 \u2212 \ud835\udf16.\nWe believe that in this situation, the Nash solution of the preference model (i.e., the NLHF solution),\nassigning close to uniform probability to these 3 actions (one being preferred by each category of\nhumans) is more aligned with the diversity of human preferences than the optimum of the reward\nmodel (i.e., the RLHF solution), which would deterministically select a single action. Also the Nash\nequilibrium is less sensitive to the preference distribution, since the corresponding equilibrium is\nsmooth w.r.t. change in the distribution over types of humans (i.e., when \ud835\udf16 varies near 0), whereas\nthe RLHF solution will switch from selecting exclusively \ud835\udc661 when \ud835\udf16 > 0 to selecting exclusively \ud835\udc662\nwhen \ud835\udf16 < 0.\n3.3. Sensitivity to the sampling distribution\nAnother difference between reward and preference models is that a reward model depends on the\ndistribution over responses it has been trained on, whereas a preference model essentially does not.\nIndeed, when we learn a reward model we are solving the following optimization problem:\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf0b def= arg max\n\ud835\udc5f(\u00b7,\u00b7) \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c,\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udc4d\u223c\ud835\udf08\ud835\udd3c\nh\nlog\n\u0010\n\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\u210e\n\ud835\udc64) \u2212 \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\u210e\n\ud835\udc59 ))\n\u0011i\n,\nwhere \ud835\udc66\u210e\n\ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udc66\u210e\n\ud835\udc59 are respectively the preferred (and less preferred) response (among \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032)\naccording to a randomly sampled human \ud835\udc4d \u223c \ud835\udf08, given \ud835\udc65. The (optimal) solution to this problem\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf0b depends on the policy \ud835\udf0b that has generated the data. Indeed, as mentioned in the introduction\n(see Section 1), the reward model assigns an Elo score to each individual response, which is defined\nin terms of a comparison against other responses; thus, it depends on the overall distribution over\nresponses it has been trained on.\nOn the contrary, since the preference model takes two responses as input, the output does not depend\ndirectly on the distribution these responses have been sampled from. The preference model is simply\nlearnt by supervised learning, where for each \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66\u2032, the preference model P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) is regressed\nto the human preference \ud835\udfd9{\ud835\udc66 is preferred to \ud835\udc66\u2032 given \ud835\udc65} using a cross entropy loss:\nP\u2217 def= arg max\nP(\u00b7\u227b\u00b7|\u00b7) \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c,\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udc4d\u223c\ud835\udf08\ud835\udd3c\n\u0002\nlog P(\ud835\udc66\u210e\n\ud835\udc64 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u210e\n\ud835\udc59 |\ud835\udc65)\n\u0003\n.\nNotice that the optimal solution to this optimization problem is, for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208 supp(\ud835\udf0c), \ud835\udc66 \u2208\nsupp(\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)), \ud835\udc66\u2032 \u2208 supp(\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)),\nP\u2217(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) = \u2119\ud835\udc4d\u223c\ud835\udf08 (Human \ud835\udc4d prefers \ud835\udc66 to \ud835\udc66\u2032 given \ud835\udc65) ,\nthus does not depend on \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0b or \ud835\udf0b\u2032. Now, of course, when using approximate models the learned\npreference model may still depend on the data distribution as the quality of the approximate model\nwill depend on the local quantity of data collected.\nThus it is our general expectation that the preference model is significantly less reliant on the specific\npolicy that generated the data when compared to the reward model.\nThis observation becomes even more important in scenarios where multiple iterations of RLHF/NLHF\noccur, comprising data collection, constructing a reward/preference model, policy optimization based\non the model, and collecting new data following the updated policy.\nIn the case of RLHF, the reward model from a prior iteration diverges from the next iteration due to\nshifts in data generation, necessitating complete relearning. On the contrary, in the NLHF approach,\nthe preference model can be preserved and further enriched through the introduction of novel data,\nthereby offering a more seamless and efficient adaptation process.\n6\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\n4. Regularized preference model\nWe now consider a regularized version of the preference model. This is motivated by situations where\nthe preference model is more accurately estimated when following some given policy. This could\ninclude the policy responsible for generating the data used to train the preference model or situations\nwhere it is imperative to ensure that our solution remains close to a known safe policy. In such cases,\nwe incorporate a penalty mechanism into our preference model, employing KL-regularization to\nquantify the divergence between the policy under consideration and a designated reference policy\ndenoted as \ud835\udf07; see Jaques et al. (2019); Ouyang et al. (2022); Stiennon et al. (2020) for further details\non the role KL-regularization in RLHF.\nThe regularized preference between actions \ud835\udc66 \u223c \ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc66\u2032 \u223c \ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) is defined as\nP\ud835\udf0b,\ud835\udf0b\u2032\n\ud835\udf0f\n(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)\ndef= P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) \u2212 \ud835\udf0f log \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)\n\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udf0f log \ud835\udf0b\u2032(\ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)\n\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) ,\nand we define accordingly the KL-regularized preference between policies:\nP\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032)\ndef=\n\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c,\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)\nh\nP\ud835\udf0b,\ud835\udf0b\u2032\n\ud835\udf0f\n(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)\ni\n=\nP(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) \u2212 \ud835\udf0fKL\ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf07) + \ud835\udf0fKL\ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udf0b\u2032, \ud835\udf07),\n(2)\nwhere KL\ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf07) = \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c[KL(\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udf07(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65))]. We now state the existence and uniqueness of the Nash\nequilibrium of this regularized preference model.\nProposition 1 (Nash equilibrium). There exists a unique Nash equilibrium of the regularized preference\nmodel P\ud835\udf0f.\nProof. The mappings \ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) and \ud835\udf0b\u2032 \u21a6\u2192 P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) are linear in \ud835\udf0b (respectively in \ud835\udf0b\u2032) thus\n\ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) is concave and \ud835\udf0b\u2032 \u21a6\u2192 P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) is convex. Existence of a Nash equilibrium is\nderived from the minimax theorem for convex-concave functions (Sion, 1958) and its uniqueness\ncomes from its strict convexity/concavity, see Appendix C for the proof of uniqueness using variational\ninequalities.\n\u25a1\n5. Algorithms for approximating the Nash equilibrium\nThe regularized preference model P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) defines a constant-sum two-player game where Player\n1 selects \ud835\udf0b and Player 2 selects \ud835\udf0b\u2032. There are well-known techniques for approximating the Nash\nequilibrium. Some of them offer a convergence on average (in the sense that it is a mixture of the\nsequence of policies that converges to the Nash equilibrium), whereas other methods offer convergence\nof the last iterate.\nConvergence on average.\nFictitious play (FP; Brown, 1951; Fudenberg and Levine, 1998; Heinrich\net al., 2015; Robinson, 1951) consists in playing, at every iteration, each player\u2019s best response against\nthe uniform mixture of the opponent\u2019s past strategies. Here we would define \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1\ndef= arg max\ud835\udf0b P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b\n\u00af\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61), where \u00af\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 is the mixture policy 1\n\ud835\udc61\n\u00cd\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc60=1 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc60. It is known that the mixture policy \u00af\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 converges to\nthe Nash equilibrium in constant-sum games (see Hofbauer and Sorin (2006) for a reference in\nthe general concave-convex case considered here). Also, FP has been considered with function\napproximation (Heinrich and Silver, 2016). Online convex optimization: In the context of solving\nconvex-concave constant-sum games, we rely on online convex optimization where each player\nminimizes its own convex loss. See for example Cesa-Biachi and Lugosi (2006); Hoda et al. (2010);\nNesterov (2005). Regret minimization has been extensively considered in games since the average\nstrategy of self-playing no-regret algorithms converges to a Nash equilibrium (Kangarshahi et al., 2018;\n7\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nRakhlin and Sridharan, 2013). Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) has been considered in the\nsetting of imperfect information games in (Zinkevich et al., 2007) showing a \ud835\udc42(1/\u221a\n\ud835\udc61) convergence\nrate in terms of exploitability. Other techniques provide a faster rate of convergence \ud835\udc42(1/\ud835\udc61) (Abernethy\net al., 2018; Daskalakis et al., 2011; Farina et al., 2019; Syrgkanis et al., 2015). These techniques\nhave been usually studied in the discrete time setting but has also been looked at in continuous\ntime (Mertikopoulos et al., 2018).\nConvergence of the last iterate.\nExtragradient or optimistic mirror descent methods have been\nproven to converge to a Nash equilibrium (Korpelevich, 1976; Mertikopoulos et al., 2019) with\npossibly an exponential rate in unconstrained spaces (Mokhtari et al., 2020). The most closely\nrelated extragradient method in this domain is optimistic multiplicative-weights-update (OMWU;\nDaskalakis and Panageas, 2019) which provides convergence guarantees to the Nash equilibrium\nof the last iterate. Another approach uses the Frank-Wolfe method to compute Nash equilibria in\nnormal-form games (Gidel et al., 2016), although convergence is attained at the same rate as for\nfictitious play. A related algorithm introduced by Munos et al. (2020) for imperfect information\ngames consists in each player doing a step of mirror ascent against an improved opponent (MAIO) for\nwhich exponential convergence of the last-iterate was proven (with a instance-dependent exponent).\nAnother approach (Perolat et al., 2021, 2022), called regularized Nash dynamics (R-NaD), introduced\nfriction to the dynamics by considering a KL-regularized objective showed a last-iterate convergence\nin a continuous-time dynamics setting.\n6. Analysis of a tabular algorithm: Nash-MD\nFor simplicity of notation we remove the dependence on the context \ud835\udc65, thus policies \ud835\udf0b \u2208 \u0394(Y) are\nprobability distributions over Y. We now introduce an algorithm, called Nash-MD, which is a novel\nvariant of mirror descent (Bubeck, 2015; Lattimore and Szepesv\u00e1ri, 2020; Nemirovski and Yudin,\n1983) that makes use of a specific regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 which is a geometric mixture between the\ncurrent policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 and the reference policy \ud835\udf07. We prove the convergence (in terms of KL distance) of\nthe last iterate to the Nash equilibrium of P\ud835\udf0f.\nThe Nash-MD algorithm:\nDefine the regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 as a geometric mixture between the\ncurrent policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 and the reference policy \ud835\udf07:\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc66)\ndef=\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc66)1\u2212\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66)\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f\n\u00cd\n\ud835\udc66\u2032 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc66\u2032)1\u2212\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66\u2032)\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f ,\n(3)\nwhere \ud835\udf02 is a learning rate. We define the Nash-MD algorithm as a step of mirror descent relative to\nthe regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 :\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1\ndef= arg max\n\ud835\udf0b\n\u0002\n\ud835\udf02P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 ) \u2212 KL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 )\n\u0003\n.\n(4)\nThe optimization above can also be made explicit in the following form:\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1(\ud835\udc66) \u221d \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc66) exp \u0000\ud835\udf02P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 )\u0001\n,\nor equivalently\nlog \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1(\ud835\udc66) = [(1 \u2212 \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f) log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc66) + \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f log \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66)] + \ud835\udf02P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 ) + \ud835\udc50,\n(5)\nwhere \ud835\udc50 is a normalization constant which is independent of \ud835\udc66.\nThe intuition for this algorithm is to improve the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 in a direction that increases the\npreference \ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 P(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 ) against the regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 , while not deviating too much from it. We\nnow state our main theoretical result; see Appendix B for the proof.\n8\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nTheorem 1. Let \ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f be the Nash equilibrium of the regularized preference model: P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) = P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b\n\ud835\udf0b\u2032) \u2212 \ud835\udf0fKL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf07) + \ud835\udf0fKL(\ud835\udf0b\u2032, \ud835\udf07). At every iteration \ud835\udc61 we have that\nKL(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f)KL(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) + 2\ud835\udf022.\n(6)\nWe deduce that for the choice \ud835\udf02 = log\ud835\udc47/(\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc47) we have\nKL(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc47) \u2264\n\u0012\nKL(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0b0) + 2 log\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udf0f2\n\u0013 1\n\ud835\udc47 .\nThus this algorithm produces a sequence of policies (\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61)1\u2264\ud835\udc61\u2264\ud835\udc47 with last-iterate convergence (in KL-\ndivergence) to the regularized Nash equilibrium \ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f at a speed \u02dc\ud835\udc42(1/\ud835\udc47). We now mention several\nimportant features of this algorithm, specially in the context of LLMs.\nNash-MD does not require playing against the full mixture \u00af\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61.\nIn order to compute \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1 we\ndo not need to play against the mixture \u00af\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 = 1\n\ud835\udc61\n\u00cd\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc60=1 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc60 of past policies (where by \u2018playing against a\npolicy \u02dc\ud835\udf0b\u2019 we mean computing (or estimating) the preference P(\ud835\udc66, \u02dc\ud835\udf0b)), unlike in fictitious play. We\nplay against a single (geometric) mixture \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 between the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 and the reference policy\n\ud835\udf07. This is important in situations, such as in LLMs, where storing and generating sample from several\npolicies is costly.\nNash-MD has a last-iterate convergence property.\nThe second important property of Nash-MD\nis that we have convergence of the last-iterate (i.e., the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 converges to \ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f) and not\nonly convergence on average (as is typically the case of fictitious play and usual regret minimization\nalgorithms like CFR and OMD). This feature is particularly important in the context of LLMs as well\ndue to the substantial memory resources that would be otherwise needed to store a mixture policy\nlike \u00af\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61.\nComparison with online mirror descent (OMD).\nIn general the analysis of constant-sum concave-\nconvex games can be performed in the framework of online convex optimization where the goal is\nto find a sequence of solutions \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 that minimizes the sum of a sequence of convex loss functions\n\ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b). The OMD algorithm (using the KL as Bregman divergence) defines the sequence:\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1\ndef= arg min\n\ud835\udf0b\n[\ud835\udf02\u2207\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) \u00b7 (\ud835\udf0b \u2212 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) + KL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61)] ,\n(7)\nfor which it can be shown (see e.g., Cesa-Biachi and Lugosi, 2006) that the average cumulative regret,\nunder optimal choice of learning rate, can be bounded as\n1\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc47\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc61=1\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) \u2212 min\n\ud835\udf0b\n1\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc47\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc61=1\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b) = \ud835\udc42\n\u0010\n1/\n\u221a\n\ud835\udc47\n\u0011\n.\nThis type of upper bound on the regret can be further used to deduce a convergence result in constant-\nsum games where each player would play an OMD strategy to minimize their own convex loss. In our\ncontext, we could apply this OMD strategy to minimize the regularized preference model P\ud835\udf0f, and since\nP\ud835\udf0f is symmetric, we only need to consider the dynamics of a single player. So the loss function at time \ud835\udc61\nis the negative preference against the current policy of the opponent: \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b) = \u2212P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61). We deduce\nthat \u2207\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) = \u2212 [\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0bP\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61)]\ud835\udf0b=\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61, thus \u2207\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) \u00b7 \ud835\udf0b = \u2212 \u00cd\n\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc66)\nh\nP(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udf0f\n\u0010\nlog \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc66)\n\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66) + 1\n\u0011i\n. Thus\nthe OMD update rule in Equation (7) can be rewritten as\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1 = arg max\n\ud835\udf0b\n\"\n\ud835\udf02\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc66)\n\u0012\nP(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udf0f log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc66)\n\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66)\n\u0013\n\u2212 KL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61)\n#\n.\n9\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nNow, using the regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 introduced in Equation (3), we can rewrite this update rule as\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1 = arg max\n\ud835\udf0b\n\u0002\n\ud835\udf02P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) \u2212 KL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 )\n\u0003\n.\n(8)\nComparing Equation (4) and Equation (8) we notice that both OMD and Nash-MD make use of\nthe same KL penalty term KL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 ). However they differ in the fact that OMD optimizes the\npreference \ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) against the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 whereas Nash-MD optimizes the preference\n\ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 P(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 ) against the regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 .\nIn the context of convex-concave games, the regret bound on the average cumulative regret translates\ninto an upper bound on the exploitability of the game when players play their average policies, thus\nentailing their on-average convergence to the Nash equilibrium. However it is known that usual\nregret-minimization algorithms may not possess a last-iterate convergence property because the\nsequence of policies \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61 may oscillate around the Nash equilibrium (see, for example, Mertikopoulos\net al., 2018). Nevertheless, last-iterate convergence have been obtained for variants of OMD, such as\nextra-gradient and optimistic versions, see e.g., Daskalakis and Panageas (2019); Mertikopoulos et al.\n(2019); Mokhtari et al. (2020); Munos et al. (2020); Rakhlin and Sridharan (2013).\nTo the best of our knowledge, it appears that Nash-MD has not been introduced before, despite its\nsimplicity. Nash-MD enjoys a last-iterate convergence property with a KL-divergence to the Nash\nequilibrium decaying as \u02dc\ud835\udc42(1/\ud835\udc47). We believe the reason this simple modification of OMD possesses\nthese nice properties is because of the special structure of the regularized preference function that we\nconsider here which is the sum of a bilinear function (in policy spaces) and a KL-penalty term.\nThe contextual bandit setting.\nAll the results mentioned in this section are for the state-independent\ncase, where policies and preferences do not depend on the context \ud835\udc65. In the case of LLMs the context\nis the prompt \ud835\udc65, and responses \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032 are generated conditioned on \ud835\udc65. However the theoretical\nresults do not change. Indeed, we would define the Nash-MD algorithm in the contextual bandit case\nas follows: for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208 supp(\ud835\udf0c),\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)\ndef= arg max\n\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7)\n\u0002\n\ud835\udf02P(\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 (\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)|\ud835\udc65) \u2212 KL(\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7), \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 (\u00b7|\ud835\udc65))\n\u0003\n,\nwhere\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) \u221d \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)1\u2212\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f.\nWe prove the convergence of this algorithm, in exactly the same way as in Theorem 1, by showing\nthat at every iteration \ud835\udc61 we have\nKL(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61+1)\n\u2264\n(1 \u2212 \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf0f)KL(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc61) + 2\ud835\udf022,\nwhere KL(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b\u2032) = \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c[KL(\ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65))].\n7. Implementation of NLHF\nNow, building upon the insights from Nash-MD, we explore potential gradient-based algorithms for\ndeep-learning architectures designed for the computation of the Nash equilibrium of a preference\nmodel, with a specific focus on their applicability in the context of LLMs.\n7.1. Generating one token at the time, instead of a full sequence\nIn LLMs it is usually the case that tokens are generated one at a time in an autoregressive manner.\nThus the response \ud835\udc66 \u223c \ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) can be written as \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc41 (where \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc41\ndef= (\ud835\udc660, . . . , \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc41)), where each\ntoken \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b is generated from a distribution \ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) conditioned on previous tokens, such that\n10\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\n\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc41|\ud835\udc65) = \u00ce\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121). In practice (see the experiments section for results on LLMs) we will\nimplement this token-per-token autoregressive generation of responses \ud835\udc66 \u223c \ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) using next token\ndistributions (implemented as a softmax over logits).\nNow consider a parametric policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03. Nash-MD requires the generation of alternative responses\n\ud835\udc66\u2032 \u223c \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03 from the regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03 which is defined in Equation (3) as a geometric mixture\nbetween the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 and the reference policy \ud835\udf07. However it is not easy to generate a\nsequence \ud835\udc66 from this distribution by sampling one token \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b at a time. In particular, since \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03 is not a\nsimple (arithmetic) mixture, we cannot select one policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 or \ud835\udf07 according to some prior probability\n(that would depend on \ud835\udf0f) and then generate a sequence of tokens following that policy. Additionally,\ndefining the normalization constant \ud835\udc50 as in Equation (5) for the full mixture \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03 is computationally\nprohibitive given the large number of possible sequences; instead, we would like to proceed by\ngenerating a token at a time. The approach we follow in our experiments consists in generating a\ntoken \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b from the marginal (geometric) mixture \u02dc\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) defined such that\nlog \u02dc\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) = \ud835\udf0f log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0f) log \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) + \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121),\nwhere the normalization constant \ud835\udc36 depends on \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121. In order to sample from this marginal\ngeometric mixture over the \ud835\udc5bth token, we evaluate the corresponding logits of both the current policy\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 and the reference policy \ud835\udf07 (conditioned on (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121)), we compute their (\ud835\udf0f-arithmetic) mixture,\nand sample a next token \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b from the corresponding softmax distribution. We call this corresponding\nproduct of marginal (geometric) mixtures over individual tokens the one-step-at-a-time regularized\npolicy\n\u02dc\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)\ndef=\n\ud835\udc41\n\u00d6\n\ud835\udc5b=0\n\u02dc\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121).\nNotice that the one-step-at-a-time regularized policy \u02dc\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) is different from the original regularized\npolicy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0f\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) because the sequence of normalization constants \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) depend on the specific\nsample path \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121 and does not necessarily correspond to the full normalization constant \ud835\udc50 defined\nin Equation (5). We leave the analysis of the difference between these two policies for future work.\n7.2. Computing the Nash equilibrium using regularized policy gradient\nOur general algorithm for computing the Nash equilibrium of the preference model consists in\nrepeating these steps:\n\u2022 We randomly select a prompt \ud835\udc65 \u223c \ud835\udf0c.\n\u2022 We generate two responses \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032 (in an autoregressive fashion in the case of LLMs):\n\u2013 the first one \ud835\udc66 \u223c \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) by following the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 that is being optimized;\n\u2013 the second one \ud835\udc66\u2032 \u223c \ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) by following an alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032.\nThe choice of the alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 that we use for the second generated sample \ud835\udc66\u2032 depends on\nthe specific algorithm we consider (the description of which is given in the next subsection).\n\u2022 We update the parameter \ud835\udf03 of the policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 in the direction of the gradient \u2207\ud835\udf03P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) of the\nregularized preference model P\ud835\udf0f.\nWe consider two cases, depending on whether a preference model is learnt or not.\n11\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nP-model-based approach.\nIf we have learnt a preference model P (see Section 8.1 for example for\nhow one can learn a preference model) we query it to get the preference reward P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) and\nupdate \ud835\udf03 by moving it in the direction of the policy gradient estimate\nb\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66\u2032)\ndef= \u2207\ud835\udf03 log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) (P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) \u2212 1/2 \u2212 \ud835\udf0f log(\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)/\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65))) .\n(9)\nNotice we have subtracted the baseline 1/2 = P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) from the preference P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) (which\ndoes not change the expectation of the gradient) as a variance reduction technique that does not\nrequire learning a value function as baseline. In practice, when the response \ud835\udc66 comprises a sequence\nof tokens \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc41, a sample-based estimator to the KL based on the sample response \ud835\udc66 can be used.\nFurther, this can be decomposed into a sum across token indicies of per-token KL estimators, and\nthe standard policy-gradient variance-reduction trick of only multiplying \u2207\ud835\udf03 log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b|\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc660:\ud835\udc5b\u22121) by KL\nestimator terms corresponding to indices at least as great as \ud835\udc5b can be applied.\nP-model-free approach.\nIn the case the preference model P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) comes directly from\nhuman preferences: P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) = \u2119\ud835\udc4d\u223c\ud835\udf08(Human \ud835\udc4d prefers \ud835\udc66 over \ud835\udc66\u2032 given \ud835\udc65), where \ud835\udf08 is a dis-\ntribution over humans, and if humans are immediately available to express their preference be-\ntween any two responses, we can directly estimate the gradient by replacing P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) with\n\ud835\udfd9{Human \ud835\udc4d prefers \ud835\udc66 over \ud835\udc66\u2032 given \ud835\udc65} in Equation (9). This estimate does not require to learn a\npreference model first and is thus not affected by possible bias coming from an approximate model.\nImplementation-wise it requires having access to humans preference immediately after having gener-\nated the responses \ud835\udc66 and \ud835\udc66\u2032.\nIn both model-based and model-free approaches, we have that\n\u2207\ud835\udf03P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032) = \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c,\nn\n\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 (\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)\n\ud835\udc66\u2032\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2032 (\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)\n[b\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc66\u2032)] ,\n(10)\n(where \ud835\udf0b\u2032 denotes a stop-gradient on \ud835\udf0b\u2032 in the case \ud835\udf0b\u2032 would depend on \ud835\udf03).\n7.3. Choice of the alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032\nNow, for the choice of alternative policies \ud835\udf0b\u2032 that are used to generate the second sample \ud835\udc66\u2032, we will\nconsider two different algorithms Nash-MD-PG and Nash-EMA-PG, that are inspired by, respectively,\nthe mirror-ascent algorithm Nash-MD introduced in the previous section, and a generalization of\nfictitious play where we consider an exponential moving average.\nNash-MD-PG.\nWe define the alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 as a geometric-mixture between \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 and \ud835\udf07 in\na similar way as the regularized policy is defined in Equation (3):\nlog \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)\ndef= (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) log(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)) + \ud835\udefd log(\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65)) + \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc65),\n(11)\nwhere \ud835\udefd \u2208 [0, 1] is the parameter of the mixture, and \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc65) is a constant independent of \ud835\udc66. This is\ninspired by the Nash-MD algorithm described in Section 6, which we have proven to be convergent in\nTheorem 1. In the case of sequential generation of tokens in LLMs, we apply the one-step-at-a-time\nversion \u02dc\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 of this regularized policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 as defined in Subsection 7.1. However, the corresponding PG\nversion outlined in Subsection 7.2 differs from Nash-MD as defined in Section 6 in a number of ways.\nIn addition to using a parametric representation of policies instead of a tabular one, it differs from\nthe fact that it is not directly implementing a mirror descent algorithm but a simple gradient descent\non the regularized preference model. In a sense this algorithm is only making a gradient step for the\ninner optimization problem of Equation (4), whereas a more faithful variant of Nash-MD would use a\ntwo-time scale algorithm and perform several gradient steps (while keeping \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 and \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 fixed) until\n12\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nthe inner loop has reached an optimum, before updating \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 and \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03. Another apparent difference is\nthat Nash-MD uses a KL-regularization w.r.t. the mixture policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03, whereas Nash-MD-PG uses a KL\nw.r.t. the reference policy \ud835\udf07. However, we have that\nKL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03) = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd)KL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03) + \ud835\udefdKL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf07) \u2212 \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c[\ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc65)] = \ud835\udefdKL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf07) \u2212 \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c[\ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc65)],\nwhere \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc65) is the normalizing constant in Equation (11). Thus, we have\n\u2207\ud835\udf03KL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03) = \ud835\udefd\u2207\ud835\udf03KL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf07) ,\nand since we perform a single step of gradient descent before updating \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, regularizing with respect\nto the mixture \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 (in Nash-MD) is equivalent to regularizing w.r.t. \ud835\udf07 (in Nash-MD-PG). Further, we\nuse an additional parameter \ud835\udefd (to define the mixture) that can be further tuned independently of \ud835\udf0f.\nThus, while it is possible to implement Nash-MD more faithfully, such as by incorporating two-\ntimescale policy gradient versions or exploring variants of regularized policy gradient methods such\nas PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) or NeuRD (Hennes et al., 2020), we contend that the essence of\nNash-MD is encapsulated in Nash-MD-PG for the following reason: the policy gradient algorithm\nEquation (10) improves the current policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 by playing against the geometric mixture \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 while\npreserving regularization with respect to \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03.\nExtreme cases for \ud835\udefd \u2208 [0, 1].\nConsider the alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf03 of Nash-MD-PG when \ud835\udefd \u2208 [0, 1]\ntakes its extreme possible values: \ud835\udefd = 0 or 1. When \ud835\udefd = 0 then \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd=0\n\ud835\udf03\n= \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03, thus the alternative policy\nis the current policy, and this algorithm is simply a version of self-play (SP) where one improves its\npolicy by playing against oneself. We do not expect this algorithm (even in its tabular form) to enjoy\na last-iterate convergence to the Nash equilibrium; see the discussion around the OMD algorithm in\nEquation (8).\nNow, when \ud835\udefd = 1, then the alternative policy is \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udefd=1\n\ud835\udf03\n= \ud835\udf07, thus we are improving the current policy\nagainst the (fixed) reference policy \ud835\udf07 (i.e., optimizing \ud835\udf0b \u21a6\u2192 P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf07)), thus this a version of best-\nresponse (BR) against \ud835\udf07. This will generally not converge to the Nash equilibrium either because\nthere is no reason that this BR cannot be exploited.\nNash-EMA-PG.\nAs an alternative to Nash-MD-PG, we consider as alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 another\nmixture policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 def= \ud835\udf0b\u00af\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 where \u00af\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 is a exponential moving average (EMA) of the past values of the\nparameter (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc60)\ud835\udc60\u2264\ud835\udc61, defined (recursively) by \u00af\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd)\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf030. Thus when \ud835\udefd = 0 then \ud835\udf0b\u00af\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 and\nthe algorithm is just self-play, and when \ud835\udefd = 1, then \ud835\udf0b\u00af\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf030 and the algorithm is a best response\nagain the fixed initial policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf030.\nNow for any other \ud835\udefd \u2208 (0, 1) the policy uses as parameter a mixture of past parameters. Because of\nthe non-linearity of the policy representation, there is no guarantee that this policy is the mixture\nof the corresponding past policies. However, prior work in deep learning (Busbridge et al., 2023;\nGrill et al., 2020; Rame et al., 2023; Wortsman et al., 2022) suggests that it could be a reasonable\nfirst-order approximation to it.\n8. Experiments\nWe now report experiments on a summarisation task and compare several algorithms for NLHF\n(self-play, best-response against \ud835\udf07, Nash-MD-PG and Nash-EMA-PG) as well as a RLHF baseline.\n13\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\n8.1. Preference models versus reward models\nIn this section, we compare parametric preference models P\ud835\udf03 and reward models \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03. Preference\nmodels assigns a score P\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) \u2208 [0, 1] that can be interpreted as the probability of generation \ud835\udc66\nbeing preferred to generation \ud835\udc66\u2032 given the context \ud835\udc65. The preference P\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) is initialised by\nusing a LLM prompted in the following way:\n\u2018You are an expert summary rater.\nGiven a piece of text and two of its\npossible summaries, output 1 or 2 to indicate which summary is better.\nText - \u27e8text\u27e9, Summary 1 - \u27e8summary1\u27e9, Summary 2 - \u27e8summary2\u27e9.\nPreferred Summary -\u2019,\nwhere \u27e8text\u27e9 corresponds to \ud835\udc65, \u27e8summary1\u27e9 to \ud835\udc66, and \u27e8summary2\u27e9 to \ud835\udc66\u2032. We then use the last logit\nfor an arbitrary chosen token and pass it through a sigmoid function to output a single number in\n[0, 1]. This number models the preference P\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65). We train the LLM to fit the underlying\nhuman preference probability P(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) by minimizing a cross-entropy loss on a dataset \ud835\udc37 =\n{(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc64, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc59 )1\u2264\ud835\udc58\u2264\ud835\udc3e}, where \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc64 is the preferred generation, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc59 is the less preferred generation and \ud835\udc3e is\nthe number of examples:\nLP(\ud835\udf03) = \u2212\ud835\udd3c(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59)\u223c\ud835\udc37 [log (P\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64 \u227b \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59|\ud835\udc65))] .\nReward models assigns a score \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) \u2208 \u211d that can be interpreted as the value of a generation \ud835\udc66 given\na context \ud835\udc65. The reward \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) is defined by prompting the LLM in the following way: \u2018Context -\n\u27e8text\u27e9, Summary - \u27e8summary\u27e9\u2019 where \u27e8text\u27e9 corresponds to \ud835\udc65 and \u27e8summary\u27e9 to \ud835\udc66. We then\nuse the last logit for an arbitrary chosen token to output a single number. This number models\nthe reward \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65). Reward models are trained to fit the underlying human preference probability\nP(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65) via a Bradley-Terry model P\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47 (\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65)\ndef= \ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66\u2032)) where \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc65) is the\nsigmoid function. They use the same preference dataset \ud835\udc37 and minimize the following cross-entropy\nloss:\nL\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udf03) = \u2212\ud835\udd3c(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59)\u223c\ud835\udc37 [log (\ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64|\ud835\udc65) \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59|\ud835\udc65)))] .\nIn our experiments, we use the summarization dataset described in Stiennon et al. (2020) that\nhas been built from the TL;DR dataset (V\u00f6lske et al., 2017). We train our preference and reward\nmodels on the train set \ud835\udc37Train, that contains 92820 examples, and evaluate them on a test set of high\nconfidence data \ud835\udc37Test. To measure the quality of our models we use the expected agreement, also\ncalled accuracy, between our models and the human ratings:\nA(P\ud835\udf03) = \ud835\udd3c(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59)\u223c\ud835\udc37\n\u0002\n1{P\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64\u227b\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59 |\ud835\udc65)\u22650.5}\n\u0003\n,\nA(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03) = \ud835\udd3c(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59)\u223c\ud835\udc37\n\u0002\n1{\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc64|\ud835\udc65)\u2212\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc59 |\ud835\udc65))\u22650.5}\n\u0003\n.\nOur first experiment (see Figure 1) shows the accuracy of preference models with different sizes.\nOur models are T5X encoder-decoder models (transformer models) that have been described in\ndetail in (Roberts et al., 2022; Roit et al., 2023). We use different sizes: T5X-small (110M), T5X-XL\n(3B) and T5X-XXL (11B). We see, on the test set, that the bigger the model the better the accuracy.\nHowever, there is relatively small gains going from 3B to 11B in this specific summarization task. In\nthe remaining, we therefore run our experiments on T5X-XL models only.\nOur second experiment consists in looking at the accuracy of T5X-XL reward model versus the accuracy\nof a T5X-XL preference model. We observe that the preference model has a slightly better accuracy\nthan the reward model on the test set (peak accuracy for the preference model is around 0.78 vs 0.76\nfor the reward model).\n14\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nFigure 1 | Learning curves showing the accuracy of preference models of different sizes on the train\nset (left) and on the test set (right).\nFigure 2 | Learning curves showing the accuracy of a preference model versus the accuracy of a reward\nmodel of the same size on the train set (left) and on the test set (right).\n15\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\n8.2. Supervised fine-tuned (SFT) initial policy\nIn all our experiments, we will initialize our policy with a T5X-L model and fine-tune it by supervised\nlearning using the OpenAI dataset described in Stiennon et al. (2020) that was built from the TL;DR\ndataset (V\u00f6lske et al., 2017). We call this supervised fine-tuned model the SFT. In all our experiments,\nour policies are initialized with this SFT.\nFor all our policy models, we opted for a T5X-L model, as opposed to T5X-XL, for computational\nefficiency and to compute the pairwise comparisons across our policies. The primary objective of\nthese experiments is to provide a proof of concept for the NLHF approach introduced in this paper,\nrather than striving for state-of-the-art performance in text summarization. Therefore, our aim is to\nconduct a fair and equitable comparison among the various approaches.\n8.3. RLHF baseline\nWe established a RLHF baseline by initializing our model with the SFT and then updating the policy\nby doing 10000 steps of a regularized policy gradient update:\n\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc65\u223c\ud835\udf0c,\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65) [\u2207\ud835\udf03 log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65) (\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) \u2212 \ud835\udf0fKL(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udf07(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)))] ,\n(12)\nwhere the reward \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) comes from the trained T5X-XL reward model, as described in Subsection 8.1.\nWe conducted a sweep across a set of values 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 for the parameter \ud835\udf0f of the KL-\nregularization. The value \ud835\udf0f = 0.05 has been selected for the pairwise comparison table below.\n8.4. NLHF algorithms Nash-MD and Nash-EMA\nWe initialize our policy with the SFT and update the model by executing the Nash-MD-PG and\nNash-EMA-PG algorithms as outlined in Section 7. The preference model P used in these algorithms\nis derived from the trained T5X-XL model, as described in Subsection 8.1.\nWe conducted a sweep over the values \ud835\udf0f \u2208 {0.02, 0.01, 0.008, 0.005} and selected \ud835\udf0f = 0.008 for all\nNash-MD and Nash-EMA experiments for the pairwise comparison table below.\nFor Nash-MD-PG we conducted a sweep over the mixing coefficient \ud835\udefd \u2208 {0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, 0.5,\n0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.0} (used in the definition of the alternative policy defined in Section 7.3) and\nfor Nash-EMA-PG we have swept over \ud835\udefd \u2208 {0, 0.999, 0.9995, 0.9999, 1.0}.\n8.5. Pairwise preference between all the models\nHere are the list of all the models we considered for pairwise preference comparison.\n\u2022 SFT: Supervised-fined-tuned, described in Subsection 8.2. All models all initialised with this SFT\nand this SFT is also the policy \ud835\udf07 we use for the KL-regularization.\n\u2022 RLHF described in Subsection 8.3 with regularization coefficient \ud835\udf0f = 0.05.\n\u2022 SP (self-play). This corresponds to Nash-MD-PG with mixture coefficient \ud835\udefd = 0 (or equivalently\nNash-EMA-PG with \ud835\udefd = 0 as both algorithms are equivalent for \ud835\udefd = 0), described in Subsection 8.4.\nThe policy improves by playing against itself (the alternative policy \ud835\udf0b\u2032 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03 is the current policy).\n\u2022 MD1 to MD6 is Nash-MD-PG with \ud835\udefd \u2208 {0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75}.\n\u2022 BR is best-response against SFT. This corresponds to Nash-MD-PG with \ud835\udefd = 1 (or equivalently\nNash-EMA-PG with \ud835\udefd = 1). The policy improves by playing against the fixed SFT policy.\n\u2022 EMA1 and EMA2 are the last-iterate of Nash-EMA-PG (i.e., returns the last policy), with \ud835\udefd \u2208\n{0.999, 0.9995}.\n16\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\n\u2022 EMA1* and EMA* are the EMA policy of Nash-EMA-PG (i.e., returns the policy with average\nweight) with \ud835\udefd \u2208 {0.999, 0.9995}.\nAll models are trained for 10000 steps. The Nash-MD models (as well as SP and BR) and Nash-EMA\nare trained with a regularization coefficient of \ud835\udf0f = 0.008. The pairwise preference comparisons\nunder P\ud835\udf0f are given in Table 1; these figures are estimated based on 1,000 pairwise comparisons, and\nhence an upper bound on the width of a 95% confidence interval for each is \u00b10.032, based on the\nexact Clopper-Pearson method for Bernoulli proportions (Clopper and Pearson, 1934). Note that\nthe Clopper-Pearson method can be used to deduce a per-element confidence interval which may be\nconsiderably narrower in cases where the empirically observed preference rate is close to 0 or 1.\nTable 1 | The regularized preference P\ud835\udf0f(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc50 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f) between column policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc50 against row policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\nP\ud835\udf0f\nSFT\nRLHF\nSP\nMD1\nMD2\nMD3\nMD4\nMD5\nMD6\nBR\nEMA1\nEMA2\nEMA1*\nEMA2*\nSFT\n0.500\n0.975\n0.981\n0.986\n0.983\n0.982\n0.979\n0.970\n0.967\n0.933\n0.965\n0.970\n0.971\n0.975\nRLHF\n0.025\n0.500\n0.741\n0.769\n0.752\n0.744\n0.661\n0.450\n0.340\n0.167\n0.640\n0.531\n0.617\n0.671\nSP\n0.019\n0.259\n0.500\n0.547\n0.506\n0.509\n0.406\n0.244\n0.185\n0.082\n0.418\n0.338\n0.363\n0.450\nMD1\n0.014\n0.231\n0.453\n0.500\n0.471\n0.469\n0.354\n0.224\n0.165\n0.079\n0.372\n0.308\n0.348\n0.409\nMD2\n0.017\n0.248\n0.494\n0.529\n0.500\n0.492\n0.393\n0.231\n0.182\n0.084\n0.426\n0.315\n0.375\n0.454\nMD3\n0.018\n0.256\n0.491\n0.531\n0.508\n0.500\n0.380\n0.230\n0.153\n0.087\n0.411\n0.328\n0.349\n0.457\nMD4\n0.021\n0.339\n0.594\n0.646\n0.607\n0.620\n0.500\n0.306\n0.224\n0.088\n0.508\n0.416\n0.458\n0.531\nMD5\n0.030\n0.550\n0.756\n0.776\n0.769\n0.770\n0.694\n0.500\n0.380\n0.169\n0.682\n0.554\n0.627\n0.697\nMD6\n0.033\n0.660\n0.815\n0.835\n0.818\n0.847\n0.776\n0.620\n0.500\n0.269\n0.735\n0.644\n0.706\n0.777\nBR\n0.067\n0.833\n0.918\n0.921\n0.916\n0.913\n0.912\n0.831\n0.731\n0.500\n0.856\n0.789\n0.830\n0.875\nEMA1\n0.035\n0.360\n0.582\n0.628\n0.574\n0.589\n0.492\n0.318\n0.265\n0.144\n0.500\n0.407\n0.448\n0.507\nEMA2\n0.030\n0.469\n0.662\n0.692\n0.685\n0.672\n0.584\n0.446\n0.356\n0.211\n0.593\n0.500\n0.540\n0.627\nEMA1*\n0.029\n0.383\n0.637\n0.652\n0.625\n0.651\n0.542\n0.373\n0.294\n0.170\n0.552\n0.460\n0.500\n0.589\nEMA2*\n0.025\n0.329\n0.550\n0.591\n0.546\n0.543\n0.469\n0.303\n0.223\n0.125\n0.493\n0.373\n0.411\n0.500\nWe will analyse these results after the next section where we describe an evaluation of our models\nbased on a preference model build from a much larger LLM.\n8.6. Evaluation using the PaLM 2 preference model\nWhile the ideal approach for evaluating our models would involve soliciting human preferences\nbetween summaries generated by different models, we resort to a proxy method using the highly\ncapable LLM, PaLM 2 Large (Anil et al., 2023). We query this model to obtain a preference signal,\nwhich we refer to as the PaLM 2 preference model P\u2217(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032|\ud835\udc65), achieved by prompting the LLM in\nthe following manner:\n\u2018You are an expert summary rater.\nGiven a piece of text and two of its\npossible summaries, output 1 or 2 to indicate which summary is better.\nText - \u27e8text\u27e9, Summary 1 - \u27e8summary1\u27e9, Summary 2 - \u27e8summary2\u27e9.\nPreferred Summary -\u2019,\nwhere \u27e8text\u27e9 corresponds to \ud835\udc65, \u27e8summary1\u27e9 to \ud835\udc66, and \u27e8summary2\u27e9 to \ud835\udc66\u2032.\nThis evaluation approach shares similarities with the method employed by Lee et al. (2023). To\nobtain an assessment of the preference P\u2217(\ud835\udf0b \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2032), we compute the ratio between the total number\nof token \u20191\u2019 generated and the total number of token \u20191\u2019 or \u20192\u2019 across 2000 samples drawn from the\ndistribution (\ud835\udc65 \u223c \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udc66 \u223c \ud835\udf0b(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc66\u2032 \u223c \ud835\udf0b\u2032(\u00b7|\ud835\udc65)).\nThis P\u2217 serves as an approximate surrogate for human preferences. Notably, it is essential to highlight\nthat the preference model P utilized during the training of our policies is considerably smaller in\nsize than P\u2217 and corresponds to a different model. Specifically, P is based on the T5X-XL model,\nfine-tuned with TL;DR data, whereas P\u2217 is derived from the PaLM 2 Large model.\n17\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nThe pairwise preference comparisons under P\u2217 using the PaLM 2 Large model are given in Table 2.\nAs each element is estimated with 2000 samples, the confidence interval, an upper bound on the\n95% confidence interval is given by \u00b10.023, based on the exact Clopper-Pearson method for Bernoulli\nproportions (Clopper and Pearson, 1934).\nTable 2 | PaLM 2 preference P\u2217(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc50 \u227b \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f) model between column policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc50 against row policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f.\nP\u2217\nSFT\nRLHF\nSP\nMD1\nMD2\nMD3\nMD4\nMD5\nMD6\nBR\nEMA1\nEMA2\nEMA1*\nEMA2*\nSFT\n0.500\n0.990\n0.983\n0.982\n0.989\n0.987\n0.985\n0.982\n0.965\n0.943\n0.970\n0.961\n0.977\n0.980\nRLHF\n0.010\n0.500\n0.489\n0.598\n0.519\n0.561\n0.501\n0.436\n0.284\n0.148\n0.468\n0.320\n0.477\n0.510\nSP\n0.017\n0.511\n0.500\n0.592\n0.504\n0.545\n0.499\n0.451\n0.310\n0.211\n0.445\n0.362\n0.464\n0.488\nMD1\n0.018\n0.402\n0.408\n0.500\n0.425\n0.470\n0.369\n0.362\n0.238\n0.163\n0.391\n0.270\n0.400\n0.447\nMD2\n0.011\n0.481\n0.496\n0.575\n0.500\n0.513\n0.491\n0.434\n0.298\n0.196\n0.460\n0.351\n0.430\n0.496\nMD3\n0.013\n0.439\n0.455\n0.530\n0.487\n0.500\n0.484\n0.408\n0.273\n0.187\n0.429\n0.323\n0.413\n0.472\nMD4\n0.015\n0.499\n0.501\n0.631\n0.509\n0.516\n0.500\n0.428\n0.265\n0.161\n0.468\n0.358\n0.437\n0.503\nMD5\n0.018\n0.564\n0.549\n0.638\n0.566\n0.592\n0.572\n0.500\n0.329\n0.210\n0.532\n0.389\n0.518\n0.539\nMD6\n0.035\n0.716\n0.690\n0.762\n0.702\n0.727\n0.735\n0.671\n0.500\n0.342\n0.652\n0.548\n0.651\n0.691\nBR\n0.057\n0.852\n0.789\n0.837\n0.804\n0.813\n0.839\n0.790\n0.658\n0.500\n0.743\n0.640\n0.752\n0.774\nEMA1\n0.030\n0.532\n0.555\n0.609\n0.540\n0.571\n0.532\n0.468\n0.348\n0.257\n0.500\n0.381\n0.480\n0.556\nEMA2\n0.039\n0.680\n0.638\n0.730\n0.649\n0.677\n0.642\n0.611\n0.452\n0.360\n0.619\n0.500\n0.585\n0.659\nEMA1*\n0.023\n0.523\n0.536\n0.600\n0.570\n0.587\n0.563\n0.482\n0.349\n0.248\n0.520\n0.415\n0.500\n0.555\nEMA2*\n0.020\n0.490\n0.512\n0.553\n0.504\n0.528\n0.497\n0.461\n0.309\n0.226\n0.444\n0.341\n0.445\n0.500\n8.7. Analysis of the results\nFirst, let us mention that the RLHF baseline that we have built is a very strong baseline. It beats SFT\nwith a win rate of 99% marking the highest win rate observed against SFT among all models when\nusing the PaLM 2 preference model P\u2217\nBest-response against self-play (BR) does not exhibit strong performance. Despite being trained\nexplicitly to outperform self-play during training, its P\u2217-evaluation yields a relatively modest score\nof 94% against self-play. Furthermore, BR performs poorly against RLHF and all other Nash-based\napproaches. This suggests the possibility of \u2019preference hacking,\u2019 where BR may be overly adapting to\nthe preference model by overfitting to the specific SFT policy.\nSelf-play (SP) exhibits strong overall performance, with notable exceptions in the P\u2217 evaluation\nagainst RLHF and the Nash-MD models (for \ud835\udefd \u2264 0.5). This suggests that enhancing one\u2019s policy\nthrough self-play could be a promising avenue for improving the initial model. However, it\u2019s essential\nto acknowledge that self-play does not guarantee the attainment of a Nash equilibrium, as cyclic\npatterns are possible, as discussed in the Theory Section. In particular, SP is found to be vulnerable to\nexploitation by certain Nash-MD models.\nThe Nash-MD models, especially those with \ud835\udefd \u2264 0.5, exhibit very strong performance. Notably, Nash-\nMD models with \ud835\udefd = 0.125, \ud835\udefd = 0.25, and \ud835\udefd = 0.375 outperform all other models, including RLHF.\nAmong them, Nash-MD with \ud835\udefd = 0.125 (highlighted in bold as \u2019MD1\u2019) emerges as the top-performing\nmodel, surpassing all others in both the training preference model P\ud835\udf0f and the evaluation model P\u2217.\nAll Nash-EMA models, including EMA1 and EMA2 (representing the last iterate) as well as EMA1*\nand EMA2* (representing the average policy), are outperformed by Nash-MD for \ud835\udefd \u2264 0.5 and RLHF.\nThis observation may suggest that the first-order approximation of the mixture policy as the policy\nhaving an average (EMA) weight may not be well-suited in this context, potentially contributing to\nthe overall lower performance.\nExamining Nash-MD, which emerges as the most efficient method, it is interesting to note that both\nextreme values of the mixing parameter \ud835\udefd \u2208 [0, 1], namely \ud835\udefd = 0 (self-play) and \ud835\udefd = 1 (best-response\nagainst SFT), result in suboptimal performance compared to intermediate values of \ud835\udefd (particularly\n\ud835\udefd = 0.125, \ud835\udefd = 0.25, and \ud835\udefd = 0.375). This trend is visible, for instance, in the highlighted blue row\n18\nNash Learning from Human Feedback\nshowing Nash-MD (for \ud835\udefd \u2208 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 1.0) against RLHF. It suggests that\nimproving one\u2019s policy by playing against a mixture of the initial policy and the current policy yields\nsuperior model improvement compared to interactions with either the initial policy or the current\npolicy in isolation.\n9. Conclusion and future work\nNLHF emerges as an interesting and promising alternative to RLHF, offering a fresh perspective\non aligning models with human preferences. Learning a preference model from human preference\ndata is a more intuitive and natural approach compared to learning a reward model. It involves\nsimpler techniques, such as supervised learning, and doesn\u2019t necessitate specific assumptions, like the\nBradley-Terry model.\nOnce a preference model is established, the concept of the Nash equilibrium naturally arises as a\ncompelling solution concept. Nash-MD, an algorithm that optimizes policies by playing against a\ngeometric mixture of the current policy and the initial policy, has been introduced. We have established\nits last-iterate convergence to the Nash equilibrium.\nWe have introduced and implemented deep learning versions of Nash-MD and Nash-EMA in LLMs and\nreported results in a text-summarization task. For Nash-EMA-PG, we considered both the last-iterate\nand the average policy. Both Nash-MD-PG and Nash-EMA-PG demonstrate competitive performance\ncompared to the RLHF baseline.\nNash-MD-PG stands out as the best-performing method, surpassing other models in a pairwise\ncomparison, when evaluated with a very large LLM (PaLM 2 Large). The choice of the mixture\nparameter in Nash-MD entails an interesting trade-off. A parameter value of 0 corresponds to self-play,\nwhile a value of 1 represents best-response against SFT. Notably, intermediate values within the\nrange of 0.125 to 0.375 consistently outperform both self-play and best-response, highlighting the\nadvantages of playing against a mixture of policies as opposed to a pure policy.\nFuture research directions would consider the exploration of various mixtures between the current\npolicy and past checkpoints, extending the concept initially introduced by Nash-MD. Additionally,\nanother immediate direction would consider incorporating a decaying mixing coefficient \ud835\udefd to align\nmore closely with theoretical considerations.\nIn conclusion, NLHF offers a compelling avenue for preference learning and policy optimization. The\nintroduction of Nash-MD as an algorithmic solution, along with deep learning adaptations, opens\nup new possibilities for aligning models with human preferences. Further research in this direction,\nincluding the exploration of different mixture strategies, holds significant promise for advancing the\nfield of aligning LLMs with human preferences.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the individuals who designed and built the RL training infrastructure used in\nthis paper: L\u00e9onard Hussenot, Johan Ferret, Robert Dadashi, Geoffrey Cideron, Alexis Jacq, Sabela\nRamos, Piotr Stanczyk, Danila Sinopalnikov, Am\u00e9lie H\u00e9liou, Ruba Haroun, Matt Hoffman, Bobak\nShahriari, and in particular Olivier Pietquin for motivating discussions.

Maximizing expected Elo vs maximizing probability of winning\nConsider the following preference model, where the set of actions is Y = {\ud835\udc661, \ud835\udc662, \ud835\udc663} and the preference\ntable between these actions is\nP(\ud835\udc66 \u227b \ud835\udc66\u2032)\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc661\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc662\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc663\n\ud835\udc66\u2032 = \ud835\udc661\n1/2\n9/10\n2/3\n\ud835\udc66\u2032 = \ud835\udc662\n1/10\n1/2\n2/11\n\ud835\udc66\u2032 = \ud835\udc663\n1/3\n9/11\n1/2\nThis preference model can be perfectly captured by a Bradley-Terry reward model in which the Elo\nscore of all actions would be (up to an additive constant): \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc661) = 0, \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc662) = log 9, and \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc663) = log 2.\nIf we optimize over the simplex \u0394(Y), then the policy selecting deterministically \ud835\udc662 is optimal both in\nterms of rewards and in terms of preference against any policy. However, if we consider a constrained\noptimization problem where we search for a policy in a subset S \u2282 \u0394(Y), then the optimum of\nthe expected reward and preference may be different. To illustrate, let S be the set of probability\ndistributions \ud835\udf0b \u2208 \u0394(Y) such that \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc661) = 2\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc662).\nIn that case, the policy \ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udc45\ndef= (2/3, 1/3, 0) is optimal in terms of maximizing expected rewards whereas\nthe policy \ud835\udf0b\u2217\nP\ndef= (0, 0, 1) is optimal in terms of maximizing preference against any alternative policy\nin S. In particular we have\n\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udc45 [\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc66)] = 0 \u00d7 2/3 + log(9) \u00d7 1/3 > log(2) = \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc66\u223c\ud835\udf0b\u2217\nP [\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc66)],\nwhereas policy \ud835\udf0b\u2217\nP is preferred over \ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udc45, since\nP(\ud835\udf0b\u2217\nP \u227b \ud835\udf0b\u2217\n\ud835\udc45) = P(\ud835\udc663 \u227b \ud835\udc661) \u00d7 2/3 + P(\ud835\udc663 \u227b \ud835\udc662) \u00d7 1/3 = 50/99 > 1/2.\nThus if one searches for a policy in S, then the optimum in terms of maximizing expected (Elo)\nreward and maximizing preference (probability of winning) are different.\nNote that the constraint \ud835\udf0b \u2208 S may be imposed in a soft way using regularization. Here for example\nwe could implement a 2-step decisions process where in a first step one would choose the probability\nmass assigned to \ud835\udc663, and in the second step, one would choose the remaining mass to allocate between\n\ud835\udc661 and \ud835\udc662. The second step may be constrained in a soft way by penalizing distributions (over \ud835\udc661 and\n\ud835\udc662) that are different from a reference distribution \ud835\udf07 = (2/3, 1/3) by using a KL-regularization with a\nlarge \ud835\udf0f coefficient. In this way the set of effective policies that would be considered would be close to\nS.\nThis example illustrates the fact that in constrained (or regularized) optimization settings, maximizing\nElo versus preference are different objectives, even in a setting where preferences can be perfectly\nexpressed in a Bradley-Terry model.\nB.

Specifically, we pro-\npose a new model, denoted as Diffusion Vision Transform-\ners (DiffiT), which consists of a hybrid hierarchical archi-\ntecture with a U-shaped encoder and decoder. We intro-\nduce a novel time-dependent self-attention module that al-\nlows attention layers to adapt their behavior at different\nstages of the denoising process in an efficient manner. We\nalso introduce latent DiffiT which consists of transformer\nmodel with the proposed self-attention layers, for high-\nresolution image generation. Our results show that Dif-\nfiT is surprisingly effective in generating high-fidelity im-\nages, and it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks\non a variety of class-conditional and unconditional synthe-\nsis tasks. In the latent space, DiffiT achieves a new SOTA\nFID score of 1.73 on ImageNet-256 dataset. Repository:\nhttps://github.com/NVlabs/DiffiT.\n1. Introduction\nDiffusion models [25, 64, 66] have revolutionized the do-\nmain of generative learning, with successful frameworks in\nthe front line such as DALL\u00b7E 3 [54], Imagen [26], Stable\ndiffusion [55, 56], and eDiff-I [6]. They have enabled gen-\nerating diverse complex scenes in high fidelity which were\nonce considered out of reach for prior models. Specifically,\nsynthesis in diffusion models is formulated as an iterative\nprocess in which random image-shaped Gaussian noise is\n1\narXiv:2312.02139v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023\ndenoised gradually towards realistic samples [25, 64, 66].\nThe core building block in this process is a denoising au-\ntoencoder network that takes a noisy image and predicts the\ndenoising direction, equivalent to the score function [30, 71].\nThis network, which is shared across different time steps of\nthe denoising process, is often a variant of U-Net [25, 57]\nthat consists of convolutional residual blocks as well as self-\nattention layers in several resolutions of the network. Al-\nthough the self-attention layers have shown to be impor-\ntant for capturing long-range spatial dependencies, yet there\nexists a lack of standard design patterns on how to incor-\nporate them. In fact, most denoising networks often lever-\nage self-attention layers only in their low-resolution feature\nmaps [14] to avoid their expensive computational complex-\nity. Recently, several works [6, 11, 42] have observed that\ndiffusion models exhibit a unique temporal dynamic dur-\ning generation. At the beginning of the denoising process,\nwhen the image contains strong Gaussian noise, the high-\nfrequency content of the image is completely perturbed, and\nthe denoising network primarily focuses on predicting the\nlow-frequency content. However, towards the end of denois-\ning, in which most of the image structure is generated, the\nnetwork tends to focus on predicting high-frequency details.\nThe time dependency of the denoising network is often im-\nplemented via simple temporal positional embeddings that\nare fed to different residual blocks via arithmetic operations\nsuch as spatial addition. In fact, the convolutional filters in\nthe denoising network are not time-dependent and the time\nembedding only applies a channel-wise shift and scaling.\nHence, such a simple mechanism may not be able to opti-\nmally capture the time dependency of the network during\nthe entire denoising process.\nIn this work, we aim to address the issue of lacking fine-\ngrained control over capturing the time-dependent compo-\nnent in self-attention modules for denoising diffusion models.\nWe introduce a novel Vision Transformer-based model for\nimage generation, called DiffiT (pronounced di-feet) which\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of FID score\nof image generation on CIFAR10 [43] and FFHQ-64 [32]\n(image space) as well as ImageNet-256 [13] and ImageNet-\n512 [13] (latent space) datasets. Specifically, DiffiT proposes\na new paradigm in which temporal dependency is only in-\ntegrated into the self-attention layers where the key, query,\nand value weights are adapted per time step. This allows the\ndenoising model to dynamically change its attention mech-\nanism for different denoising stages. In an effort to unify\nthe architecture design patterns, we also propose a hierarchi-\ncal transformer-based architecture for latent space synthesis\ntasks.\nThe following summarizes our contributions in this work:\n\u2022 We introduce a novel time-dependent self-attention mod-\nule that is specifically tailored to capture both short- and\nlong-range spatial dependencies.\nOur proposed time-\ndependent self-attention dynamically adapts its behavior\nover sampling time steps.\n\u2022 We propose a novel transformer-based architecture, de-\nnoted as DiffiT, which unifies the design patterns of de-\nnoising networks.\n\u2022 We show that DiffiT can achieve state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance on a variety of datasets for both image and latent\nspace generation tasks.\n2. Related Work\nTransformers in Generative Modeling\nTransformer-\nbased models have achieved competitive performance in\ndifferent generative learning models in the visual domain [10,\n15, 16, 27, 79, 80]. A number of transformer-based archi-\ntectures have emerged for GANs [45, 46, 75, 82]. Trans-\nGAN [31] proposed to use a pure transformer-based genera-\ntor and discriminator architecture for pixel-wise image gen-\neration. Gansformer [29] introduced a bipartite transformer\nthat encourages the similarity between latent and image fea-\ntures. Styleformer [51] uses Linformers [72] to scale the\nsynthesis to higher resolution images. Recently, a number\nof efforts [7, 21, 48, 52] have leveraged Transformer-based\narchitectures for diffusion models and achieved competitive\nperformance. In particular, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) [52]\nproposed a latent diffusion model in which the regular U-Net\nbackbone is replaced with a Transformer. In DiT, the condi-\ntioning on input noise is done by using Adaptive LayerNorm\n(AdaLN) [53] blocks. Using the DiT architecture, Masked\nDiffusion Transformer (MDT) [21] introduced a masked\nlatent modeling approach to effectively capture contextual\ninformation. In comparison to DiT, although MDT achieves\nfaster learning speed and better FID scores on ImageNet-256\ndataset [13], it has a more complex training pipeline. Unlike\nDiT and MDT, the proposed DiffiT does not use shift and\nscale, as in AdaLN formulation, for conditioning. Instread,\nDiffiT proposes a time-dependent self-attention (i.e. TMSA)\nto jointly learn the spatial and temporal dependencies. In ad-\ndition, DiffiT proposes both image and latent space models\nfor different image generation tasks with different resolu-\ntions with SOTA performance.\nDiffusion Image Generation\nDiffusion models [25, 64,\n66] have driven significant advances in various domains,\nsuch as text-to-image generation [6, 54, 59], natural language\nprocessing [47], text-to-speech synthesis [41], 3D point\ncloud generation [77, 78, 84], time series modeling [67],\nmolecular conformal generation [74], and machine learning\nsecurity [50]. These models synthesize samples via an itera-\ntive denoising process and thus are also known in the com-\nmunity as noise-conditioned score networks. Since its initial\nsuccess on small-scale datasets like CIFAR-10 [25], diffu-\nsion models have been gaining popularity compared to other\n2\nTokenizer\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f1\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nDownsample\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nDownsample\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nDownsample\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nUpsample\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nUpsample\nDiffiT \nResBlock\nUpsample\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f2\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f3\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f4\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f1\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f2\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f3\nHead\nDiffiT ResBlock\nSwish - GN\n+\nConv 3\u2a2f3\nTime \nEmbedding\nDiffiT\nTransformer\nGN\nConv 3\u2a2f3\nHead\nConv 3\u2a2f3\nTokenizer\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 3\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 128\n32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 256\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 256\n8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 256\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 3\nFigure 2 \u2013 Overview of the image-space DiffiT model.

Compared with vari-\national autoencoders [40], diffusion models divide the syn-\nthesis procedure into small parts that are easier to optimize,\nand have better coverage of the latent space [2, 63, 69]; com-\npared with generative adversarial networks [23], diffusion\nmodels have better training stability and are much easier to\ninvert [20, 65]. Diffusion models are also well-suited for im-\nage restoration, editing and re-synthesis tasks with minimal\nmodifications to the existing architecture [3, 4, 12, 20, 35\u2013\n37, 49, 58, 70], making it well-suited for various downstream\napplications.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Diffusion Model\nDiffusion models [25, 64, 66] are a family of generative\nmodels that synthesize samples via an iterative denoising\nprocess. Given a data distribution as q0(z0), a family of\nrandom variables zt for t \u2208 [0, T] are defined by injecting\nGaussian noise to z0, i.e., qt(zt) =\nR\nq(zt|z0)q0(z0)dz0,\nwhere q(zt|z0) = N(z0, \u03c32\nt I) is a Gaussian distribution.\nTypically, \u03c3t is chosen as a non-decreasing sequence such\nthat \u03c30 = 0 and \u03c3T being much larger than the data variance.\nThis is called the \u201cVariance-Exploding\u201d noising schedule\nin the literature [66]; for simplicity, we use these notations\nthroughout the paper, but we note that it can be equiva-\nlently converted to other commonly used schedules (such\nas \u201cVariance-Preserving\u201d [25]) by simply rescaling the data\nwith a scaling term, dependent on t [34, 65].\nThe distributions of these random variables are the\nmarginal distributions of forward diffusion processes\n(Markovian or not [65]) that gradually reduces the \u201csignal-\nto-noise\u201d ratio between the data and noise. As a generative\nmodel, diffusion models are trained to approximate the re-\nverse diffusion process, that is, to transform from the initial\nnoisy distribution (that is approximately Gaussian) to a dis-\ntribution that is close to the data one.\nTraining\nDespite being derived from different perspec-\ntives, diffusion models can generally be written as learning\nthe following denoising autoencoder objective [71]\nEq0(z0),t\u223cp(t),\u03f5\u223cN (0,I)[\u03bb(t)\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(z0 + \u03c3t\u03f5, t)\u22252\n2].\n(1)\nIntuitively, given a noisy sample from q(zt) (generated via\nzt := z0 + \u03c3t\u03f5), a neural network \u03f5\u03b8 is trained to predict\nthe amount of noise added (i.e., \u03f5). Equivalently, the neural\nnetwork can also be trained to predict z0 instead [25, 60].\nThe above objective is also known as denoising score match-\ning [71], where the goal is to try to fit the data score (i.e.,\n\u2207zt log q(zt)) with a neural network, also known as the\nscore network s\u03b8(zt, t). The score network can be related to\n\u03f5\u03b8 via the relationship s\u03b8(zt, t) := \u2212\u03f5\u03b8(zt, t)/\u03c3t.\nSampling\nSamples from the diffusion model can be simu-\nlated by the following family of stochastic differential equa-\ntions that solve from t = T to t = 0 [17, 24, 34, 81]:\ndz = \u2212( \u02d9\u03c3t + \u03b2t)\u03c3ts\u03b8(z, t)dt +\np\n2\u03b2t\u03c3td\u03c9t,\n(2)\n3\nLN\nTime\nembedding \nLinear\nLinear\n+\n+\nMulti-head\nSelf-Attention\nLinear\nDiffiT Transformer Block\nQ, K, V\nLinear\nLN\nGELU\n+\nTMSA\nMLP\nFigure 3 \u2013 The DiffiT Transformer block applies linear projection\nto spatial and time-embedding tokens before combining them\ntogether to form query, key, and value vectors for each token.\nThese vectors are then used to compute multi-head self-attention\nactivations, followed by two linear layers.\nwhere \u03c9t is the reverse standard Wiener process, and \u03b2t is a\nfunction that describes the amount of stochastic noise during\nthe sampling process. If \u03b2t = 0 for all t, then the process\nbecomes a probabilistic ordinary differential equation [1]\n(ODE), and can be solved by ODE integrators such as de-\nnoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM [65]). Otherwise,\nsolvers for stochastic differential equations (SDE) can be\nused, including the one for the original denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPM [25]). Typically, ODE solvers\ncan converge to high-quality samples in fewer steps and SDE\nsolvers are more robust to inaccurate score models [34].\n3.2. DiffiT Model\nTime-dependent Self-Attention\nAt every layer, our trans-\nformer block receives {xs}, a set of tokens arranged spatially\non a 2D grid in its input. It also receives xt, a time token\nrepresenting the time step. Similar to Ho et al. [25], we\nobtain the time token by feeding positional time embeddings\nto a small MLP with swish activation [19]. This time token\nis passed to all layers in our denoising network. We intro-\nduce our time-dependent multi-head self-attention, which\ncaptures both long-range spatial and temporal dependen-\ncies by projecting feature and time token embeddings in a\nshared space. Specifically, time-dependent queries q, keys k\nand values v in the shared space are computed by a linear\nprojection of spatial and time embeddings xs and xt via\nqs = xsWqs + xtWqt,\n(3)\nks = xsWks + xtWkt,\n(4)\nvs = xsWvs + xtWvt,\n(5)\nwhere Wqs, Wqt, Wks, Wkt, Wvs, Wvt denote spatial\nand temporal linear projection weights for their correspond-\ning queries, keys, and values respectively.\nWe note that the operations listed in Eq. 3 to 5 are equiva-\nlent to a linear projection of each spatial token, concatenated\nwith the time token. As a result, key, query, and value are all\nlinear functions of both time and spatial tokens and they can\nadaptively modify the behavior of attention for different time\nsteps. We define Q := {qs}, K := {ks}, and V := {vs}\nwhich are stacked form of query, key, and values in rows of\na matrix. The self-attention is then computed as follows\nAttention(Q, K, V) = Softmax\n\u0012QK\u22a4\n\u221a\nd\n+ B\n\u0013\nV. (6)\nIn which, d is a scaling factor for keys K, and B corresponds\nto a relative position bias [62]. For computing the attention,\nthe relative position bias allows for the encoding of infor-\nmation across each attention head. Note that although the\nrelative position bias is implicitly affected by the input time\nembedding, directly integrating it with this component may\nresult in sub-optimal performance as it needs to capture both\nspatial and temporal information. Please see Sec. 5.4 for\nmore analysis.\nDiffiT Block\nThe DiffiT transformer block (see Fig. 3) is\na core building block of the proposed architecture and is\ndefined as\n\u02c6xs = TMSA (LN (xs), xt) + xs,\n(7)\nxs = MLP (LN (\u02c6xs)) + \u02c6xs,\n(8)\nwhere TMSA denotes time-dependent multi-head self-\nattention, as described in the above, xt is the time-\nembedding token, xs is a spatial token, and LN and MLP\ndenote Layer Norm [5] and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nrespectively.\n3.2.1\nImage Space\nDiffiT Architecture\nDiffiT uses a symmetrical U-Shaped\nencoder-decoder architecture in which the contracting and\nexpanding paths are connected to each other via skip con-\nnections at every resolution. Specifically, each resolution\nof the encoder or decoder paths consists of L consecutive\nDiffiT blocks, containing our proposed time-dependent self-\nattention modules. In the beginning of each path, for both\nthe encoder and decoder, a convolutional layer is employed\nto match the number of feature maps. In addition, a convo-\nlutional upsampling or downsampling layer is also used for\ntransitioning between each resolution. We speculate that the\nuse of these convolutional layers embeds inductive image\nbias that can further improve the performance. In the remain-\nder of this section, we discuss the DiffiT Transformer block\nand our proposed time-dependent self-attention mechanism.\nWe use our proposed Transformer block as the residual cells\nwhen constructing the U-shaped denoising architecture.\n4\n\ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a \u00d7 3\nEncoder\nPatch Embed\nLayer Norm\n+\nTime \nEmbedding\nTMSA\nLayer Norm\nMLP\n+\nLatent DiffiT \nTransformer Block\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc41\nDecoder\nUnpatchify\n+\n\ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a \u00d7 3\n\u210e \u00d7 \ud835\udc64 \u00d7 \ud835\udc36\nLabel \nEmbedding\nFigure 4 \u2013 Overview of the latent DiffiT framework.\nDiffiT ResBlock\nWe define our final residual cell by com-\nbining our proposed DiffiT Transformer block with an addi-\ntional convolutional layer in the form:\n\u02c6xs = Conv3\u00d73 (Swish (GN (xs))) ,\n(9)\nxs = DiffiT-Block (\u02c6xs, xt) + xs,\n(10)\nwhere GN denotes the group normalization operation [73]\nand DiffiT-Transformer is defined in Eq. 7 and Eq. 8 (shown\nin Fig. 3). Our residual cell for image space diffusion models\nis a hybrid cell combining both a convolutional layer and our\nTransformer block.\n3.2.2\nLatent Space\nRecently, latent diffusion models have been shown effective\nin generating high-quality large-resolution images [56, 69].\nIn Fig. 4, we show the architecture of latent DiffiT model.\nWe first encode the images using a pre-trained variational\nauto-encoder network [56]. The feature maps are then con-\nverted into non-overlapping patches and projected into a new\nembedding space. Similar to the DiT model [52], we use\na vision transformer, without upsampling or downsampling\nlayers, as the denoising network in the latent space. In addi-\ntion, we also utilize a three-channel classifier-free guidance\nto improve the quality of generated samples. The final layer\nof the architecture is a simple linear layer to decode the\noutput.\n4. Results\n4.1. Image Space\nWe have trained the proposed DiffiT model on CIFAR-10,\nFFHQ-64 datasets respectively. In Table. 1, we compare the\nperformance of our model against a variety of different gen-\nerative models including other score-based diffusion models\nas well as GANs, and VAEs. DiffiT achieves a state-of-the-\nart image generation FID score of 1.95 on the CIFAR-10\ndataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such\nas EDM [34] and LSGM [69].

Latent Space\nWe have also trained the latent DiffiT model on ImageNet-\n512 and ImageNet-256 dataset respectively. In Table. 2, we\npresent a comparison against other approaches using various\nimage quality metrics. For this comparison, we select the\nbest performance metrics from each model which may in-\nclude techniques such classifier-free guidance. In ImageNet-\n256 dataset, the latent DiffiT model outperforms competing\napproaches, such as MDT-G [21], DiT-XL/2-G [52] and\nStyleGAN-XL [61], in terms of FID score and sets a new\nSOTA FID score of 1.73. In terms of other metrics such\nas IS and sFID, the latent DiffiT model shows a competi-\ntive performance, hence indicating the effectiveness of the\nproposed time-dependant self-attention. In ImageNet-512\ndataset, the latent DiffiT model significantly outperforms\nDiT-XL/2-G in terms of both FID and Inception Score (IS).\nAlthough StyleGAN-XL [61] shows better performance in\nterms of FID and IS, GAN-based models are known to suffer\nfrom issues such as low diversity that are not captured by\nthe FID score. These issues are reflected in sub-optimal\nperformance of StyleGAN-XL in terms of both Precision\nand Recall. In addition, in Fig. 6, we show a visualization of\nuncurated images that are generated on ImageNet-256 and\nImageNet-512 dataset. We observe that latent DiffiT model\nis capable of generating diverse high quality images across\ndifferent classes.\n5. Ablation\nIn this section, we provide additional ablation studies to\nprovide insights into DiffiT.

Time and Feature Token Dimensions\nWe conduct experiments to study the effect of the size of time\nand feature token dimensions on the overall performance.\nAs shown below, we observe degradation of performance\nwhen the token dimension is increased from 256 to 512. Fur-\nthermore, decreasing the time embedding dimension from\n512 to 256 impacts the performance negatively.\n5.2. Effect of Architecture Design\nAs presented in Table 4, we study the effect of various com-\nponents of both encoder and decoder in the architecture\ndesign on the image generation performance in terms of\nFID score on CIFAR-10. For these experiments, the pro-\njected temporal component is adaptively scaled and simply\nadded to the spatial component in each stage.

For the decoder, we use\nthe Multi-Level Feature Aggregation variant of SETR [83]\n(SETR-MLA) to generate images in the input resolution.\nOur experiments show this architecture is sub-optimal as it\nyields a final FID score of 5.34. We hypothesize this could\nbe due to the isotropic architecture of ViT which does not\nallow learning representations at multiple scales.\nWe then extend the encoder ViT into 4 different multi-\nresolution stages with a convolutional layer in between each\nstage for downsampling (config B). We denote this setup as\nMulti-Resolution and observe that these changes and learn-\ning multi-scale feature representations in the encoder sub-\n6\nFigure 6 \u2013 Visualization of uncurated generated images on ImageNet-256 and ImageNet-512 datasets by latent DiffiT model.\nConfig\nEncoder\nDecoder\nFID Score\nA\nViT [18]\nSETR-MLA [83]\n5.34\nB\n+ Multi-Resolution\nSETR-MLA [83]\n4.64\nC\nMulti-Resolution\n+ Multi-Resolution\n3.71\nD\n+ DiffiT Encoder\nMulti-Resolution\n2.27\nE\n+ DiffiT Encoder\n+ DiffiT Decoder\n1.95\nTable 4 \u2013 Ablation study on the effectiveness of encoder and\ndecoder architecture.\nModel\nTMSA FID Score\nDDPM++(VE) [66]\nNo\n3.77\nDDPM++(VE) [66]\nYes\n3.49\nDDPM++(VP) [66]\nNo\n3.01\nDDPM++(VP) [66]\nYes\n2.76\nTable 5 \u2013 Impact of TMSA as a standalone module in other\ndenoising networks.\nstantially improve the FID score to 4.64.\nIn addition, instead of SETR-MLA [83] decoder, we con-\nstruct a symmetric U-like architecture by using the same\nMulti-Resolution setup except for using convolutional layer\nbetween stage for upsampling (config C). These changes\nfurther improve the FID score to 3.71. Furthermore, we first\nadd the DiffiT Transformer blocks and construct a DiffiT\nEncoder and observe that FID scores substantially improve\nto 2.27 (config D). As a result, this validates the effectiveness\nof the proposed TMSA in which the self-attention models\nboth spatial and temporal dependencies. Using the DiffiT\ndecoder further improves the FID score to 1.95 (config E),\nhence demonstrating the importance of DiffiT Transformer\nblocks for decoding.\n5.3. Time-Dependent Self-Attention\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed TMSA lay-\ners in a generic denoising network. Specifically, using the\nDDPM++ [66] model, we replace the original self-attention\nlayers with TMSA layers for both VE and VP settings for\nimage generation on the CIFAR10 dataset. Note that we\ndid not change the original hyper-parameters for this study.\nAs shown in Table 5 employing TMSA decreases the FID\nscores by 0.28 and 0.25 for VE and VP settings respectively.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\n7\nConfig\nComponent\nFID Score\nF\nRelative Position Bias\n3.97\nG\nMLP\n3.81\nH\nTMSA\n1.95\nTable 6 \u2013 The impact of TMSA design choices on FID score.\nDiffiT- w TMSA\nDiffiT- wo TMSA\nFigure 7 \u2013 Side-by-side qualitative comparison of attention maps\nduring the denoising process for models with and without TMSA.\nThe denoising process starts at the top row.\nTMSA to dynamically adapt to different sampling steps and\ncapture temporal information.\n5.4. Impact of Self-Attention Components\nIn Table 6, we study different design choices for introducing\ntime-dependency in self-attention layers. In the first base-\nline, we remove the temporal component from our proposed\nTMSA and we only add the temporal tokens to relative po-\nsitional bias (config F). We observe a significant increase\nin the FID score to 3.97 from 1.95. In the second baseline,\ninstead of using relative positional bias, we add temporal\ntokens to the MLP layer of DiffiT Transformer block (config\nG). We observe that the FID score slightly improves to 3.81,\nbut it is still sub-optimal compared to our proposed TMSA\n(config H). Hence, this experiment validates the effectiveness\nof our proposed TMSA that integrates time tokens directly\nwith spatial tokens when forming queries, keys, and values\nin self-attention layers.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nGuidance\nScale\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nFID\nScore\nImageNet-256\nImageNet-512\nFigure 8 \u2013 Effect of classifier-free guidance scale on FID score\nfor ImageNet-256 and ImageNet-512 experiments with the latent\nDiffiT model.\n5.5. Visualization of Self-Attention Maps\nOne of our key motivations in proposing TMSA is to allow\nthe self-attention module to adapt its behavior dynamically\nfor different stages of the denoising process. In Fig. 7, we\ndemonstrate a qualitative comparison of self-attention maps.\nAlthough the attention maps without TMSA change in ac-\ncordance to noise information, they lack fine-grained object\ndetails that are perfectly captured by TMSA.\n5.6. Effect of Classifier-Free Guidance\nWe investigate the effect of classifier-free guidance scale on\nthe quality of generated samples in terms of FID score. For\nImageNet-256 experiment, we used the improved classifier-\nfree guidance [21] which uses a power-cosine schedule to\nincrease the diversity of generated images in early sampling\nstages. This scheme was not used for ImageNet-512 experi-\nment, since it did not result in any significant improvements.\nAs shown in Fig. 5.6, the guidance scales of 4.6 and 1.49\ncorrespond to best FID scores of 1.73 and 2.67 for ImageNet-\n256 and ImageNet-512 experiments, respectively. Increasing\nthe guidance scale beyond these values result in degradation\nof FID score.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this work, we presented Diffusion Vision Transformers\n(DiffiT) which is a novel transformer-based model for\ndiffusion-based image generation.\nThe proposed DiffiT\nmodel unifies the design pattern of denoising diffusion archi-\ntectures. We proposed a novel time-dependent self-attention\nlayer that jointly learns both spatial and temporal dependen-\ncies. Our proposed self-attention allows for capturing short\nand long-range information in different time steps. Analysis\nof time-dependent self-attention maps reveals strong\nlocalization and dynamic temporal behavior over sampling\nsteps. We introduced the latent DiffiT for high-resolution\nimage generation.\nWe have evaluated the effectiveness\nof DiffiT using both image and latent space experiments.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Brian DO Anderson.

Ablation\nG.1. Time Token in TMSA\nWe investigate if treating time embedding as a seperate token in TMSA maybe a beneficial choice. Specifically, we apply\nself-attention to spatial and time tokens separately to understand the impact of decoupling them. As shown in Table S.1, we\nobserve the degradation of performance for CIFAR10, FFHQ64 datasets, in terms of FID score. Hence, the decoupling of\nspatial and temporal information in TMSA leads to sub-optimal performance.\nModel TMSA Design CIFAR10 FFHQ64\nDiffiT\nSeparate\n2.28\n2.59\nDiffiT\nMixed\n1.95\n2.22\nTable S.1 \u2013 Ablation study for the impact of decoupling time and spatial tokens in TMSA on FID score.

Sensitivity to Time Embedding\nWe study the sensitivity of DiffiT model to different time embeddings representations such as Fourier and positional time\nembeddings.

Comparison to DiT and LDM\nOn contrary to LDM [56] and DiT [52], the latent DiffiT does not rely on shift and scale, as in AdaLN [52], or concatenation\nto incorporate time embedding into the denoising networks. However, DiffiT uses a time-dependent self-attention (i.e. TMSA)\nto jointly learn the spatial and temporal dependencies. In addition, DiffiT proposes both image and latent space models for\ndifferent image generation tasks with different resolutions with SOTA performance. Specifically, as shown in Table S.3, DiffiT\nsignificantly outperforms LDM [56] and DiT [52] by 31.26% and 51.94% in terms of FID score on ImageNet-256 [13] dataset.\nIn addition, DiffiT outperforms DiT [52] by 13.85% on ImageNet-512 [13] dataset. Hence, these benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of the proposes architecture and TMSA design in DiffiT model as opposed to previous SOTA for both CNN and\nTransformer-based diffusion models.\nModel\nClass\nImageNet-256\nImageNet-512\nFID \u2193\nIS \u2191\nPrecision \u2191\nRecall \u2191\nFID \u2193\nIS \u2191\nPrecision \u2191\nRecall \u2191\nLDM-4-G [56]\nDiffusion\n3.60\n247.67\n0.87\n0.48\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDiT-XL/2-G [52]\nDiffusion\n2.27\n278.24\n0.83\n0.57\n3.04\n240.82\n0.84\n0.54\nDiffiT\nDiffusion\n1.73\n276.49\n0.80\n0.62\n2.67\n252.12\n0.83\n0.55\nTable S.3 \u2013 Comparison of image generation performance against state-of-the-art models on ImageNet-256 and ImageNet-512 dataset.\nThe latent DiffiT model achieves SOTA performance in terms of FID score on ImageNet-256 dataset.\n12\nTable S.4 \u2013 Detailed description of components in DiffiT encoder for models that are trained at 64 \u00d7 64 resolution.\nComponent Description\nOutput size\nInput\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 3\nTokenizer\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 128\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L1\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 128\nDownsampler\n32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 128\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L2\n32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 256\nDownsampler\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 128\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L3\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 256\nDownsampler\n8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 256\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L4\n8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 256\nTable S.5 \u2013 Detailed description of components in DiffiT decoder for models that are trained at 64 \u00d7 64 resolution.\nComponent Description\nOutput size\nInput\n8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 256\nUpsampler\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 256\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L3\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 256\nUpsampler\n32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 256\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L2\n32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 256\nUpsampler\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 256\nDiffiT ResBlock \u00d7L1\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 128\nHead\n64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 3\nH. Architecture\nH.1. Image Space\nWe provide the details of blocks and their corresponding output sizes for both the encoder and decoder of the DiffiT model in\nTable S.4 and Table S.5, respectively. The presented architecture details denote models that are trained with 64\u00d764 resolution.\nWithout loss of generality, the architecture can be extended for 32\u00d732 resolution. For FFHQ-64 [32] dataset, the values of\nL1, L2, L3 and L4 are 4, 4, 4, and 4 respectively. For CIFAR-10 [43] dataset, the architecture spans across three different\nresolution levels (i.e. 32, 16, 8), and the values of L1, L2, L3 are 4, 4, 4 respectively. Please refer to the paper for more\ninformation regarding the architecture details.\nH.2. Latent Space\nIn Fig S.1, we illustrate the architecture of the latent DiffiT model. Our model is comparable to DiT-XL/2-G variant which\n032 uses a patch size of 2. Specifically, we use a depth of 30 layers with hidden size dimension of 1152, number of heads\ndimension of 16 and MLP ratio of 4. In addition, for the classifier-free guidance implementation, we only apply the guidance\nto the first three input channels with a scale of (1 + x) where x is the input latent.\nI. Implementation Details\nI.1. Image Space\nWe strictly followed the training configurations and data augmentation strategies of the EDM [34] model for the experiments\non CIFAR10 [43], and FFHQ-64 [32] datasets, all in an unconditional setting. All the experiments were trained for 200000\niterations with Adam optimizer [39] and used PyTorch framework and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We used batch sizes of 512\nand 256, learning rates of 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and training images of sizes 32 \u00d7 32 and 64 \u00d7 64 on experiments for\nCIFAR10 [43] and FFHQ-64 [32] datasets, respectively.\nWe use the deterministic sampler of EDM [34] model with 18, 40 and 40 steps for CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-64 datasets,\nrespectively. For FFHQ-64 dataset, our DiffiT network spans across 4 different stages with 1, 2, 2, 2 blocks at each stage.\n13\n\ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a \u00d7 3\nEncoder\nPatch Embed\nLayer Norm\n+\nTime \nEmbedding\nTMSA\nLayer Norm\nMLP\n+\nLatent DiffiT \nTransformer Block\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc41\nDecoder\nUnpatchify\n+\n\ud835\udc3b \u00d7 \ud835\udc4a \u00d7 3\n\u210e \u00d7 \ud835\udc64 \u00d7 \ud835\udc36\nLabel \nEmbedding\nFigure S.1 \u2013 Overview of the latent DiffiT framework.\nWe also use window-based attention with local window size of 8 at each stage. For CIFAR-10 dataset, the DiffiT network\nhas 3 stages with 2 blocks at each stage. Similarly, we compute attentions on local windows with size 4 at each stage. Note\nthat for all networks, the resolution is decreased by a factor of 2 in between stages. However, except for when transitioning\nfrom the first to second stage, we keep the number of channels constant in the rest of the stages to maintain both the number\nof parameters and latency in our network. Furthermore, we employ traditional convolutional-based downsampling and\nupsampling layers for transitioning into lower or higher resolutions. We achieved similar image generation performance by\nusing bilinear interpolation for feature resizing instead of convolution. For fair comparison, in all of our experiments, we used\nthe FID score which is computed on 50K samples and using the training set as the reference set.\nI.2. Latent Space\nWe employ learning rates of 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 and batch sizes of 256 and 512 for ImageNet-256 and ImageNet-512\nexperiments, respectively. We also use the exponential moving average (EMA) of weights using a decay of 0.9999 for both\nexperiments. We also use the same diffusion hyper-parameters as in the ADM [14] model. For a fair comparison, we use the\nDDPM [25] sampler with 250 steps and report FID-50K for both ImageNet-256 and ImageNet-512 experiments.\nJ. Qualitative Results\nWe illustrate visualization of generated images for CIFAR-10 [43] and FFHQ-64 [32] datasets in Figures S.2 and S.3,\nrespectively. In addition, in Figures S.4, S.5, S.6 and S.7, we visualize the the generated images by the latent DiffiT model\nfor ImageNet-512 [13] dataset. Similarly, the generated images for ImageNet-256 [13] are shown in Figures S.8, S.9 and S.10.\nWe observe that the proposed DiffiT model is capable of capturing fine-grained details and produce high fidelity images across\nthese datasets.\n14\nFigure S.2 \u2013 Visualization of uncurated generated images for CIFAR-10 [43] dataset.

The proposed framework is fully differentiable\nand experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our\n\u2020 Work done during an internship at Tsinghua University.\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art methods while achiev-\ning an exceeding rendering speed.\n1. Introduction\nNovel view synthesis (NVS) is a critical task that aims to\nproduce photo-realistic images at novel viewpoints from\nsource images captured by multi-view camera systems. Hu-\nman NVS, as its subfields, could contribute to 3D/4D im-\nmersive scene capture of sports broadcasting, stage per-\nformance and holographic communication, which demands\nreal-time efficiency and 3D consistent appearances. Pre-\nvious attempts [5, 27] synthesize novel views through a\nweighted blending mechanism [48], but they typically rely\non dense input views or precise proxy geometry. Under\nsparse-view camera settings, it remains a formidable chal-\nlenge to render high-fidelity images for NVS.\n1\narXiv:2312.02155v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023\nRecently, implicit representations [29, 34, 43], espe-\ncially Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [24], have demon-\nstrated remarkable success in numerous NVS tasks. NeRF\nutilizes MLPs to represent the radiance field of the scene\nwhich jointly predicts the density and color of each sam-\npling point. To render a specific pixel, the differentiable\nvolume rendering technique is then implemented by aggre-\ngating a series of queried points along the ray direction.\nThe following efforts [29, 38] in human free-view rendering\nimmensely ease the burden of viewpoint quantities while\nmaintaining high qualities. Despite the progress of accel-\nerating techniques [6, 25], NVS methods with implicit rep-\nresentations are time-consuming in general for their dense\npoints querying in scene space.\nOn the other hand, explicit representations [6, 25, 53],\nparticularly point clouds [13, 14, 49], have drawn sus-\ntainably attention due to their high-speed, and even real-\ntime, rendering performance. Once integrated with neu-\nral networks, point-based graphics [1, 31] realize a promis-\ning explicit representation with comparable realism and ex-\ntremely superior efficiency in human NVS task [1, 31],\ncompared with NeRF. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splat-\nting (3D-GS) [10] introduces a new representation that the\npoint clouds are formulated as 3D Gaussians with a se-\nries of learnable properties including 3D position, color,\nopacity and anisotropic covariance.\nBy introducing \u03b1-\nblending [11], 3D-GS provides not only a more reasonable\nand accurate mechanism for back-propagating the gradients\nbut also a real-time rendering efficiency for complex scenes.\nAlbeit realizing a real-time inference, Gaussian Splatting\nrelies on per-subject [10] or per-frame [20] parameter opti-\nmizations for several minutes. It is therefore impractical in\ninteractive scenarios as it necessitates the re-optimization of\nGaussian parameters once the scene or character changes.\nIn this paper, we target a generalizable 3D Gaussian\nSplatting method to directly regress Gaussian parameters in\na feed-forward manner instead of per-subject optimization.\nInspired by the success of learning-based human recon-\nstruction, PIFu-like methods [34, 35], we aim to learn the\nregression of human Gaussian representations from mas-\nsive 3D human scan models with diverse human topologies,\nclothing styles and pose-dependent deformations. Deploy-\ning these learned human priors, our method enables instan-\ntaneous human appearance rendering using a generalizable\nGaussian representation.\nSpecifically, we introduce 2D Gaussian parameter (po-\nsition, color, scaling, rotation, opacity) maps which are de-\nfined on source view image planes, instead of unstructured\npoint clouds. These Gaussian parameter maps allow us to\nrepresent a character with pixel-wise parameters, i.e. each\nforeground pixel corresponding to a specific Gaussian point.\nAdditionally, it enables the application of efficient 2D con-\nvolution networks rather than expensive 3D operators. To\nlift 2D parameter maps to 3D Gaussian points, depth maps\nare estimated for both source views via two-view stereo [17]\nas a learnable unprojection operation.\nSuch unprojected\nGaussian points from both source views constitute the rep-\nresentation of character and the novel view image can be\nrendered with splatting technique [10].\nHowever, the aforementioned depth estimation is not\ntrivial to tackle with existing cascaded cost volume meth-\nods [15, 39] due to the severe self-occlusions in human char-\nacters. Therefore, we propose to learn an iterative stereo-\nmatching [17] based depth estimation along with our Gaus-\nsian parameter regression, and jointly train the two mod-\nules on large data. Optimal depth estimation contributes\nto enhanced precision in determining the 3D Gaussian posi-\ntion, while concurrently minimizing rendering loss of Gaus-\nsian module rectifies the potential artifacts arising from the\ndepth estimation.\nSuch a joint training strategy benefits\neach component and improves the overall stability of the\ntraining process.\nIn practice, we are able to synthesize 2K-resolution\nnovel views exceeding 25 FPS on a single modern graphics\ncard. Leveraging the rapid rendering capabilities and broad\ngeneralizability inherent in our proposed method, an unseen\ncharacter can be instantly rendered without necessitating\nany fine-tuning or optimization, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In\nsummary, our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce a generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting\nmethodology that employs pixel-wise Gaussian parame-\nter maps defined on 2D source image planes to formulate\n3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner.\n\u2022 We propose a fully differentiable framework composed\nof an iterative depth estimation module and a Gaussian\nparameter regression module. The intermediate predicted\ndepth map bridges the two components and makes them\npromote mutually.\n\u2022 We develop a real-time NVS system that achieves 2K-\nresolution rendering by directly regressing Gaussian pa-\nrameter maps.\n2. Related Work\nNeural Implicit Human Representation.\nNeural im-\nplicit function has recently aroused a surge of interest to rep-\nresent complicated scenes, in form of occupancy fields [8,\n22, 34, 35], neural radiance fields [7, 24, 29, 47, 57] and\nneural signed distance functions [28, 38, 43, 45].\nIm-\nplicit representation shows the advantage in memory effi-\nciency and topological flexibility for human reconstruction\ntask [8, 50, 59], especially in a pixel-aligned feature query\nmanner [34, 35]. However, each queried point is processed\nthrough the full network, which dramatically increases\ncomputational complexity. More recently, numerous meth-\nods have extended Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [24] to\nstatic human modeling [4, 37] and dynamic human mod-\n2\neling from sparse multi-view cameras [29, 38, 57] or a\nmonocular camera [7, 9, 47].\nHowever, these methods\ntypically require a per-subject optimization process and it\nis non-trivial to generalize these methods to unseen sub-\njects. Previous attempts, e.g., PixelNeRF [54], IBRNet [44],\nMVSNeRF [3] and ENeRF [15] resort to image-based fea-\ntures as potent prior cues for feed-forward scene modeling.\nThe large variation in pose and clothing makes generaliz-\nable NeRF for human rendering a more challenging task,\nthus recent work simplifies the problem by leveraging hu-\nman priors.\nFor example, NHP [12] and GM-NeRF [4]\nemploy parametric human body model (SMPL [18]), Key-\npointNeRF uses 3D skeleton keypoints to encode spatial\ninformation, but these additional processes increase com-\nputational cost and an inaccurate prior estimation would\nmislead the final rendering result. On the other hand, de-\nspite the great progress in accelerating the scene-specific\nNeRF [6, 25, 53], efficient generalizable NeRF for interac-\ntive scenarios still remains to be further elucidated.\nDeep Image-based Rendering.\nImage-based rendering,\nor IBR in short, synthesizes novel views from a set of multi-\nview images with a weighted blending mechanism, which is\ntypically computed from a geometry proxy. [32, 33] deploy\nmulti-view stereo from dense input views to produce mesh\nsurfaces as a proxy for image warping. DNR [41] directly\nproduces learnable features on the surface of mesh proxies\nfor neural rendering. Obtaining these proxies is not straight-\nforward since high-quality multi-view stereo and surface re-\nconstruction requires dense input views. LookinGood [21]\nimplements RGBD fusion to attain real-time human render-\ning. Point clouds from SfM [23, 30] or depth sensors [26]\ncan also be engaged as geometry proxies. These methods\nhighly depend on the performance of 3D reconstruction al-\ngorithms or the quality of depth sensors. FWD [2] designs\na network to refine depth estimations, then explicitly warps\npixels from source views to novel views with the refined\ndepth map. Several warped images are further fused to gen-\nerate a final RGB image using a lightweight transformer.\nFloRen [36] utilizes a coarse human mesh reconstructed by\nPIFu [34] to render initialized depth maps for novel views.\nArguably most related to ours is FloRen [36], as it also\nrealizes 360\u25e6 free view human performance rendering in\nreal-time. However, the appearance flow in FloRen merely\nworks in 2D domains, where the rich geometry cues and\nmulti-view geometric constraints only serve as 2D supervi-\nsion. The difference is that our approach lifts 2D depth into\n3D point clouds and directly utilizes the 3D point represen-\ntation to render novel views in a fully differentiable manner.\nPoint-based Graphics.\nPoint-based representation has\nshown great efficiency and simplicity for various 3D tasks\n[16, 31, 58]. Previous attempts integrate point cloud rep-\nresentation with 2D neural rendering [1, 31] or NeRF-\nlike volume rendering [51], but such a hybrid architecture\ndoes not exploit rendering capability of point cloud and\ntakes a long time to optimize each scene.\nThen differ-\nentiable point-based [49] and sphere-based [13] rendering\nhave been developed, which demonstrates promising ren-\ndering results, especially attaching them to a conventional\nnetwork pipeline [26].\nIn addition, isotropic points can\nbe substituted by a more reasonable Gaussian point mod-\neling [10, 20] to realize a rapid differentiable rendering\nwith a splatting technique. However, a per-scene optimiza-\ntion strategy prevents it from real-world applications. In\nthis paper, we go further to generalize 3D Gaussian Splat-\nting across different subjects and maintain its fast and high-\nquality rendering properties.\n3. Preliminary\nSince the proposed GPS-Gaussian harnesses the power of\n3D-GS [10], we give a brief introduction in this section.\n3D-GS models a static 3D scene explicitly with point\nprimitives, each of which is parameterized as a scaled Gaus-\nsian with 3D covariance matrix \u03a3 and mean \u00b5\nG(X) = e\u2212 1\n2 (X\u2212\u00b5)T \u03a3\u22121(X\u2212\u00b5)\n(1)\nIn order to be effectively optimized by gradient descent, the\ncovariance matrix \u03a3 can be decomposed into a scaling ma-\ntrix S and a rotation matrix R as\n\u03a3 = RSST RT\n(2)\nThe projection of Gaussians from 3D space to a 2D image\nplane is implemented by a view transformation W and the\nJacobian of the affine approximation of the projective trans-\nformation J. The covariance matrix \u03a3\u2032 in 2D space can be\ncomputed as\n\u03a3\u2032 = JW\u03a3WT JT\n(3)\nfollowed by a point-based alpha-blend rendering which\nbears similarities to that used in NeRF [24], formulated as\nCcolor =\nX\ni\u2208N\nci\u03b1i\ni\u22121\nY\nj=1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1i)\n(4)\nwhere ci is the color of each point, and density \u03b1i is rea-\nsoned by the multiplication of a 2D Gaussian with covari-\nance \u03a3\u2032 and a learned per-point opacity [52]. The color is\ndefined by spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients in [10].\nTo summarize, the vanilla 3D Gaussians methodology\ncharacterizes each Gaussian point by the following at-\ntributes: (1) a 3D position of each point X \u2208 R3, (2) a\ncolor defined by SH c \u2208 Rk (where k is the freedom of SH\nbasis), (3) a rotation parameterized by a quaternion r \u2208 R4,\n(4) a scaling factor s \u2208 R3\n+, and (5) an opacity \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\n3\nEncoder\n\u2130\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\nSelected Views\n\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59, \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\nFeature \nMaps {\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\nS, \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5fS}\nDepth Estimator\nDepth\nMaps {\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03l, \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03r}\nCost\nVolume\n+\nDecoder\n\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\nRotation\nMap \u2133\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\nScaling \nMap \u2133\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\nOpacity\nMap \u2133\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\nEncoder\n\u2130\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\nDepth\nMap \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\nFeature \nMaps \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60=1\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\n\u03a0\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\n\u22121\nView Selection\n \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3 , \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1c , \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2b , \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c , \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc \n\ud835\udca2\ud835\udca2 =\nGaussian Points: \n4.2 Pixel-wise Gaussian\nParameters Prediction\n4.1 View Selection and Depth Estimation\n4.3 Joint Training with \nDifferentiable Rendering\n\ud835\udca2\ud835\udca21:\n\ud835\udca2\ud835\udca22:\nColor\nMap \u2133\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\nPosition\nMap \u2133\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\nFigure 2. Overview of GPS-Gaussian. Given RGB images of a human-centered scene with sparse camera views and a target novel\nviewpoint, we select the adjacent two views on which to formulate our Gaussian representation. We extract the image features followed\nby conducting an iterative depth estimation. For each source view, the depth map and the RGB image serve as a 3D position map and a\ncolor map, respectively, to formulate the Gaussian representation while the other parameters of 3D Gaussians are predicted in a pixel-wise\nmanner. The Gaussian parameter maps defined on 2D image planes of both views are further unprojected to 3D space and aggregated for\nnovel view rendering. The fully differentiable framework enables all networks a joint training mechanism.\n4. Method\nThe overview of our method is illustrated in Fig. 2. Given\nthe RGB images of a human-centered scene with sparse\ncamera views, our method aims to generate high-quality\nfree-viewpoint renderings of the performer in real-time.\nOnce given a target novel viewpoint, we select the two\nneighboring views and extract the image features using a\nshared image encoder. Following this, a two-view depth es-\ntimator takes the extracted features as input to predict the\ndepth maps for both source views (Sec. 4.1). The depth val-\nues and the RGB values in foreground regions of the source\nview determine the 3D position and color of each Gaus-\nsian point, respectively, while the other parameters of 3D\nGaussians are predicted in a pixel-wise manner (Sec. 4.2).\nCombined with the depth map and source RGB image, these\nparameter maps formulate the Gaussian representation in\n2D image planes and are further unprojected to 3D space.\nThe unprojected Gaussians from both views are aggregated\nand rendered to the target viewpoint in a differentiable way,\nwhich allows for end-to-end training (Sec. 4.3).\n4.1. View Selection and Depth estimation\nView Selection. Unlike the vanilla 3D Gaussians that opti-\nmize the characteristics of each Gaussian point on all source\nviews, we synthesize the novel target view by interpolating\nthe adjacent two source views. Given the N input images\ndenoted as {In}N\nn=1, with their camera position {Cn}N\nn=1,\nthe source views can be represented by Vn = Cn \u2212 O,\nwhere O is the center of the scene. Similarly, the target\nnovel view rendering can be defined as Itar with target cam-\nera position Ctar and view Vtar = Ctar \u2212 O. By conduct-\ning a dot product of the input views vectors and the novel\nview vector, we can select the nearest two views (vl, vr) as\nthe \u2018working set\u2019 of two-view stereo, where l and r stand\nfor \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 view, respectively.\nThe rectified source images Il, Ir \u2208 [0, 1]H\u00d7W \u00d73 are\nfed to a shared image encoder Eimg with several residual\nblocks and downsampling layers to extract dense feature\nmaps f s \u2208 RH/2s\u00d7W/2s\u00d7Ds where Ds is the dimension\nat the s-th feature scale\n\u27e8{f s\nl }S\ns=1, {f s\nr }S\ns=1\u27e9 = Eimg(Il, Ir)\n(5)\nwhere we set S = 3 in our experiments.\nDepth Estimation. The depth map is the key component of\nour framework bridging the 2D image planes and 3D Gaus-\nsian representation. Note that, depth estimation in two-view\nstereo is equivalent to disparity estimation. For each pixel\n(u, v) in one view, disparity estimation \u03d5disp aims to find its\ncorresponding coordinate (u+\u03d5disp(u), v) in another view,\nconsidering the displacement of each pixel is constrained to\n4\na horizontal line in rectified stereo. Since disparity predic-\ntions can be easily converted to depth maps given camera\nparameters, we do not distinguish between depth maps and\ndisparity maps in the following sections. In theory, any al-\nternative depth estimation methods can be adapted to our\nframework. We implement this module in an iterative man-\nner inspired by [17] mainly because it avoids using pro-\nhibitively slow 3D convolutions to filter the cost volume.\nGiven the feature maps f S\nl , f S\nr \u2208 RH/2S\u00d7W/2S\u00d7DS, we\ncompute a 3D correlation volume C \u2208 RH/2S\u00d7W/2S\u00d7W/2S\nusing a matrix multiplication\nC(f S\nl , f S\nr ),\nCijk =\nX\nh\n(f S\nl )ijh \u00b7 (f S\nr )ikh\n(6)\nThen, an iterative update mechanism predicts a sequence\nof depth estimations {dt\nl}T\nt=1 and {dt\nr}T\nt=1 by looking up\nin volume C, where T is the number of update times. For\nmore details about the update operators, please refer to [40].\nThe outputs of final iterations (dT\nl , dT\nr ) are upsampled to a\nfull-resolution image size via a convex upsampling. The\ndepth estimation module \u03a6depth can be formulated as\n\u27e8Dl, Dr\u27e9 = \u03a6depth(f S\nl , f S\nr , Kl, Kr)\n(7)\nwhere Kl and Kr are the camera parameters, Dl, Dr \u2208\nRH\u00d7W \u00d71 are the depth estimations. The classic two-view\nstereo methods estimate the depth for \u2018reference views\u2019\nonly, while we pursue depth maps of both inputs to formu-\nlate the Gaussian representation, which makes our imple-\nmentation highly symmetrical. By leveraging this nature,\nwe realize a compact and highly parallelized module that\nresults in a decent efficiency increase. Detailed designs of\nthis module can be seen in our supplementary material.\n4.2. Pixel-wise Gaussian Parameters Prediction\nEach Gaussian point in 3D space is characterized by at-\ntributes G = {X, c, r, s, \u03b1}, which represent 3D position,\ncolor, rotation, scaling and opacity, respectively.\nIn this\nsection, we introduce a pixel-wise manner to formulate 3D\nGaussians in 2D image planes. Specifically, we formulate\nour Gaussian maps G as\nG(x) = {Mp(x), Mc(x), Mr(x), Ms(x), M\u03b1(x)} (8)\nwhere x is the coordinate of a foreground pixel in an im-\nage plane, Mp, Mc, Mr, Ms, M\u03b1 represents Gaussian\nparameter maps of position, color, rotation, scaling and\nopacity, respectively. Given the predicted depth map D, a\npixel located at x can be immediately unprojected from im-\nage planes to 3D space using projection matrix P \u2208 R3\u00d74\nstructure with camera parameters K\nMp(x) = \u03a0\u22121\nP (x, D(x))\n(9)\nThus the learnable unprojection in Eq. 9 bridges 2D fea-\nture space and 3D Gaussian representation. Considering our\nhuman-centered scenario is predominantly characterized by\ndiffuse reflection, instead of predicting the SH coefficients,\nwe directly use the source RGB image as the color map\nMc(x) = I(x)\n(10)\nWe argue that the remaining three Gaussian parameters are\ngenerally related to (1) pixel level local features, (2) a global\ncontext of human bodies, and (3) a detailed spatial struc-\nture. Image features {f s}S\ns=1 from encoder Eimg have al-\nready derived strong cues of (1) and (2). Hence, we con-\nstruct an additional encoder Edepth that has an identical ar-\nchitecture to the image encoder and takes the depth map D\nas input. Depth features complement the geometric aware-\nness for each pixel for better Gaussian parameters reason-\ning. The image features and the spatial features are fused by\na U-Net like decoder Dparm to regress pixel-wise Gaussian\nfeatures in full image resolution\n\u0393 = Dparm(Eimg(I) \u2295 Edepth(D))\n(11)\nwhere \u0393 \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7DG, DG is the dimension of Gaussian\nfeatures, \u2295 stands for concatenations at all feature levels.\nThe prediction heads, each composed of 2 convolution lay-\ners, are adapted to Gaussian features for specific Gaussian\nparameter map regression. Before being used to formulate\nGaussian representations, the rotation map should be nor-\nmalized since it represents a quaternion\nMr(x) = Norm(hr(\u0393(x)))\n(12)\nwhere hr is the rotation head. The scaling map and the\nopacity map need activations to satisfy their range\nMs(x) = Softplus(hs(\u0393(x)))\nM\u03b1(x) = Sigmoid(h\u03b1(\u0393(x)))\n(13)\nwhere hs and h\u03b1 represent the scaling head and opacity\nhead, respectively. The detailed network architecture in this\nsection is provided in our supplementary materials.\n4.3. Joint Training with Differentiable Rendering\nThe pixel-wise Gaussian parameter maps defined on both of\nthe two source views are lifted to 3D space and aggregated\nto render a photo-realistic novel view image using Gaussian\nSplatting in Sec. 3.\nJoint Training Mechanism. The fully differentiable ren-\ndering framework simultaneously enables joint training\nfrom two perspectives: (1) The depth estimations of both\nsource views.\n(2) The depth estimation module and the\nGaussian parameter prediction module. As for the former,\nthe independent training of depth estimators on two source\nviews could make the 3D representation inconsistent due\nto the slight mismatch of the source views. As for the lat-\nter, the classic stereo-matching based depth estimation is\nfundamentally a 2D task that aims at densely finding the\n5\nTable 1.

On the other hand, optimal depth esti-\nmation contributes to enhanced precision in determining the\n3D Gaussian parameters.\nLoss Functions. We use L1 loss and SSIM loss [46], de-\nnoted as Lmae and Lssim respectively, to measure the dif-\nference between the rendered and ground truth image\nLrender = \u03b2Lmae + \u03b3Lssim\n(14)\nwhere we set \u03b2 = 0.8 and \u03b3 = 0.2 in our experiments.\nSimilar to [17], we supervise on the L1 distance between the\npredicted and ground truth depth over the full sequence of\npredictions {dt}T\nt=1 with exponentially increasing weights.\nGiven ground truth depth dgt, the loss is defined as\nLdisp =\nT\nX\nt=1\n\u00b5T \u2212t\u2225dgt \u2212 dt\u22251\n(15)\nwhere we set \u00b5 = 0.9 in our experiments. Our final loss\nfunction is L = Lrender + Ldisp.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Implementation Details\nOur GPS-Gaussian is trained on a single RTX3090 graph-\nics card using AdamW [19] optimizer with an initial learn-\ning rate of 2e\u22124. Since the unstable depth estimation in the\nvery first training steps can have a strong impact on Gaus-\nsian parameter regression, we pre-train the depth estimation\nmodule for 40k iterations. Then we jointly train two mod-\nules for 100k iterations with a batch size of 2 and the whole\ntraining process takes around 15 hours.\n5.2. Datasets and Metrics\nTo learn human priors from a large amount of data, we col-\nlect 1700 and 526 human scans from Twindom [42] and\nTHuman2.0 [55], respectively.\nWe randomly select 200\nand 100 scans as validation data from Twindom and THu-\nman2.0, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, we uniformly\nposition 8 cameras in a cycle, thus the angle between two\nneighboring cameras is about 45\u25e6. We render synthetic hu-\nman scans to these camera positions as source view images\nwhile randomly choosing 3 viewpoints to render novel view\nimages, which are positioned on the intersection arc be-\ntween each two adjacent input views. To test the robustness\nin real-world scenarios, we capture real data of 4 characters\nin the same 8-camera setting and prepare 8 additional cam-\nera views as evaluation data. Similar to ENeRF [15], we\nevaluate PSNR, SSIM [46] and LPIPS [56] as metrics for\nthe rendering results in foreground regions determined by\nthe bounding box of humans.\n5.3. Comparisons with State-of-the-art Methods\nBaselines. Considering that our goal is instant NVS ren-\ndering, we compare our GPS-Gaussian against three gen-\neralizable methods including implicit method ENeRF [15],\nImage-based rendering method FloRen [36] and hybrid\nmethod IBRNet [44]. All baseline methods are trained from\nscratch on the same dataset as ours and take as input two\nsource views for one novel view rendering, the same setting\nas ours, at each training iteration. We further prepare the\ncomparison with one per-subject optimization method 3D-\nGS [10] which is optimized on all 8 input views using the\ndefault strategies in the released code.\nComparison Results.\nWe prepare comparisons on both\nsynthetic data and real-world data.\nIn Table 1, our\nGPS-Gaussian outperforms all methods on all metrics and\nachieves a much faster rendering speed. For qualitative ren-\ndering results shown in Fig. 3, our method is able to syn-\nthesize fine-grained novel view images with more detailed\nappearances. Once occlusion happens, some target regions\nunder the novel view are invisible in one or both of source\nviews. In this case, depth ambiguity between input views\ncauses ENeRF and IBRNet to render unreasonable results\nsince these methods are confused when conducting the fea-\nture aggregation. The unreliable geometric proxy in these\ncases also makes FloRen produce blurred outputs even if\nit employs the depth and flow refining networks. In our\nmethod, the human priors learned from massive human im-\nages help to alleviate the adverse effects caused by occlu-\n6\n3D-GS\nIBRNet\nENeRF\nGround Truth\nOurs\nFloRen\nTHuman2.0\nTwindom\nReal-world Data\nFigure 3.

Also, most of the\ncompared methods have difficulty in handling thin struc-\ntures such as hockey sticks and robes in Fig. 3. We further\nprepare the sensitivity analysis of camera view sparsity in\nTable 2. For the results of 6-camera, we use the same model\ntrained in 8-camera setting without any fine-tuning. Among\nbaselines, our method degrades reasonably and holds ro-\nbustness when decreasing cameras. We ignore 3D-GS here\nbecause it takes several minutes per-subject optimization\nand produces noisy rendering results, as shown in Fig. 3,\neven in 8-camera setting.\n5.4. Ablation Studies\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our designs in more detail\nthrough ablation experiments. Other than rendering met-\nrics, we follow [17] to evaluate depth (identical to dispar-\nity) estimation with the end-point-error (EPE) and the ratio\nof pixel error in 1 pix level.

We design a model\nwithout the differentiable Gaussian rendering by substitut-\ning it with point cloud rendering at a fixed radius. Thus the\nmodel degenerates into a depth estimation network and an\nundifferentiable depth warping based rendering. The ren-\ndering quality is merely based on the accuracy of depth es-\ntimation while the rendering loss could not conversely pro-\nmote the depth estimator. We train the ablated model for\nthe same iterations as the full model for fair comparison.\nThe rendering results in Fig. 4 witness obvious noise due to\nthe depth ambiguity in the margin area of the source views\nwhere the depth value changes drastically. The rendering\nnoise causes a degradation in PSNR and SSIM as mani-\nfested in Table 3, while cannot be reflected in the perception\nmatric LPIPS. The joint regression with Gaussian parame-\nters precisely recognizes these outliers and compensates for\nthese artifacts by predicting an extremely low opacity for\nthe Gaussian points centered at these points. Meanwhile,\nthe independent training of the depth estimation module in-\nterrupts the interaction of two source views, resulting in an\ninconsistency when recovering the geometry. As illustrated\nin Table 3, joint learning makes a more robust depth estima-\ntor with a 5% improvement in EPE.\nEffects of Depth Encoder. We claim that merely using im-\nage features is insufficient for predicting Gaussian param-\neters. Herein, we remove the depth encoder from our full\nmodel, thus the Gaussian parameter decoder only takes as\ninput the image features to predict Mr, Ms, M\u03b1 simulta-\nneously. As shown in Fig. 4, we find the model fails to\nrecover the details of human appearance, leading to blurred\nrendering results. The absence of spatial awareness makes\nthe predicted Scaling Map Ms incline to a mean value,\nwhich causes serious overlaps between Gaussian points.\nThis drawback significantly deteriorates the visual percep-\ntion reflected on the LPIPS, even with a comparable depth\nestimation accuracy, as shown in Table 3.\n6. Conclusion and Discussion\nBy regressing directly Gaussian parameter maps defined\non the estimated depth images of source views, our GPS-\nGaussian takes a significant step towards real-time and\nphoto-realistic Novel View Synthesis system using only\nsparse view cameras. Our proposed pipeline is fully dif-\nferentiable and carefully designed.\nWe demonstrate that\nour method improves notably both quantitative and quali-\ntative results compared with baseline methods and achieves\na much faster rendering speed on a single RTX 3090 GPU.\nAlthough the proposed GPS-Gaussian synthesizes high-\nquality images, some elements can still impact the effective-\nness of our method. For example, an accurate foreground\nmatting is necessary as preprocessing step. Besides, we can\nnot perfectly handle a very large disparity in the case of 6-\ncamera setting when a target region in one view is totally\ninvisible in another view. We believe that one can leverage\ntemporal information to solve this problem.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Kara-Ali Aliev, Artem Sevastopolsky, Maria Kolos, Dmitry\nUlyanov, and Victor Lempitsky.

B), the details of network architecture (Sec. C) and\nlive demo (Sec. D).\nA. Run-time Comparison\nWe compare the run-time of the proposed GPS-Gaussian\nwith baseline methods. All compared methods generally\ncontain two components including view independent com-\nputation on input source images and a target view orien-\ntated rendering which depends on the given novel view-\npoint. The detailed run-time of each method on both con-\ntents is illustrated in Table A. The view independent compu-\ntation in FloRen [36] contains matting and coarse geometry\ninitialization while the key component including the depth\nand flow refinement networks operates on novel viewpoints.\nIBRNet [44] uses transformers to aggregate multi-view cues\nat each sampling point of novel view direction, which\nmakes view dependent computation time-consuming. EN-\neRF [15] constructs two view dependent cost volumes in\na coarse-to-fine manner to predict the depth of the target\nviewpoint followed by a depth-guided sampling for volume\nrendering. These methods necessitate recomputations of the\nview dependent modules once the target viewpoint changes.\nIn our GPS-Gaussian, the main computation lies on Gaus-\nsian parameter map regression and depth estimation, which\nare formulated on source image planes. The unprojected\nGaussian representation from source views enables 3D con-\nsistent novel view rendering. Given a target viewpoint, it\ntakes only 0.8 ms to render the 3D Gaussians to the target\n2D image plane. This allows us to render multiple images\nsimultaneously given the viewpoints of multiple viewers.\nTable A. Run-time comparison. \u2018View independent\u2019 computa-\ntion refers to the network latency on source views. \u2018View de-\npendent\u2019 computation refers to the view-specific inference on a\nsingle novel viewpoint. The rendering resolution here is set to\n1024 \u00d7 1024. The proposed Gaussian parameter maps are com-\npletely formulated on source views, while the only novel view de-\npendent manipulation in our method is the Gaussian Splatting ren-\ndering. The fast view dependent computation speed of our method\nenables novel view synthesis for multiple viewpoints immediately\nin real-time.\nMethods\nView independent View dependent (per view)\nFloRen [36]\n14 ms\n11 ms\nIBRNet [44]\n5 ms\n4000 ms\nENeRF [15]\n11 ms\n125 ms\nOurs\n27 ms\n0.8 ms\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFigure A. Visualization of opacity maps. (a) One of the source\nview images. (b) The predicted opacity map related to (a). (c)/(d)\nThe projected color/opacity map from the source view to the novel\nviewpoint. (e) The novel view rendering result. The opacity val-\nues are visualized in the heat map where a cold color represents a\nvalue near 0, and a hot color represents a value near 1. The low\nopacity values predicted for the outliers make them invisible in the\nrendering results.\nB. Visualization of Opacity Maps\nAs mentioned in Sec. 5.4, the joint regression with Gaus-\nsian parameters eliminates the outliers by predicting an ex-\ntremely low opacity for the Gaussian points centered at\nthese points. The visualization of opacity maps is shown\nin Fig. A. Since the depth prediction works on low res-\nolution and upsampled to full-image size, the drastically\nchanged depth in the margin areas causes ambiguous pre-\ndictions (e.g. the front and rear placed legs of the girl and\nthe crossed arms of the boy in Fig. A). These ambiguities\nfurther lead to rendering noise on novel views when using\na point cloud rendering technique. Thanks to the learned\nopacity map, the predicted low opacity values make the out-\nliers invisible in the final novel view rendering results, as\nshown in Fig. A (e).\nC. Network Architecture\nThe network architecture of the proposed GPS-Gaussian is\nshown in Fig. B.

Network architecture. The proposed framework takes the source image as input to regress the Gaussian parameter maps (color\nmap Mc, position map Mp, rotation map Mr, scaling map Ms and opacity map M\u03b1).\nImage Encoder.\nThe image encoder Eimg is applied to\nboth the left and right images and maps each image to a set\nof dense feature map {f s\nl }S\ns=1 as in Eq. 5. The image en-\ncoder Eimg has a similar architecture to the feature encoder\nin RAFT-Stereo [17]. We replace the 7 \u00d7 7 convolution\nwith a 5\u00d75 one at the beginning of the network and replace\nall batch normalization with group normalization. Residual\nblocks and downsampling layers are used to produce im-\nage features in 3 levels at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 the input image\nresolution, with 32, 48 and 96 channels, respectively. The\nextracted features are further used to construct the correla-\ntion volume and regress the Gaussian parameters.\nDepth Estimation Module. As mentioned in Sec. 4.1, The\nclassic two-view stereo methods estimate the depth for \u2018ref-\nerence view\u2019 only, while the feature of \u2018target view\u2019 is only\nused to construct the cost volume but not involved in the\nfurther depth estimation or iterative refine module.\nThe\ncost volume in Eq. 6 is computed redundantly if exchanging\nthe role of both inputs for depth estimation of both views.\nBy making the image encoder independent from the dispar-\nity estimation module, and re-indexing the correlation vol-\nume C for both lookup procedures, we realize a compact\nand highly parallelized implementation that results in a de-\ncent efficiency increase exceeding 30%. For the refinement\nmodule, we set T = 4 considering the trade-off between the\nperformance and the cost. The GRU units are identical to\nthat implemented in RAFT-Stereo [17].\nGaussian Parameter Prediction Module. This module is\ncomposed of a depth encoder Eimg and a U-Net like Gaus-\nsian parameter decoder Dparm. The depth encoder, which\ntakes as input the depth prediction, has an identical architec-\nture to the image encoder. Image features and depth features\nare concatenated at each level and further aggregated to the\nGaussian parameter decoder via skip connections. The de-\ncoded pixel-wise Gaussian feature \u0393 passes through three\nspecific prediction heads to get rotation map Mr, scaling\nmap Ms and opacity map M\u03b1, respectively. Meanwhile,\nthe position map Mp is determined by the predicted depth\nmap D and the color map Mc directly borrows from the\nRGB value of the input image.\nD. Live Demo\nWe prepare a live demo in supplementary video, in which\nwe capture source view RGB streams and render novel view\nin one system.\nDue to the memory cost of RTX 3090,\nwe connect the front 6 cameras faced human subjects to\nthe computer, and cameras are positioned in a circle of a\n2-meter radius. We note that our method achieves high-\nquality real-time rendering, even for challenging hairstyles\nand human-object interaction.\n12\n"

The idea is to apply a language decoder\nthat auto-regressively predicts the text tokens from image\nembeddings to form labels. To ground this prediction pro-\ncess in auto-regression, we customize a non-causal atten-\ntion mask for the decoder, incorporating two key features:\nmodeling tokens from different labels to be independent,\nand treating image tokens as a prefix. This masking mech-\nanism inspires an efficient method \u2212 one-shot sampling \u2212\nto simultaneously sample tokens of multiple labels in paral-\nlel and rank generated labels by their probabilities during\ninference. To further enhance the efficiency, we propose a\nsimple strategy to construct a compact decoder by simply\ndiscarding the intermediate blocks of a pretrained language\nmodel. This approach yields a decoder that matches the\nfull model\u2019s performance while being notably more efficient.\nThe code is available at github.com/kaiyuyue/nxtp.\n1. Introduction\nThis paper delves into a fundamental problem in computer\nvision \u2212 object recognition \u2212 translating an image into ob-\nject labels. Generally speaking, the recognition framework\ncomprises an image encoder and a decoder. The image en-\ncoder, either in the form of a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) [43, 60, 72, 106, 110] or a vision transformer (ViT)\n[28, 93, 120], produces image embeddings, while the de-\ncoder propagates them to predict object labels.\nIf the decoder is a linear classifier [28, 43, 60, 72, 106, 110],\nit needs to be initialized with fixed object concepts. ResNet\n[43], for instance, initializes its final linear layer with 1K\nembeddings, a.k.a. weights, to represent 1K objects in Ima-\ngeNet [25]. Such static weights, however, limit the model\u2019s\nability to recognize any object. This limitation can be mit-\nigated using a language model [26, 114] as the decoder to\ngenerate a flexible set of object embeddings from input de-\nscriptions. For example, CLIP [93] encodes the object de-\nscriptions into dynamic weights by prompting with \u201ca photo\nof a {L}\u201d, where L could be any object name, and matches\nthese weights with image embeddings to recognize objects.\n*Work done during an internship at Meta AI. kaiyuyue@cs.umd.edu.\nGenerative Decoder\nAuto-Regression\nso\nfa\ncat\nblank et\nImage Token Embeddings\nProbability\nFigure 1.

Photo authorized with CC BY 4.0.\nNote that CLIP predefines the gallery with a fixed number\nof object descriptions prior to inference. This requirement\nreveals that CLIP\u2019s object embeddings cover only a portion\nof the textual space in practical scenarios, rather than its en-\ntirety. Additionally, enlarging the gallery has been shown\nto diminish its performance [19]. Given these observations,\na question arises: Can we eliminate the predefined object\nlabels or descriptions?\nA direct strategy could use a generative model, particularly\na large language model (LLM) [11, 87, 91, 92, 112\u2013114],\nto decode labels from image embeddings.\nFor instance,\nFlamingo [1, 3] employs a LLM to transform image em-\nbeddings into textual outputs for various vision tasks such\nas object recognition, image captioning, and visual ques-\ntion answering (VQA). But producing the desired results\nfor a specific task needs several reference samples as few-\nshot prompts for the model. In other words, it requires pre-\ndefined reference pivots to refine and align its predictions\nmore precisely with the target task.\nThe most straightforward alternative is to skip any predefin-\ning procedure and align the LLM with the recognition task\ndirectly. This approach hinges on the fact that a LLM\u2019s to-\nken embeddings represent the entire textual space, includ-\ning all object labels. This is as opposed to predefining sub-\nsets, i.e., query galleries or reference pivots, of this space\nthat potentially constrains the model\u2019s capability.\nBuilding on this concept, we propose a simple method that\nemploys a language decoder to auto-regressively decode\nobject labels token-by-token from image embeddings, as de-\npicted in Figure 1. We operate a pretrained CLIP image en-\ncoder [93] to produce image embeddings, already aligned\nwith text, and linearly transform them to match the language\ndecoder\u2019s embedding dimension.\n1\narXiv:2312.02142v3  [cs.CV]  12 Mar 2024\nThis auto-regressive framework, unlike the contrastive fra-\nmework exemplified by CLIP [93], is trained to predict text\nembeddings from image embeddings, rather than aligning\nboth. While related in spirit to recent vision-language mod-\nels such as LiMBeR [81], LLaVA [68, 69], and BLIP-2 [64,\n65], our method introduces differences and innovations:\nFirst, our approach targets object recognition, as opposed to\nthe chat-oriented VQA methods. We train on image-caption\npairs, easier to collect and annotate than image-question-\nanswer triplets, and extract nouns from raw captions as ref-\nerence labels to weakly supervise training. For inference,\nwe generate text fragments as labels rather than sentences.\nIn scenarios like recommendation systems [97] that require\nlabels or tags, a simple label-only output is more concise\nthan verbose sentences requiring further post-processing.\nSecond, our decoder has a different token modeling mech-\nanism. Instead of decoding all input and output tokens in\na conditional sequence as in LLMs, we ensure tokens from\ndifferent labels to be independent, while tokens from the\nsame label remain conditional. Naturally, all label tokens\nare conditional on image embeddings. This decoupling is\nbased on the understanding that different labels in the same\nimage are independent but their coexistence is determined\nby the underlying visual context. To this end, we customize\na non-causal attention mask for our language decoder.\nFurther, the non-causal masking mechanism inspires a new\nsampling method, called one-shot sampling, to generate text\ntokens for labels. Instead of sampling tokens in sequence as\nin greedy search, beam search, and nucleus sampling [50],\none-shot sampling simultaneously samples tokens of multi-\nple labels in parallel and ranks them by their probabilities.\nThis makes use of the strong parallelization capabilities of a\ntransformer, leading to object recognition that is much more\nefficient than the aforementioned methods and does not suf-\nfer from repetition issues [35, 121].\nLastly, we put forth a straightforward strategy to enhance\nmodel efficiency of our recognition model. We hypothesize\nthat only partial knowledge in LLMs is vital for recognition\nand focus on maximizing efficiency by not engaging the en-\ntire language model. To construct the decoder, we start with\na pretrained LLM, e.g., LLaMA [112, 113], retain first six\ntransformer blocks along with the final output layer, and\ndrop the intervening blocks. This compact decoder matches\nthe full model\u2019s performance but is substantially more effi-\ncient, i.e., 4.5\u00d7 faster in inference.\n2. Related Work\nAligning Images and Text, including sentences, phrases,\nor words, in a shared space has been prevalent for image-\ntext matching [9, 23, 34, 49, 57, 59, 78, 108, 119], and foun-\ndational in contrastive frameworks [40, 75, 93], while others\nare geared towards generating text descriptions from images\n[55, 56, 59, 78, 108, 115]. Then, integrating visual percep-\ntion with LLMs [114] like GPT [11, 87, 91, 92] and LLaMA\n[112, 113] is gaining traction by treating image embeddings\nas language token embeddings, seamlessly fusing visual\nand textual information within the model [48, 105]. Such\nmethods are being applied to tasks such as detection [14],\nfew-shot recognition [1, 93], textual explainations [10],\nclassification justification [45], bottleneck models [100,\n122], reasoning [2, 42, 46, 77, 80, 103], and chat-based\nmodels [22, 64, 65, 68, 69, 81] for captioning and VQA.\nTackling Open-Vocabulary Tasks for recognition [93], de-\ntection [29, 38, 61, 82, 83, 123] and segmentation [29, 36]\ntypically involves training on a set of base labels and then\nrecognizing rare unseen labels. The cornerstone of open-\nvocab approaches is the contrastive learning [41, 109] like\nCLIP [93], which employs a language model to encode la-\nbels to contrast with images. Therefore, open-vocab meth-\nods potentially inherit CLIP\u2019s limitations discussed in Sec-\ntion 1 due to the predefined base and rare labels. CaSED\n[19] utilizes raw captions to form a vocabulary-free gallery,\ndiverging from the gallery of predefined label vocabularies.\nHowever, its performance is heavily dependent on gallery\nselection, as demonstrated in Table 10 of [19], highlighting\nits limitations as a retrieval-based method.\nWe argue that by dramatically increasing the training data\nto cover a wide array of objects, the reliance on recognizing\nrare data and concepts can be heavily reduced. Our method\naligns more with the open-world paradigm [6] that incre-\nmentally learns new labels over time, mirroring the way of\ndata collection in the real world. In the application, given\njust an image, our model predicts labels with ranking prob-\nabilities, without relying on any predefined set of concepts.\n3. Method\n3.1. Revisiting Object Recognition\nWe begin by briefly reviewing object recognition in its gen-\neral formulation. Suppose that 2D images are fed into a\nbackbone, e.g. ViT [28] in CLIP [93], which produces im-\nage embeddings1 Xv \u2208 RM\u00d7D, where M is the spatial size\nand D is the embedding dimension. In a nutshell, the prob-\nlem of recognition aims to decode object labels solely from\nXv, translating image embeddings into the textual space.\nIn the past years, the core design of this translation employs\na set of textual embeddings W \u2208 RN\u00d7D to seek the opti-\nmal alignment with Xv:\narg max \u03c3(Wf(Xv)\u22a4),\n(1)\n1Bold capital letters denote a matrix X, and bold lower-case letters a\ncolumn vector x. xi and xj represents the ith row and jth column of the\nmatrix X respectively. Xij denotes the scalar in the ith row and jth column\nof the matrix X. All non-bold letters represent scalars.\n2\nwhere \u03c3 is the softmax function and f is to transform Xv\nfor aligning with W. For instance, linear classifiers such as\nResNet [43] employ the average pooling as f to transform\nXv to a single vector representation, and initiate W using\na set of predefined concepts corresponding to object labels,\ne.g., N = 1000 for ImageNet [25]. The contrastive frame-\nworks such as CLIP [93] embed a collection of predefined\nobject descriptions into W, and apply an aggregation (like\n[CLS] embedding [28]) and linear projection as f on Xv.\nEq. 1 aims to maximize the alignment between f(Xv) and\nW. The space of W plays a critical role in this alignment as\nthe diversity and richness of the embeddings in W directly\naffect the model\u2019s ability to differentiate objects. The linear\nclassifiers and contrastive frameworks, however, limit W to\na predefined subset that potentially constrains the model\u2019s\ncapability to recognize any object. Our goal is to eliminate\nthis limitation and extend W to the entire textual space.\n3.2. Auto-Regression for Recognition\nRecently, LLMs have significantly advanced in understand-\ning and generating text [11, 87, 91, 92, 112\u2013114]. Consid-\nering that their token embeddings are trained to represent\nthe entire textual space, we define W with the token em-\nbeddings2 from a pretrained LLM, e.g., LLaMA [112, 113],\nfeaturing N = 32K textual tokens. Then Eq. 1 changes to\npredicting the token:\nP(w|Xv) = arg max \u03c3(Wf(Xv)\u22a4),\n(2)\nwhere w represents the most probable single token for Xv.\nIn our method, f is a combination of linear projection and\nthe pretrained LLM to project Xv in the textual space of W.\nThat is, f is our language decoder.\nTo guide the language decoder in the recognition task, we\nprompt it with a short instruction \u2212 \u201cthe objects in the im-\nage are\u201d \u2212 tokenized as Xp \u2208 RP \u00d7D. Then we concatenate\nXv and Xp to form our input token embeddings:\nX = Xv \u2295 [IMG] \u2295 Xp,\n(3)\nwhere \u2295 is the concatenation operation and [IMG] is a spe-\ncial token to indicate the boundary.\nTypically, a label consists of multiple tokens, e.g., \u201csofa\u201d\nhas two tokens [so] and [fa]. Without loss of generality, we\nassume a label L has T tokens. Now predicting L is equiv-\nalent to auto-regressively predicting its tokens:\nP(L) = P(w1, . . . , wT |Xv, Xp) =\nT\nY\nt=1\nP(wt|w<t, X),\n(4)\n2In general, LLMs have two sets of token embeddings, one for encod-\ning input tokens and the other for predicting output tokens. Some LLMs\nlike GPT-2 [92] share the same embeddings for both input and output to-\nkens [90], while others like LLaMA [113] employ different embeddings.\nOur method defines W with the embeddings designated for output tokens.\nLk\nind\no\nors\ncat\nso\nfa\n[SEP]\nXv Xp\nM =\n\u221e\n0.0\nXv\nXp\nFigure 2. Non-causal attention mask for prefixing image tokens\nXv and decoupling tokens from different labels Lk to be indepen-\ndent at the [SEP] token.\nwhere wt is the t-th token of L, and w<t is the sequence\nof tokens before the t-th token. To compute the conditional\nprobability in Eq. 4, the transformer-based LLM in f em-\nploys a causal mask M [114] on the pairwise attention A to\nmodel the interdependence between tokens:\nA \u2190 A + M,\nM = tril(\u221e),\n(5)\nwhere tril(\u221e) is with zeros in the lower triangle and infinity\nvalues in the upper triangle. This enforces the token wt to\nattend only to the preceding tokens w<t, i.e., making wt\nconditional on w<t, as shown in the left of Figure 2.\n3.3. Non-causal Masking\nIn general, an image contains multiple objects, and our\ngoal is to predict them all. Suppose there are K objects,\nand we denote the output set of labels for the image as\nL = {L1, ..., LK}, where k-th label has Tk + 1 tokens,\nincluding the special token [SEP] for the delimiter. Then\nthe likelihood of this set of labels appearing in the image is\nthe product of their probabilities:\nP(L) =\nK\nY\nk=1\nP(Lk) =\nK\nY\nk=1\nTk+1\nY\nt=1\nP(wk\nt |wk\n<t, X).\n(6)\nNow Eq. 6 is not a standard auto-regression practiced in\nLLMs because wk\nt only needs to attend to the input tokens\nX and the preceding tokens wk\n<t from the same label Lk.\nThis is supported by the understanding that the labels co-\nexist in the same image due to the underlying visual con-\ntext, but are independent of each other. Additionally, the\nimage tokens Xv exhibit inherently spatial correlation, in\ncontrast to the temporal correlation of natural language to-\nkens. Therefore, we customize a non-causal attention mask\nM with two designs, illustrated in the right of Figure 2: a)\nWe decouple the correlation between tokens from different\nlabels at the [SEP] token to prevent these tokens from being\nattended to each other; b) We treat image tokens Xv as a\nprefix [27, 70, 94, 116\u2013118], enabling the image tokens to\nsee each other. Interestingly, our non-causal attention mask\nshares a similar design as the column mask in [95] but is\ndeveloped from a different perspective, where the column\nmask is specifically for image-to-image attention.\n3\nIn the end, Eq. 6 is our final training objective. We use the\ncross-entropy loss for optimization, with weakly-supervised\nlabels3 L extracted from the corresponding image captions.\n3.4. One-Shot Sampling\nThe non-causal masking decouples the tokens from distinct\nlabels, indicating that the first token of any label could be\nthe next after X in the first sampling round. In other words,\na higher probability for the first token, being sampled after\ninput X, would result in a higher relevance of the label to\nthe image. This inspires us to sample tokens of multiple la-\nbels in parallel, as shown in Figure 3.\nfinal tokens w/  \ninitial tokens\nranked logits\ntop-k\ncat\nart\ncharacter\ndoor\ncart\nwall\nk\nc\ncat\nart\ncharacter\ndoor\ncart\nwall\nk\nc\noon\npaper\nitten\nute\nsampling\n[SEP]\nFigure 3. One-shot sampling for generating tokens of top-k labels\nin parallel. Once the model samples the [SEP] token, the label is\ncompleted. Otherwise, the model continues for unfinished labels.\nGiven input tokens X, we propagate them into the decoder\nand rank the output logits by their softmax probabilities.\nThe top-k tokens, called initial tokens, decide the top-k\nlabels to be generated. The efficacy of linking initial to-\nkens to final labels is explored in Table 8, highlighting the\npromise of this straightforward approach. Then we sample\nthe next token for the top-k initial tokens in parallel, using\ntop-1 sampling, to generate k labels. If the sampled token\nis [SEP], the label is completed. Otherwise, the model con-\ntinues to sample the next token for the unfinished labels.\nFinally, we report the probability of each label as the prod-\nuct of its token probabilities. We refer to this approach as\none-shot sampling, which enables parallel sampling of mul-\ntiple labels in one shot. The key to its parallelism lies in the\nnon-causal masking mechanism, which also avoids the rep-\netition issue [35, 121] typically faced in greedy and beam\nsearch, as it causes the model to focus uniformly on the\nsame input tokens X across various labels.\nTo sum up, the one-shot sampling differs from other sam-\npling methods in two essential aspects: a) It operates in\nparallel across multiple object labels, with each parallel\nbranch processing a small number of tokens (roughly less\nthan ten tokens), in contrast to the sequential sampling of\nother methods; b) It naturally aligns with the vision recog-\nnition task by representing the image as a spatially corre-\nlated entity, while other sampling methods depict the image\nas a sequence of tokens.\n3Our learning approach is considered weakly-supervised as the labels\nare incomplete and imperfect derived from raw captions.\n3.5. Truncating the Decoder\nNow, considering the language model LLaMA in our de-\ncoder f, we posit that a specific subset of language under-\nstanding in its numerous parameters is vital for recognition.\nThis realization prompts us to focus on maximizing effi-\nciency by not engaging the entire model. We construct our\nlanguage decoder, initially based on the LLaMA 7B (ver-\nsion 1 or 2), by truncating it to the first 6 transformer blocks\nalong with the final output layer, as depicted in Figure 4,\nwhile preserving its tokenizer and the pretrained 32K token\nembeddings for encoding the input. We designate this mod-\nified version as the truncated language decoder, denoted as\nLangtruncated in our experiments.\nfreezing\nXv\nViT-L/14\nLLaMA 7B\ntruncating\ntraining\nFigure 4. Encoder and truncated decoder. We retain the first 6\ntransformer blocks along with the final output layer of the LLaMA\n7B as our truncated decoder, and train with partial encoder blocks.\n4. Experiments\nData. We construct training datasets at two different scales\nfor experiments. G3M: a training group of 3M(illion) pairs\ncombines CC3M [104], COCO Captions [15, 67], SBU\n[88], which is mainly used for ablation studies. G70M: We\ngather 67M pairs from LAION-Synthetic-115M (slightly\nfewer than previous work due to missing URLs) [64, 102].\nCombining it with G3M, we form a 70M-pair training group\nfor scaling-up training. For evaluation, we use the valida-\ntion split of CC3M, COCO Captions, and OpenImages V7\n[7]. We parse the raw captions to obtain meaningful nouns\nas reference labels in both training and evaluation. The pro-\ncessing details are described in Section A.5.\nImplementation. The inference augmentation for input im-\nages in CLIP [93] is applied in both training and evalua-\ntion. The input size is 2242. The image encoder is ViT-\nL/14 [28] pretrained from CLIP [93], producing 256 token\nembeddings with the dimension of 1024, as Xv. Note that\nwe drop its [CLS] token. The special token embedding of\n[IMG] is learned during training. The special token [SEP] is\nthe comma (,), and 32K token embeddings for the input are\nfixed. The max number of input tokens is 512. No [EOS]\ntoken, i.e., the end of the sentence, is used in the input. We\nshuffle labels for each image in training.\nTraining. AdamW [74] with the cosine annealing learn-\ning rate (LR) schedule [73] is applied in single-stage train-\ning. The multi-dimensional parameters apply a weight de-\ncay of 10\u22121. The global batch size is 512 with 32 NVIDIA\nA100-SXM4-80GB GPUs. The warm-up has 2K iterations.\nWe jointly train four parts: the last 6 blocks of the image\nencoder ViT-L/14, the projection layer for Xv, the special\n4\n[IMG] token embedding, and the whole truncated language\ndecoder, using a LR of 10\u22125 for 3 epochs, as shown in Fig-\nure 4, taking \u223c5 hours on G3M and \u223c5 days on G70M.\nEvaluation. The n-gram overlap metrics, including BLEU\n[89] and ROUGE [66], are widely used to evaluate the qual-\nity of sentences generated by language models. However,\nthese metrics are not suitable for evaluating the quality of\nresults in recognition tasks. For example, \u201ccar\u201d and \u201cauto-\nmobile\u201d have the low n-gram similarity but are semantically\nalike. To quantify the semantic similarity between the gen-\nerated labels and the reference labels, we adopt the concept\nfrom BERTScore [124] to formulate our evaluation metric4.\nFormally, given a set of reference labels R with size M and\na set of generated labels G with size N, we use the sentence-\nBERT [96] to encode R to a set of semantic embeddings\nR \u2208 RM\u00d7D and G to G \u2208 RN\u00d7D, where D is the em-\nbedding dimension. Then we compute the cosine similarity\nmatrix S \u2208 RM\u00d7N between R and G:\nSij =\nri g\u22a4\nj\n\u2225ri\u2225\u2225gj\u2225 \u2208 R[\u22121,1].\n(7)\nWe compute the recall for the reference set R and the pre-\ncision for the generated set G:\nR = 1\nM\nM\nX\ni=1\nmax\nj\nSij,\nP = 1\nN\nN\nX\nj=1\nmax\ni\nSij,\n(8)\nwhere max indicates the greedy matching strategy follow-\ning [124]. Finally, we compute the F1 score as the harmonic\nmean of R and P:\nF1 = 2RP\nR + P .\n(9)\nFor each sample, we evaluate the top-k generated labels out\nof N and report the average R, P, and F1 over all samples.\nNote that, different models may have different numbers of\ngenerated labels N for each image. Especially, when N <\nk, we do not pad the matrix S with zeros to make N = k\nand penalize the model. Thus, the model with N < k will\nhave a higher P compared to the model with N = k.\n4.1.

Comparison of different methods with top-10 predictions. Bold numbers are the best results and underlined numbers are the\nsecond best results, same for the following tables.\nAnalytic Comparisons. In the R column of Table 1, R re-\nmains consistent as the number of reference labels per sam-\nple is fixed, so unaffected by prediction count. Higher R\nsuggests top-k predictions have higher semantic relevance\nto the reference labels.\nOur method outperforms others\nfor top-10 predictions across all datasets, showing our ap-\nproach\u2019s ability to yield more relevant labels.\nThe P column is sensitive to the quantity of predictions; for\ninstance, if we assess top-10 predictions but the model pro-\nduces only five labels, the precision will be higher than that\nof the model yielding 10 predictions, according to Eq. 8. To\nbetter understand the P/R relationship, we plot two differ-\nent precision-recall (PR) curves in Figure 5, calculated by\nadjusting the match threshold between references and pre-\ndictions, and altering k for predictions.\nThe left column of Figure 5 derives from various thresholds\non the similarity matrix S in Eq. 7 with top-10 predictions.\nThe curves demonstrate a strong linear correlation due to\nthe calculation of P and R from the best matches in S.\nA threshold of 0.7, for example, excludes pairs with lower\nsimilarity, reducing both P and R simultaneously. The rate\nat which P and R decline with increasing thresholds reflects\nthe overall similarity of predictions to reference labels \u2212 a\nfaster drop means the lower overall similarity. Our method,\nwith the gradual descent of the curves, suggests better pre-\ndiction quality across all test datasets. At a threshold of 1.0,\nnon-zero values of P and R signify that the model\u2019s predic-\ntions perfectly match the reference labels.\nThe right column of Figure 5 shows the PR curves for vary-\ning top-k predictions, with the inverse correlation between\nP and R, indicating their trade-off. Our method outper-\nforms others in both P and R at top-1 and -3, while at top-5,\nFlamingoopen and InstructBLIP saturate at the same level as\ntop-10, even we double their sampling tokens for trying to\ngenerate more. This observation demonstrates that VQA-\nbased models are suboptimal for the task due to the lack\nof the ability to generate diverse labels consistently. The\nplateau explain their highest P, but lower R and F1 in Ta-\nble 1. Our method can achieve higher recall with increasing\nk, showing that it can consistently hold a P/R balance.\n5. Ablation Studies\nTruncating the Language Decoder. To test our conjecture\nthat only a subset of knowledge in LLMs is vital for the task,\nwe reduce the decoder\u2019s size starting from LLaMA 7B. We\nhave found that removing intermediate transformer blocks\nresults in a compact decoder with comparable performance.\nTo begin, we need to determine which transformer blocks to\nremove out of the 32 blocks in LLaMA 7B. Drawing inspi-\nration from [44], we initially fine-tuned the last third, i.e.,\n11 blocks, along with the final output layer. On the other\nhand, motivated by the observation that the language de-\ncoder takes image embeddings as the input with a novel\ndomain, we fine-tune the first third of the blocks, i.e., 11\nblocks, and the final output layer. This approach is premised\non the hypothesis that the initial blocks might be better\nsuited to learn the image embeddings. As evidenced by Ta-\nble 2, indeed the first third of the LLaMA 7B emerges as the\nmost significant segment. Therefore, we decided to remove\nblocks after the 11th block.\n6\nCC3M\nCOCO\nOpenImages\nf.t. part\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nfirst third 0.679 0.602 0.632 0.621 0.802 0.698 0.559 0.593 0.569\nlast third 0.651 0.586 0.611 0.585 0.748 0.654 0.550 0.587 0.562\nTable 2.

Comparison of different sampling methods using top-5\npredictions. The greedy and beam search sample up to 64 tokens,\nand takes first five generated labels as predictions.\nNote that, we always retain the final output layer of LLaMA\nfor generating the final logits. Initially, we truncate LLaMA\n7B at the 11th block, as illustrated in Figure 4, resulting in a\n3B model. Table 3 shows that the 3B model matches the full\nmodel in performance. To further explore the impact of the\ndecoder size, we truncate the 3B model\u2019s decoder by remov-\ning its last 5 transformer blocks to produce a 1.78B model\nand find it still performs comparably to the full model. Un-\ntil the 0.77B model, which has only one transformer block,\nthe performance has a noticeable drop but small.\nThe other way to construct the decoder is directly using rel-\native small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA 3B [113]. Table 4 shows\nour truncated decoder outperforms LLaMA 3B at the same\nmodel scale, indicating that truncated decoders can be ben-\nefited from the better token embeddings of the larger LLMs.\nPlus, truncating enables models to flexibly balance accuracy\nand efficiency across different model scales as in Table 3.\nSampling Strategies. We investigate three deterministic to-\nken sampling methods: greedy search, 3-way beam search,\nand one-shot sampling. Greedy and beam search select the\nhighest probability token, i.e., top-1, at each step. With our\nmodel, greedy and beam search suffer from the repetition\nissue, explained in Section 3.4. To mitigate it for the com-\nparison, we follow [58] to penalize the logits x of the pre-\nceding generated tokens. The sampling distribution for the\nnext token is\np =\nexp(xi/(\u03c4 \u00b7 1(i \u2208 G)))\nP\nj exp(xj/(\u03c4 \u00b7 1(j \u2208 G))),\n(10)\nwhere \u03c4 = 1.2 is the penalization factor, 1(\u00b7) is the indica-\ntor function, and G is the set of preceding sampled tokens.\nThe results are shown in Table 5. One-shot sampling con-\nsiders label count instead of token count in greedy and beam\nsearch. It generates more diverse labels without the repeti-\ntion issue, explaining its superior performance in R and F1\nover greedy and beam search, though with marginally re-\nduced P, consistently in top-10 predictions (see Table A.6).\nTheir top-10 comparisons show that, unlike one-shot sam-\npling, increasing the number of tokens in greedy and beam\nsearch does not result in more diverse labels.\nNote that our one-shot sampling could potentially encounter\na competition issue, where if multiple plausible labels share\nthe same initial token, it would sample one of them and omit\nthe others. While sampling multiple times for the same to-\nken could mitigate this issue, in practice, its impact seems\nless critical than the repetition issue in sequential sampling.\nPlus, redundant tokenization can allow multiple labels with\nthe same starting words being returned through different to-\nken combinations. This is tentatively indicated by our large-\nscale predictions in Table 9.\n1.78B\n3.00B\n7.05B\n# params\n123.0 ms\n226.0 ms\n550.0 ms\n586.0 ms\n1005.0 ms\n2235.0 ms\nw/ greedy search\nw/ one-shot sampling\nGeneration Efficiency. We combine the sampling methods\nwith different decoder sizes to investigate their overall gen-\neration efficiency. As illustrated above, the 1.78B model is\n4.5\u00d7 faster than the 7B version in inference. Further, with\none-shot sampling and truncated language model, our ap-\nproach achieves 18.1\u00d7 speed-up compared to the full model\nwith greedy sampling. The inference time is measured by\nthe average time of generating top-10 labels with one-shot\nsampling and 64 tokens with greedy search per image. The\nmodels run with a batch size of 1 and 16-bit Floating Point,\ni.e., FP16, on an A100 GPU. Attention is without kv-cache.\nNon-causal Masking. In Section 3.3, the non-causal mask-\ning considers two aspects: a) prefixing image embeddings\n7\nXv in the input sequence, and b) decoupling tokens from\ndifferent labels to be independent. The first ablation is to\nun-prefix the image embeddings as a sequential input. Table\n6 shows that the prefixing is beneficial for the performance,\nespecially with the sequential sampling strategy, i.e., greedy\nsearch. For the one-shot sampling, the prefixing helps with\na slight improvement on COCO.\nThe second ablation is to model tokens conditionally from\ndifferent labels, also shown in Table 6. Independent model-\ning is able to also provide marginal performance improve-\nment with both greedy search and one-shot sampling, even\nthough it provides significant gains in efficiency due to the\nparallelized decoding of all object labels.\nCC3M\nCOCO\nOpenImages\nmodeling\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\ngreedy search\nbaseline\n0.662 0.577 0.611 0.602 0.754 0.667 0.539 0.559 0.543\n+ prefix\n0.664 0.580 0.613 0.604 0.759 0.670 0.541 0.563 0.546\n+ indep.\n0.668 0.600 0.625 0.609 0.797 0.688 0.548 0.588 0.561\none-shot sampling\nbaseline\n0.677 0.601 0.630 0.611 0.790 0.687 0.556 0.592 0.567\n+ prefix\n0.678 0.603 0.632 0.613 0.792 0.689 0.557 0.594 0.568\n+ indep.\n0.679 0.602 0.632 0.621 0.802 0.698 0.559 0.593 0.569\nTable 6.

Besides, CLIP [93] has a similar trend, but its\nperformance is much lower than ours. Further, with inflat-\ning its gallery from base to the extended one, CLIP has a\nperformance drop across all datasets, also observed in [19].\nFigure 6. Qualitative results with top-10 predictions.

Appendix\nA.1. Compare with GPT-4V Preview\nSince the GPT-4V(ision) Preview [86] is also able to gener-\nate object labels for images, we compare our method with it\nfor the recognition task. The API parameters for the GPT-\n4V Preview [86] are: input image size is 2562, temperature\nis zero for deterministic predictions, and detail is low with\nsampling 65 output tokens. The model version from API is\ngpt-4-1106-vision-preview. We prompt it to gener-\nate ten main object labels as its top-10 predictions with the\nfollowing instruction:\nthe instruction for OpenAI GPT-4-vision-preview API5\nDescribe every detail in the image by listing ten main object labels. The\nanswer should only contain the object labels separated by a comma, for\nexample, \u201ccar, airplane, dog\u201d.\nDue to the API request limit, we are able to evaluate it on\na subset of the COCO validation split, which contains 4359\nout of 5000 images in total. We compare various methods in\nTable A.1 with top-10 predictions, showing that our method\nperforms better than the GPT-4V Preview [86] across all\nmetrics, and the GPT-4V Preview has the second-highest\nR. The PR-curves are illustrated in Figure A.1, indicating\nthat our method has a better P/R trade-off. Since GPT-4V\nPreview consistently generates ten labels for each image, its\nP is also low compared to Flamingoopen and InstructBLIP.\nCOCO\nmethod\nprompt\nR\nP\nF1\nCLIP [93]\n-\n0.525 0.562 0.540\nFlamingoopen [3] w/ MPT [111]\nlist\n0.556 0.794 0.647\nInstructBLIP [22]\nlist\n0.613 0.897 0.725\nGPT-4V Preview [86]\ninstruct 0.625 0.601 0.610\nOurs\n-\n0.765 0.756 0.758\nTable A.1.

As we mentioned in Section 3.3, the ref-\nerence labels extracted from the raw captions are imperfect\nand incomplete. To verify that our method generalizes well\nto predict plausible labels, we conduct a cross-validation\non the COCO validation subset, treating the GPT-4V Pre-\nview\u2019s predictions as reference labels to evaluate others. Ta-\nble A.2 demonstrates that our method consistently matches\nthe performance across all metrics as presented in Table 1,\nin which our method ranks first in R and F1. Again, the\nlower P for our method is due to the fact that our model\npredicts the required number of labels, while others with a\nhigher P presumably predict less than ten labels.

Ranking Predictions\nWe ablate ranking strategies for the predictions produced by\nour model. Given an image, our model generates K labels\nL = {L1, . . . , LK}. Each label Lk has Tk + 1 tokens,\nincluding the special token [SEP] for the delimiter.\nRanking by CLIP Score. The first strategy is to rank the\npredictions by the CLIP score:\nclip(Lk) = fCLIP(image, label Lk),\n(A.1)\nwhere fCLIP is the CLIP model [93] with the image encoder\nof ViT-L/14 and the language encoder. The CLIP score is\nbased on cosine distance in the embedding space.\nRanking by Probability. The second strategy is to rank the\npredictions by their probabilities in Eq. 6:\nprob(Lk) =\nTk+1\nY\nt=1\nP(wk\nt |wk\n<t, X),\n(A.2)\nin which the probability of each label is the product of the\nindividual probabilities of its tokens, including the delimiter\ntoken [SEP]. If greedy and beam search sample a particular\nlabel multiple times, we sum up the probabilities as its final\nprobability.\n13\nRanking by Perplexity. The third one is to rank the predic-\ntions by their perplexities. The perplexity is computed with\nthe fixed length Tk + 1 for each label:\nppl(Lk) = exp\n\"\n\u2212\n1\nTk + 1\nTk+1\nX\nt=1\nlog P(wk\nt |wk\n<t, X)\n#\n.\n(A.3)\nIf the greedy and beam search sample a particular label mul-\ntiple times, we use its minimum perplexity to ensure opti-\nmal selection and accuracy.\nRanking by Cross-Modal Similarity Score. The last one\nis to rank predictions by their cross-modal similarity scores,\ncomputed with the image and label token embeddings:\nsim(Lk) = 1\nTk\nTk\nX\nt=1\nd(wk\nt , Xv),\n(A.4)\nwhere d is the euclidean distance averaged over all the im-\nage token embeddings for each label token embedding wk\nt :\nd(wk\nt , Xv) = 1\nM\nM\nX\ni=1\ns\n2 \u2212 2 \u00b7\nwk\nt \u00b7 xv\ni\n\r\rwk\nt\n\r\r\n2 \u00b7 \u2225xv\ni\u22252\n,\n(A.5)\nwhere M is the number of image tokens. This similarity is\nalso called compatibility score to measure the compatibility\nbetween image and label embeddings, which motivates us\nto select the predictions that are compatible with the corre-\nsponding images. In other words, the closer the label token\nembeddings are to the image token embeddings, the more\nlikely the label is the correct prediction.\nResults. Table A.3 compares the above four ranking strate-\ngies using top-5 predictions across different sampling meth-\nods for our 1.78B model trained on G3M. The greedy and 3-\nway beam search samples 64 tokens for each image. Since\none-shot sampling yields ordered predictions, we sample 10\nlabels per image and utilize ranking strategies to select the\nfinal top-5 predictions.\nThe overall best ranking strategy is using probability for\ngreedy search and one-shot sampling, and using CLIP score\nfor beam search. For R, one-shot sampling with probability\nranks first on CC3M and COCO, and the greedy search with\nprobability leads on OpenImages. The greedy search with\nprobability has a slightly higher P than one-shot sampling\nwith probability, but the latter has a better overall F1.\nFor greedy search, the compatibility score has the same per-\nformance as the perplexity. For one-shot sampling, the com-\npatibility score is better than the perplexity. Without a rank-\ning strategy, one-shot sampling matches the performance of\nprobability-based ranking, showing its effectiveness in us-\ning top-k initial tokens to decide the final top-k predictions.\nNo ranking strategy outperforms the CLIP score for both\ngreedy and beam search, yet we apply CLIP score to other\nmodels like Flamingo, BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA.\ngreedy\nbeam\none-shot\nranking\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nCC3M\n-\n0.661 0.604 0.624 0.641 0.590 0.608 0.673 0.598 0.627\nclip\n0.646 0.604 0.617 0.630 0.594 0.605 0.643 0.588 0.608\nprob\n0.659 0.602 0.622\n-\n-\n-\n0.673 0.598 0.627\nppl\n0.614 0.563 0.581\n-\n-\n-\n0.509 0.466 0.484\nsim\n0.611 0.564 0.581 0.598 0.557 0.571 0.594 0.531 0.556\nCOCO\n-\n0.606 0.802 0.687 0.585 0.772 0.663 0.618 0.799 0.695\nclip\n0.590 0.792 0.673 0.573 0.772 0.654 0.592 0.773 0.668\nprob\n0.603 0.796 0.683\n-\n-\n-\n0.619 0.800 0.695\nppl\n0.578 0.748 0.649\n-\n-\n-\n0.528 0.640 0.577\nsim\n0.576 0.747 0.647 0.552 0.724 0.623 0.576 0.717 0.637\nOpenImages\n-\n0.549 0.599 0.565 0.530 0.577 0.546 0.560 0.595 0.570\nclip\n0.540 0.598 0.560 0.525 0.580 0.544 0.543 0.591 0.559\nprob\n0.580 0.576 0.569\n-\n-\n-\n0.562 0.597 0.572\nppl\n0.577 0.571 0.565\n-\n-\n-\n0.495 0.505 0.496\nsim\n0.575 0.571 0.564 0.509 0.553 0.524 0.527 0.547 0.532\nTable A.3.

Because\nit saturates at top-10, we only report its top-5 comparison.\nThe results are shown in Table A.4, showing that the CLIP\nscore is the optimal ranking strategy for those models.\nA.3. Additional Results\nIn this section, we present additional results, mainly with\ntop-10 predictions, for ablation studies.\nAblation on Truncating the Decoder. We compare the re-\nsults of different truncating sizes of the language decoder\nwith top-10 predictions in Table A.5.\nThere is a small\nperformance drop, 0.745 \u2192 0.738 in R on CC3M, with\ntruncating the decoder from 3B to 1.78B, while the perfor-\nmances on COCO and OpenImages remain the same.\nAblation on Sampling Methods. We compare sampling\nmethods, i.e., greedy search, 3-way beam search, and one-\nshot sampling, with top-10 predictions in Table A.6. The\nresults, consistent with those in Table 5, indicate that one-\nshot sampling surpasses greedy and beam search in R and\n14\nF1 scores but falls short in P when considering top-10 pre-\ndictions. The reason is that greedy and beam search pro-\nduce \u223c7 labels average per image in top-10 due to the rep-\netition issue. Figure A.2 (right side) demonstrates satura-\ntion around k = 7, accounting for their higher P in top-\n10 predictions. This ablation study shows that greedy and\nbeam search do not produce more diverse predictions with\nincreasing number of tokens.\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nrecall\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nprecision\n0.0\n0.3\n0.5\n1.0\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nrecall\n0.6\n0.7\nprecision\nk = 1\nk = 3\nk = 5\nk = 7\nk = 10\none-shot sampling\ngreedy search\nbeam search\nFigure A.2.

Table A.7 compares the\nresults of different LLaMA versions for the language de-\ncoder with top-10 predictions. The top-10 results are con-\nsistent with Table 7, showing LLaMA 2 is slightly better\nthan LLaMA 1 on G3M, and comparable on G70M.\nAblation on Embedding Models in Evaluation Metric.\nThe evaluation metric is based on embedding models to\ncompute the similarity Sij in Eq. 7. To verify the robustness\nof our method, we compare the results using CLIP ViT-L/14\n[93] as the metric embedding model in Table A.8. Our re-\nsults are from the 1.78B model trained on G70M, and the\nothers are from the best settings in Table 1. Our method\nconsistently outperforms others in R and F1 scores, and is\ncompetitive in P.\nAblation on Training Epochs. We conduct an ablation\nstudy on training epochs for our 1.78B model on G3M. Ta-\nble A.9 shows the results with top-10 predictions, indicating\nthat training more epochs improves the performance.\nAdditional Main Results. Table A.10 shows the main re-\nsults with top-5 predictions, consistent with those in Table\n1. The performance drop on CC3M for models trained on\nG3M versus G70M stems from a data distribution shift.\nA.4. Evaluation Metric\nThe recall in evaluation metric Eq. 8 essentially represents\nthe top-k accuracy, which is for recognition tasks [99].\nFor an image, ground-truth (GT) labels are G = {gi}M\ni=1,\nordered model predictions are P = {pj}N\nj=1.

For example, the word\n\u201cdogs\u201d is lemmatized to \u201cdog\u201d.\nWith this preprocessing, we obtain a set of meaningful noun\nwords for each image and summarize the information in\nthe following table, including the number of image-caption\npairs and distinct nouns.\nCC3M\nCOCO\nSBU\nOpenImages LAION\nstatistics\ntrain\nval\ntrain\nval\ntrain\nval\ntrain\n# images 2.69M 12478 118287 5000 828816\n41686\n67M\n# nouns\n22890\n4875\n15444 3834 132372\n3119\n2.7M\nThe training split contains 2,794,419 distinct nouns, while\nall validation splits have a total of 8,637 distinct nouns. The\n16\nnumber of overlapping nouns between the training and val-\nidation splits is 8,347, which is 97.8% of distinct nouns in\nvalidation splits.\nA.6. Prompt Settings\nFor training, we adopt the prompt augmentation, which con-\ntains different prompt templates but with the same semantic\nmeaning. In each training iteration, we randomly select one\nprompt from those templates for the batched images. For in-\nference, we only use one simple prompt in all experiments.\nThe prompt templates are listed as follows.\nsetting\nprompt templates\ntraining\nThe objects in the image are\nThe items present in the picture are\nThe elements depicted in the image are\nThe objects shown in the photograph are\nThe items visible in the image are\nThe objects that appear in the picture are\nThe elements featured in the image are\nThe items captured in the photograph are\nThe elements seen in the picture are\nThe items represented in the image are\ninference\nThe objects in the image are\nFor comparison, we evaluate chat-based VQA models, i.e.,\nBLIP-2 [65], InstructBLIP [22], and LLaVA [68, 69], with\ntwo types of prompt, which are\n1) text completion: The objects in the image are,\n2) and VQA: Describe every detail in the image.\nWe refer to the text completion prompt as prompt: list and\nthe VQA prompt as prompt: caption. After obtaining model\noutputs, we apply the rule from Section A.5 to extract nouns\nas predicted labels.\nEspecially, Flamingo [1, 3] has a unique prompt setting\nwith few-shot instruction. For the caption type, we change\nthe prompt setting to What objects are in the image?.\nThen we construct the prompt with 4-shot samples as in [1],\nwhich is listed as the following tables.\nthe list prompt type with few-shot samples for Flamingo\n<image>The objects in the image are boy, bush, chair, clothes,\ngrass, house, tree, sports ball.<|endofchunk|> <image>The\nobjects in the image are bus, car, clouds, house, leaves, person,\nroad.<|endofchunk|> <image>The objects in the image are\ngiraffe, grass, tree.<|endofchunk|> <image>The objects in the\nimage are cat, telecontroller, sofa.<|endofchunk|> <image>The\nobjects in the image are\nthe reference images as few-shot samples for Flamingo\nCC3M\nCOCO\nOpenImages\n# tokens\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nR\nP\nF1\nprompt: list\n64\n0.542 0.556 0.540 0.482 0.842 0.606 0.455 0.622 0.518\n128\n0.544 0.557 0.542 0.494 0.871 0.623 0.476 0.641 0.538\n256\n0.542 0.556 0.540 0.482 0.842 0.606 0.455 0.622 0.518\nprompt: caption\n64\n0.601 0.539 0.561 0.600 0.893 0.714 0.523 0.626 0.562\n128\n0.609 0.539 0.561 0.600 0.893 0.714 0.523 0.626 0.562\n256\n0.600 0.539 0.560 0.601 0.894 0.714 0.512 0.643 0.562\nTable A.11.

Different number of sampling tokens for Instruct-\nBLIP with top-10 predictions.\nA.7. Number of Sampling Tokens in Comparison\nWe have various models to compare with ours. For a fair\ncomparison, we need to take care of the maximum number\nof sampling tokens for each model to make sure that we\ncan extract enough potential nouns words from their out-\nputs. LLaVA [68, 69] has a maximum number of sampling\ntokens of 1024, which is already enough for the task. BLIP-\n2 [65] has a maximum 32 in default, but we change it to 64\nfor top-5 and 128 for top-10. To verify this setting is fair for\nBLIP-2, we ablate the number of sampling tokens for BLIP-\n2 with the caption prompt in Table A.11. For InstructBLIP\n[22], we use its default number of sampling tokens, which is\n256 for top-5 and top-10. To verify the setting, we ablate the\nnumber of sampling tokens for InstructBLIP in Table A.12.\nDue to Flamingo [1, 3] has the same output format as ours,\nwe keep the same maximum number of sampling tokens for\nit as ours for greedy search, i.e., 64 for top-5. We double the\nnumber to 128 for its top-10 predictions. For VQA meth-\nods, sampling more tokens for more potential predictions\nsignificantly increases time cost, esp. with beam search.\nA.8. Visualizing Predictions\nWe visualize the top-10 predictions from our 1.78B model\ntrained on G70M in Figure A.3-A.9 without cherry-picking.\nThe image is paired with two columns: our predictions on\nthe left, probability-indicating ranking bars on the right.\nThe images sampled from COCO have gray column to show\nGPT-4V Preview\u2019s [86] predictions, intuitively illustraing\nthe strengths and weaknesses of our method with the apples-\nto-apples comparison.\n17\nA.9. Discussion\nIn this section, we discuss the limitations of our method and\nexperiments that we have tried but does not work well.\nLess Is More. Our method\u2019s performance heavily relies on\nthe quality of the training data. More noisy data will hurt\nthe performance, for example, models trained on the nois-\nier CC12M [12] underperform compared to those trained on\nCC3M [104]. Moreover, high quality requires more human\nefforts, which is expensive, meaning to densely annotate all\npossible labels for each image. We might consider using\nGPT-4V [86] for generating high-quality labels, though it\nmay be costly (API expenses) and subject to the hallucina-\ntion issue. Exploring methods to train models with fewer\nlabels for broader generalization could be intriguing.\nDefining Labels. How to define the label for describing an\nobject in an image? A label could be a word, which is used\nin this paper, but also could be a phrase or a sentence. We\nhave tried to define the label with the noun phrase, which in-\ncludes an adjective, for example, \u201cgray car\u201d and \u201ccute boy\u201d.\nHowever, these models underperformed, partly due to poor\ntraining data quality and the limitations of the parser for ex-\ntracting noun phrases from captions. We also experimented\nwith concrete nouns for training, but the results were un-\nsatisfactory due to noisy reference labels produced by the\nparser, which needs a comprehensive filter to remove noise.\nEvaluation.\nFirst, our evaluation has limitations due to\nthe incomplete and imperfect nature of reference labels de-\nrived from raw captions. Second, we calculate P, R and F1\nscore based on the semantic similarity between the embed-\ndings of predicted and reference labels from a pretrained\nlanguage model. However, such a model-based semantic\nsimilarity brings noise and bias to the evaluation results due\nto the model imperfection. This motivates us to conduct the\ncross-validation experiments in Section A.1, which views\nGPT-4V\u2019s [86] predictions as reference labels. Develop-\ning a reliable evaluation metric beyond human evaluation\nor model-based semantic similarity is an interesting topic.\nFine-Grained Recognition. Our method, though not de-\nsigned for fine-grained recognition, could be adapted for\nsuch tasks. Currently, the method underperforms in this\narea due to the use of general, rather than fine-grained, train-\ning data. Improving performance may be possible by using\nmore specific, fine-grained training data, which circles back\nto the initial question regarding the quality of training data.\nSingle-Label Prediction. Our method is optimized for top-\nk predictions and exhibits lower performance in top-1 ac-\ncuracy evaluations. Our approach encourages the model to\npredict multiple labels for an image, which is more realis-\ntic than predicting just one label because images generally\ncontain multiple objects. Therefore, we do not focus on im-\nproving top-1 accuracy in this paper.\nCompetition Issue. We acknowledge the inherent compet-\nitive issue in our one-shot sampling, similar to the repeti-\ntion issue observed in sequence-based methods like greedy\nand beam search. However, its results are still promising\nin experiments, which is likely due to redundant tokeniza-\ntion. Mitigating or analyzing the competition issue for the\none-shot sampling could be our future research topic.\nA.10. Other Related Works\nApproaching object recognition as a natural language pre-\ndiction, pioneered by [4, 31, 85], has been proposed be-\nfore the deep learning era [63]. The motivation is primarily\nto assist journalists in annotating images for retrieval pur-\nposes [5, 79]. [85] slices an image into regions and predicts\nwords using probabilistic models. [31] views recognition as\na machine translation problem, aligning image regions with\nwords using a lexicon, optimized by the EM algorithm [24].\nImage Annotation and Multi-label Prediction. The evo-\nlution of image annotation or tagging closely mirrors that of\nmulti-label prediction. Initial approaches develop on topic\nmodels [53] like latent Dirichlet allocation [5] and proba-\nbilistic latent semantic analysis [49, 84]. Mixture models\n[32, 52, 62] have also been explored to model the joint dis-\ntributions over images and tags. Then SVM-based discrim-\ninative models [21, 47, 54] are proposed to predict tags.\nLater, the annotation task is treated as a retrieval problem\n[39, 76] based on nearest neighbors [20] or joint optimiza-\ntion [13]. The difficulty of collecting multi-label annota-\ntions inspires curriculum learning-based models [18, 30]\nand semi-supervised methods [33, 101, 107]. Now models\nwith ranking-based losses [37] and transformer-based archi-\ntecture [51, 71, 98, 125] are introduced for tagging images,\nbut they are still closed-set recognition models trained on\nheavily-annotated/cleaned datasets. In contrast, our method\nis an open-set recognition model trained on raw data, which\nis at the real open-level with a large-scale prediction capa-\nbility (top-100). In the figure below, our model correctly\npredicts the wild terms like Nintendo, Mario, and Switch,\nwhile [125] does not.\nRecognize Anything [122]\nOur Top-20 Predictions\n| prob: 0.15203 - coffee \n| prob: 0.09728 - shop \n| prob: 0.09182 - counter \n| prob: 0.03848 - interior \n| prob: 0.03389 - bar \n| prob: 0.03215 - restaurant \n| prob: 0.02440 - table\nbar stool | bulletin board | canteen | ceiling | chair | coffee shop | table | restaurant | \ufb02oor | retail | stool | store\n| prob: 0.02245 - store \n| prob: 0.01950 - area \n| prob: 0.01905 - inside \n| prob: 0.01590 - starbucks \n| prob: 0.01313 - cafe \n| prob: 0.01220 - chair \n| prob: 0.01172 - \ufb02oor\n| prob: 0.01020 - cup \n| prob: 0.00879 - drink \n| prob: 0.00794 - room \n| prob: 0.00746 - customer \n| prob: 0.00635 - wood \n| prob: 0.00345 - bakery\nRecognize Anything [125]\nOur Top-20 Predictions\n| prob: 0.07281 - tablet \n| prob: 0.06749 - coffee \n| prob: 0.06593 - window \n| prob: 0.05811 - controller \n| prob: 0.05653 - game \n| prob: 0.04788 - switch \n| prob: 0.04065 - wii\ncoffee | coffee cup | computer | control | cup | table | electronic | gadget | game | game controller | \nipad | joystick | laptop | mug | tablet | pine cone | remote | sit | tablet computer | window | window sill\n| prob: 0.03786 - console \n| prob: 0.03552 - cup \n| prob: 0.02562 - top \n| prob: 0.02060 - mug \n| prob: 0.01817 - screen \n| prob: 0.01339 - video \n| prob: 0.01111 - star\n| prob: 0.01088 - nintendo \n| prob: 0.01051 - computer \n| prob: 0.00823 - mario \n| prob: 0.00819 - remote \n| prob: 0.00734 - control \n| prob: 0.00713 - sill \n| prob: 0.00393 - desk\nA.11.

    "text": "GIVT: Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformers\nMichael Tschannen1\nCian Eastwood1,\u2217\nFabian Mentzer2,\u25e6\n1Google DeepMind\n2Google Research\nAbstract\nWe introduce generative infinite-vocabulary transform-\ners (GIVT) which generate vector sequences with real-\nvalued entries, instead of discrete tokens from a finite vo-\ncabulary. To this end, we propose two surprisingly simple\nmodifications to decoder-only transformers: 1) at the in-\nput, we replace the finite-vocabulary lookup table with a\nlinear projection of the input vectors; and 2) at the output,\nwe replace the logits prediction (usually mapped to a cate-\ngorical distribution) with the parameters of a multivariate\nGaussian mixture model. Inspired by the image-generation\nparadigm of VQ-GAN and MaskGIT, where transformers\nare used to model the discrete latent sequences of a VQ-\nVAE, we use GIVT to model the unquantized real-valued\nlatent sequences of a VAE. When applying GIVT to class-\nconditional image generation with iterative masked model-\ning, we show competitive results with MaskGIT, while our\napproach outperforms both VQ-GAN and MaskGIT when\nusing it for causal modeling. Finally, we obtain competitive\nresults outside of image generation when applying our ap-\nproach to panoptic segmentation and depth estimation with\na VAE-based variant of the UViM framework.\n1. Introduction\nAfter becoming the dominant architecture in natural lan-\nguage processing shortly after their introduction, Trans-\nformers [67] have also recently become very popular in\ncomputer vision [16, 37, 57]. Dosovitskiy et al. [16] showed\nthat by splitting images into sequences of patches, linearly\nembedding those patches, and then feeding the resulting se-\nquence of features to a transformer encoder leads to power-\nful image classifiers that outperform CNN-based architec-\ntures at large model and data scale. This strategy is now\nstandard for many discriminative vision task including clas-\nsification [16], detection [37], and segmentation [57].\nHowever, mapping an image to a sequence of (unquan-\ntized) feature vectors is not suitable for transformer-based\nimage generation since generative transformers decoders\n\u2217Work done as a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind.\n\u25e6Significant technical contributions.\nQuantized\nTransformer\nOur\nGIVT\nT\nT\nLookup\nLinear\nTokens in \nTokens in \nLookup Table\nEmbed via Linear\nCausal\nTransformer\nCausal\nTransformer\nCategorical\n Distribution\nContinuous\nDistribution\n94\n6\n42\nFigure 1.\nWe compare the standard discrete-token generative\ntransformer (left) to our continuous, infinite-vocabulary variant\n(GIVT, right), using the same decoder-only architecture.

Such a structure naturally fits natural language,\nfor which decoder-only models enable powerful sequential\ngenerative modeling and efficient training via teacher forc-\ning [47, 67]. To harness these capabilities for images, re-\ncent works [6, 7, 18, 36, 43] have employed a two-stage\napproach which first learns a Vector-Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (VQ-VAE) [66] to map images to a sequence\nof discrete tokens, and then learns a transformer decoder to\nmodel the latent discrete-token distribution. Another advan-\ntage of such VQ-VAE-based image tokenization is that it\nenables interleaved multimodal generative models, simply\nby concatenating the vocabularies of the different modali-\nties including text and images [1, 2, 26].\nWhile this two-stage approach was successfully applied\nto image and multimodal generation, it has several issues.\nThe vocabulary size in VQ-VAE determines how much in-\nformation can be stored in the latent code sequence, and\nhow much of the visual modeling is done by the VQ-VAE\ndecoder. Having a small vocabulary can make the latent\nmodeling easier but also makes the latent code less infor-\nmative, which prevents control of the low-level details in\n1\narXiv:2312.02116v2  [cs.CV]  18 Jan 2024\nFigure 2. Selected samples from the GIVT-Causal for 10 ImageNet classes (130, 130, 138, 144, 933, 145, 360, 207, 829, 248).\nimage generation, and impacts quality when using the to-\nkens for dense prediction [30, 39] or low-level discrimina-\ntive tasks [1, 26]. To mitigate this issue, the vocabulary size\ncan be increased, which, however, can lead to low vocab-\nulary utilization [43] so that high-fidelity VQ-VAE setups\nrely on a range of advanced techniques, such as entropy\nlosses [6] or codebook-splitting [30]. Furthermore, large\nvocabularies lead to correspondingly large embedding ma-\ntrices consuming a lot of memory, which can be an issue\nparticularly in multimodal contexts with vocabularies com-\nbined across modalities.\nTo avoid these issues, we propose a modification to\ndecoder-only transformers which removes the need for dis-\ncrete tokens and therefore fixed, finite vocabularies. Specif-\nically, we propose\u2014to our knowledge for the first time\u2014\na generative transformer decoder which operates on se-\nquences of real-valued vectors. As real-valued vectors can\nbe seen as an infinite vocabulary, we call this a Genera-\ntive Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT). We make two\nminimal changes compared to the standard transformer de-\ncoder architecture [47, 67], see Fig. 1: 1) at the input, rather\nthan using a sequence of discrete tokens to look up a fi-\nnite vocabulary of embeddings, we linearly embed a se-\nquence of real-valued vectors; and 2) at the output, rather\nthan predicting the parameters of a categorical distribution\nover a finite vocabulary (via logits), we predict the parame-\nters of a continuous distribution over real-valued vectors.\nWe train this model in the same way as standard trans-\nformer decoders: with a causal attention mask and teacher\nforcing [67], and alternatively also explore fast progressive\nmasked-bidirectional-modelling as in MaskGIT [6, 7, 12].\nWhile GIVT can, in principle, be applied to any se-\nquence of feature vectors, it can be challenging to di-\nrectly model sequences that are prohibitively long or fol-\nlow a complex distribution (e.g., the sequence of RGB pix-\nels obtained by flattening a high-resolution image). There-\nfore, similar to the two-stage approach with VQ-VAEs and\nanalogous the two-stage approach of latent-diffusion mod-\nels [46, 50], we first learn a lower-dimensional latent space\nwith a Gaussian-prior VAE, and then model it with GIVT.\nAdditionally, we port various inference schemes from\nthe sequence-modeling literature (e.g., temperature sam-\npling, classifier-free guidance). Surprisingly, this leads to\na model which is comparable to or better than VQ-based\napproaches, by purely relying on real-valued tokens.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. We show that GIVT matches or outperforms the standard\ndiscrete-token transformer decoder on both image gener-\nation and dense prediction tasks like semantic segmenta-\ntion and monocular depth estimation (via UViM [30]).\n2. We derive variants of standard sampling techniques for\nthe continuous case, such as temperature sampling, beam\nsearch, and classifier-free guidance (CFG, [23]), and\ndemonstrate their effectiveness.\n3. We study the relationship between the degree of VAE\nlatent-space regularization (via KL-term weighting [22,\n27]) and the resulting properties of GIVT.\nWe emphasize that the VAE and GIVT training only relies\non standard techniques from the deep-learning toolbox, and\nnot the advanced training techniques of the VQ-VAE litera-\nture like auxiliary losses [6, 66] on the latent representation,\ncodebook reinitialization [34], or dedicated optimization al-\ngorithms [25, 30].\n2.

No component uses a quantizer.\n65] for image generation, moving the autorgressive model-\ning to the latent space of VQ-VAEs [49, 66] emerged as a\nmore efficient alternative. The use of GANs and perceptual\nlosses for VQ-VAE training as well as modern causal [18,\n68, 72] and masked [6, 7, 36] transformers for latent model-\ning led to substantial quality improvements. Another active\narea leveraging VQ-VAEs is interleaved multimodal gen-\nerative modeling of images and text [1, 2, 26]. Further,\nVQ-VAEs are a popular choice to tokenize the label space\nof dense prediction vision tasks [30, 39].\nFinally, some\nlanguage-inspired techniques for self-supervised learning\nfrom images rely on VQ-VAE representations [3, 36, 70].\nDiscretized mixtures of distributions\nreplace the dense\nprediction of the logits of a categorical distribution with\na continuous mixture model which is subsequently dis-\ncretized.\nThis approach was proposed in [53] for pixel-\nspace autoregressive modeling, to reduce the number of\nmodel parameters and to improve learning efficiency, and\nis also popular in neural compression [10, 41, 42].\nContinuous outputs in NLP\nA popular approach to han-\ndle large vocabularies in machine translation is to predict\nlanguage tokens via their word embeddings with a contin-\nuous distribution, instead of token IDs with a categorical\ndistribution [31, 32, 35, 58, 59]. Decoding is usually done\nin greedy fashion with embedding lookup and hence does\nnot produce diverse samples. Further, the models consume\nand predict word embeddings form a fixed, finite set.\nVAEs with learned priors\nA rich body of literature stud-\nies improving VAEs with learned priors: Inverse autoregres-\nsive flows emerged as a popular choice [9, 28]. Other ap-\nproaches are based on normalizing flows [63] or a mixture\nof variational posteriors with pseudo-inputs [60]. For VAEs\nwith discrete (non-VQ) latents, learned priors based on Re-\nstricted Boltzmann Machines were studied [51, 64].\nTime-series modeling with Transformers\nA variety of\nworks has recently explored transformers for time-series\nmodeling/forecasting. Those works either use a regression\nloss [11, 20, 33, 45, 74], quantile forecasting [17, 38], or\nresort to discretizing/binning the data [48]. Somewhat re-\nlated, [44, 69] regress continuous speech features from dis-\ncrete tokens. None of these models predict a continuous\ndistribution like GIVT that allows for autoregressive gener-\nation.\n3. Generative infinite-vocabulary transformers\nAs mentioned in Sec. 1, our method is conceptually similar\nto recent works that train decoder-only transformer models\non the discrete codes of VQ-VAEs [6, 7, 18, 71], with the\ncrucial difference being that we do not quantize (i.e., do not\nuse VQ). We now describe the components of our method.\n3.1. VAE training\nWe first train a continuous \u03b2-VAE [22] with Gaussian en-\ncoder and prior as originally proposed by [27]. Given an\ninput image x, the encoder E predicts mean \u00b5, and variance\n\u03c3 of a multivariate normal distribution with diagonal covari-\nance matrix, and samples a representation z from N(\u00b5, \u03c3)\nusing the reparameterization trick [27]. The VAE decoder\nthen maps the latent sequence back to an image. Since we\nuse a Gaussian encoder distribution, the KL-term in the evi-\ndence lower bound (ELBO) [27] can be computed in closed\nform as described in [27, Sec. F.1]. As for the reconstruc-\ntion/likelihood term in the ELBO, we rely on a mixture of\nMSE, perceptual loss and GAN loss for image generation\nfollowing [6, 18], or the categorical cross-entropy for dense\nprediction tasks [30]. Our encoder spatially-downsamples\nx, whereby we obtain a z with spatial dimensions h\u00d7w and\nfeature dimension d, with h=\u2308H/16\u2309, w=\u2308W/16\u2309, given a\nH\u00d7W input x.\nThe hyperparameter \u03b2 multiplying the KL-term controls\nhow strongly z is regularized. As we shall see in Sec. 5, this\nregularization of the VAE is important to be able to model\nthe resulting (true) latent distribution p(z) well.\n3.2. GIVT training\nWe next train a GIVT to predict p(z) or p(z|c) (when a\nconditioning signal c is available, e.g., in class-conditional\ngeneration). We flatten z into a hw-length sequence of d-\ndimensional real-valued vectors (or \u201csoft tokens\u201d). Note\nhow this differs from the standard VQ-VAE-based setup,\nwhere the latent transformer decoder models a hw-length\nsequence of integers denoting codebook indices.\nApart\nfrom this change, we only perform two small changes to the\nstandard transformer decoder-only architecture (see Fig. 1):\n3\nModel\nInference\nSteps\nFID\u2193\nPrecision\u2191\nRecall\u2191\nGANs\nBigGAN-deep [5]\n6.95\n0.87\n0.28\nStyleGAN-XL [54]\n2.30\n0.78\n0.53\nDiffusion\nADM [13]\n250\n10.94\n0.69\n0.63\nModels\nADM-G [13]\nCG = 1.0\n250\n4.59\n0.82\n0.52\nDiT-XL/2 [46]\n250\n9.62\n0.67\n0.67\nDiT-XL/2-G [46]\nCFG = 1.50\n250\n2.27\n0.83\n0.57\nSequence\nVQGAN [18]\nTop-k = Mixed\n256\u22c6\n17.04\nModels\nVQGAN [18]\nTop-k = 600, CG = 0.05\n256\u22c6\n5.20\nMaskGIT [6]\ntC = 4.5\n16\n4.92\u2020\n0.84\u2020\n0.49\u2020\nMaskGIT [43]\ntC = 4.5, CFG = 0.1\n16\n4.51\n0.86\n0.47\nGIVT-Causal (Ours)\n256\u22c6\n12.64\n0.71\n0.58\nGIVT-Causal (Ours)\nBeam = 8/1\n256\u22c6\n6.91\n0.75\n0.56\nGIVT-Causal (Ours)\nt = 0.95\n256\u22c6\n9.18\n0.73\n0.58\nGIVT-Causal (Ours)\nt = 0.95, DB-CFG = 0.5\n256\u22c6\n4.29\n0.83\n0.50\nGIVT-MaskGIT (Ours)\n16\n7.52\n0.79\n0.51\nGIVT-MaskGIT (Ours)\ntC = 16, DB-CFG = 0.2\n16\n5.57\n0.86\n0.45\nTable 1.

Additional comments: \u2020Numbers obtained by us from public code, \u22c6Inference uses activation caching.\nWe replace the embedding lookup tables at the input with\na single linear layer to project from d to the transformer\nhidden dimension. At the output, we do not predict a cate-\ngorical distribution, and instead let the transformer predict\nthe parameters of a continuous distribution.\nAssuming channel-wise independence, we can model\neach of the d entries with a k-mixture GMM. The GIVT\nmodel then predicts 3dk parameters (dk means, scales, and\nmixture probabilities) that we interpret as d scalar GMMs.\nExperimentally, we found it beneficial to normalize the\nmixture probabilities with a softmax activation, and the\nvariance parameters with softplus.\nWe use the standard cross-entropy loss (which is equiva-\nlent to the negative log-likelihood) on the distribution \u02dcp pre-\ndicted by GIVT, and minimize LT = P\nc Ez [\u2212 log \u02dcp(z|c)],\nassuming the the classes or conditioning signal c uniformly\ndistributed (see Appendix A.1 for details on the loss). We\ntrain two types of GIVT models, as described next.\nGIVT-Causal\nHere, z is flattened into a sequence line-\nby-line, and the GIVT predicts every d-dimensional vector\nin the sequence conditioned on all previous vectors, mask-\ning the self-attention layers to be causal [18, 67].\nThis\ntraining strategy is also called teacher forcing and is anal-\nogous to the latent modeling in VQ-GAN [18]. For class-\nconditional image generation we prepend a [CLS] vector\nto the input sequence, i.e., a learned vector for each class c.\nGIVT-MaskGIT\nHere, as in MaskGIT [6], we mask the\ninput randomly during training and then gradually uncover\nthe masked tokens during inference. The only changes com-\npared to [6] are related to our real-valued tokens: since we\nhave infinitely many tokens, there is no obvious choice to\ndefine a special mask token (when using VQ, one can just\nextend the vocabulary to contain special tokens, such as\n[MASK]). Instead, given z and a mask M indicating for\nevery spatial location whether it is masked, we first replace\nthe locations in z corresponding to M with zeros (to remove\ninformation), and then embed it with a single dense layer,\nas above. Additionally, we concatenate one of two learned\nspecial vectors in the feature dimension, a [MASK] vector\nfor masked locations, and a [UNMASK] vector otherwise\n(we half the dimension of the embedded inputs and special\ntokens s.t. the final hidden dimension remains unchanged).\n3.3. Inference\nGiven a VAE and GIVT trained as above, we run GIVT\nduring inference either causally (see Fig. 3) or as in\nMaskGIT [6]. We now investigate the various inference\nschemes that have been developed for discrete transform-\ners, and derive their continuous counterparts.\n3.3.1\nTemperature Sampling, Nucleus Sampling,\nBeam Search\nIn causal sequence models for text (see [24] for an overview\nand discussion) and VQ-GAN-based approaches, it is com-\n4\n0.00005\n0.00010\n0.00015\n0.00020\nKL Weight \n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nFID\nSampling FID (B model)\nReconstruction FID\nd\n4\n8\n16\n32\nFigure 4. VAE ablation: We vary the KL weight \u03b2 and number\nof channels d when training the VAE. Dashed lines show the sam-\npling FIDs obtained with a Base-size GIVT-Causal. As we in-\ncrease \u03b2, the sampling FID improves, but the reconstruction FID\nincreases, lower bounding the best possible sampling FID. For the\nmain results we use \u03b2 = 0.00005 and d = 16.\nmon to tune the sampling algorithm. We start with temper-\nature sampling, which for discrete models adapts the soft-\nmax temperature of the categorical distributions predicted\nat each decoding step.\nFor GIVT, we instead scale the\nstandard deviation of the predicted Gaussian distribution(s)\nand call this strategy \u201cvariance scaling\u201d. As we will see in\nSec. 4, this simple change can have a significant impact on\nsample quality.\nNucleus sampling [24] proposes to collect the largest\nlogits such that its cumulative probability after normaliza-\ntion exceeds a threshold (for example 0.8), and to sample\nfrom this reduced-support distribution. In GIVT, for a sin-\ngle Gaussian prediction per output dimension, this can be\napproximated by truncating the predicted distributions per\ndimension (thereby choosing a higher-density support). We\nobserved that this has a similar effect to variance scaling\nand therefore do not pursue this strategy.\nWe also consider beam search, which is the same for\nGIVT as it is for discrete transformer decoders. For every\nsample, we maintain B beams, and at every step we sam-\nple a number of candidates for every beam (we call these\n\u201cfans\u201d here). We then compute the cumulative log prob-\nability for all beams and fans up to the current sampling\nstep, and select the B beams with the highest cumulative\nlog probability. Finally, there is no analogous concept for\ntop-k sampling [19] in GIVT, because it predicts continu-\nous distributions.\n3.3.2\nDistribution-Based Classifier Free Guidance\nIn\nthe\ndiffusion\nliterature,\nclassifier-free\nguidance\n(CFG) [23] has been employed with great success.\nConcretely, conditional diffusion models are trained with\nan additional null class \u2205 to learn the unconditional data\ndistribution.\nThen, during inference, the conditional log\ndensity is \u201cmoved away\u201d from the unconditional one: given\np(z|c)\np(z|\n)\npCFG(z|c), w = 0.1\npCFG(z|c), w = 0.5\nFigure 5.\nVisualization of our Density-Based Classifier-Free\nGuidance (DB-CFG). We show the conditional and unconditional\nPDFs predicted by GIVT, and the resulting CFG PDF for two val-\nues of w. Note how the CFG distributions become more peaked.\nWe use rejection sampling to sample from pCFG (see Sec. 3.3.1).\na guidance weight w, the updated (diffusion) score estimate\nis is obtained as\n\u02dc\u03f5(z, c) = (1 + w)\u03f5(z, c) \u2212 w\u03f5(z, \u2205),\n(1)\nwhere \u03f5 estimates the gradient of the log density of the data\ndistribution, \u03f5(z, c) \u221d \u2207z log p(z|c) (see [23, Sec.\n2]).\nFrom this, we now derive a CFG variant for our GIVT,\nsince we directly predict a density. We term this approach\n\u201cDensity-Based CFG\u201d (DB-CFG). Eq. 1 can be written as\n\u02dc\u03f5(z, c) \u221d (1 + w)\u2207z log p(z|c) \u2212 w\u2207z log p(z|\u2205)\n\u221d \u2207z log\n\u0000p(z|c)1+wp(z|\u2205)\u2212w\u0001\n,\ni.e., \u02dc\u03f5 estimates the log of the density pCFG(z|c)\n\u221d\np(z|c)1+wp(z|\u2205)\u2212w (see Fig. 5). Thus, we want to adapt\nour models to sample from pCFG.\nTo this end, we fol-\nlow [23] and train GIVT with an additional null class \u2205.\nDuring inference, we run GIVT twice at every step, once\nconditional on the actual label c and once conditional on \u2205.\nTo implement classifier-free guidance, we then have to sam-\nple from an unnormalized version of pCFG(z) derived from\nthe two GIVT predictions. To this end, we turn to rejec-\ntion sampling, which requires: 1) an unnormalized density;\n2) a good proposal distribution p\u2032, that is close to the true\ntarget distribution; and 3) a scaling factor K to bound the\nlikelihood between p\u2032 and the unnormalized target density.\nIn our setup, the distributions we mix are all Gaus-\nsian. We find empirically that the unconditional distribu-\ntions (i.e., distributions predicted using the \u2205 label) tend to\nhave larger variance than the conditional ones (as visual-\nized in Fig. 5). It is thus sensible to pick sample proposals\nfrom N(\u00b5c, 2\u03c3c), where \u00b5c, \u03c3c are the parameters predicted\nby GIVT when given the label c. We empirically find that\ndrawing 1000 samples is enough to find at least one valid\nsample 99.9% of the time. For the remaining <0.1%, fall\nback to sampling from N(\u00b5c, \u03c3c).\nWe emphasize that the overhead of DB-CFG is small:\nit requires two forward passes (per inference step) instead\n5\nVAE Sample\nStep 1\nStep 4\nStep 8\nStep 16\nFigure 6.\nFirst Column: Two images obtained when sampling from the VAE prior, resulting in a soup of low-level image textures.\nRemaining Columns: Visualizing the output of GIVT-MaskGIT, for two ImageNet classes (947, 94), after 1, 4, 8, 16 inference steps.

Experiments\nWe explore various tasks to show the generality of GIVT.\n4.1. Image generation\nWe use ImageNet and explore class-conditional generation\n(where we condition our GIVT on class labels) for 256px\nand 512px, as well as unconditional generation for 256px.\nVAE\nWe closely follow the setup of MaskGIT [6]. We\nuse their VAE architecture, built of ResBlocks (as detailed\nin App. A; encoder and decoder have a combined 53.5M pa-\nrameters), remove the VQ layer and related losses, and re-\nplace it with a linear layer predicting \u00b5, \u03c3 (Sec. 3.1). We use\nthe same weights for reconstruction, perceptual, and GAN-\nloss, as well as identical optimizer parameters, as in [6, 43];\nwe only vary the latent dimension d and weight \u03b2 of the KL-\nterm. By default, we set the token dimension to 16 (i.e., we\npredict 16 means and variances per token) and \u03b2 = 5\u00b710\u22125.\nGIVT\nFor GIVT-Causal, we follow the original trans-\nformer decoder architecture [67] in decoder-only mode,\nbut remove biases from attention layers, MLP blocks, and\nLayerNorms, and replace ReLU by GELU as is common\npractice. For GIVT-MaskGIT, we simply remove the at-\ntention mask during training and feed masked inputs in-\nstead of shifted ones. Unless otherwise stated, we use the\nBERT-Large configuration [12]. We configure our GIVT\nmodels to predict a single Gaussian distribution by default,\nbut also explore predicting a mixture of 4 distributions per\ndimension, and predicting a multivariate Gaussian mod-\neling the full covariance matrix of the tokens (instead of\nassuming a diagonal covariance matrix).\nFor the condi-\ntional generation experiments, we use a learned embed-\nding which we prepend to the embedded token sequence.\nTo train GIVT, we use the AdaFactor optimizer from [73]\nwith a cosine schedule (500 epochs; with linear warmup\nof 50 epochs), set the learning rate and weight decay to\n10\u22123 and 10\u22124, respectively, the optimizer \u03b22 parameter\nto 0.95, the dropout probability to 0.2 for GIVT-causal and\n0.4 for GIVT-MaskGIT, and the batch size to 8192. We\nuse the same data augmentation as during VAE training (see\n[6, 43]), and sample from the VAE encoder distribution for\nevery batch (an additional source of randomness besides\ndata augmentation).\nWe implement GIVT in JAX [4] and use the JAX version\nof TensorFlow Probability [14] to implement the predicted\ndistributions and compute the log-probabilities. We train\nGIVT-Casual and GIVT-MaskGIT models for 256 \u00d7 256\nImageNet, and GIVT-MaskGIT additionally on 512 \u00d7 512.\nWe note that our VAE is trained on 256 \u00d7 256 images, and\nwe use it also for 512 \u00d7 512 experiments (like [6]).\nGIVT-MaskGIT inference\nWe fix the number of infer-\nence steps to 16 (as in [6]), and explore various inference\nschedules which define how many tokens are uncovered in\neach inference step. We employ the cosine schedule from\nthe paper, as well as various power schedules (i.e. letting\nr = i/16 at step i, the fraction of masked tokens is given\nby cos(\u03c0/2r) for the cosine schedule, and by 1\u2212r\u03b1 for the\n6\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nDB-CFG\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nSampling FID (GIVT-Causal)\nGIVT-Causal, t=1.05\nGIVT-Causal, t=1.0\nGIVT-Causal, t=0.95\nVQGAN\nMaskGIT (VQ)\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\nDB-CFG\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nSampling FID (GIVT-MaskGIT)\nGIVT-MaskGIT, schedule=pow:1.0\nGIVT-MaskGIT, schedule=pow:2.0\nGIVT-MaskGIT, schedule=pow:2.5\nGIVT-MaskGIT, schedule=pow:3.0\nGIVT-MaskGIT, schedule=cosine\nVQGAN\nMaskGIT (VQ)\n4\n8\n12\n16\nMasked Inference Step\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n1.00\nAvg.

Then, we show our\nGIVT-MaskGIT, using different inference schedules, and observe that apart from a linear schedule, all explored schedules achieve similar\nquality.

As in [6], we sort tokens by likelihood\nat each step and sample using a \u201cchoice temperature\u201d tC.\nExploring the VAE latent space\nTo better understand\nthe interplay between the feature dimension, the strength\nof the KL regularization \u03b2, the reconstruction quality of\nthe VAE, and the sampling quality of the GIVT, we train\nVAEs with latent dimension in {4, 8, 16, 32} and \u03b2 in\n{2.5\u00b710\u22125, 5\u00b710\u22125, 10\u22124, 2\u00b710\u22124} using the VAE-training\nsetup described at the beginning of this section. For each of\nthe resulting VAEs we train a causal GIVT with the smaller\nBERT-Base [12] dimensions.\nEvaluation\nFor the VAEs we report \u201creconstruction\nFID\u201d, the FID obtained when reconstructing the 50k Ima-\ngeNet validation images. For our GIVT variants and base-\nlines, we report the sampling FID [21] when sampling a\nbalanced set of 50k images covering all ImageNet classes.\nIn both cases, we rely on the well-established ADM Tensor-\nFlow Suite [13], which uses the entire ImageNet training set\nas a reference. Furthermore, we also report Precision and\nRecall [52]. Finally, we evaluate the representation learn-\ning capabilities by training a linear classifier on an average-\npooled intermediate representation of unconditional GIVT-\nCausal as in prior work [8, 71] (see App. D for details).\n4.2. Panoptic segmentation and depth estimation\nWe build on the UViM framework [30], which uses a VQ-\nVAE to compress the label space of computer-vision dense-\nprediction tasks, and an encoder-decoder transformer tak-\ning the RGB image as an input and predicting the associ-\nated dense labels as discrete codes in the VQ-VAE latent\nspace. Here, we replace the VQ-VAE with a \u03b2-VAE and\nuse a GIVT encoder-decoder to model the continuous la-\ntent code. For the VAE, we use the same transformer-based\nautoencoder architecture (6-layer encoder and 12-layer de-\ncoder) and cross-entropy loss as [30]. We set d = 16 and\nKL weight \u03b2 = 2.5 \u00b7 10\u22124 for panoptic segmentation and\n\u03b2 = 2 \u00b7 10\u22124 for depth estimation. To build an encoder-\ndecoder GIVT model the same way as in [30], we employ\nthe causal variant described for ImageNet generation and\ninsert a cross-attention layer after each self-attention layer.\nFollowing [30], we use the ImageNet-21k-pretrained ViT-\nL/16 from [56] as the encoder, set the image resolution to\n512px, and adopt the preprocessing and optimization hyper-\nparameters from [30]. We use the UViM variant without en-\ncoder and decoder context [30]. Finally, we consider vari-\nance scaling and beam search, selecting the best parameters\non a held-out subset of the training set as in [30].\n5. Results\n5.1. Image generation\nVAE latent space\nIn Fig. 4 we show how varying the\nweight \u03b2 of the KL term affects (i) the VAE reconstruction\nFID and (ii) the sampling FID of a Base-size GIVT-Causal\ntrained on the corresponding latent sequence. For (i), in-\ncreasing \u03b2 leads to worse reconstruction FID since the VAE\ncan store less information in the latent. It shifts more of the\nmodeling effort to the VAE decoder, so that the decoder be-\ncomes gradually more generative, which affects sampling\nquality (see [61, Sec., 7] for an extensive discussion).\nFor (ii), we see the opposite trend: increasing \u03b2 leads to\ndecreased (better) sampling FID for GIVT models trained\non the latent sequence. Arguably, this is because the VAE\nlatent sequence more closely follows the Gaussian prior,\nand hence becomes easier for the GIVT to model. Note,\nhowever, that reconstruction FID lower-bounds the sam-\npling FID, so one should chose a VAE with reconstruction\nFID smaller than the desired sampling FID. For this reason,\nwe chose \u03b2 = 5 \u00b7 10\u22125 for the VAE used in our main mod-\nels, which obtains a reconstruction FID of 3.66 (note that\nour best GIVT-Causal model has sampling FID 4.29, see\n7\nModel\nInference\nSteps FID\u2193\nADM [13]\n250 23.20\nADM-G [13]\nCG = 1.0\n250\n7.72\nDiT-XL/2 [46]\n250 12.03\nDiT-XL/2-G [46]\nCFG = 1.5\n250\n3.04\nMaskGIT [6]\ntC = 4.5\n16\n7.80\u2020\nGIVT-MaskGIT (Ours)\n16\n6.36\nGIVT-MaskGIT (Ours)\nDB-CFG = 0.2\n16\n5.81\nTable 2.

Our masked GIVT-MaskGIT obtains\ncompetitive FID scores with only 16 inference steps.\n\u2020Numbers\nobtained by us from public code.\nTable 1). Finally, we see that the latent dimension d has\nquite a small impact on reconstruction and sampling FID.\nSampling FID\nIn Table 1 we show the sampling FID\nfor three class-conditional model classes on 256 \u00d7 256\nImageNet:\nGANs, diffusion-based approaches, and se-\nquence modeling approaches.\nOne can observe that our\nGIVT-Causal models outperform the quantization-based\nVQ-GAN in terms of FID, even though VQ-GAN has more\nthan 4\u00d7 the model parameters. We study the impact of our\nDB-CFG for both our models in Fig. 7. On the left, for\ncausal models, we see the impact of temperature scaling,\nand obtain the best results with t = 0.95.\nWe did not\nobserve benefits from temperature scaling for our GIVT-\nMaskGIT models, possibly due to the high-confidence\nselection-scheme already favoring high-certainty tokens. In\nthe middle of Fig. 7, we instead show the impact of different\ninference schedules on GIVT-MaskGIT. We find that the co-\nsine schedule used in the original VQ-VAE-based MaskGIT\nyields the best FID (by a small margin).\nMoving on to\n512 \u00d7 512 ImageNet, we show Sampling FID of available\nmodels in Table 2. We see that our GIVT-MaskGIT scales\nto this resolution, and obtains an FID of 5.81. Finally, we\npresent unconditional results in App. C. This task is con-\nsiderably harder, but GIVT outperforms the diffusion-based\nADM [13] by a solid margin.\nSamples\nFig. 2 shows 10 samples from GIVT-Causal,\nand App. E shows 10 samples for the GIVT-MaskGIT. We\ncan see that the model produces high-fidelity, coherent sam-\nples. To study sample diversity, we sample multiple images\nfor a fixed class in App. E.\nIn Fig. 6, one can see two samples from our VAE (ob-\ntained by decoding latents sampled from the prior), which\nshow a soup of image textures. We then show different steps\nof the GIVT-MaskGIT inference, and observe similar be-\nhavior as in the VQ-based model ([6, Fig. 2]).\nAblations and visualizations\nWe did not observe clear\nModel\nType\n#Tok.\n#Param.

Type: (Latent) generative model type. #Param.:\nNumber of parameters of the full (latent) generative model.\nbenefits from using more than one mixture component per\nlatent dimension in our image generation experiments (both\nfor causal and MaskGIT-based GIVTs). This is perhaps un-\nsurprising since our VAE\u2019s latent codes are regularized to-\nwards a unimodal Gaussian prior. Using multiple mixtures\nmight be more beneficial when, e.g., training GIVT on less-\nregularized latent spaces such as those of vision encoders\npretrained in supervised or contrastive settings.\nFurther, predicting the full covariance matrix per latent\nvector, rather than assuming a diagonal covariance, only\nled to very modest gains of about 3% for MaskGIT-based\nGIVT. On the other hand, a full covariance matrix makes\nDB-CFG less tractable than the diagonal covariance (be-\ncause the high dimensional multivariate distribution has\nmore regions of low density).\nIn Fig. 7 (right), we visualize the predicted standard de-\nviations as a function of the GIVT-MaskGIT inference step.\nThe standard deviation gradually decreases, meaning that\nthe predictions later in the sampling process become more\ncertain. Furthermore, the unconditional predictions gener-\nally have a higher standard deviation, as expected.\nRepresentation learning\nTable 3 shows the ImageNet\nlinear probing accuracy of unconditional GIVT-Causal and\ngenerative models from the literature (we chose the model\nvariants closest in terms of model size and compute). GIVT-\nCausal matches VIM+ViT (ViT-VQ-GAN) [71] which has\nmore than 2\u00d7 the model parameters and 4\u00d7 the sequence\nlength (and hence FLOPs). GIVT-Causal is only outper-\nformed by MAGE [36], whose latent encoder-decoder ar-\nchitecture is better suited for representation learning than\ndecoder-only models. An investigation of the probing accu-\nracy as function of the layer index can be found in App. D.\n5.2.

In App. E we show visual results.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we proposed two small modifications to stan-\ndard transformer decoder-only models to make them suit-\nable to generating real-valued vectors. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first decoder-only model amenable to generat-\ning sequences of real-valued vectors. In the context of im-\nage generation with VQ-GAN or Mask-GIT, this side-steps\ntraining difficulties such as low codebook usage in VQ-\nVAEs and corresponding mitigations like entropy losses or\ncodebook-splitting algorithms, by enabling the use of stan-\ndard VAEs which are much easier to train. Furthermore, our\nmethod avoids large embedding matrices because the fea-\nture representations can directly be consumed and predicted\nby our GIVT model. Surprisingly, our simple, quantization-\nfree approach outperforms its VQ-based equivalent when\nusing causal transformers for class-conditional image gen-\neration, and obtains strong performance in dense prediction\ntasks when applied to UViM. We hope that future work ex-\nplores applications of GIVT to other modalities such as au-\ndio and time-series modeling.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Andr\u00b4e Susano Pinto, Neil Houlsby,\nEirikur Agustsson, and Lucas Theis for inspiring discus-\nsions and helpful feedback on this project.

Loss function and implementation details\nWe start with the case where GIVT models the distribution\nof each feature vector or soft token in the sequence indepen-\ndently across channels with a scalar k-mixture GMM, con-\nditionally on all previous feature vectors in the sequence.\nThe predicted GIVT output for a mini batch of size B of d-\ndimensional feature sequences of length L is a B \u00d7L\u00d73dk\ntensor y = [m; s; \u03c0] where m, s and \u03c0 are B \u00d7 L \u00d7 dk\ntensors stacked along the last dimension comprising means,\nstandard deviations, and mixture weights, respectively. We\nassume the entries of s to be lower-bounded by a small pos-\nitive constant \u03f5 = 10\u22125 (e.g., by applying a softplus func-\ntion to the corresponding network outputs and clipping to \u03f5)\nand the entries of \u03c0 to be non-negative. m is composed as\n[m(1); . . . ; m(k)] where the m(n) are the B \u00d7 L \u00d7 d mean\ntensors of the GMM components stacked along the last axis;\ns and \u03c0 are composed in the same way. The mixture weights\nare assumed normalized across components (e.g., via a soft-\nmax function), i.e., Pk\nn=1 \u03c0(n)\nb,\u2113,c = 1 for all b, \u2113, c.\nThen, the negative log-likelihood of the feature se-\nquences {zb}B\nb=1 (i.e. the training images after embedding\nvia the VAE encoder and applying reparametrization) w.r.t.\nthe distribution \u02dcp predicted by GIVT can be written as\n\u2212\nB\nX\nb=1\nlog(\u02dcp(zb))\n= \u2212\nB\nX\nb=1\nlog\n L\nY\n\u2113=1\nd\nY\nc=1\n k\nX\nn=1\n\u03c0(n)\nb,\u2113,cN(zb,\u2113,c|m(n)\nb,\u2113,c, s(n)\nb,\u2113,c)\n!!\n= \u2212\nB\nX\nb=1\nL\nX\n\u2113=1\nd\nX\nc=1\nlog\n k\nX\nn=1\n\u03c0(n)\nb,\u2113,cN(zb,\u2113,c|m(n)\nb,\u2113,c, s(n)\nb,\u2113,c)\n!\n,\n(2)\nwhere N(z|m, s) is a Gaussian density\nN(z|m, s) =\n1\ns\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 e\u2212 1\n2( z\u2212m\ns )\n2\n.\nWhen using a single Gaussian instead of a GMM to model\neach output channel (i.e. k = 1, as in most experiments)\nEq. (2) becomes\nB\nX\nb=1\nL\nX\n\u2113=1\nd\nX\nc=1\n1\n2\n\u0012zb,\u2113,c \u2212 mb,\u2113,c\nsb,\u2113,c\n\u00132\n+log(sb,\u2113,c)+1\n2 log(2\u03c0).\nWhile this loss simplifies to a sum over the sequence dimen-\nsion \u2113, note that mb,\u2113,c, sb,\u2113,c (and in the GMM case \u03c0b,\u2113,c)\nare predicted from zb,1, . . . , zb,\u2113\u22121 by GIVT (setting zb,0 to\na learned [CLS] or [BOS] vector). Further, it can be seen\nthat lower-bounding the sb,\u2113,c with \u03f5 > 0 avoids extremely\nlarge loss values when some zb,\u2113 fall into low-density re-\ngions of \u02dcp.\nFor the multivariate case, where dependencies between\nfeature channels are modeled, GIVT predicts a d \u00d7 d co-\nvariance matrix S(n)\nb,\u2113 for each mixture component n, and\ndata negative log-likelihood becomes\n\u2212\nB\nX\nb=1\nL\nX\n\u2113=1\nlog\n k\nX\nn=1\n\u03c0(n)\nb,\u2113 \u02dc\nN(zb,\u2113|m(n)\nb,\u2113 , S(n)\nb,\u2113 )\n!\n,\nwhere \u02dc\nN is a multivariate Gaussian density.\nFor all loss variants, the MaskGIT version of GIVT the\nsum over L is reduced to the sum over the indices l corre-\nspond to masked locations, and the loss is normalized by\nthe number of mask tokens.\nA.2. Image generation\nFor the image generation experiments on ImageNet, we\nadapt the CNN-based VQ-GAN tokenizer from MaskGIT\n(see vqgan tokenizer.py). We replace the VQ layer and re-\nlated losses with a Gaussian reparametrization layer [27],\nand we use the hyper parameters given in Table 5 for the\nCNN. For our transformers, we use the standard pre-LN\nsetup (see, e.g., UViM vtt.py for a concrete implementa-\ntion).

Note that the 32 features of the embedding are\nsplit into 16 means and 16 scales, so our actual representation has\nd = 16 channels after reparametrization.\nImageNet preprocessing\nWe preprocess the ImageNet\ndata as follows, following prior work [6, 43]:\n\u2022 Decode JPEGs\n\u2022 Random crop such that between 80% and 100% of the\nsource image are retained\n\u2022 Resize to target resolution (256\u00d7256 or 512\u00d7512) using\nbicubic filters with anti-aliasing\n\u2022 Randomly flip the image horizontally with probability 0.5\nA.3. Panoptic Segmentation and Depth Estimation\nFor our UViM panoptic segmentation and depth estimation\nexperiments, we adopt the public UViM GitHub repo and\n12\nonly replace the VQ layer in stage I, adapt the transformer\ndecoder in stage II, and modify the losses accordingly.\nB.

We obtained samples for\nMAGE [36] using their GitHub code. Note that the MAGE Base\nand Large models have considerably more model parameters than\nour corresponding models because MAGE has a latent encoder-\ndecoder model (rather than a decoder-only model).\nD. Probing intermediate representations\nWe extract intermediate representations form a GIVT-\ncausal trained for 256 \u00d7 256 unconditional ImageNet gen-\neration by average-pooling the output of a given layer over\nthe sequence dimension (which results in a feature vector\nof dimension 1024 for L-sized models). Thereby, the input\nimage is first encoded with the VAE encoder and then fed\nto GIVT as during teacher forcing (i.e. the latent sequence\nis first right-shifted and padded, and then fed to GIVT with\ncausal attention mask).\nFollowing prior work [8, 71], we investigate the impact\nof the layer index on the linear probing accuracy. To speed\nup the evaluation we rely on 25-shot classification with the\nfast evaluator form [73] and test a range of diverse data sets.\nThe results presented in Fig. 8 show that the range of layers\n10 to 20 lead to high accuracy for all data sets.\nWe choose layer 18 for the linear probing experiments\nusing the full ImageNet training set. To select hyperparame-\nters we set aside 1% of the training data and consider the se-\nlection of schedules and hyperparameters described in [62,\nApp. A].

On the NVIDIA Dataset [78], our method achieves a rendering quality comparable to state-\nof-the-art NeRF-based methods but is much faster to train and render. The bubble size in the figure indicates the training time (GPU-hour).\nAbstract\nNovel view synthesis from an in-the-wild video is diffi-\ncult due to challenges like scene dynamics and lack of par-\nallax. While existing methods have shown promising results\nwith implicit neural radiance fields, they are slow to train\nand render. This paper revisits explicit video representa-\ntions to synthesize high-quality novel views from a monoc-\nular video efficiently. We treat static and dynamic video\ncontent separately. Specifically, we build a global static\nscene model using an extended plane-based scene represen-\ntation to synthesize temporally coherent novel video. Our\nplane-based scene representation is augmented with spher-\nical harmonics and displacement maps to capture view-\ndependent effects and model non-planar complex surface\ngeometry. We opt to represent the dynamic content as per-\nframe point clouds for efficiency. While such representa-\ntions are inconsistency-prone, minor temporal inconsisten-\ncies are perceptually masked due to motion. We develop a\nmethod to quickly estimate such a hybrid video representa-\ntion and render novel views in real time. Our experiments\nshow that our method can render high-quality novel views\nfrom an in-the-wild video with comparable quality to state-\nof-the-art methods while being 100\u00d7 faster in training and\nenabling real-time rendering.\n\u2217Work done while Yao-Chih was an intern at Adobe Research.\n1. Introduction\nNeural radiance fields (NeRFs) [44] have brought great suc-\ncess to novel view synthesis of an in-the-wild video. Exist-\ning NeRF-based dynamic view synthesis approaches [14,\n31, 38] rely on per-scene training to obtain high-quality re-\nsults. However, the use of NeRFs as video representations\nmakes the training process slow, often taking one or more\ndays. Moreover, it remains challenging to achieve real-time\nrendering with such NeRF-based representations.\nRecently, 3D Gaussian Splatting [22] based on an ex-\nplicit scene representation achieves decent rendering qual-\nity on static scenes with a few minutes of per-scene training\nand real-time rendering. However, the success of 3D Gaus-\nsians relies on sufficient supervision signals from a wide\nrange of multiple views, which is often lacking in monocu-\nlar videos. As a result, floaters and artifacts are revealed in\nnovel views in regions with a weak parallax (Fig. 2).\nWe also adopt a per-video optimization strategy to sup-\nport high-quality view synthesis. Meanwhile, we seek a\ngood representation for an in-the-wild video that is fast to\ntrain, allows for real-time rendering, and generates high-\nquality novel views. We use a hybrid representation that\ntreats static and dynamic video content differently to handle\nscene dynamics and weak parallax simultaneously. We re-\nvisit plane-based scene representations, which are not only\ninherently friendly for scenes with low parallax but are ef-\n1\narXiv:2312.02135v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023\nPose and video depth\nestimation\nRendering with\n3D Gaussians [22]\nRendering with\nOurs\nFigure 2. 3D Gaussians [22] fails in weak-parallax videos. We\nshow two casual videos in DAVIS [50] where the recent efficient\n3D Gaussians produce floaters and noises in novel view due to\ninsufficient parallax cues. We use the groundtruth masks to filter\nout the dynamic content and only reconstruct the static scenes.\nfective at modeling static scenes in general.A good exam-\nple is multi-plane image [12, 62, 68, 83]. We, inspired by\nPiecewise Planar Stereo [60], use a soup of 3D oriented\nplanes to more flexibly represent the static video content\nfrom a wide range of viewpoints. To support temporally\nconsistent novel view synthesis, we build a global plane-\nbased representation for static video content.\nMoreover,\nwe extend this soup-of-planes representation with spher-\nical harmonics and displacement maps to capture view-\ndependent effects and complex non-planar surface geom-\netry. Dynamic content in an in-the-wild video is often close\nto the camera and with complex motion. It is inefficient to\nmaintain a large number of small planes to represent such\ncontent. Consequently, we opt for per-frame point clouds\nto represent dynamic content for efficiency. To synthesize\ntemporally coherent dynamic content and reduce occlusion,\nwe blend the dynamic content from neighboring time steps.\nWhile such an approach is still inherently prone to tempo-\nral issues, small inconsistencies are usually not perceptually\nnoticeable due to motion.\nWe further develop a method and a set of loss functions\nto optimize our hybrid video representation from a monoc-\nular video. Since our hybrid representation can be rendered\nin real-time, our per-video optimization only takes 15 min-\nutes on a single GPU. Our method achieves a rendering\nquality that is comparable to NeRF-based dynamic synthe-\nsis algorithms [14, 31, 32, 38] quantitatively and qualita-\ntively, but is over 100x faster for training and rendering.\nIn summary, our contributions include:\n\u2022 a hybrid explicit non-neural representation that can model\nboth static and dynamic video content, support view-\ndependent effects and complex surface geometries, and\nenable real-time rendering;\n\u2022 a per-video optimization algorithm together with a set of\ncarefully designed loss functions to estimate the above\nhybrid video representation from a monocular video;\n\u2022 extensive evaluations on the NVIDIA [78] and DAVIS\ndatasets [50] show that our method can generate novel\nviews with comparable quality to state-of-the-art NeRF-\nbased view synthesis methods while being 100\u00d7 faster for\nboth training and rendering.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Dynamic-scene view synthesis\nIn contrast to static-scene novel view synthesis [7, 17,\n28, 33, 41\u201344, 58, 64, 70], novel view synthesis for dy-\nnamic scenes is particularly challenging due to the tem-\nporally varying contents that need to be handled.\nTo\nmake this problem more tractable, many existing meth-\nods [2, 4, 5, 9, 13, 29, 34, 35, 40, 52, 63, 84] reconstruct 4D\nscenes from multiple cameras capturing the dynamic scene\nsimultaneously. However, such multi-view videos are not\npractical for casual applications, which instead only provide\nmonocular videos. To tackle monocular videos, Yoon et\nal. [78] computes the video depth and performs depth-based\n3D warping. However, the video depth may not be globally\nconsistent, which results in view inconsistencies.\nWith the emergence of powerful neural rendering, a\n4D scene can be implicitly represented in a neural net-\nwork [76].\nTo model motion in neural representations,\n[14, 31, 38, 47, 48, 61, 67] learn a canonical template with\na deformation field to advect the casting rays. Some al-\ngorithms [14, 31, 38] utilize scene flow as a regularization\nfor the 4D scene reconstruction which yield promising im-\nprovements. Instead of embedding a 4D scene within the\nnetwork parameters, DynIBaR [32] aggregates the features\nfrom nearby views by a neural motion field to condition the\nneural rendering. Although existing neural rendering meth-\nods can achieve decent rendering quality, the computational\ncosts and time for both per-scene training and rendering are\nhigh. Recently, MonoNeRF [66] and a concurrent work,\nFlowIBR [8], investigated priors in the form of pre-training\non a large corpus of data to reduce the per-scene training\ntime for neural rendering. While showing encouraging re-\nsults, these approaches do not generalize well though and\nthe time-consuming rendering is still present.\n2.2. View synthesis with explicit representations\nIn contrast to implicitly encoding a scene in the network\nparameters, view synthesis algorithms with explicit 3D rep-\nresentations can often train and/or render faster.\nSome methods exploit depth estimation to perform ex-\nplicit 3D warping for novel view synthesis [10, 27, 46, 73,\n78]. A feature-based point cloud is often used by neural\n2\nPreprocessing (Sec. 3.1)\nPlane fitting\ninitialization Eq.

We first preprocess an input monocular video to obtain obtain the video depth and pose as well as the dynamic\nmasks (Sec. 3.1). The input video is then decomposed into static and dynamic content. We initialize a soup of oriented planes by fitting\nthem to the static scene. These planes are augmented to capture view-dependent effects and non-planar complex surfaces. These planes are\nback-warped to the target view and composited from far to near to generate the target static view (Sec. 3.2). We estimate per-frame point\nclouds for dynamic content together with dynamic masks (Sec. 3.3). For temporal consistency, we use optical flows to blend the dynamic\ncontent from neighboring frames. The blended dynamic content is then warped to the target view. Finally, the target novel view is rendered\nby blending the static and dynamic novel content.\nrendering to enhance the synthesis quality [1, 10, 56, 73].\nInstead of learning a feature space for point clouds, NPC [3]\ndirectly renders the RGB points with an MLP which yields\na fast convergence and promising quality. Recent 3D/4D\nGaussian approaches [22, 75] treat each 3D point as an\nanisotropic 3D Gaussian to learn and render high-quality\nnovel views efficiently without neural rendering. Neverthe-\nless, these methods heavily rely on accurate point locations\nfor a global 3D point cloud. Therefore, they may require\ndepth sensors [1] or SfM [57] as initialization [3, 22]. Based\non an initial point cloud, subsequent approaches [22] lever-\nage multi-view supervision to adaptively densify and prune\nthe 3D points. However, these methods often fail in scenes\nwith little parallax (Fig. 2).\nMesh is also a popular 3D representation [20]. However,\nit is difficult to estimate meshs from a casual video. One\nparticular challenge is to directly optimize the positions of\nmesh vertices to integrate inconsistent depths from multiple\nviews into a global mesh. Alternatively, [55, 69, 71, 77] first\nlearn a neural SDF representation and then bake an explicit\nglobal mesh for static scenes. However, such a two-step\nmethod which involves optimizing for an MLP is slow.\nLayered depth images (LDI) [58] are an efficient repre-\nsentation for novel view synthesis [25, 30, 59]. Multiplane\nimage (MPI) approaches [12, 18, 35, 49, 62, 68, 74, 83], fur-\nther extend the LDI representation and use a set of fronto-\nparallel RGBA planes to represent a static scene. These\nMPIs can often be generated using a feed-forward network\nand are thus fast to estimate. They can also be rendered\nefficiently by homography-based warping and alpha com-\nposition. However, fronto-parallel planes are restricted to\nforward-facing scenes and do not allow large viewpoint\nchanges for novel view synthesis. To address this issue,\n[36, 80] construct a set of oriented feature planes to perform\nneural rendering for static-scene view synthesis. Yet again\nhowever, such feature planes require a time-consuming op-\ntimization. Our method, similarly inspired by [60], fits a\nsoup of oriented planes to 3D scene surfaces. In contrast to\nfeature planes, we adopt the non-neural RGBA representa-\ntion in [83] for fast training and rendering.\n3. Method\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, our method takes an N-frame RGB\nvideo, I1..N as an input and renders a novel view \u02dcIt at the\ntarget view point \u02dcT and timestamp t. We first preprocess the\ninput video to the obtain video depth maps D1..N, the cam-\nera trajectory T1..N, and dynamic masks M1..N(Sec. 3.1).\nWe then decompose the video into a global static represen-\ntation (Sec. 3.2) and a per-frame dynamic representation\n(Sec. 3.3). Finally, we render the static and dynamic rep-\nresentations according to the target camera pose and com-\nposite them to generate the novel view \u02dcIt.\nWe aim for a novel view synthesis approach that can train\n3\nPlane\nActual surface\nview ray \nview ray\n(a) Flat plane approximates a surface\n(b) View-dependent texture\nInput image\nView \ndirection\n \nDisplace.

(a) Since a flat plane can-\nnot sufficiently represent a non-flat surface, we augment it with\nboth view-dependent appearance and displacement (b). Both of\nthem are encoded by spherical harmonic coefficients, C0..\u2113C\nmax and\n\u22060..\u2113\u2206\nmax, respectively. Given a view direction v, we first obtain\nthe view-specific color Cv and displacement \u2206v, then shift (back-\nwarp) Cv into the final view-specific Cv,\u2206v texture for planar ho-\nmography warping to the target view. Note that the transparency\nmap \u03b1 is shifted jointly with Cv.\nfast, support real-time rendering, and generate high-quality\nand temporally coherent novel views. As neural scene rep-\nresentations require more computation, we revisit explicit\nscene representations for a monocular video. First, we rep-\nresent the dynamic content and the static background sep-\narately. We use a global background scene representation\nto enable temporally coherent view synthesis. To cope with\ndynamic content, we estimate a per-frame representation.\nWhile this is not ideal, minor inconsistencies within the\ndynamic content are not noticeable to viewers due to the\nmotion-masking effect of human perception. Second, we\nuse a soup of plane representation, inspired by Piecewise\nPlanar Stereo [60], to represent the background and further\nextend it to support both view-dependent effects and non-\nplanar scene surfaces. Third, we represent dynamic content\nusing per-frame point clouds. As detailed later in this sec-\ntion, we provide a method that can efficiently estimate such\na hybrid video representation to support real-time rendering\nof novel views with comparable quality of state-of-the-art\nmethods that need 100\u00d7 of our training time.\n3.1. Preprocessing\nSimilar to existing methods [14, 31, 32], our method ob-\ntains an initial 3D reconstruction from an input video\nI1..N using off-the-shelf video depth and pose estima-\ntion methods. Specifically, we use a re-implementation of\nRCVD [26] in VideoDoodles [79] to acquire video depth\nD1..N and camera poses T1..N. To obtain initial masks for\ndynamic regions, we first estimate likely-dynamic regions\nthrough semantic segmentation [19] and then acquire bina-\nrymotion masks by thresholding the error between optical\nflows [65] and rigid flows computed from depth maps and\npose estimates. We then aggregate these masks to obtain\nthe desired dynamic masks M1..N before using Segment-\nAnything [24] to refine the object boundaries.\n3.2. Extended Soup of Planes for Static Content\nWe fit a soup of oriented planes to the point cloud con-\nstructed using the pre-computed depth maps and camera\nposes in Sec. 3.1. To represent scene surfaces, each plane\nhas the same texture resolution, which contains an appear-\nance map and a density map. We further augment the planes\nwith spherical harmonics and displacement fields to model\nview-dependent effects and non-planar surfaces.\nPlane initialization.\nGiven a number Np of finite planes\nP1..Np, we first fit them to the 3D static scene point cloud\nby minimizing the objective:\n\u03a3\nNp\ni=1d(Pi, Xi,j) + \u03bbnorm\u27e8nPi, nXi,j\u27e9 + \u03bbareawihi,\n(1)\nwhere each 3D point Xj is assigned to the nearest\nplane Pi with finite size (wi, hi) in every optimiz-\ning iteration.\nThe point-to-plane distance is calculated\nby d(P, X)\n=\nq\nmax(|xP | \u2212 w\n2 , 0)2 + max(|yP | \u2212 h\n2 , 0)2 + |zP |2,\nwhere [xP , yP , zP ]\u22ba is the 3D point X w.r.t. the plane basis\ncoordinate system with the plane center as the origin. We\nalso measure the orientation difference between the point\nnormal vector nXi,j and the corresponding plane normal\nnPi. The last term encourages each plane to have a com-\npact size to avoid redundant overlapping planes. \u03bbnorm,\nand \u03bbarea are hyper-parameters to re-weight each term.\nView-dependent plane textures.\nA 2D plane texture\nstores S \u00d7S appearance Ci and transparency maps \u03b1i of the\ncorresponding 3D plane Pi. We utilize spherical harmonic\n(SH) coefficients for appearance maps to facilitate view de-\npendency [22, 53, 74]. The view-specific color is obtained\nby Cv = P\u2113C\nmax\n\u2113=0 C\u2113H\u2113(v), where H\u2113 are the SH basis func-\ntions. Moreover, a flat plane with a view-dependent ap-\npearance map may still be insufficient to represent a bumpy\nsurface (Fig. 4a). The different viewing rays, v, looking\nat the same 3D point may hit the plane in different loca-\ntions, which can cause blurriness. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a view-dependent displacement map \u2206i for each\nplane Pi, encoded by SH coefficients. As shown in Fig. 4b,\n4\ngiven a ray v, we obtain the view-specific displacement,\n\u2206v = P\u2113\u2206\nmax\n\u2113=0 \u2206\u2113H\u2113(v), to shift the color Cv into Cv,\u2206v:\nCv,\u2206v(u, v) = Cv(u + \u2206v\nu, v + \u2206v\nv),\n(2)\nwhere (u, v) denotes the pixel on a plane that ray v hits.\nWe also apply the displacement to the transparency map \u03b1\nalong with color Cv, allowing a plane to better approximate\nthe complex non-planar surface geometry.\nDifferentiable rendering.\nWe first obtain the view-\nspecific RGB Cv,\u2206v\ni\nand transparency maps \u03b1\u2206v\ni\nfrom the\ntexture of each plane Pi. We then backward warp them to\nthe target view \u02dcT as ( \u02dcCv,\u2206v\ni\n, \u02dc\u03b1\u2206v\ni\n) using planar homography\nand composite them from back to front [83]. Unlike fronto-\nparallel MPIs that have a set of planes with fixed depth or-\nder [83], we need to perform pixel-wise depth sorting to the\nunordered and oriented 3D planes before compositing into\nthe static-content image \u02dcIs:\n\u02dcIs =\nNp\nX\nj=1\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u02dcCv,\u2206v\nj\n\u02dc\u03b1\u2206v\nj\nNp\nY\nk=j+1\n(1 \u2212 \u02dc\u03b1\u2206v\nk )\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\n(3)\nSimilarly, the static depth \u02dcDs can be obtained by replacing\ncolor \u02dcCv,\u2206v\nj\nwith plane depth \u02dcdj in the above equation.\n3.3. Consistent Dynamic Content Synthesis\nUsing oriented planes to represent near and complex dy-\nnamic objects is challenging. Therefore, we resort to sim-\nple but effective per-frame point clouds to represent them.\nAt each timestamp t, we extract the dynamic appearance Id\nt\nand soft dynamic masks M\u2217\nt from input frame It (Sec. 3.4).\nThen, they are warped to compute the dynamic color \u02dcId\nt and\nmask \u02dc\nMt at the target view ( \u02dcT, t) using forward splatting:\n\u02dcxt = \u02dcK \u02dcTT \u22121\nt\nDtK\u22121\n\u02dct\nxt,\n(4)\nwhere xt and \u02dcxt are pixel coordinates in the source Id\nt\nand target image \u02dcIt, respectively. K are the camera intrin-\nsics. We adopt differentiable and depth-ordered softmax-\nsplatting [45] to warp (Id\nt , M \u2217\nt ) to (\u02dcId\nt , \u02dc\nMt) as well as the\ndynamic depth \u02dcDd\nt w.r.t. view \u02dcT. The final image \u02dcIt at\n( \u02dcT, t) is blended by the static and dynamic content (\u02dcIs, \u02dcId\nt ):\n\u02dcIt = (1 \u2212 \u02dc\nM\u2032\nt)\u02dcIs + \u02dc\nM\u2032\nt\u02dcId\nt ,\n(5)\nwhere the soft mask \u02dc\nM\u2032\nt is based on the warped mask \u02dc\nMt\nand further considers the depth order between \u02dcDs\nt and \u02dcDd\nt to\nhandle occlusions between them. Similarly, the final depth\n\u02dcDt can be computed from \u02dcDs\nt and \u02dcDd\nt .\nTemporal neighbor blending.\nIdeally, the dynamic ap-\npearance Id\nt and learned mask M\u2217\nt can be optimized from\nthe precomputed mask Mt. But the precomputed mask Mt\nmay be noisy and its boundary may be temporally inconsis-\ntent. As a result, extracting masks M\u2217\n1..N independently\nfrom the noisy M1..N can result in temporal inconsisten-\ncies. Therefore, we sample and blend the dynamic colors\nand masks from neighboring views Id\nt\u00b1j with Id\nt via the op-\ntical flow Ft\u2192t\u00b1j [65]. The blended dynamic color I\nd\nt and\nmask Mt are then warped to composite with static content.\n3.4. Optimization\nVariables.\nWe jointly optimize our hybrid static and dy-\nnamic video representation. For static content, in addition\nto the plane textures (C1..Np, \u03b11..Np, \u22061..Np), the precom-\nputed camera poses T1..N and plane geometry (i.e., plane\nbasis, center, width, and height) can also be optimized. For\ndynamic content, we first initialize the RGB and masks\n(Id\n1..N, M\u2217\n1..N) from the input frames I1..N and precom-\nputed masks M1..N and then optimize them. Besides, we\nalso refine flow F by fine-tuning flow model [65] for neigh-\nbor blending during the optimization. We also optimize the\ndepth Dd\n1..Np for dynamic content when scene flow regular-\nization is adopted. Then, we employ a recipe of reconstruc-\ntion objectives and regularizations to assist optimization.\nPhotometric loss. The main supervision signal is the pho-\ntometric difference between the rendered view \u02dcIt and the\ninput frame It at view Tt. We omit time t in this section for\nsimplicity. The photometric loss Lpho is calculated as:\nLpho(\u02dcI, I) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u2225\u02dcI \u2212 I\u22252\n2 + \u03b3DSSIM(\u02dcI, I),\n(6)\nwhere DSSIM is the structural dissimilarity loss based on\nthe SSIM metric [72] with \u03b3 = 0.2. Besides, the percep-\ntual difference Lpercep\npho\n[21] is also measured by a pretrained\nVGG16 encoder. Furthermore, to ensure the static plane\ntextures represent static contents without dynamics picking\nany static content, we directly compute the masked static-\ncontent photometric loss between \u02dcIs and I by:\nLs\npho = min\n\u0010\nLM\npho(\u02dcIs, I), LM\u2217\npho(\u02dcIs, I)\n\u0011\n.\n(7)\nDynamic mask.\nThe soft dynamic mask M\u2217 aims to\nblend the dynamic content Id with the static content. We\ncompute a cross entropy loss Lbce\nmask between M\u2217 and the\nprecomputed mask M with a decreasing weight since M\nmay be noisy. We also encourage the smoothness of M\u2217 by\nan edge-aware smoothness loss Lsmooth\nmask\n[16]. To prevent\nthe mask from picking static content, we apply a sparsity\nloss with both L0- and L1-regularizations [39] to restrict\nnon-zero areas:\nLreg\nmask(M\u2217) = \u00b50\u03a60(M\u2217) + \u00b51\u2225M\u2217\u22251 + \u00b5bceLbce(M\u2217, 1),\n(8)\nwhere \u03a60(\u00b7) is an approximate L0 [39]. For non-zero areas,\nwe encourage them to be close to 1 via the binary cross\nentropy Lbce(\u00b7) with a small weight.\n5\nGroundtruth\nOurs\nNSFF [31]\nDynNeRF [14]\nRoDynRF [38]\nMonoNeRF\u2020 [66]\nFigure 5.

Therefore, we further apply a total\nvariation loss Ltv\n\u03b1 to each warped plane transparency \u02dc\u03b1\u2206v\ni\n.\nScene flow regularization. Depth estimation for dynamic\ncontent in a monocular video is an ill-posed problem. Many\nexisting methods first estimate depth maps for individual\nframes with a single-image depth estimation method. They\nthen assume that the motion is slow and accordingly use\nscene flows as regularization to smooth the individually es-\ntimated depth maps to improve the temporal consistency.\nHowever, it still highly depends on the initial single depth\nestimates. We observe that the assumption may not always\nhold true and may compromise the scene reconstruction and\nnovel view synthesis quality. In addition, scene flow regu-\nlarization slows our training process significantly. Hence,\nwe disable scene flow regularization by default. We will\ndiscuss the effect of the scene flow regularization in the\nsupplemental material. Another promising solution is to\npreprocess depth maps in true scale [6] to provide reliable\ndynamic-object depth, which we will explore in the future.\nImplementation details. Our implementation is based on\nPyTorch with Adam [23] and VectorAdam [37] optimizers\nalong with a gradient scaler [51] to prevent floaters. We\n6\nGroundtruth\nOurs\nNSFF [31]\nDynNeRF [14]\nDynIBaR [32]\nFigure 6.

The opti-\nmization only takes 15 minutes on a single A100 GPU with\n2000 iterations. We describe our detailed hyper-parameter\nsettings in the supplemental material.\n4. Experimental Results\nWe experiment with our methods and compare to SOTA on\nNVIDIA Dynamic Scene [78] and DAVIS [50] datasets.\n4.1. Comparisons on the NVIDIA Dataset\nNVIDIA\u2019s Dynamic Scene Dataset [78] contains 9 scenes\nsimultaneously captured by 12 cameras on a static camera\nrig. To simulate a monocular input video with a moving\ncamera, we follow the protocol in DynNeRF [14] to pick\na non-repeating camera view for each timestamp to form\na 12-frame video. We measure the PSNR and LPIPS [81]\nscores on the novel views from the viewpoint of the first\ncamera but at varying timestamps.\nWe show the visual\ncomparisons in Fig. 5 and report quantitative results in Ta-\nble 1. Although our PSNR scores are slightly worse than\nNSFF [31] in some sequences, our LPIPS scores are con-\nsistently better. This is because depth estimation for dy-\nnamic content is ill-posed. A slightly inaccurate dynamic\ndepth can cause a slight misalignment between the ground\ntruth and the rendered image. The pixel-wise PSNR met-\nric is sensitive to such subtle misalignments while we ar-\ngue that LPIPS is a fairer metric for monocular dynamic\nview synthesis since it measures the perceptual difference\nrather than pixel-wise errors. Besides, even though MonoN-\neRF [66] has shown generalization potential by pre-training\non one scene and fine-tuning on a target scene, our approach\nstill performs better than its per-scene optimization setting.\nOverall, our method achieves the second-best LPIPS and\ncomparable PSNR scores but with over 100\u00d7 faster training\nand rendering speeds than [14, 31, 38].\nTo compare with DynIBaR, we followed their protocol to\nform longer input videos with 96-204 frames by repeatedly\nsampling from the 12 cameras [32]. The overall quantita-\ntive scores and time comparisons are presented in Fig. 7.\nOurs\nDynIBaR\nDynNeRF\nFlowIBR\nNSFF\nHyperNeRF\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nFlowIBR\nDynNeRF\nNSFF\nDynIBaR\nHyperNeRF\nOurs\n20\n23\n26\n29\n32\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\nLPIPS (lower the better)\nPSNR (higher the better)\nRendering time  (sec/img)\nTraining time  (GPU-hour)\nLPIPS vs. Training time\nPSNR vs. Rendering time\nFigure 7.\nQuantitative and speed comparison using the\nNVIDIA-long protocol [32]. Although DynIBaR [32] gets the\nbest quality overall, it is time-consuming for training and render-\ning. In contrast, with the fastest training and rendering speed, the\nrendering quality of our method is the second-best in the LPIPS\nmetric, and comparable with DynNeRF [14] and NSFF [31] and\nbetter than FlowIBR [8] in the PSNR metric.\nMethod\nTraining\nRendering (sec/img)\nNVIDIA\nLPIPS\u2193\nGPU hour\n480\u00d7270\n860\u00d7480\nYoon et al. \u2020 [78]\n>2\n-\n>1\n0.152\nHyperNeRF* [48]\n64\n2.5\n-\n0.367\nDynNeRF* [14]\n74\n20.4\n-\n0.082\nNSFF* [31]\n223\n6.2\n-\n0.199\nRoDynRF [38]\n28\n2.4\n7.6\n0.065\nDynIBaR [32]\n320\n7.2\n22.2\n-\nFlowIBR* [8]\n2.3\n25.1\n-\n-\nMonoNeRF [66]\n22\n22.9\n76.9\n0.106\n4D Gaussians [75]\n1.2\n0.023\n0.035\n0.199\nOurs\n0.25\n0.021\n0.038\n0.081\nTable 2.\nSpeed comparison.\nOur method achieves real-time\nrendering and the second-best LPIPS score on the NVIDIA\nDataset [78]. \u2020We corresponded with the authors of [78] to acquire\nthe runtime performance. * denotes the speeds reported by [8].\nAgain, due to the ill-posed dynamic depth and only rely-\ning on video depth without scene flow regularization, our\nmethod produces slight misalignments with respect to the\nground truth in dynamic areas and thus yields slightly worse\nPSNR scores. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 6, our ap-\nproach provides sharper and richer details in dynamic con-\ntent than NSFF [31] and DynNeRF [14] and accordingly,\nour method achieves the second-best LPIPS score.\n4.2. Visual Comparisons on the DAVIS Datatset\nThe videos generated from the NVIDIA dataset [14] is dif-\nferent from an in-the-wild video. Therefore, we select sev-\neral videos from the DAVIS Dataset [50] to validate our al-\ngorithm in real-world scenarios. For a fair comparison, we\nuse the same video depth and pose estimation from our pre-\nprocessing step for DynIBaR and then run DynIBaR with\ntheir officially released code [32]. We show the results in\nFig. 8.\nAlthough DynIBaR can synthesize better details\nwith neural rendering in the first example, it introduces blur-\nriness by aggregating information from local frames and\nyields noticeable artifacts in other three examples. In con-\ntrast, our method maintains a static scene representation and\nobtains comparable quality to DynIBaR in the first example\nwhile being significantly faster to train and render.\n7\nInput\nDynIBaR [32]\nOurs\nFigure 8. Visual comparison on DAVIS [50]. We showcase the\nnovel view synthesis results and the corresponding input frame\nat the same time. DynIBaR [32] may fail to handle some casual\nvideos with few parallax and introduce noticeable artifacts.\n4.3. Speed Comparisons\nWe compare both per-scene training and rendering speed\nin Table 2 along with the overall LPIPS scores in Table 1.\nNeRF-based methods [14, 31, 38] usually require multiple\nGPUs and/or over one day for the per-video optimization.\nWhile some recent studies [8, 66] attempt to develop a gen-\neralized NeRF-based approach, there is still a quality gap\nto the per-video optimization methods, and their rendering\nspeed is still slow. In contrast, explicit representations, such\nas our method and 4D-GS [75], can train and render fast.\nOur method has a similar rendering speed but is faster to\noptimize than 4D-GS. In summary, our method can gen-\nerate novel views with comparable quality to NeRF-based\nmethods while being much faster to train and render (both\n>100\u00d7 faster than [32, 38]).\n4.4. Ablation Study\nTo thoroughly examine our method, we conduct ablation\nstudies on the NVIDIA Dataset in Table 3. In our static\nmodule, the view dependency of plane textures plays a key\nrole in rendering quality. The individual view-dependent\nappearance and displacement can each enhance the LPIPS\nscores by 19% (0.104\u21920.084) and 16% (0.104\u21920.087), re-\nspectively. Jointly, they can improve the baseline further,\n22% in LPIPS and 1.4dB in PSNR. For the dynamic mod-\nule, the improvement by adding neighboring blending is not\nsignificant since the preprocessed masks are already good\nas provided by DynNeRF\u2019s protocol [14]. We encourage\nthe readers to view our supplementary videos to observe the\nimproved temporal consistency on casual videos.\n4.5. Limitations\nOur approach may fail when the preprocessed video depth\nand pose are inaccurate.

We encourage readers to view our supple-\nmentary videos to see the improved temporal consistency.\n(a) Input\n(b) Preproc. depth\n(c) Static-only\n(d) Reconstruction\n(e) Novel view\nFigure 9. Limitations. Our view synthesis quality may degrade\nwhen the preprocessed video depth (b) is inaccurate. The subtle\nmotion of dynamic content makes motion segmentation difficult,\nleaking dynamic content into the static representations (c). Similar\nto DynIBaR [32], our method may produce incomplete dynamic\ncontent (e) due to the per-frame representation for dynamics.\nscene reconstruction is blurry because the inaccurate depth\nestimation leads to a poor initialization of the oriented\nplanes.\nIn addition, our method cannot separate objects\nwith subtle motion from a static background, such as videos\nin DyCheck [15], which is a challenging dataset for most\nof the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, similar to DynI-\nBaR [32], our method may produce an incomplete fore-\nground (Fig. 9e) by forward splatting from the local source\nframe without a canonical dynamic template.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper presented an efficient view synthesis method\nfor casual videos. Similar to state-of-the-art methods, we\nadopted a per-video optimization strategy to achieve high-\nquality novel view synthesis. To speed up our training /\noptimization process, instead of using a NeRF-based repre-\nsentation, we revisit explicit representations and used a hy-\nbrid static-dynamic video representation. We employed a\nsoup of planes as a global static background representation.\nWe further augmented it using spherical harmonics and dis-\nplacements to enable view-dependent effects and model\ncomplex non-planar surface geometry. We use per-frame\npoint clouds to represent dynamic content for efficiency.\nWe further developed an effective optimization method to-\ngether with a set of carefully designed loss functions to opti-\nmize for such a hybrid video representation from an in-the-\nwild video. Our experiments showed that our method can\ngenerate high-quality novel views with comparable qual-\nity to state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches while being\n(>100\u00d7) for both training and testing.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Kara-Ali Aliev, Artem Sevastopolsky, Maria Kolos, Dmitry\nUlyanov, and Victor Lempitsky.

A), runtime analysis of our method (Sec. B), ad-\nditional visual comparisons on the NVIDIA dataset [78]\n(Sec. C), and the discussion of scene flow regularization\n(Sec. D)\nA. Implementation details\nA.1. Initialization.\nPlane geometry. As described in the Sec. 3.2 of the main\npaper, we fit a soup of oriented 3D planes to the scene sur-\nfaces by a simple optimization with the objective Eq. (1)\nin the main paper. We first obtain the static scene point\ncloud by unprojecting the depth estimation from a set of\nkeyframes, which are selected by a fixed stride (e.g., 4).\nSubsequently, to initialize the planes\u2019 positions before the\nfitting optimization, we randomly sample Np points from\nthe point cloud as plane centers, where the randomness is\nweighted by the inverse of points\u2019 depths (i.e., disparities).\nThe intuition is that the nearer scenes may need more planes\nto represent more details with complex depths. Similarly,\nthe nearer planes are initialized with smaller sizes to main-\ntain fidelity since all planes have the same texture resolu-\ntion. The fitting process is effective at distributing the Np\nplanes to fit the entire scene surface (as shown in Fig. 3 in\nthe main paper). We set the number of planes Np = 64\nby default and 5000 iterations for the fitting optimization.\nAnd the hyper-parameters \u03bbnorm and \u03bbarea in Eq. (1) in\nthe main paper are set as 106 and 10\u22124, respectively.\nPlane texture. Once the plane fitting optimization is com-\npleted, we can initialize the base color C0\n1..Np and trans-\nparency \u03b11..Np for the view-dependent plane textures. With\nthe per-frame RGB point cloud, we assign the pixel color\nand transparency as 1 at the intersection of the viewing ray\nand the plane that is nearest to the point. For casual videos,\nwe set the width S = 256 for each plane texture. The\ndegree of spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients for view-\ndependent color \u2113C\nmax is set to 3. For the view-dependent\ndisplacement maps \u22061..Np, we initialize it with zeros (i.e.,\nno displacement). The width of displacement maps is set to\n32 with SH degree \u2113\u2206\nmax = 2. We use a sigmoid as the ac-\ntivation function for the transparency maps \u03b11..Np to limit\nthe range to [0, 1].\nDynamic module.\nThe initial per-frame dynamic col-\nors Id\n1..N are extracted from the input frames I1..N using\nthe preprocessed binary masks M1..N. Besides, the depth\nfor dynamic-content splatting is initialized with the precom-\nputed depth D1..N and can be updated when the scene flow\nregularization is adopted.\nRendering step\nRuntime (ms)\nStatic\nObtain view-dep. texture\n1.99\nPlane warping\n12.42\nPixelwise depth sorting\n0.12\nPlane composition\n0.27\nDynamic\nNeighboring blending\n21.28\nForward splatting\n1.35\nStatic-dynamic composition\n0.09\nTotal\n37.52\nTable 4.

Our method is efficient to supervise and trains on ca-\nsual videos within 15 minutes.\nA.2. Synthesis Optimization.\nThe synthesis optimization yields one image per iteration\n(i.e., batch size = 1). For casual videos of frames with a\n860\u00d7480 resolution and \u223c100 frames, we use 1000 itera-\ntions by default. For the NVIDIA dataset [78] with a reso-\nlution of 480\u00d7270, the number of iterations is set to 2000.\nBoth training processes can be completed within 15 min-\nutes. For the view-dependent plane textures in the static\nmodule, The active bands of the SH coefficients are in-\ncreased every 50 iterations until reaching the maximum SH\ndegrees [22].\nIn the dynamic module, we take the neighbors {t\u00b11, t\u00b1\n2} of the source view at the timestamp t for temporal neigh-\nbor blending. We utilize the pretrained backbone of the Mi-\nDaS network [54] to learn the dynamic masks M\u2217\n1..Np. The\nRAFT model [65] is jointly fine-tuned with a photometric\nloss Lpho\nflow and a cycle consistency loss Lcycle\nflow to obtain the\nrefined optical flow F for the neighbor blending. We ex-\nploit a small MLP with positional encoding to output a grid\nof scales and shifts to adjust the dynamic depth Dd\nt when\nthe scene flow regularization is applied. Note that the ren-\ndering phase does not require any network pass since we\ncan directly use the network outputs (i.e., masks M\u2217, flows\nF, dynamic depths Dd) on the fly.\n12\nThe total loss L is computed by:\nL\n= Ltotal\npho + Ltotal\nmask + Ltotal\ndepth\n+ \u03b7flowLtotal\nflow + \u03b7\u03b1Ltv\n\u03b1 ,\nLtotal\npho\n= \u03c1fullLpho + \u03c1sLpho + \u03c1percepLpercep\npho\n,\nLtotal\nmask\n= \u00b5preprocLbce\nmask + Lreg\nmask + \u00b5smoothLsmooth\nmask ,\nLtotal\ndepth\n= \u03c3fullLdepth + \u03c3sLs\ndepth\n+ \u03c3smoothLsmooth\ndepth\n+ \u03c3smooth,sLsmooth,s\ndepth\n,\nLtotal\nflow\n= Lpho\nflow + Lcycle\nflow\n(10)\nwhere the hyper-parameters for the photometric loss\n\u03c1full, \u03c1s, \u03c1percep = 10, 10, 1, respectively. For the mask\nloss Ltotal\nmask, \u00b5preproc\n= 0.05, \u00b50\n= 1.5, the hyper-\nparameters \u00b51 = 0.0015, and \u00b5bce = 0.5, corresponding\nto the Eq. (8) in the main paper. For the depth loss Ltotal\ndepth,\nwe compute the errors on the full-rendered depth \u02dcD and \u02dcDs.\nSimilarly, the smoothness losses Lsmooth\ndepth\nand Lsmooth,s\ndepth\nare\nconsidered. The hyper-parameters are set as \u03c3full = 0.1,\n\u03c3s = 0.1, \u03c3smooth = 1, \u03c3smooth,s = 0.1. Lastly, the hyper-\nparameters for the flow loss Ltotal\nflow and the smoothness loss\nof plane transparency Ltv\n\u03b1 are \u03b7flow = 10 and \u03b7\u03b1 = 10,\nrespectively.\nA.3. Rendering.\nTo achieve fast view synthesis, we save all outputs of the\ntrained networks after the synthesis optimization.\nCon-\nsequently, the rendering phase does not require any net-\nwork pass and directly takes the saved outputs on the fly.\nThe saved parameters take roughly 1.4GB for an 80-frame\nvideo. In addition, only the neighbors {t \u00b1 1} of the source\nview at timestamp t are used for temporal neighbor blend-\ning in order to speed up the rendering.\nB. Runtime analysis\nWe present the runtime breakdown of both the rendering\nand training processes in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.\nThe experiments are run on a single A100 GPU with an\n80-frame input video of 860\u00d7480 resolution. Our proposed\nmethod performs efficient training on an input video within\n15 minutes and real-time rendering at 27 FPS.\nC. Visual comparisons on the NVIDIA dataset\nWe present additional visual comparisons on the NVIDIA\ndataset [78] using DynNeRF [14]\u2019s evaluation protocol.\nThe results of HyperNeRF [48], NSFF [31], DynNeRF [14],\nand RoDynRF [38] are provided by RoDynRF [38]*. For\n*Evaluation results released by RoDynRF [38]:\nhttps : / /\nrobust-dynrf.github.io\nMonoNeRF [66], we re-produced the pre-scene optimiza-\ntion results by using the officially-released codes\u2020 with the\ndefault configuration\u2021.\nAs shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, HyperNeRF [48]\nand 4D-GS [75] fail to capture the motion with their de-\nformation fields and yield severe distortions and artifacts.\nMonoNeRF [66] produces duplicated dynamic content in\nboth examples of Fig. 11. Besides, in the second example\nof Fig. 10, DynNeRF [14] and MonoNeRF [66] introduce\nnoise to the green pole on the left. Our proposed method\ncan render high-quality results with the fastest training and\nrendering speeds.\nD. Scene flow regularization\nDue to the ill-posed dynamic-depth estimation problem, the\nscene flow regularization is usually adopted [14, 31, 32, 38]\nto learn a smooth motion field from per-frame depths and\noptical flows.\nSubsequently, the rendering is performed\nby the learned motion field.\nNotably, unlike the neural-\nrendering approaches that aim to acquire smoothed neural\nmotion fields, our explicit approach attempts to obtain the\nsmoothed dynamic depths for rendering. Therefore, simi-\nlar to Zhang et al. [82] used in the preprocessing of DynI-\nBaR [32], scene flow regularization is also adopted in our\npreprocessing video depth and pose estimation. In addition,\nwe further apply the scene flow to the optimization of our\nsynthesis framework.\nD.1. Method details of scene flow regularization\nTo smooth the motion in the sequential dynamic depth\nmaps, the dynamic depth Dd\n1..N is updated by scene flow\nregularization Ldepth\nsf\nthrough the optimization:\nLdepth\nsf\n= \u2225Dd\nt \u2212 zt+j\u2192t\u22251\n|Dd\nt + zt+j\u2192t| ,\n(11)\nwhere zt+j\u2192t denotes the z-component of the scene flow\nXt+j\u2192t from timestamp t + j to t, w.r.t. the view t. To\nestimate the scene flow, we follow [82] exploiting an MLP\n\u03b8sf to predict the forward and backward motions of an input\n3D point Xt at time t:\n(Xt\u2192t+1, Xt\u2192t\u22121) = \u03b8sf(Xt, t).\n(12)\nWe compute the cycle-consistency loss Lcycle\nsf\nof the scene\nflow estimation as well as the error Lflow\nsf\nbetween the pre-\ncomputed optical flow [65] and the inferred flow of pro-\njecting Xt\u2192t+1 to the 2D image plane. The scene flow is\n\u2020MonoNeRF [66] official codes:\nhttps : / / github . com /\ntianfr/MonoNeRF\n\u2021We use the default configuration for Balloon1 Balloon2 but\ntrain individual scenes separately for 150,000 iterations\n13\nsmoothed by:\nLsmooth\nsf\n=\nt+\u03c9\u22121\nX\ni=t\u2212\u03c9+1\n\u2225Xi\u22121\u2192i \u2212 Xi\u2192i+1\u22252,\n(13)\nwhere \u03c9 is half of the window size of the scene flow track.\nWe set \u03c9 = 2. Finally, the entire scene flow loss Lsf =\nLflow\nsf\n+ \u03b2depthLdepth\nsf\n+ \u03b2cycleLcycle\nsf\n+ \u03b2smoothLsmooth\nsf\nis\nthen added the total loss L, where we set \u03b2depth = 10\u22123,\n\u03b2cycle = 10\u22122, and \u03b2smooth = 10\u22123.\nD.2. Results with adding scene flow regularization\nWith the scene flow regularization Lsf, we can observe the\nimprovements on 3 sequences on the Nvidia dataset [78]\nin Table 6. Nevertheless, the synthesis quality degrades in\nthe other 4 sequences due to some distortions in the over-\nsmoothed dynamic depth Dd\n1..N. We found that the adjust-\nment of dynamic depth maps is still highly affected by the\ninitial depth estimates, and therefore it is not easy to obtain\nthe ideal depth that aligns with the actual groundtruth in\npractice. Furthermore, the scene flow regularization slows\nthe synthesis optimization process (15 \u2192 33 minutes). As a\nresult, we disable the scene flow regularization in our syn-\nthesis optimization by default. Despite some slight mis-\nalignments with the ground truth, our method can still yield\nvisually plausible synthesis results. To solve the ill-posed\ndynamic depth problem, a promising future direction is\nto improve the accuracy of single-depth estimators in true\nscale [6].\n14\nGround Truth\nOurs\nHyperNeRF [14]\nNSFF [31]\nDynNeRF [14]\nRoDynRF [38]\nMonoNeRF [66]\n4D-GS [75]\nGroundt Truth\nOurs\nHyperNeRF [14]\nNSFF [31]\nDynNeRF [14]\nRoDynRF [38]\nMonoNeRF [66]\n4D-GS [75]\nGround Truth\nOurs\nHyperNeRF [14]\nNSFF [31]\nDynNeRF [14]\nRoDynRF [38]\nMonoNeRF [66]\n4D-GS [75]\nFigure 10.

However, existing methods face chal-\nlenges in either achieving fine-grained, multi-granularity\nsegmentation or contending with substantial computational\noverhead, inhibiting real-time interaction.\nIn this pa-\nper, we introduce Segment Any 3D GAussians (SAGA),\na novel 3D interactive segmentation approach that seam-\nlessly blends a 2D segmentation foundation model with 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent breakthrough of ra-\ndiance fields.\nSAGA efficiently embeds multi-granularity\n2D segmentation results generated by the segmentation\nfoundation model into 3D Gaussian point features through\nwell-designed contrastive training. Evaluation on existing\nbenchmarks demonstrates that SAGA can achieve competi-\ntive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,\nSAGA achieves multi-granularity segmentation and accom-\nmodates various prompts, including points, scribbles, and\n2D masks.\nNotably, SAGA can finish the 3D segmenta-\ntion within milliseconds, achieving nearly 1000\u00d7 acceler-\nation1 compared to previous SOTA. The project page is at\nhttps://jumpat.github.io/SAGA.\n1. Introduction\nInteractive 3D segmentation in radiance fields has attracted\na lot of attention from researchers, due to its potential\napplications in various domains like scene manipulation,\nautomatic labeling, and virtual reality.\nPrevious meth-\nods [13, 25, 46, 47] predominantly involve lifting 2D visual\nfeatures into 3D space by training feature fields to imitate\nmulti-view 2D features extracted by self-supervised visual\nmodels [4, 39]. Then the 3D feature similarities are used\nto measure whether two points belong to the same object.\nBCorresponding author: wei.shen@sjtu.edu.cn\n1Concrete acceleration depends on specific scenes. For LLFF-Horns it\nis about 700\u00d7 (shown in Fig. 1) and for more complex scenes like LERF-\nfigurines it can reach about 5000\u00d7 (shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3).\nFigure 1. SAGA is a novel interactive 3D segmentation approach\nthat delivers precise 3D segmentation in milliseconds. Each seg-\nmentation result displays the computation time in seconds at the\nlower part, indicating the duration from the user\u2019s prompt input to\nthe acquisition of the segmentation result.\nSuch approaches are fast due to their simple segmentation\npipeline, but as a price, the segmentation granularity may be\ncoarse since they lack the mechanism for parsing the infor-\nmation embedded in the features (e.g., a segmentation de-\ncoder). In contrast, another paradigm [5] proposes to lift the\n2D segmentation foundation model to 3D by projecting the\nmulti-view fine-grained 2D segmentation results onto 3D\nmask grids directly. Though this approach can yield precise\nsegmentation results, its substantial time overhead restricts\ninteractivity due to the need for multiple executions of the\nfoundation model and volume rendering. Specifically, for\ncomplex scenes with multiple objects requiring segmenta-\ntion, this computational cost becomes unaffordable.\nThe above discussion reveals the dilemma of currently\nexisting paradigms in achieving both efficiency and accu-\nracy, pointing out two factors that limit the performance of\nexisting paradigms. First, implicit radiance fields employed\nby previous approaches [5, 13] hinder efficient segmenta-\n1\narXiv:2312.00860v1  [cs.CV]  1 Dec 2023\ntion: the 3D space must be traversed to retrieve a 3D ob-\nject. Second, the utilization of the 2D segmentation decoder\nbrings high segmentation quality but low efficiency.\nAccordingly, we revisit this task starting from the re-\ncent breakthrough in radiance fields: 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) has become a game changer because of its ability in\nhigh-quality and real-time rendering. It adopts a set of 3D\ncolored Gaussians to represent the 3D scene. The mean of\nthese Gaussians denotes their position in the 3D space thus\n3DGS can be seen as a kind of point cloud, which helps\nbypass the extensive processing of vast, often empty, 3D\nspaces and provides abundant explicit 3D prior. With this\npoint cloud-like structure, 3DGS not only realizes efficient\nrendering but also becomes as an ideal candidate for seg-\nmentation tasks.\nOn the basis of 3DGS, we propose to distill the fine-\ngrained segmentation ability of a 2D segmentation founda-\ntion model (i.e., the Segment Anything Model) into the 3D\nGaussians. This strategy marks a departure from previous\nmethods that focuses on lifting 2D visual features to 3D and\nenables fine-grained 3D segmentation. Moreover, it avoids\nthe time-consuming multiple forwarding of the 2D segmen-\ntation model during inference. The distillation is achieved\nby training 3D features for Gaussians based on automat-\nically extracted masks with the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) [23]. During inference, a set of queries are gener-\nated with input prompts, which, are then used to retrieve the\nexpected Gaussians through efficient feature matching.\nNamed as Segment Any 3D GAussians (SAGA), our ap-\nproach can achieve fine-grained 3D segmentation in mil-\nliseconds and support various kinds of prompts including\npoints, scribbles and masks. Evaluation on existing bench-\nmarks demonstrates the segmentation quality of SAGA is\non par with previous state-of-the-art.\nAs the first attempt of interactive segmentation in 3D\nGaussians, SAGA is versatile, accommodating a range of\nprompt types, including masks, points, and scribbles. Our\nevaluation on existing benchmarks demonstrates that SAGA\nperforms on par with the state-of-the-art. Notably, the train-\ning of Gaussian features typically concludes within merely\n5-10 minutes. Subsequently, the segmentation of most tar-\nget objects can be completed in milliseconds, achieving\nnearly 1000\u00d7 acceleration.\n2. Related Work\nPromptable 2D segmentation\nInspired by natural lan-\nguage processing and recent computer vision progress,\nKirillov et al. [23] proposed the task of promptable seg-\nmentation.\nThe goal of this task is to return segmenta-\ntion masks given input prompts that specify the segmen-\ntation target in an image.\nTo solve this problem, they\npresent the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a revolution-\nary segmentation foundation model. An analogous model to\nSAM is SEEM [55], which also exhibits impressive open-\nvocabulary segmentation capabilities.\nBefore them, the\nmost closely related task to promptable 2D segmentation\nis the interactive image segmentation, which have been ex-\nplored by many studies [3, 7, 14, 15, 29, 41, 43].\nLifting 2D Vision Foundation Models to 3D\nRecently,\n2D vision foundation models have experienced robust\ngrowth. In contrast, 3D vision foundation models have not\nseen similar development, primarily due to the scarcity of\ndata.\nAcquiring and annotating 3D data is significantly\nmore challenging than its 2D counterpart. To tackle this\nproblem, researchers attempted to lift 2D foundation mod-\nels to 3D [8, 16, 20, 22, 28, 38, 51, 53]. A noteworthy\nattempt is LERF [22], which trains a feature field of the\nVision-Language Model (i.e., CLIP [39]) together with the\nradiance field. Such paradigm helps locating objects in ra-\ndiance fields based on language prompts but falls short in\nprecise 3D segmentation, especially when faced with mul-\ntiple objects of similar semantics. The remaining methods\nmainly focus on point clouds. By associating the 3D point\ncloud with 2D multi-view images with the help of camera\nposes, the extracted features by 2D foundation models can\nbe projected to the 3D point cloud. Such integration is sim-\nilar to LERF but incurs a higher data acquisition cost com-\npared to radiance field-based methods.\n3D Segmentation in Radiance Fields\nInspired by the\nsuccess of radiance fields [1, 6, 10, 11, 18, 27, 32, 34,\n45, 49, 50], numerous studies have explored 3D segmen-\ntation within them.\nZhi et al. [54] proposes Semantic-\nNeRF, which demonstrates the potential of Neural Radi-\nance Field (NeRF) in semantic propagation and refinement.\nNVOS [40] introduces an interactive approach to select 3D\nobjects from NeRF by training a lightweight multi-layer\nperception (MLP) using custom-designed 3D features. By\nusing 2D self-supervised models, e.g. N3F [47], DFF [25],\nLERF [22] and ISRF [13], aim to lift 2D visual features\nto 3D by training additional feature fields that can output\n2D feature maps imitating the original 2D features in dif-\nferent views. NeRF-SOS [9] distills the 2D feature simi-\nlarities into 3D features with a correspondence distillation\nloss [17]. In these 2D visual feature-based approaches, 3D\nsegmentation can be achieved by comparing the 3D fea-\ntures embedded in the feature field, which appears to be\nefficient. However, since the information embedded in the\nhigh-dimensional visual features cannot be fully exploited\nwhen relying solely on Euclidean or cosine distances, the\nsegmentation quality of such methods is limited. There are\nalso some other instance segmentation and semantic seg-\nmentation approaches [2, 12, 19, 30, 35, 44, 48, 52] com-\nbined with radiance fields.\nTwo most closely related approach to our SAGA is\n2\nSAM\nencoder\nSAM\ndecoder\nMLP\n3D features\nSAM masks\nRasterization\nCorrespondence loss\nEq.

Given a pre-trained 3DGS model and its training set, we attach a low-dimensional 3D feature to each\nGaussian in the model. For every image within the training set, we employ SAM to extract 2D features and a set of masks. Then we\nrender 2D feature maps through the differentiable rasterization and train the attached features with two losses: i.e., the SAM-guidance loss\n(Eq. (7)) and the correspondence loss (Eq. (10)). The former adopts SAM features to guide the 3D features to learn 3D segmentation from\nthe ambiguous 2D masks. The latter distills the point-wise correspondence derived from the masks to enhance feature compactness.\nISRF [13] and SA3D [5]. The former follows the paradigm\nof training a feature field to imitate multi-view 2D 2D vi-\nsual features.\nThus it struggles with distinguishing dif-\nferent objects (especially parts of object) with similar se-\nmantics. The latter iteratively queries SAM to get 2D seg-\nmentation results and projecting them onto mask grids for\n3D segmentation. Though good segmentation quality, its\ncomplex segmentation pipeline leads to high time consump-\ntion and inhibits the interaction with users. Compared with\nthem, SAGA can handle multi-granularity 3D segmentation\nwithin milliseconds and achieve a better trade-off between\nthe segmentation quality and efficiency.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Preliminaries\n3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nAs a recent advancement\nof radiance fields, 3DGS [21] uses trainable 3D Gaussians\nto represent the 3D scene and proposes an efficient differ-\nentiable rasterization algorithm for rendering and training.\nGiven a training dataset I of multi-view 2D images with\ncamera poses, 3DGS learns a set of 3D colored Gaussians\nG = {g1, g2, ..., gN}, where N denotes the number of 3D\nGaussians in the scene. The mean of each Gaussian repre-\nsents its position in the 3D space and the covariance repre-\nsents the scale. Thus 3DGS can be regarded as a kind of\npoint cloud. Given a specific camera pose, 3DGS projects\nthe 3D Gaussians to 2D and then computes the color C of a\npixel by blending a set of ordered Gaussians N overlapping\nthe pixel:\nC =\nX\ni\u2208N\nci\u03b1i\ni\u22121\nY\nj=1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1j),\n(1)\nwhere ci is the color of each Gaussian and \u03b1i is given by\nevaluating a 2D Gaussian with covariance \u03a3 multiplied with\na learned per-Gaussian opacity. From Eq. (1) we can learn\nthe linearity of the rasterization process: the color of a ren-\ndered pixel is the weighted sum of the involved Gaussians.\nIn our framework, such characteristic ensures the alignment\nof 3D features with the 2D rendered features.\nSegment Anything Model (SAM)\nSAM [23] takes an\nimage I and a set of prompts P as input, and outputs the\ncorresponding 2D segmentation mask M, i.e.,\nM = SAM(I, P).\n(2)\n3.2. Overall Pipeline\nAs shown in Fig. 2, given a pre-trained 3DGS model G and\nits training set I, we first employ the SAM encoder to ex-\ntract a 2D feature map FSAM\nI\n\u2208 RCSAM\u00d7H\u00d7W and a set of\nmulti-granularity masks MSAM\nI\nfor each image I \u2208 RH\u00d7W\nin I. Then we train a low-dimensional feature fg \u2208 RC for\neach Gaussian g in G based on the extracted masks to ag-\ngregate the cross-view consistent multi-granularity segmen-\ntation information (C denotes the feature dimension and is\n3\nset to 32 in default). This is achieved by a carefully de-\nsigned SAM-guidance loss. To further enhance the feature\ncompactness, we derive point-wise correspondences from\nextracted masks and distills them into the features (i.e., the\ncorrespondence loss).\nIn the inference stage, for a specific view with camera\npose v2, a set of queries Q are generated based on the input\nprompts P. Then these queries are used to retrieve the 3D\nGaussians of the corresponding target by efficient feature\nmatching with the learned features. Additionally, we also\nintroduce an efficient post-processing operation that utilizes\nthe strong 3D prior provided by the point cloud-like struc-\nture of 3DGS to refine the retrieved 3D Gaussians.\n3.3. Training Features for Gaussians\nGiven a training image I with its specific camera pose v, we\nfirst render the corresponding feature map according to the\npre-trained 3DGS model G. Similar to Eq. (1), the rendered\nfeature Fr\nI,p of a pixel p is computed as:\nFr\nI,p =\nX\ni\u2208N\nfi\u03b1i\ni\u22121\nY\nj=1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1j),\n(3)\nwhere N is the ordered set of Gaussians overlapping the\npixel. During the training phase, we freeze all other at-\ntributes of the 3D Gaussians G (e.g., mean, covariance and\nopacity) except the newly attached features.\nSAM-guidance Loss\nThe automatically extracted 2D\nmasks MI via SAM are complex and confusing (i.e., a\npoint in the 3D space may be segmented as different ob-\njects / parts on different views). Such ambiguous supervi-\nsion signal poses a great challenge to training 3D features\nfrom scratch. To tackle this problem, we propose to use\nthe features generated by SAM for guidance. As shown in\nFig. 2, we first adopt an MLP \u03c6 to project the SAM features\nto the same low-dimensional space as the 3D features:\nF\u2032\nI = \u03c6(FSAM\nI\n).\n(4)\nThen for each extracted mask M in MSAM\nI\nwe obtain a cor-\nresponding query TM \u2208 RC with a masked average pool-\ning operation:\nTM =\n1\n||M||1\nHW\nX\np=1\n1(Mp = 1)F\u2032\nI,p,\n(5)\nwhere 1 denotes the indicator function. Then TM is used to\nsegment the rendered feature map Fr\nI through a softmaxed\npoint product:\nPM = \u03c3(TM \u00b7 Fr\nI),\n(6)\n2I is equivalent to v when used as a subscript, since there is a one-to-\none correspondence between the training image and its camera pose.\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the element-wise sigmoid function. The\nSAM-guidance loss is defined as the binary cross entropy\nbetween the segmentation result PM and the corresponding\nSAM extracted mask M:\nLSAM = \u2212\nX\nI\u2208I\nX\nM\u2208MI\nHW\nX\np\n[Mp log PM,p\n+ (1 \u2212 Mp) log(1 \u2212 PM,p)].\n(7)\nCorrespondence Loss\nIn practice, we find the learned\nfeatures with the SAM-guidance loss are not compact\nenough, which degrades the segmentation quality of various\nkinds of prompts (refer to the ablation study in Sec. 4 for\nmore details). Inspired by previous contrastive correspon-\ndence distillation methods [9, 17], we introduce the corre-\nspondence loss to tackle the problem.\nAs mentioned before, for each image I with height H\nand width W in the training set I, a set of masks MI are ex-\ntracted with SAM. Considering two pixels p1, p2 in I, they\nmay belong to many masks in MI. Let Mp1\nI , Mp2\nI denote\nthe masks that p1, p2 belong to respectively. Intuitively, if\nthe intersection over union of the two sets is larger, the two\npixels should share more similar features. Thus the mask\ncorrespondence KI(p1, p2) is defined as:\nKI(p1, p2) = |Mp1\nI \u2229 Mp2\nI |\n|Mp1\nI \u222a Mp2\nI |.\n(8)\nThe feature correspondence SI(p1, p2) between two pixels\np1, p2 is defined as the cosine similarity between their ren-\ndered features:\nSI(p1, p2) =< Fr\nI,p1, Fr\nI,p2 >,\n(9)\nthen the correspondence loss is defined as:\nLcorr = \u2212\nX\nI\u2208I\nHW\nX\np1\nHW\nX\np2\nKI(p1, p2)SI(p1, p2).\n(10)\nIf two pixels never belong to the same segment, we reduce\ntheir feature similarity by setting the 0-valued entries in KI\nto \u22121.\nWith the two components of the SAM-guidance loss\n(Eq. (7)) and the correspondence loss (Eq. (10)), the final\nloss of SAGA is:\nL = LSAM + \u03bbLcorr,\n(11)\nwhere \u03bb is a hyper-parameter for balancing the two loss\nterms (set to 1 in default).\n3.4. Inference\nThough the training is performed on the rendered feature\nmaps, the linearity of the rasterization operation (shown in\n4\nEq. (3)) ensures that the features in the 3D space are aligned\nwith the rendered features on the image plane. Thus, the\nsegmentation of the 3D Gaussians can be achieved with 2D-\nrendered features. This characteristic endows SAGA with\nthe compatibility with different kinds of prompts including\npoints, scribbles and masks. Moreover, we introduce an ef-\nficient post-processing algorithm (Sec. 3.5) based on the 3D\nprior provided by 3DGS.\nPoint Prompt\nWith a rendered feature map Fr\nv for a spe-\ncific view v, we generate queries for positive points and neg-\native points by directly retrieving their corresponding fea-\ntures on Fr\nv. Let Qp\nv and Qn\nv denote the Np positive queries\nand Nn negative queries respectively. For a 3D Gaussian g,\nits positive score Sp\ng is defined as the maximum cosine sim-\nilarity between its feature fg and the positive queries Qp\nv,\ni.e., max{< fg, Qp > |Qp \u2208 Qp\nv}. Similarly, the negative\nscore Sn\ng is defined as max{< fg, Qn > |Qn \u2208 Qn\nv}. The\n3D Gaussian belongs to the target Gt only if Sp\ng > Sn\ng.\nTo further filter out noisy Gaussians, an adaptive thresh-\nold \u03c4 is set to the positive score, i.e., g \u2208 Gt only if Sp\ng > \u03c4.\n\u03c4 is set as the mean of the maximum positive scores. Note\nthat such filtering may cause many false negatives, but can\nbe solved by the post-processing introduced in Sec. 3.5.\nMask And Scribble Prompts\nSimply treating the dense\nprompts as multiple points will lead to unaffordable GPU\nmemory overhead. Thus we employ the K-means algorithm\nto extract some positive queries Qp\nv and negative queries\nQn\nv from the dense prompts. The number of clusters of K-\nmeans is set to 5 empirically, but is adjustable according to\nthe complexity of the target object.\nSAM-based Prompt\nThe previous prompts are obtained\nfrom rendered feature maps. With the SAM-guidance loss,\nwe can directly use the low-dimensional SAM features F\u2032\nv\nfor generating queries. The input prompts are first fed into\nSAM for generating accurate 2D segmentation result Mref\nv .\nWith this 2D mask, we first obtain a query Qmask with the\nmasked average pooling and use this query to segment the\n2D rendered feature map Fr\nv to get a temporary 2D seg-\nmentation mask Mtemp\nv\n, which is then compared with Mref\nv .\nIf the intersecting region of Mtemp\nv\nand Mref\nv\noccupies a\nlarge proportion (90%, by default) of Mref\nv , Qmask\nv\nis ac-\ncepted as the query. Otherwise, we use the K-means algo-\nrithm to extract another set of queries Qkmeans\nv\nfrom the low-\ndimensional SAM features F\u2032\nv within the mask. We adopt\nsuch strategy because that the segmentation target may con-\ntain many components, which cannot be captured by simply\napplying the masked average pooling.\nAfter obtaining the query set QSAM\nv\n= {Qmask\nv\n} or\nQSAM\nv\n= Qkmeans\nv\n, the subsequent process is almost the same\nas the former prompt approaches. We use the point product\ninstead of the cosine similarity as the metric for segmenta-\ntion to align with the SAM-guidance loss. For a 3D Gaus-\nsian g, its positive score Sp\ng is defined as the maximum point\nproduct computed with these queries:\nSp\ng = max{fg \u00b7 Q|Q \u2208 QSAM\nv\n}.\n(12)\nThe 3D Gaussian g belongs to the segmentation target Gt\nif its positive score is greater than another adaptive thresh-\nold \u03c4 SAM, which is the sum of the mean and the standard\ndeviation of all scores SG = {Sp\ng|g \u2208 G}.\n3.5. 3D Prior Based Post-processing\nThe initial segmentation Gt of the 3D Gaussians exhibits\ntwo primary problems:\n(i) the presence of superfluous\nnoisy Gaussians and (ii) the omission of certain Gaus-\nsians integral to the target object.\nTo tackle the prob-\nlem, we utilize traditional point cloud segmentation tech-\nniques [36, 37, 42], including statistical filtering and re-\ngion growing. For segmentation based on point and scribble\nprompts, statistical filtering is employed to filter out noisy\nGaussians.\nFor mask prompts and SAM-based prompts,\nthe 2D mask is projected onto Gt to get a set of validated\nGaussians and projected onto G to exclude unwanted Gaus-\nsians. The resulting validated Gaussians serve as the seed\nfor the region-growing algorithm.\nFinally, a ball query-\nbased region growing method is applied to retrieve all re-\nquired Gaussians of the target from the original model G.\nStatistical Filtering\nThe distance between two Gaussians\ncan indicate whether they belong to the same target. Statisti-\ncal filtering begins by employing the K-Nearest Neighbors\n(KNN) algorithm to calculate the average distance of the\nnearest\np\n|Gt| Gaussians for each Gaussian within the seg-\nmentation result Gt. Subsequently, we compute the mean\n(\u00b5) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of these average distances\nacross all Gaussians in Gt. We then remove Gaussians with\nan average distance exceeding \u00b5 + \u03c3 to get Gt\u2032.\nRegion Growing Based Filtering\nThe 2D mask from\nmask prompt or SAM-based prompt can serve as a prior\nfor accurately localizing the target. Initially, we project the\nmask onto the segmented Gaussians Gt, yielding a subset of\nvalidated Gaussians, denoted as Gc. Subsequently, for each\nGaussian g within Gc, we compute its Euclidean distance\ndg to its closest neighbor in the same subset:\ndGc\ng = min{D(g, g\u2032)|g\u2032 \u2208 Gc},\n(13)\nwhere D(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes the Euclidean distance. Then we iter-\natively incorporate neighboring Gaussians in Gt whose dis-\ntances are less than the maximum nearest neighbor distance\nobserved in the set Gc, formalized as max{dGc\ng |g \u2208 Gc}.\n5\nTable 1.

Thus we only apply the region\ngrowing based filtering when a mask is available.\nBall Query Based Growing\nThe filtered segmentation\noutput Gt\u2032 may not contain all Gaussians belong to the tar-\nget. To address this problem, we utilize a ball query algo-\nrithm to retrieve all required Gaussians from all Gaussians\nG. Concretely, this is achieved by checking spherical neigh-\nborhoods with a radius r, centered at each Gaussian in Gt\u2032.\nGaussians that are located within these spherical boundaries\nin G are then aggregated into the final segmentation result\nGs. The radius r is set to be the maximum nearest neighbor\ndistance in Gt\u2032, i.e., r = max{dGt\u2032\ng |g \u2208 Gt\u2032}.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Datasets\nFor quantitative experiments, we use the Neural Volumetric\nObject Selection (NVOS) [40], SPIn-NeRF [33] datasets.\nThe NVOS [40] dataset is based on the LLFF dataset [31],\nwhich includes several forward-facing scenes.\nFor each\nscene, the NVOS dataset provides a reference view with\nscribbles and a target view with 2D segmentation masks\nannotated. Similarly, the SPIn-NeRF [33] dataset also an-\nnotates some data manually based on widely-used NeRF\ndatasets [11, 24, 26, 31, 32]. Futhermore, we also use SA3D\nto annotate some objects in the LERF-figurines scene to\ndemonstrate the better trade-off of efficiency and segmen-\ntation quality achieved by SAGA. For qualitative analysis,\nwe use the LLFF [31] dataset, the MIP-360 dataset [1], the\nT&T dataset [24] and the LERF dataset [22].\n4.2. Quantitative Results\nNVOS\nWe follow SA3D [5] to process the scribbles pro-\nvided by the NVOS dataset to meet the requirements of\nSAM. As shown in Table 1, SAGA is on par with previous\nTable 2.

This operation can be\nseen as a kind of mask prompt. The results are shown in Ta-\nble 2. MVSeg adopts the video segmentation approach [4]\nto segment the multi-view images and SA3D automatically\nqueries 2D segmentation foundation model for rendered im-\nages on the training views. Both of them need to forward\na 2D segmentation model for many times.\nRemarkably,\nSAGA shows comparable performance with them in nearly\none-thousandth of the time. Note that the slight degradation\nis caused by the sub-optimal geometry learned by 3DGS.\nPlease refer to Sec. 4.3 for more details.\nComparison with SA3D\nTo further demonstrate the ef-\nfectiveness of SAGA, we compare the segmentation time\nconsumption and the quality with SA3D. We run SA3D\nbased on the LERF-figurines scene to get a set of annota-\ntions for many objects. Subsequently we use SAGA to seg-\nment the same objects and check the IoU and time cost for\neach object. The results are shown in Table 3, We also pro-\nvide visualization results for comparison with SA3D, please\nrefer to Sec. 4.3 for more details. It is noteworthy to men-\ntion that limited by the huge GPU memory cost of SA3D,\nthe training resolution of SAGA is much higher. This in-\ndicates that SAGA can get 3D assets with higher quality in\nmuch less time. Even considering the training time (about\n10 minutes per scene), the average segmentation time for\neach object of SAGA is much less than SA3D.\n6\nFigure 3. Qualitative results of SAGA. Compared with SA3D, SAGA can achieve similar performance within one thousandth of the time.\nCompared with ISRF, SAGA can distinguish object with similar semantics and realize part segmentation. Furthermore, thanks to the\nefficient 3D Gaussian representation, the rendering quality of the segmented object is better than previous SOTA SA3D and ISRF.\n4.3. Qualitative Results\nWe begin by establishing that SAGA attains a segmentation\naccuracy on par with the prior SOTA, SA3D, while signif-\nicantly reducing time cost. Subsequently, we demonstrate\nthe enhanced performance of SAGA over ISRF, in both part\nand object segmentation tasks. Results are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe first row shows the segmentation results of SA3D\nand SAGA on the LERF-figurines scene, with segmenta-\ntion times annotated in the lower right of each segmented\nobject. The second row compares SAGA with ISRF, which\ntrains a feature field by imitating the 2D features extracted\nby a self-supervised vision transformer (e.g., DINO [4]).\nISRF struggles to differentiate between objects of similar\nsemantics, like parts of the T-Rex skeleton.\nIn contrast,\nSAGA distills the knowledge embedded in the SAM de-\ncoder into the feature field, thereby adeptly managing such\ncomplexities. Additional segmentation results for the MIP-\n360-counter [1] and T&T-truck [24] scenes are presented in\nthe third row. It\u2019s important to note the noise present at the\nperiphery of the segmented targets. This is attributed to the\ninherent properties of 3D Gaussians, where a certain Gaus-\nsian intersect multiple objects, particularly at the boundaries\nwhere different objects meet.\nFailure Cases\nIn Table 2, SAGA exhibits sub-optimal\nperformance compared to the previous state-of-the-art\nmethods. This is because of a segmentation failure of the\nLLFF-room scene, which reveals a limitation of SAGA. We\nshow the mean of the colored Gaussians in Fig. 4, which\nFigure 4. A failure case of SAGA. The upper-right part shows the\nsegmentation result, and the lower part shows the mean of Gaus-\nsians of the 3DGS model. The failure is caused by the incorrect\ngeometric structure of the learned Gaussians by 3DGS.\ncan be seen as a kind of point cloud. SAGA is susceptible\nto inadequate geometric reconstruction of the 3DGS model.\nAs marked by the red boxes, the Gaussians of the table is\nnotably sparse, where the Gaussians representing the table\nsurface are floating beneath the actual surface. Even worse,\nthe Gaussians from the chair are in close proximity to those\nof the table. These issues not only impede the learning of\ndiscriminative 3D features but also compromise the efficacy\nof the post-processing. We believe that enhancing the geo-\nmetric fidelity of the 3DGS model can ameliorate this issue.\n7\nTable 4.

Without this loss term, the learned features are not compact\nenough, which greatly impedes point prompt-based segmentation\nand mask prompt-based segmentation.\n4.4. Ablation Study\nLoss Terms\nOur loss function comprises two key compo-\nnents: 1) SAM-guidance loss and 2) Correspondence loss.\nWe demonstrate their efficacy quantitatively and qualita-\ntively. As shown in Table 4, the absence of SAM-guidance\nloss significantly hinders the performance of SAGA in com-\nplex scenes, such as LLFF-fern, due to the ambiguous na-\nture of the segmentation targets. Furthermore, as indicated\nin Fig. 5, excluding the correspondence loss leads to less\ncompact 3D features. This affects the effectiveness of vari-\nous kinds of prompts and makes the SAM-based prompt as\nthe sole effective approach.\nPost-processing\nAs shown in Fig. 6, without the post-\nprocessing there are some noisy Gaussians in the segmenta-\ntion result and the segmentation target (the flowers) seems\ntranslucent due to the missing Gaussians.\nComputation Consumption\nWe analyse the time cost of\nSAGA based on the T&T-truck scene [24] and the LERF-\nFigure 6.

Without the post-processing, the\nsegmentation result is noisy and incomplete.\nTable 5.\nComputation consumption analysis.\nThe number of\nGaussians indicates the scale of the scene and the corresponding\nsegmentation target.

The segmentation target for the for-\nmer is the truck and for the latter is the green apple on the\ntable. Both of them can be found in Fig. 3. As shown in\nTable 5, for large targets, the primary computation lies in\npost-processing. In contrast, for the smaller target, the time\ncost of Gaussians retrieving becomes the main consump-\ntion, which depends on the complexity of the scene.\n5. Limitation\nSAGA requires training features for 3D Gaussians, which\nmakes it more suitable for scenes with multiple objects to be\nsegmented than object-centric scenes. Besides, the primary\nlimitations of SAGA stem from 3DGS and SAM, which can\nbe summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The Gaussians learned by 3DGS are ambiguous without\nany constraint on geometry.\nA single Gaussian might\ncorrespond to multiple objects, complicating the task of\naccurately segmenting individual objects through feature\nmatching. We believe this issue can be alleviated by fu-\nture progress in the 3DGS representation.\n\u2022 The masks automatically extracted by SAM tend to ex-\nhibit a certain level of noise as a byproduct of the multi-\ngranularity characteristic. This can be alleviated by ad-\njusting the hyper-parameters involved in automatic mask\nextraction.\nAdditionally,\nit\u2019s important to note that the post-\nprocessing step in SAGA is semantic-agnostic, which may\nbring some false positive points into the segmentation re-\nsult. We leave this issue as future work.\n8\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce SAGA, a novel interactive 3D\nsegmentation method. As the first attempt of interactive\nsegmentation in 3D Gaussians, SAGA effectively distills\nknowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into\n3D Gaussians using two carefully designed losses.

In\nthis paper, we introduce StyleAligned, a novel technique de-\nsigned to establish style alignment among a series of gener-\nated images. By employing minimal \u2018attention sharing\u2019 dur-\ning the diffusion process, our method maintains style con-\nsistency across images within T2I models. This approach\nallows for the creation of style-consistent images using a\nreference style through a straightforward inversion opera-\ntion. Our method\u2019s evaluation across diverse styles and text\nprompts demonstrates high-quality synthesis and fidelity,\nunderscoring its efficacy in achieving consistent style across\nvarious inputs.\n1. Introduction\nLarge-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models [43,\n45, 51] have emerged as an essential tool across creative\ndisciplines, such as art, graphic design, animation, archi-\ntecture, gaming and more. These models show tremendous\ncapabilities of translating an input text into an appealing vi-\nsual result that is aligned with the input description.\nAn envisioned application of T2I models revolves\naround the rendition of various concepts in a way that shares\na consistent style and character, as though all were created\nby the same artist and method (see Fig. 1). While profi-\ncient in aligning with the textual description of the style,\nstate-of-the-art T2I models often create images that diverge\nsignificantly in their interpretations of the same stylistic de-\nscriptor, as depicted in Fig. 2.\nRecent methods mitigate this by fine-tuning the T2I\nmodel over a set of images that share the same style [16,55].\nThis optimization is computationally expensive and usually\n*Equal contribution.\n\u2020Equal Advising.\n\u201cToy train...\u201d\n\u201c Toy airplane...\u201d\n\u201c...drawing, vector art.\u201d\n\u201c...colorful, macro photo.\u201d\n\u201c...BW logo, high contrast.\u201d\n\u201c...poster, ilustration.\u201d\n\u201c Toy bicycle...\u201d\n\u201c Toy car...\u201d\nFigure 1.

By fusing the fea-\ntures of the toy train image (left) during the diffusion process, we\ncan generate an image set of different content that shares the style.\nrequires human input in order to find a plausible subset of\nimages and texts that enables the disentanglement of con-\ntent and style.\nWe introduce StyleAligned, a method that enables con-\nsistent style interpretation across a set of generated images\n(Fig. 1). Our method requires no optimization and can\nbe applied to any attention-based text-to-image diffusion\nmodel. We show that adding minimal attention sharing op-\nerations along the diffusion process, from each generated\nimage to the first one in a batch, leads to a style-consistent\nset. Moreover, using diffusion inversion, our method can\nbe applied to generate style-consistent images given a ref-\nerence style image, with no optimization or fine-tuning.\narXiv:2312.02133v2  [cs.CV]  11 Jan 2024\nStyle Aligned\nStandard Text-to-Image\nFigure 2. Standard text-to-image vs. StyleAligned set gener-\nation. Given style description of \u201cminimal origami\u201d, standard\ntext-to-image generation (top) results with an unaligned image set\nwhile our method (bottom) can generate variety of style aligned\ncontent.\nWe present our results over diverse styles and text\nprompts, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity\nto the prompts and reference style. We show diverse ex-\namples of generated images that share their style with a\nreference image that can possibly be a given input image.\nImportantly, our technique stands as a zero-shot solution,\ndistinct from other personalization techniques, as it oper-\nates without any form of optimization or fine-tuning. For\nour code and more examples, please visit the project page\nstyle-aligned-gen.github.io\n2. Related Work\nText-to-image generation. Text conditioned image gen-\nerative models [10,37,44] show unprecedented capabilities\nof generating high quality images from text descriptions.\nIn particular, T2I diffusion models [41, 44, 52] are pushing\nthe state of the art and they are quickly adopted for differ-\nent generative visual tasks like inpainting [5, 50], image-\nto-image translation [61, 66], local image editing [12, 28],\nsubject-driven image generation [48,57] and more.\nAttention Control in diffusion models. Hertz et al. [20]\nhave shown how cross and self-attention maps within the\ndiffusion process determine the layout and content of the\ngenerated images. Moreover, they showed how the atten-\ntion maps can be used for controlled image generation.\nOther studies have leveraged modifications in attention lay-\ners to enhance the fidelity or diversity of generated im-\nages\n[11, 40], or apply attention control for image edit-\ning [8, 15, 36, 38, 39, 59]. However, in contrast to prior\napproaches that primarily enable structure-preserving im-\nage editing, our method excels at generating images with\ndiverse structures and content while maintaining a consis-\ntent style interpretation.\nStyle Transfer. Transferring a style from a reference im-\nage to a target content image is well studied subject in com-\nputer graphics. Classic works [13, 14, 22, 31] rely on opti-\nmization of handcrafted features and texture resampling al-\ngorithms from an input texture image, combined with struc-\nture constrains of a content image. With the progress of\ndeep learning research, another line of works utilizes deep\nneural priors for style transfer optimization using deep fea-\ntures of pre-trained networks [18,58], or injecting attention\nfeatures from a style image to a target one [4]. More re-\nlated to our approach, Huang et al. [26] introduced a real\ntime style transfer network based on Adaptive Instance Nor-\nmalization layers (AdaIN) that are used to normalize deep\nfeatures of a target image using deep features statistics of\na reference style image.\nFollow-up works, employ the\nAdaIN layer for additional unsupervised learning tasks, like\nstyle-based image generation [29] and Image2Image trans-\nlation [27,34].\nT2I Personalization To generalize T2I over new vi-\nsual concepts, several works developed different optimiza-\ntion techniques over a small collection of input images that\nshare the same concept [16, 19, 48, 62]. In instances where\nthe collection shares a consistent style, the acquired con-\ncept becomes the style itself, affecting subsequent gen-\nerations.\nMost close to our work is StyleDrop [55], a\nstyle personalization method that relies on fine-tuning of\nlight weight adapter layers [24] at the end of each atten-\ntion block in a non-autoregressive generative text-to-image\ntransformer [10]. StyleDrop can generate a set of images\nin the same style of by training the adapter layers over a\ncollection of images that share the same style. However,\nit struggles to generate a consistent image set of different\ncontent when training on a single image.\nOur method can generate a consistent image set without\noptimization phase and without relying on several images\nfor training. To skip the training phase, recent works devel-\noped dedicated personalization encoders [17,32,53,65,66]\nthat can directly inject new priors from a single input im-\nage to the T2I model. However, these methods encounter\nchallenges to disentangle style from content as they focus\non generating the same subject as in the input image.\n3.

Preliminaries\nDiffusion models [23, 54] are generative latent variable\nmodels that aim to model a distribution p\u03b8(x0) that approx-\nimates the data distribution q(x0) and are easy to sample\nfrom. Diffusion models are trained to reverse the diffusion\n\u201cforward process\u201d:\nxt = \u221a\u03b1tx0 +\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03b1t\u03f5, \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I),\nwhere t \u2208 [0, \u221e) and the values of \u03b1t are determined by a\nscheduler such that \u03b10 = 1 and limt\u2192\u221e \u03b1t = 0. During\ninference, we sample an image by gradually denoising an\ninput noise image xT \u223c N(0, I) via the reverse process:\nxt\u22121 = \u00b5t\u22121 + \u03c3tz, z \u223c N(0, I),\nwhere the value of \u03c3t is determined by the sampler and \u00b5t\u22121\nis given by\n\u00b5t\u22121 =\n\u221a\u03b1t\u22121xt\n\u221a\u03b1t\n+\n\u0012p\n1 \u2212 \u03b1t\u22121 \u2212\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u03b1t\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0013\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t),\nwhere \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) is the output of a diffusion model parame-\nterized by \u03b8.\nMoreover, this process can be generalized for learning\na marginal distribution using an additional input condition.\nThat leads text-to-image diffusion models (T2I), where the\noutput of the model \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, y) is conditioned on a text\nprompt y.\nSelf-Attention in T2I Diffusion Models. State-of-the-\nart T2I diffusion models [7,41,52] employ a U-Net architec-\nture [46] that consists of convolution layers and transformer\nattention blocks [60]. In these attention mechanisms, deep\nW.O.

Sharing the self\u2013attention between all images in the set (bot-\ntom) results with some diversity loss (style collapse across many\nseeds) and content leakage within each set (colors from one image\nleak to another). Disabling the queries\u2013keys AdaIN opeartion re-\nsults with less consistent image sets compared to our full method\n(top) which keeps on both diversity between different sets and con-\nsistency within each set.\nimage features \u03d5 \u2208 Rm\u00d7dh attend to each other via self-\nattention layers and to contextual text embedding via cross-\nattention layers.\nOur work operates at the self-attention layers where deep\nfeatures are being updated by attending to each other. First,\nthe features are projected into queries Q \u2208 m \u00d7 dk, keys\nK \u2208 m \u00d7 dk and values V \u2208 m \u00d7 dh through learned lin-\near layers. Then, the attention is computed by the scaled\ndot-product attention:\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax\n\u0012QKT\n\u221adk\nV\n\u0013\n,\nwhere dk is the dimension of Q and K. Intuitively, each\nimage feature is updated by a weighted sum of V , where\nthe weight depends on the correlation between the projected\nquery q and the keys K. In practice, each self-attention\nlayer consists of several attention heads, and then the resid-\nual is computed by concatenating and projecting the atten-\ntion heads output back to the image feature space dh:\n\u02c6\u03d5 = \u03d5 + Multi-Head-Attention(\u03d5).\n3.2. Style Aligned Image Set Generation\nThe goal of our method is to generate a set of images\nI1 . . . In that are aligned with an input set of text prompts\ny1 . . . yn and share a consistent style interpretation with\neach other. For example, see the garnered image set of toy\nobjects in Fig. 3 that are style-aligned with each other and\nto the input text on top. A na\u00a8\u0131ve way to generate a style\naligned image set of different content is to use the same\nstyle description in the text prompts. As can be seen at the\nbottom of Fig. 2, generating different images using a shared\nstyle description of \u201cin minimal origami style\u201d results in an\nunaligned set, since each image is unaware of the exact ap-\npearance of other images in the set during the generation\nprocess.\nThe key insight underlying our approach is the utiliza-\ntion of the self-attention mechanism to allow communica-\ntion among various generated images. This is achieved by\nsharing attention layers across the generated images.\nFormally, let Qi, Ki, and Vi be the queries, keys, and\nvalues, projected from deep features \u03d5i of Ii in the set, then,\nthe attention update for \u03d5i is given by:\nAttention(Qi, K1...n, V1...n),\n(1)\nwhere K1...n =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nK1\nK2\n...\nKn\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb and V1...n =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nV1\nV2\n...\nVn\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb. However, we\nhave noticed that by enabling full attention sharing, we may\nharm the quality of the generated set. As can be seen in\nFig. 5 (bottom rows), full attention sharing results in content\nleakage among the images. For example, the unicorns got\ngreen paint from the garnered dino in the set. Moreover, full\nattention sharing results with less diverse sets of the same\nset of prompts, see the two sets in Fig. 5 in bottom rows\ncompared to the sets above.\nTo restrict the content leakage and allow diverse sets, we\nshare the attention to only one image in the generated set\n0.245\n0.250\n0.255\n0.270\n0.275\n0.28\n0.285\n0.29\n0.295\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n// //\nT2I Reference\nSDRP\n(SDXL)\nSDRP\n(unofficial)\nDB\u2013LoRA\nOurs (full)\nOurs\n(W.O.

We compare the results of\nthe different methods (blue marks) and our ablation experiments\n(orange marks) in terms of text alignment (CLIP score) and set\nconsistency (DINO embedding similarity).\n(typically the first in the batch). That is, target image fea-\ntures \u03d5t are attending to themselves and to the features of\nonly one reference image in the set using Eq. 1. As can be\nseen in Fig. 5 (middle), sharing the attention to only one\nimage in the set results in diverse sets that share a similar\nstyle. However, in that case, we have noticed that the style\nof different images is not well aligned. We suspect that this\nis due to low attention flow from the reference to the target\nimage.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, to enable balanced attention ref-\nerence, we normalize the queries Qt and keys Kt of the\ntarget image using the queries Qr and keys Kr of the ref-\nerence image using the adaptive normalization operation\n(AdaIN) [26]:\n\u02c6\nQt = AdaIN(Qt, Qr)\n\u02c6\nKt = AdaIN(Kt, Kr),\nwhere the AdaIn operation is given by:\nAdaIN (x, y) = \u03c3 (y)\n\u0012x \u2212 \u00b5(x)\n\u03c3(x)\n\u0013\n+ \u00b5y,\nand \u00b5(x), \u03c3(x) \u2208 Rdk are the mean and the standard devia-\ntion of queries and keys across different pixels. Finally, our\nshared attention is given by\nAttention( \u02c6\nQt, KT\nrt, Vrt),\nwhere Krt =\n\u0014Kr\n\u02c6\nKt\n\u0015\nand Vrt =\n\u0014Vr\nVt\n\u0015\n.\n4. Evaluations and Experiments\nWe have implemented our method over Stable Diffusion\nXL (SDXL) [41] by applying our attention sharing overall\n70 self-attention layers of the model. The generation of a\nfour images set takes 29 seconds on a single A100 GPU.\nNotice that since the generation of the reference image is\nTable 1. User evaluation for style aligned image set generation.\nIn each question, the user was asked to select between two image\nsets, Which is better in terms of style consistency and match to the\ntext descriptions (see Sec. 4). We report the percentage of judg-\nments in favor of StyleAligned over 800 answers (2400 in total).\nStyleDrop\n(unofficial MUSE)\nStyleDrop\n(SDXL)\nDreamBooth\u2013LoRA\n(SDXL)\n85.2 %\n67.1 %\n61.3%\nnot influenced by other images in the batch, we can generate\nlarger sets by fixing the prompt and seed of the reference\nimage across the set generation.\nFor example, see the sets in Fig. 2 and 3.\nEvaluation set. With the support of ChatGPT,we have\ngenerated 100 text prompts describing different image\nstyles over four random objects. For example, \u201c{A guitar,\nA hot air balloon, A sailboat, A mountain} in papercut art\nstyle.\u201d For each style and set of objects, we use our method\nto generate a set of images. The full list of prompts is pro-\nvided in the appendix.\nMetrics. To verify that each generated image contains\nits specified object, we measure the CLIP cosine similar-\nity [42] between the image and the text description of the\nobject. In addition, we evaluate the style consistency of\neach generated set, by measuring the pairwise average co-\nsine similarity between DINO VIT-B/8 [9] embeddings of\nthe generated images in each set. Following [47, 62], we\nused DINO embeddings instead of CLIP image embeddings\nfor measuring image similarity, since CLIP was trained with\nclass labels and therefore it might give a high score for dif-\nferent images in the set that have similar content but with\na different style. On the other hand, DINO better distin-\nguishes between different styles due to its self-supervised\ntraining.\n4.1. Ablation Study\nThe quantitative results are summarized in Fig. 6, where\nthe right\u2013top place on the chart means better text similar-\nity and style consistency, respectively. As a reference, we\nreport the score obtained by generating the set of images\nusing SDXL (T2I Reference) using the same seeds without\nany intervention. As can be seen, our method achieves a\nmuch higher style consistency score at the expense of text\nsimilarity. See qualitative comparison in Fig. 2.\nIn addition, we compared our method to additional two\nvariants of the shared attention as described in Sec. 3.2. The\nfirst variant uses full attention sharing (Full Attn. Share)\nwhere the keys and values are shared between each pair of\nimages in the set. In the second variant (W.A. AdaIN) we\nomit the AdaIN operation over queries and keys. As ex-\npected, this Full Attn. Share variant, results with higher\nstyle consistency and lower text alignment.

Varying level of attention sharing. By reducing the\nnumber of shared attention layers, i.e., allowing only self-attention\nin part of the layers, we can get more varied results (bottom rows)\nat the expense of style alignment (top row).\nin Fig. 5, Full Attn. Share harms the overall quality of the\nimage sets and diversity across sets. Moreover, our method\nwithout the use of AdaIN results in much lower style con-\nsistency. Qualitative results can be seen in Fig. 5.\n4.2. Comparisons\nFor baselines, we compare our method to T2I person-\nalization methods. We trained StyleDrop [55] and Dream-\nBooth [47] over the first image in each set of our evalua-\ntion data, and use the trained personalized weights to gen-\nerate the additional three images in each set.\nWe use a\npublic unofficial implementation of StyleDrop 1 (SDRP\u2013\nunofficial) over non-regressive T2I model. Due to the large\nquality gap between the unofficial MUSE model 2 to the\nofficial one [10], we follow StyleDrop and implement an\nadapter model over SDXL (SDRP\u2013SDXL), where we train\na low rank linear layer after each Feed-Forward layer at\nthe model\u2019s attention blocks. For training DreamBooth, we\nadapt the LoRA [25, 49] variant (DB\u2013LoRA) over SDXL\nusing the public huggingface\u2013diffusers implementation 3.\nWe follow the hyperparameters tuning reported in [55] and\ntrain both SDRP\u2013SDXL and DB\u2013LoRA for 400 steps to\nprevent overfitting to the style training image.\n1github.com/aim-uofa/StyleDrop-PyTorch\n2github.com/baaivision/MUSE-Pytorch\n3github.com/huggingface/diffusers\nAs can be seen in the qualitative comparison, Fig. 7, the\nimage sets generated by our method, are more consistent\nacross style attributes like color palette, drawing style, com-\nposition, and pose.\nMoreover, the personalization-based\nmethods may leak the content of the training reference im-\nage (on the left) when generating the new images. For ex-\nample, see the repeated woman and dogs in the results of\nDB\u2013LoRA and SDRP\u2013SDXL at the second row or the re-\npeated owl at the bottom row. Similarly, because of the con-\ntent leakage, these methods obtained lower text similarity\nscores and higher set consistency scores compared to our\nmethod.\nWe also apply two encoder-based personalization meth-\nods ELITE [64], IP\u2013Adapter [66], and BLIP\u2013Diffusion [32]\nover our evaluation set. These methods receive as input the\nfirst image in each set and use its embeddings to generate\nimages with other content. Unlike the optimization-based\ntechniques, these methods operate in a much faster feed-\nforward diffusion loop, like our method. However, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 6, their performance for style aligned image\ngeneration is poor compared to the other baselines. We ar-\ngue that current encoder-based personalization techniques\nstruggle to disentangle the content and the style of the input\nimage. We supply qualitative results in appendix C.\nUser Study.\nIn addition to the automatic evalua-\nReference image\nA car\nA cat\nA cactus\nFigure 9. Style aligned image generation to an input image.\nGiven an input reference image (left column) and text description,\nwe first apply DDIM inversion over the image to get the inverted\ndiffusion trajectory xT , xT \u22121 . . . x0. Then, starting from xT and\na new set of prompts, we apply our method to generate new content\n(right columns) with an aligned style to the input.\ntion, we conducted a user study over the results of our\nmethod, StyleDrop (unofficial MUSE), StyleDrop (SDXL),\nand DreamBooth\u2013LoRA (SDXL). In each question, we ran-\ndomly sample one of the evaluation examples and show\nthe user the 4 image set that resulted from our and another\nmethod (in a random order). The user had to choose which\nset is better in terms of style consistency, and text align-\nment. A print screen of the user study format is provided\nin the appendix. Overall, we collected 2400 answers from\n100 users using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service. The\nresults are summarized in Tab. 1 where for each method, we\nreport the percentage of judgments in our favor. As can be\nseen, most participants favored our method by a large mar-\ngin. More information about our user study can be found in\nappendix D.\n4.3. Additional Results\nStyle Alignment Control. We provide means of control\nover the style alignment to the reference image by applying\nthe shared attention over only part of the self-attention lay-\ners. As can be seen in Fig. 8, reducing the number of shared\nattention layers results with a more diverse image set, which\nstill shares common attributes with the reference image.\nStyleAligned from an Input Image. To generate style-\naligned images to an input image, we apply DDIM inver-\nsion [56] using a provided text caption. Then, we apply our\nmethod to generate new images in the style of the input us-\ning the inverted diffusion trajectory xT , xT \u22121, . . . x0 for the\nreference image. Examples are shown in Fig. 9 ,13, where\nwe use BLIP captioning [33] to get a caption for each in-\nput image. For example, we used the prompt \u201cA render of\na house with a yellow roof\u201d for the DDIM inversion of the\ntop example and replaced the word house with other ob-\njects to generate the style-aligned images of a car, a cat,\nand a cactus. Notice that this method does not require any\noptimization. However, DDIM inversion may fail [36] or\nresults with an erroneous trajectory [28]. More results and\nanalysis, are provided in appendix A\nShared Self-Attention Visualization. Figure 10 depicts\nthe self-attention probabilities from a generated target im-\nage to the reference style image. In each of the rows, we\npick a point on the image and depict the associated proba-\nbilities map for the token at this particular point. Notably\nprobabilities mapped on the reference image are semanti-\ncally close to the query point location. This suggests that the\nself-attention tokens sharing do not perform a global style\ntransfer, but rather match the styles in a semantically mean-\ningful way [4]. In addition, Figure 11 visualizes the three\nlargest components of the average shared attention maps of\nthe rhino image, encoded in RGB channels. Note that the\nshared attention map is composed of both self-attention and\ncross-image attention to the giraffe. As can be seen, the\ncomponents highlight semantically related regions like the\nKey locations\nProbabilities map\n\u201cA car \u2026\u201d\n\u201cA train,\nsimple wooden statue\u201d\n\u201cA bull \u2026\u201d\nFigure 10.

Since our method\ndoesn\u2019t require training or optimization, it can be easily\ncombined on top of other diffusion based methods to gen-\nerate style-consistent image sets.\nFig. 12 shows several\nsuch examples where we combine our method with Control-\nNet [67], DreamBooth [48] and MultiDiffusion [6]. More\nexamples and details about the integration of StyleAligned\nwith other methods can be found in appendix B.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have presented StyleAligned, which addresses the\nchallenge of achieving style-aligned image generation\nwithin the realm of large-scale Text-to-Image models.\nBy introducing minimal attention sharing operations with\nAdaIN modulation during the diffusion process, our method\nReference image\nPersonalized \ncontent\nReference image\nLeft reference \nContolNet \nMultiDiffusion\nDreamBooth\nRight reference\nDepth \ncondition\nFigure 12.\nStyleAligned with other methods.\nOn top,\nStyleAligned is combined with ControlNet to generate style-\naligned images conditioned on depth maps. In the middle, our\nmethod combined with MultiDiffusion to generate panorama im-\nages that share multiple styles. On the bottom, style consistent and\npersonalized content created by combining our method with pre-\ntrained personalized DreamBooth\u2013LoRA models.\nsuccessfully establishes style-consistency and visual coher-\nence across generated images. The demonstrated efficacy\nof StyleAligned in producing high-quality, style-consistent\nimages across diverse styles and textual prompts under-\nscores its potential in creative domains and practical appli-\ncations. Our results affirm StyleAligned capability to faith-\nfully adhere to provided descriptions and reference styles\nwhile maintaining impressive synthesis quality.\nIn the future we would like to explore the scalability and\nadaptability of StyleAligned to have more control over the\nshape and appearance similarity among the generated im-\nages. Additionally, due to the limitation of current diffu-\nsion inversion methods, a promising direction is to leverage\nStyleAligned to assemble a style-aligned dataset which then\ncan be used to train style condition text-to-image models.\n6.

StyleAligned from an Input Image\nFigure 13 shows our techniques being applied for style\ntransfer for the Peter Bruegels\u2019 \u201dThe Tower of Babel\u201d to\nmultiple places around the world. As for the prompt we\nalways use the places\u2019 followed by \u201dPieter Bruegel Paint-\ning\u201d, e.g.\u201cRome Coliseum, Pieter Bruegel Painting\u201d. Even\nthough the original masterpiece is known to model, it fails\nto reproduce its style with only text guidance. Fig. 14 shows\nsome of the places generated with the direct instruction to\nresemble the original painting, without self-attention shar-\ning. Notably, the model fails to produce an accurate style\nalignment with the original picture.\nFurther examples of style transferring from real exam-\nples are presented in Figures 17 and 18.\nWe also noticed that once the style transfer is performed\nfrom an extremely famous image, the default approach may\nsometimes completely ignore the target prompt, generating\nan image almost identical to the reference. We suppose that\nthis happens because the outputs of the denoising model for\nthe famous reference image have very high confidence and\nactivations magnitudes. Thus in the shared self-attention,\nmost of the attention is taken by the reference keys. To com-\npensate for it, we propose the simple trick of the attention\nscores rescaling. In the self-attention sharing mechanism,\nfor some fixed scale \u03bb < 1, we rescale the queries and\nkeys products conducting the new scores \u03bb \u00b7 \u27e8Q, Ktarget\u27e9.\nWe apply this only to the reference image keys. First, this\nsuppresses extra-high keys. Also, this makes the attention\nscores more uniformly distributed, encouraging the gener-\nated image to capture style aggregated from the whole ref-\nerence image.\nFig. 15 demonstrates the rescaling factor\nvariation effect for the particularly popular reference \u201dStarr\nNight\u201d by Van Gogh. Notably, without rescaling, the model\ngenerates an image almost identical to the reference, while\nthe scale relaxation produces a plausible transfer.\nB. Integration with Other Methods\nBelow, we show different examples where our method\ncan provide style aligned image generation capability on top\nof different diffusion-based image generation methods.\nStyle Aligned Subject Driven Generation. To use our\nmethod on top of a personalized diffusion model, first, given\na collection of images (3-6) of the personalized content, we\nfollow DreamBooth\u2013LoRA training [25,48] where the lay-\ners of the attention layers are fine-tuned via low-rank adap-\ntation weights (LoRA). Then, during inference, we apply\nour method by sharing the attention of personalized gener-\nated images with a generated reference style image. During\nthis process, the LoRA weights are used only for the gen-\neration of personalized content. Examples of style aligned\npersonalized images are shown in Fig.\nThe results of our\nmethod on top of different personalized models are shown\nin Fig. 19 where in each column we fine-tuned the SDXL\nmodel over the image collection on top and generated the\npersonalized content with the reference images on the left.\nIt can be seen that in some cases, like in the backpack\nphotos on the right, the subject in the image remains in\nthe same style as in the original photos. This is a known\nlimitation of training-based personalization methods [57]\nwhich we believe can be improved by applying our method\nover other T2I personalization techniques [19, 30] or more\ncareful search for training hyperparameters that allow better\ngeneralization of the personalized model to different styles.\nStyle Aligned MultiDiffusion Image Generation. Bar\net al. [6] presented MultiDiffusion, a method for generat-\ning images in any resolution by aggregating diffusion pre-\ndictions of overlapped squared crops. Our method can be\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"l6v7b8WEz3KlQh/xTtq1s64OQWE=\">AB7nicbVDLSsNA\nFL2pr1pfVZduBovgqiQi6rLoxmUF+4A2lJvJpB06mYSZiVBCP8KNC0Xc+j3u/BunbRbaemDgcM65zL0nSAXxnW/ndLa+sbmVnm7srO7t39QPTxq6yRTlLVoIhLVDVAzwSVrGW4\nE6aKYRwI1gnGdzO/8SU5ol8NJOU+TEOJY84RWOlTl/YaIiDas2tu3OQVeIVpAYFmoPqVz9MaBYzahArXuemxo/R2U4FWxa6WeapUjHOGQ9SyXGTPv5fN0pObNKSKJE2ScNma\nu/J3KMtZ7EgU3GaEZ62ZuJ/3m9zEQ3fs5lmhkm6eKjKBPEJGR2Owm5YtSIiSVIFbe7EjpChdTYhiq2BG/5FXSvqh7V/XLh8ta47aowncArn4ME1NOAemtACmN4hld4c1Lnx\nXl3PhbRklPMHMfOJ8/P7OPhg=</latexit>\u03bb\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"DSs/otLGM3tGcbw7Y+b2owP1uy4=\">AB6HicbVBNS8NAEJ3Ur1q/qh69LBbBU0mkqMeiF48t2FpoQ9l\nsJ+3azSbsboQS+gu8eFDEqz/Jm/GbZuDtj4YeLw3w8y8IBFcG9f9dgpr6xubW8Xt0s7u3v5B+fCoreNUMWyxWMSqE1CNgktsGW4EdhKFNAoEPgTj25n/8IRK81jem0mCfkSHkoecUWOlptcvV9yqOwdZJV5OKpCj0S9/9QYxSyOUhgmqdzE+NnVBnOBE5LvVRjQtmYDrF\nrqaQRaj+bHzolZ1YZkDBWtqQhc/X3REYjrSdRYDsjakZ62ZuJ/3nd1ITXfsZlkhqUbLEoTAUxMZl9TQZcITNiYglitbCRtRZmx2ZRsCN7y6ukfVH1Lqu1Zq1Sv8njKMIJnMI5eHAFdbiDBrSAcIzvMKb8+i8O/Ox6K14OQzx/AHzucPfYuMvg=</latexit>1\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"V+zfGDil62ZaIhKQ8N0P64yoyzE=\">AB63icbVBNS8NAEJ3Ur1q/qh69LBbBU0hErceiF48V7Ae0oWy2m3bp7ibsboQS+he8eFDEq3/Im/GTZuDtj4YeLw3w8y8MOFMG8/7dkpr6xubW+Xtys7u3v5B9fCoreNUEdoiMY9VN8SaciZpyzDa\nTdRFIuQ04ucv9zhNVmsXy0UwTGg8kixiBJtc8tz61aBa81xvDrRK/ILUoEBzUP3qD2OSCioN4Vjrnu8lJsiwMoxwOqv0U0TCZ4RHuWSiyoDrL5rTN0ZpUhimJlSxo0V39PZFhoPRWh7RTYjPWyl4v/eb3URDdBxmSGirJYlGUcmRilD+OhkxRYvjUEkwUs7ciMsYKE2PjqdgQ/OWXV0n7wvWv3cuHy1rjtoijDCdwCufgQx0acA9NaAGBMTzDK7w5wnlx3p2PRWvJKWaO4Q+czx/VU41</latexit>0.75\nFigure 15. Reference attention rescaling factor variation used\nfor extremely popular reference image assets.\nused on top of MultiDiffusion by enabling our shared at-\ntention between the crops to a reference image that is gen-\nerated in parallel. Fig. 20 shows style aligned panorama\nimages generated with MultiDiffusion in conjunction with\nour method using the public implementation of MultiDiffu-\nsion over Stable Diffusion V2 [3]. Notice that compared\nto a vanilla MultiDiffusion image generation (small im-\nages in 20), our method not only enables the generation of\nstyle aligned panoramas but also helps to preserve the style\nwithin each image.\nStyleAligned with Additional Conditions. Lastly, we\nshow how our method can be combined with ContolNet [67]\nwhich enriches the conditioning signals of diffusion text-\nto-image generation to include additional inputs, like depth\nmap and pose. ContolNet injects the additional informa-\ntion by predicting residual features that are added to the\ndiffusion image features outputs of the down and middle\nU-Net blocks. Similar to previous modifications, we ap-\nply StyleAligned image generation by sharing the attention\nof ControlNet conditioned images to a reference image that\nisn\u2019t conditioned on additional input. Fig. 21 shows style\naligned image set (different rows) that are conditioned on\ndepth maps (different columns) using ControlNet depth en-\ncoder over SDXL [1]. Fig. 22 shows style aligned image\nset (different rows) that are conditioned on pose estimation\nobtained by OpenPose [63] (different columns) using Con-\ntrolNet pose encoder over SDXL [2].\nC. Additional Comparisons\nWe provide additional comparisons of our method to\nencoder-based text-to-image personalization methods and\nediting approaches over the evaluation set presented in Sec-\ntion 4 in the main paper. Table 2 summarized the full quan-\ntitative results presented in the paper and here.\nEncoder Based Approaches As reported in the paper,\nwe compare our method to encoder-based text-to-image\npersonalization methods:\nBLIP-Diffusion [32], ELITE\n[64], and IP-Adapter [66]. These methods train an image\nencoder and fine-tune the T2I diffusion model to be condi-\ntioned on visual input. Fig. 23 shows a qualitative compar-\nison on the same set shown in the paper (Fig. 7). As can be\nseen, our image sets are more consistent and aligned to the\nreference. Notice that, currently, only IP-Adapter provides\nan encoder model for Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). Nev-\nTable 2. Full quantitative comparison for style aligned image\ngeneration.

Quantitative Comparison to zero shot editing ap-\nproaces. We compare the results of the different methods in terms\nof text alignment (CLIP score) and set consistency (DINO embed-\nding similarity).\nZero Shot Editing Approaches Other baselines that can\nbe used for style aligned image set generation are diffusion-\nbased editing methods when applied over the reference\nimages. However, unlike our method, these methods as-\nsume structure preservation of the input image.\nWe re-\nport the results of two diffusion-based editing approaches:\nSDEdit [35] and Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) [21] in Fig. 16.\nNotice that similar to our method, these methods provide a\nlevel of control that trade-off between alignment to text and\nalignment to the input image. To get higher text alignment,\nSDEdit can be applied over an increased percentage of dif-\nfusion steps, and P2P can reduce the number of attention\ninjection steps. Our method can achieve higher text align-\nment, as described in Section 4 in the main paper, by us-\ning our shared attention over only a subset of self-attention\nlayers. Fig. 16 presents the trade-off of the results over\nthe different methods. As can be seen, only our method\ncan achieve text alignment while preserving high set con-\nsistency.\nD. User Study and Evaluation Settings\nAs described in the main paper, we generate the images\nfor evaluation using a list of 100 text prompts where each\nprompt describes 4 objects in the same style. The full list is\nprovided at the end of supplementary materials D. We eval-\nuated the results of the different methods using the auto-\nmatic CLIP and DINO scores and through user evaluation.\nThe format of the user study is provided in Fig. 24 where the\nuser has to select between the results of two methods. For\neach method from StyleDrop (SDXL), StyleDrop (unoffi-\ncial Muse), and DreamBooth-LoRA (SDXL), we collected\n800 answers compared to our results. In total, we collected\n2400 answers from 100 participants.\nReference image\nSpace rocket\nBoy riding a bicycle\nMatterhorn mountain\nMime artist\nSeattle needle\nTwin boys on a balcony\nFigure 17.

The final\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustwor-\nthiness among open-source MLLMs, and shows better ro-\nbustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused\nfrom over-generalization.\n1. Introduction\nThe recent success of Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) marks a significant milestone in AI research [4, 6,\n14, 16, 27, 35, 37, 54, 63]. By connecting visual signals and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), MLLMs show unprece-\n*Corresponding authors\ndented capabilities in multimodal understanding, reasoning,\nand interaction [36, 37, 57]. The models are typically pre-\ntrained on large-scale image-text data to learn the founda-\ntional multimodal knowledge and capabilities [4, 6, 16, 27].\nTo steer the model behavior, most MLLMs are further fine-\ntuned with instruction tuning (also known as supervised\nfine-tuning), which supervises models to clone the behav-\nior from demonstration data, enabling MLLMs to engage\nusers in various open-world tasks [6, 14, 33, 35, 60].\nHowever, current MLLM behaviors are not well aligned\nwith human preferences. A glaring issue is their tendency\nto produce hallucinations \u2014 responses that are not factu-\nally grounded in the associated images [29, 33, 37, 48].\nThis typically includes descriptions of non-existing visual\ncontents and errors in descriptions. As shown in Figure 1,\ncurrent MLLMs can hallucinate about objects, attributes,\nnumbers, positions, actions, etc.\nQuantitatively, our hu-\nman evaluation shows that the problem is prevalent among\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, where even the most advanced\nGPT-4V [37] contains obvious hallucinations in 45.9% re-\nsponses.\nThe problem makes existing MLLMs untrust-\nworthy and thus impractical in real-world (especially high-\nstakes) applications, such as guiding visually impaired in-\ndividuals [37] or autonomous driving systems [55].\nWe argue that the problem arises from the lack of posi-\ntive/negative human feedback in instruction-tuned models,\nmaking it challenging to learn the precise behavior bound-\naries to exclude hallucination. To address the problem, we\npropose RLHF-V, a novel framework that aligns MLLM be-\nhavior by learning from human feedback. A straightforward\nway is to employ the traditional Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF) method in state-of-the-art\nLLMs [38, 51], which involves human annotators ranking\nmodel responses, and utilizing a reward model to guide the\npolicy LLM learning. However, this approach is fraught\nwith two key challenges: (1) Annotation ambiguity.

The RLHF-V framework for MLLM behavior alignment from human feedback. (1) Given the input image and prompt, we obtain\noutputs from MLLMs and collect human feedback in the form of fine-grained segment-level corrections on hallucinations. (2) During\nhuman preference learning, we perform dense direct preference optimization over the fine-grained correctional human feedback.\nful and engaging responses about rich image content are\ntypically long and complex, making it usually non-obvious\nto decide which response is preferable. As shown in Fig-\nure 1 (responses A and B), annotators usually face dilem-\nmas when presenting responses with respective advantages\nand flaws.\nBesides, even if labeled with a clear prefer-\nence, the optimal response remains unknown (e.g., the exact\ntime of the clock). (2) Learning efficiency. The coarse-\ngrained ranking feedback makes it difficult to accurately\nallocate credit to the desirable behaviors. Considering the\nlinguistic complexity and variance of responses, the desir-\nable behavior often requires a large amount of labeled data\nto learn [13, 39, 48]. Moreover, misallocation of credit to\nthe non-robust bias correlated with the data usually leads to\nreward hacking and behavior degeneration problems [7, 51].\nRLHF-V addresses these challenges by introducing two\nkey innovations: (1) At the data level, we propose to col-\nlect human feedback in the form of fine-grained segment-\nlevel corrections. As shown in Figure 1, we ask human\nannotators to directly correct the hallucinated segments\nfrom model responses, providing a clear, dense, and fine-\ngrained human preference, as well as optimal responses.\nThis strategy also avoids linguistic variance and non-robust\nbias, ensuring that the feedback is accurately allocated to\nthe desirable behaviors, thereby enhancing learning effi-\nciency and preventing reward hacking problems.\n(2) At\nthe method level, we propose dense direct preference op-\ntimization (DDPO), a new variant of DPO [42] that ad-\ndresses the traditional RLHF objective in an equivalent sim-\nple and efficient supervised fashion. DDPO directly op-\ntimizes the policy model against dense and fine-grained\nsegment-level preference, where the hallucinated segments\nreceive stronger feedback to be factually grounded.\nComprehensive experiments on five benchmarks show\nthat, RLHF-V can substantially enhance the trustworthiness\nof MLLMs with promising data and computation efficiency.\nUsing 1.4k preference data, RLHF-V significantly reduces\nthe object hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%,\nsurpassing the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF [48] trained on\n10k preference data. We also show that RLHF-V achieves\nbetter robustness than the strong GPT-4V [37] in preventing\nhallucinations aroused from over-generalization.\nThe contribution of this work can be summarized as\nthreefold: (1) We present RLHF-V, a novel framework that\naligns MLLM behavior through fine-grained correctional\nhuman feedback. (2) We collect high-quality human pref-\nerence data to provide human-aligned learning signals for\nMLLMs. (3) We conduct comprehensive experiments to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness\namong open-source MLLMs. All the code, data, and model\nweights are open-sourced at https://github.com/\nRLHF-V/RLHF-V.\n2. Human Preference Collection\nThe goal of human preference data is to distinguish human-\npreferred high-quality responses from inferior ones, provid-\ning human-aligned learning signals to steer the MLLM be-\nhaviors. We first provide an analysis of underlying factors\nof human preference data, based on which we motivate the\nhuman preference collection procedure of RLHF-V.\nHuman Preference Data: Underlying Factors and\nChallenges. Given the input x (including the image and\nthe prompt), denote the difference between a preferred out-\nput yw and an inferior output yl as Y . The difference Y can\nbe essentially decomposed into three factors:\nY = Yp + Ys + Yn,\n(1)\nwhere Yp is the truly preferred behavior such as being trust-\nworthy and helpful, Ys denotes the shallow non-robust bias\ncorrelated with the data but unrelated to human judgment\n(e.g., yw contains more usage of specific words), and Yn\nis the random noise factor denoting the linguistic variance\nof natural language (e.g., different ways of expressing the\nsame meaning). Yp is the factor we want to learn from the\ndifference Y , while fitting to Ys can lead to reward hack-\ning problems and thus should be avoided. The linguistic\nvariance Yn does not bias the preference learning but makes\nthe learning more difficult, demanding more labeled data\nto learn to the preferred factor Yp, and thus should also be\navoided if possible.\nThe common RLHF practices in LLMs collect human\npreference Y in the form of ranking labels, indicating the\noverall relative quality of responses [38, 39, 51]. According\nto the above analysis, the practice faces several key chal-\nlenges: (1) Annotation ambiguity. It can be non-obvious to\nannotate which response is superior using an overall rank-\ning label due to the fine-grained nature of Yp, especially for\ncomplex responses. As shown in Figure 1, annotators usu-\nally cannot agree on assigning an overall ranking to differ-\nent responses with respective advantages and flaws. We ob-\nserve the issue leads to unsatisfactory annotation quality of\nexisting RLHF data. Moreover, even if labeled with a clear\npreference, the optimal responses for the questions typically\nremain unknown. (2) Learning efficiency. During reinforce-\nment learning, it can be challenging and data-demanding to\nprecisely allocate the sparse and coarse-grained credit from\nY through the linguistic variance Yn to the preferred behav-\nior Yp. Misallocation to the non-robust bias factor Ys will\nlead models to collapse to exploit trivial rewards [7, 51].\nFine-grained Correctional Human Preference Collec-\ntion. To address the challenges, we propose to collect fine-\ngrained human preferences in the form of segment-level\ncorrections. As shown in Figure 1, given a flawed output yl\nfrom MLLMs, we ask human annotators to directly correct\nthe hallucinated segments, resulting in a factually optimal\noutput yw. The annotation simultaneously yields a segment-\nlevel incremental preference pair (yw, yl). The simple pro-\ncedure effectively addresses the challenges: (1) The an-\nnotation of incremental correction in segments is clearer\nand more operable for human labelers. (2) The dense and\nfine-grained feedback is directly allocated to the preferred\nbehavior Yp, excluding the linguistic variance Yn and the\nnon-robust bias Ys, therefore improving learning efficiency\nand preventing reward hacking problems. In experiments,\nwe find that the procedure greatly improves the annotation\nquality and data efficiency, enabling our model to surpass\nconcurrent models trained on an order of magnitude more\nlabeled preference data (see Section 4.3).\nIn practice, we obtain a total of 1.4k prompts as in-\nput from existing instruction tuning dataset [60] and im-\nage description prompts generated by GPT-4, and get the\nresponses from Muffin [60] for human annotation. The re-\nsponses after annotation contain 64.4 words and 2.65 cor-\nrected segments on average. We observe that the correc-\ntions are diverse in hallucination types, including objects\n(41.2%), positions (20.3%), numbers (16.5%), attributes\n(10.0%), actions (5.3%) and miscellaneous types (6.8%).\n3. Method\nWe introduce the RLHF-V approach that learns the fine-\ngrained correctional human feedback by dense direct pref-\nerence optimization. In addition, we also mitigate existing\nsources of hallucination in MLLM training by addressing\nthe vision-language mismatch problem.\n3.1. Dense Direct Preference Optimization\nTo leverage the dense and fine-grained human feedback, we\npresent DDPO, a new variant of direct preference optimiza-\ntion [42] for directly optimizing the MLLM policy against\ndense human preference. The prevalent RLHF approaches\ninvolve fitting a reward model on the preference data, and\nthen training the critique, policy and value models to maxi-\nmize the reward without deviating too far from the reference\nmodel [13, 39, 51]. This procedure requires training multi-\nple LLMs with extensive sampling and training, which suf-\nfers from complex procedures and high computation cost.\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) [42] solves this\nreinforcement learning objective in a simpler equivalent\nsupervised fashion.\nHere we briefly introduce the DPO\nmethod, and refer readers to the original paper for more\ndetails.\nThe key observation of DPO is that the reward\nfunction r(x, y) can be analytically expressed by its opti-\nmal policy model \u03c0\u2217(y|x) and reference model \u03c0ref(y|x),\nand therefore we can directly optimize the policy model un-\nder proper forms on the preference data. Specifically, the\nreward model r(x, y) can be represented as:\nr(x, y) = \u03b2 log \u03c0\u2217(y|x)\n\u03c0ref(y|x) + \u03b2 log Z(x),\n(2)\nwhere \u03b2 is a constant and Z(x) is the partition function.\nBased on this observation, the policy model can be directly\noptimized on the human feedback data:\nL = \u2212E(x,yw,yl)\n\u0002\nlog \u03c3(r(x, yw) \u2212 r(x, yl))\n\u0003\n= \u2212E(x,yw,yl)\n\u0002\nlog \u03c3(\u03b2 log \u03c0\u2217(yw|x)\n\u03c0ref(yw|x) \u2212 \u03b2 log \u03c0\u2217(yl|x)\n\u03c0ref(yl|x))\n\u0003\n, (3)\nwhere the reference model \u03c0ref(y|x) is usually implemented\nby an instruction-tuned base model we want to improve, and\nis kept fixed during DPO training. Only the policy model\n\u03c0\u2217(y|x) is updated. We note that DPO is more simple, ef-\nficient and stable in aligning MLLM behaviors compared\nwith traditional RLHF approaches.\nLeveraging dense and fine-grained segment-level feed-\nback essentially requires the model to evaluate the reward\nof segment-level actions. However, DPO is designed for\nlearning preference in the form of overall response ranking\nlabels. Specifically, the action score of DPO is given by the\nlikelihood of the holistic response in practice, where differ-\nent segments are equally treated:\nlog \u03c0(y|x) =\nX\nyi\u2208y\nlog p(yi|x, y<i),\n(4)\nwhere yi is the i-th token of the response y. We argue that\ncompared with unchanged segments yu, corrected segments\nyc more directly reveal human judgment in hallucination,\nand thus should contribute more to the overall action eval-\nuation. Therefore, we propose to score the response as a\nweighted aggregation of the fine-grained segments:1\nlog \u03c0(y|x) = 1\nN\n\u0002 P\nyi\u2208yu\nlog p(yi|x, y<i) + \u03b3 P\nyi\u2208yc\nlog p(yi|x, y<i)\n\u0003\n, (5)\nwhere \u03b3 > 1 is a weighting hyperprameter, and larger\n\u03b3 means more contribution from the corrected segments.\nN = |yu| + \u03b3|yc| is a normalizing factor, preventing longer\nresponses from getting higher scores. In this way, corrected\nsegments are highlighted to receive stronger human prefer-\nence feedback to be factually grounded. In experiments, we\nfind that DDPO can better exploit the fine-grained human\nfeedback, leading to more trustworthy responses.\n3.2. Mitigating Hallucination from VL Mismatch\nDDPO reduces hallucination by learning from human feed-\nback. From another cause-and-effect view, we examine the\nmainstream MLLM training paradigm, and identify sources\nof hallucinations in training MLLMs. Based on the obser-\nvations, we motivate a more trustworthy training recipe.\nIn general, current MLLMs learn multimodal capabili-\nties in a supervised learning paradigm, where the model out-\nputs are supervised against the ground-truth text associated\nwith the image. In such a paradigm, hallucinations can be\nintroduced by mismatches between images and text data. In\npractice, the mismatch can come from: (1) low-quality text\nin pre-training and instruction tuning data, and (2) careless\nimage augmentation during training. We specify the issues\nand solutions in the following.\nAddressing Low-quality Text Influence. Current pre-\ntraining data of MLLMs are automatically crawled from the\nWeb [9, 10, 44], which inevitably suffers from severe noise\nin the text even after extensive post-processing. Supervising\nMLLMs against such data is essentially teaching them to\nhallucinate (e.g., describing elements not present in the im-\nage, or producing inconsistent descriptions with the image).\nSimilarly, most existing visual instruction tuning datasets\nare generated by ChatGPT/GPT-4 according to intermediate\ntext annotations [33, 35, 60], which inevitably introduces\n1For denotation simplicity, without confusion we also use yu and yc to\ndenote the set of tokens in unchanged and corrected segments respectively.\nhallucination into instruction data. While it can be difficult\nto repair existing pre-training and instruction-tuning data,\nwe find that the influence can be countered by simply post-\ntraining MLLMs on high-quality visual question-answering\ndatasets. Intuitively, human-labeled datasets can provide\naccurate learning signals to calibrate model behaviors from\nhallucinations, and also enhance instruction-following ca-\npabilities. In our experiments, we find that simply fine-\ntuning the model on VQAv2 [18] can significantly reduce\nthe hallucination rate (see Section 4.3).\nMitigating Untrustworthy Image Augmentation. The\nvision-language mismatch can also come from the image\ndomain. Data augmentation is widely adopted to improve\nthe data diversity and model robustness in various multi-\nmodal models [14, 27, 41, 53, 60]. However, we note that\nsuch augmentation must be performed with care in training\nMLLMs. The key problem is that some image augmen-\ntation operations can significantly change the semantics of\nimages, which may make the augmented image inconsis-\ntent with the associated text. For example, during augmen-\ntation, random cropping can make the objects mentioned in\nthe text absent from the image. This can make the model\ndescribe non-existing objects, with wrong numbers, and in\nwrong positions. In our model training, we exclude image\ncropping in data augmentation, which improves the trust-\nworthiness of MLLMs (see Section 4.3).\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we empirically investigate the effectiveness\nof RLHF-V in aligning MLLM behaviors. In addition to\nevaluating the trustworthiness and helpfulness of conversa-\ntion, we also analyze the data efficiency and scalability as\nwell as the robustness. We refer readers to the appendix for\nmore details on benchmarks, baselines and results.\n4.1. Experimental Settings\nWe first introduce the experimental settings, including eval-\nuation, baselines, and implementation details.\nEvaluation. We evaluate the models from two perspec-\ntives, including trustworthiness reflecting the hallucination\ndegree, and helpfulness reflecting the general interaction\nquality. Similar to [48], we find binary classification eval-\nuation (i.e., answering yes/no) [17, 29] cannot well reflect\nthe MLLM behaviors in open-ended long-form interactions.\nWe thus adopt benchmarks that directly evaluate the long-\nform responses, which are more closely related to the prac-\ntical usage scenarios of MLLMs. For trustworthiness, we\nperform evaluation on three benchmarks:\n(1) Object HalBench [43] is a widely adopted bench-\nmark for assessing object hallucination in detailed image\ndescriptions.

Main experimental results on hallucination. We report hallucination rates in different granularities, including response-level\n(Resp.) and mention-level (Mention), and response-level hallucination rates in different types. We also show scores on informativeness\n(Info.), multimodal conversation (Conv.), detailed description (Detail), and complex reasoning (Comp.). * denotes zero-shot results on\nVQAv2.2 The best and second best open-source results are shown in bold and underlined respectively.\nages [31] to detect object hallucination. To improve the\nevaluation stability, we augment the benchmark with 8 di-\nverse prompts for detailed image descriptions. We report\nthe response-level hallucination rate (i.e., the percentage of\nresponses that have hallucinations), as well as the mention-\nlevel hallucination rate (i.e., the percentage of hallucinated\nobject mentions among all object mentions).\n(2) MMHal-Bench [48] evaluates hallucinations and re-\nsponse informativeness.\nIt employs GPT-4 to compare\nmodel output with human response and several object labels\nto decide the scores. In experiments, we find that GPT-4\ncannot reliably detect hallucinations due to the incomplete-\nness of MMHal-Bench text annotations. We therefore only\nreport the informativeness score from GPT-4, and assess\nresponse-level hallucination rate by human evaluation.\n(3) MHumanEval.\nThe above evaluations are either\nlimited to common object hallucination or dominated by\nshort-form question answering (i.e., questions that can be\nsufficiently answered by a few words). To provide a more\nreliable and comprehensive evaluation over diverse halluci-\nnation types, we present MHumanEval benchmark, which\ncovers both long-form image descriptions, and short-form\nquestions. The benchmark contains 146 samples collected\nfrom Object HalBench (50) and MMHal-Bench (96). Given\nmodel responses, we ask human annotators to label the hal-\nlucinated segments and hallucination types of the segments,\nincluding objects, positions, numbers and others. We report\nthe response-level hallucination rate on these types.\nFor helpfulness, we adopt two benchmarks: (1) LLaVA\nBench [35] is a widely adopted benchmark for assessing\nmultimodal conversation, detailed description and complex\nreasoning capabilities. It scores model output against ref-\nerence response via GPT-4. (2) VQAv2 [18] is a popular\ndataset for short-form visual question answering.\n2Due to limited instruction-following capability, most MLLMs need to\nBaselines.\nWe compare our model with state-of-the-\nart baselines.\n(1) General baselines.\nWe adopt Qwen-\nVL-Chat [6], LLaVA [35], LLaVA 1.5 [34], Muffin [60],\nand InstructBLIP [14] as representative general baselines.\nThese models are mostly pre-trained on large-scale multi-\nmodal data, and fine-tuned on high-quality instruction data,\nachieving strong performance across various multimodal\ntasks. (2) Baselines tailored for hallucination problems.\nLRV [33] is fine-tuned on 400k instruction data generated\nby GPT-4, and mitigates hallucination by limiting the re-\nsponse length. The concurrent LLaVA-RLHF [48] employs\nthe strong 13B Vicuna v1.5 [62] (fine-tuned from LLaMA-\n2 [51]) as LLM backbone. It trains the reward model on\n10k human-labeled preference data, and performs proximal\npolicy optimization [45] on 72k factually augmented data.\n(3) Commercial Baseline. We also include GPT-4V [37]\nas a strong reference, evaluating the gap between the open-\nsource models and state-of-the-art commercial models.\nImplementation Details. We implement the RLHF-V\nframework based on Muffin [60]. The model uses BEiT-\n3 [53] as the visual module, and 13B Vicuna v1.0 [12] (fine-\ntuned from LLaMA [50]) as the LLM backbone. The hyper-\nparameter \u03b2 is 0.5, and the weighting coefficient \u03b3 is 5. We\ntrain the model with DDPO for 7 epochs, with image resolu-\ntion 448, learning rate 5e-7 and batch size 32. The training\nof RLHF-V is computationally efficient, which takes less\nthan 1 hour on 8 A100 GPUs in total.\n4.2. Main Results\nThe main experimental results are reported in Table 1, from\nwhich we observe that: (1) RLHF-V achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source\nmodels, outperforming strong general models and models\nbe specifically fine-tuned to produce short-form VQA answers, and there-\nfore cannot achieve reasonable zero-shot performance on VQAv2.\nModel\nLiving Room\nKitchen\nBathroom\nStreet\n\u2206\nbook, person, bed\nbottle, bowl, cup\ntoilet, sink, bottle\nperson, car, motorcycle\nchair, couch, remote\nperson, chair, knife\ntoothbrush, person, cup\ntraffic light, handbag, truck\nHa\nHs\n\u2206\nHa\nHs\n\u2206\nHa\nHs\n\u2206\nHa\nHs\n\u2206\nLLaVA-1.5 [34]\n25.2\n41.8\n+16.6\n18.9\n23.9\n+5.0\n22.4\n30.4\n+8.0\n20.6\n28.0\n+7.4\n+9.2\nLLaVA-RLHF [48]\n23.7\n34.5\n+10.8\n13.1\n17.4\n+4.3\n18.2\n19.5\n+1.4\n18.3\n22.7\n+4.4\n+5.2\nQWEN-VL [6]\n24.5\n34.5\n+10.0\n16.4\n20.8\n+4.4\n21.6\n17.5\n-4.1\n22.5\n32.0\n+9.5\n+5.0\nRLHF-V\n5.5\n8.0\n+2.5\n3.8\n5.9\n+2.1\n4.1\n4.0\n-0.1\n2.3\n4.6\n+2.3\n+1.7\nGPT-4V [37]\n8.2\n19.4\n+11.2\n4.6\n5.7\n+1.1\n5.9\n13.3\n+7.5\n4.2\n4.6\n+0.4\n+5.0\nTable 2.

The framework significantly re-\nduces the hallucination rate of the base model Muffin by\n75.8% relative points for common objects on Object Hal-\nBench, and by 34.8% for overall objects on MHumanEval.\nThe improvement is consistent in different granularities\nincluding response-level and mention-level hallucinations,\nand different hallucination types including objects, posi-\ntions, and numbers. The reduction is more significant on\nthe more challenging long-form answers on Object Hal-\nBench and MHumanEval. The results show that RLHF-V\ncan effectively learn from fine-grained correctional human\nfeedback to enable more trustworthy MLLM behaviors. (2)\nRLHF-V achieves promising performance in response help-\nfulness, where the results on MMHalBench, LLaVA Bench\nand VQAv2 are strong and comparable to the base model.\nThis shows that RLHF-V can enhance the trustworthiness\nof MLLMs without sacrificing their helpfulness.\n4.3. Analysis\nIn this section, we conduct analyses on the framework con-\nsidering the following research questions: (1) How does\nRLHF-V\u2019s performance scale with feedback data amount?\n(2) What is the advantage of fine-grained correctional pref-\nerence data over traditional overall ranking data? (3) Can\nRLHF-V\u2019s data and method be adopted to enhance the trust-\nworthiness of other MLLMs? (4) How does human feed-\nback alleviate hallucinations intuitively?\nScaling feedback data leads to promising results. We\nreport the hallucination rate and numbers of hallucinated\nsegments on MHumanEval under different amounts of feed-\nback data in Figure 2. We observe that the hallucination\nrate and number of RLHF-V show a significant and rapid\ndecrease as the data amount grows. This shows that fine-\ngrained correctional human feedback provides effective and\nefficient learning signals for MLLM behavior alignment.\nBased on this tendency, we expect better performance can\nbe achieved with an increasing amount of feedback data.\nWe leave this for future work.\nFine-grained correctional human feedback enables\nbetter learning efficiency. To quantify the advantage of\nfine-grained correctional human feedback, we replace our\ndata with the 2.2k human preference data on hallucination\nfrom LLaVA-RLHF, which gives overall ranking labels fol-\nlowing common RLHF practices. From the experimental\nresults in Figure 2, we observe that model equipped with our\ndata shows a more significant and rapid reduction in halluci-\nnation rate and number. Notably, using only 200 preference\ndata, our model achieves comparable hallucination rate to\nthe model that uses an order of magnitude more labeled data\nfrom LLaVA-RLHF. The superior data efficiency is due to\n(1) better data quality since label ambiguity is minimized,\nModel\nMHumanEval \u2193\nMHB\u2193\nVQAv2\nObj.\nPos.\nNum.\nAll\nResp.\ntestdev\nMuffin [60]\n33.6\n16.4\n26.0\n74.7\n68.8\n-\nRLHF-V\n21.9\n7.5\n14.4\n55.5\n52.1\n80.0\nw/ vanilla DPO\n21.9\n11.6\n11.6\n57.5\n54.2\n80.0\nw/ IT-VQA only\n34.3\n17.1\n17.1\n65.1\n58.3\n80.0\nw/ untrust aug.\n18.5\n13.7\n14.4\n59.6\n54.2\n77.1\nTable 3.\nAblation results on different components.\nMHB:\nMMHal-Bench, IT-VQA: instruction tuning on VQAv2, untrust\naug.: untrustworthy data augmentation.\nand (2) more direct feedback on hallucinated segments, ex-\ncluding non-robust bias and linguistic variance.\nRLHF-V generalizes to enhance other MLLMs. To\ninvestigate the generalization capability of the framework,\nwe adopt RLHF-V\u2019s data and approach to align the be-\nhavior of LLaVA [35], a representative and widely used\nMLLM. Experimental results show that RLHF-V effec-\ntively reduces the hallucination count of LLaVA by 13.8\nrelative points, as well as the hallucination rate by 5.9\nrelative points. We also apply RLHF-V to stronger base\nmodels and build the OmniLMM-12B [3] which achieves\nnew SoTA results on multiple hallucination benchmarks.\nFor example, OmniLMM-12B exhibits only 4.5% mention-\nlevel hallucination on the Object HalBench.\nMoreover,\nOmniLMM-12B also shows leading performance among\ncomparable-sized models on multiple benchmarks (1637 on\nMME-Perception [17], 71.1 on SeedBench-I [25]). The re-\nsults demonstrate that RLHF-V is applicable across differ-\nent MLLMs to improve trustworthiness.\nRLHF-V reduces hallucination from correlation and\nover-generalization. LLMs possess rich world knowledge\nand strong generalization capabilities. Without proper posi-\ntive/negative human feedback, MLLMs can over-generalize\nto produce highly correlated and plausible concepts, which\nleads to hallucinations. For example, a prevalent hallucina-\ntion case observed across different MLLMs is claiming the\npresence of person as long as they see an image of street.\nTo quantify the problem, we select a set of representative\nscenes {living room, kitchen, bathroom, street}.\nFor each\nscene, we identify the corresponding images in COCO by\nlexically matching the captions with the scene name. Then\nwe obtain the top 10 frequent objects in the scene from the\nCOCO object annotations. We compare the response-level\nhallucination rate for these objects (1) on average across\nall test samples, and (2) on samples under the target scene.\nModels prone to over-generalization will expect a signifi-\ncant increase in the hallucination rate (\u2206).\nFrom the experimental results in Table 2, we observe\nthat: (1) All models including GPT-4V show a substan-\ntial increase in the hallucination rate, which demonstrates\nthe over-generalization hypothesis. (2) RLHF-V exhibits\nthe smallest change in the hallucination rate, which is\neven more robust than GPT-4V. The reason for the robust-\nness is that RLHF-V provides crucial positive/negative fine-\ngrained correctional human feedback for MLLMs, which\nhelps to learn clear behavior boundaries between reason-\nable generalizations and over-generalizations. (3) RLHF-\nV achieves the lowest hallucination rates for these com-\nmon objects both on average and especially under common\nscenes. This makes RLHF-V preferable in practical real-\nworld applications.\nAblation Study. To investigate the contribution of each\ncomponent, we perform an ablation study. From the experi-\nmental results in Table 3, we can observe that: (1) Learning\nhuman feedback with vanilla DPO leads to performance de-\ngrades, showing the advantage of DDPO in exploiting the\nfine-grained human preference. (2) Fine-tuning on VQAv2\nleads to a significant reduction in hallucination rates com-\npared with the base model. This reveals the value of tra-\nditional human-annotated datasets from a new perspective\nof hallucination mitigation.\n(3) Including untrustworthy\ndata augmentation (i.e., image cropping) in training hurts\nthe performance on both hallucination and VQAv2. This\nshows that careless data augmentation can be a double-\nedged sword in training MLLMs.\nCase Study. To provide an intuitive understanding and\ncomparison of different models, we provide qualitative re-\nsults in Figure 3. We show cases in two representative sce-\nnarios: (1) Short-form QA (i.e., questions that can be suf-\nficiently answered in a few words). Our model typically\nmaintains a good balance between helpfulness, engage-\nment and clarity. In comparison, LLaVA-RLHF is usually\nfar more engaging, introducing lengthy extensions however\nthat can be less reasonable or relevant. (2) Long-form QA\n(i.e., questions that require long text to answer). We ob-\nserve that MLLMs are significantly more prone to halluci-\nnations in long-form QA, since it typically requires more\ncomprehensive capabilities from multiple perspectives. For\nexample, InstructBLIP and LLaVA-RLHF can confidently\ndescribe non-existing objects in a large proportion of their\nresponses, whereas RLHF-V introduces significantly fewer\nhallucinations while delivering a comparable amount of ef-\nfective information. We refer readers to the appendix for\nmore qualitative results.\n5. Related Work\nMultimodal Large Language Models. Recent trends in\nmultimodal learning have witnessed the success of build-\ning MLLMs by connecting visual encoders with pow-\nerful LLMs [11, 20, 26, 58, 61].\nThe current MLLM\ntraining paradigm typically involves two stages: (1) Pre-\ntraining. Models are pretrained on large-scale image-text\npairs [6, 14, 27, 54, 60] or interleaved data [4, 5, 20] to\nAt what time is this photo taken?\nThe scene appears to be taken during the daytime, as the sunlight can be seen streaming in through the large window in the \nkitchen.

These objects are likely to be in use or placed in their respective \nlocations during the daytime, as people tend to engage in more activities and prepare meals during the day.\nIn conclusion, the photo is taken during the daytime, as evidenced by the natural light, the absence of artificial lighting, and \nthe presence of various objects in the room that are typically used during daylight hours.\nLLaVA-RLHF\nShort-form QA\nWhat is this photo about? \nPlease answer in detail.\nThe image depicts a small black dog sitting on a wooden floor in a living room, watching a television screen.

One dog is located near the left side of the TV, while another is positioned closer to the center of the \nroom. A third dog can be seen towards the right side of the image. In addition to the dogs, there are two chairs in the \nroom, one located near the left side of the TV and the other near the center of the room.\nRLHF-V (This work)\nInstructBLIP\nThe image features a black dog sitting on a hardwood floor in a room, watching a television. The TV is located on the left side \nof the room, and the dog is positioned near the center of the scene.\nThere are also two people in the room, one on the left side and the other on the right side, possibly watching the \ntelevision along with the dog. Additionally, there are two remotes visible in the room, one near the center and the \nother on the right side.

Despite\nthe success, current MLLMs suffer from serious hallucina-\ntion problems [29, 32, 33, 48]. Notably, even after extensive\nefforts, GPT-4V has still been found to be prone to halluci-\nnations, making basic factual errors confidently [37]. The\nproblem undermines practical applications of MLLMs es-\npecially in high-stakes scenarios, which has recently drawn\nincreasing attention from the community.\nBehavior Alignment for LLMs.\nAligning language\nagent behaviors with human preference has emerged as a\npromising research direction [22, 24]. Pivotal approaches\nin LLMs include instruction tuning (or supervised fine-\ntuning) and RLHF [39, 47]. While supervised fine-tuning\nis suitable for basic behavior alignment [15, 49], due to the\nmismatch between likelihood maximization objective and\nhuman preference, it may introduce or amplify hallucina-\ntion [38, 39]. Therefore, RLHF is widely accepted for fur-\nther behavior and preference alignment [8, 13, 38], where\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) [45] is recognized as\nthe major technique. Later adaptations attempt to stabilize\nthe optimization process [42] and enclose more fine-grained\nsignals [30, 56]. However, RLHF has rarely been explored\nin MLLMs to align model behaviors with humans.\nReducing Hallucination for MLLMs. Some prelimi-\nnary efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination prob-\nlems in MLLMs. LRV [33] generates instruction data with\nnegative responses, and mitigates hallucination by limit-\ning the response length. However, limiting the response\nlength does not essentially address the problem, and also\nundermines the response helpfulness.\nVIGC [52] itera-\ntively refines the instruction data for better instruction tun-\ning. Woodpecker [59] proposes to post-edit hallucinations\nby merging the output of MLLMs and a more accurate ex-\npert VQA model using GPT-3.5. The post-editing proce-\ndure involves external tools and LLMs much larger than the\ntarget MLLM online in multiple stages, which leads to high\ninference costs and delays. Gunjal et al. [19] distinguishes\nthe inaccurate parts in responses via human annotation, and\ninternally discourages the hallucinated parts by direct pref-\nerence optimization. However, the positive behaviors for\nhallucinated parts are unknown, making the human feed-\nback not complete enough to learn the behavior boundary.\nThe concurrent LLaVA-RLHF [48] employs the traditional\nRLHF approach [39] on MLLMs, and augments the reward\nmodel with rich additional text descriptions.\nIt is there-\nfore similarly challenged with label ambiguity, learning ef-\nficiency, and complex training. In comparison, RLHF-V\npresents the first fine-grained correctional human feedback\nlearning framework for behavior alignment, and systemat-\nically addresses different hallucination sources in training\nMLLMs, achieving strong performance in trustworthiness.\n6. Conclusion\nHallucination is a critical problem preventing practical ap-\nplications of MLLMs in real-world scenarios. In this work,\nwe present RLHF-V, a novel framework that enhances the\ntrustworthiness of MLLMs by behavior alignment from\nfine-grained correctional human feedback. Comprehensive\nexperimental results show that our model achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance in trustworthiness especially in chal-\nlenging long-form responses while maintaining strong help-\nfulness. In this work, we collect correctional feedback from\nhuman annotators.\nIn future, with the progress of more\ntrustworthy and capable MLLMs, we will explore collect-\ning accurate preferences from MLLMs, which can facilitate\nlarge-scale preference learning for stronger behavior align-\nment. Besides, we note that the framework of RLHF-V\ncan potentially also help reduce the hallucinations in LLMs,\nwhich we will explore in future.\nContributions\nThe authors\u2019 contributions can be outlined as follows:\n\u2022 In initializing the project, Yuan Yao and Tianyu Yu de-\nsign the framework to collect correctional human feed-\nback.

MiniGPT-4: Enhancing vision-language\nunderstanding with advanced large language models. arXiv\npreprint arXiv:2304.10592, 2023. 1\nA. Zoom-in Study regarding GPT-4V\nWe perform a zoom-in study of RLHF-V concerning GPT-\n4V to provide a better understanding of their behaviors.\nA.1. Hallucination Patterns\nWe conduct a comparative analysis of the responses gener-\nated by RLHF-V and GPT-4V, and have the following key\nobservations:\n(1) Compared with RLHF-V, GPT-4V tends to describe\nmore details in the images and elaborate more on the inter-\nrelations among them. Quantitatively, we utilize ChatGPT\nto extract all the object mentions in the responses of GPT-\n4V, and find that the average number per response is 2.1\ntimes larger than RLHF-V. We mainly attribute this to the\nhigher resolution (7.6 times larger than RLHF-V) [1] and\nthe more powerful LLM backbone [37].\n(2) GPT-4V\u2019s hallucinations are more concentrated in\nsome responses. In HumanEval, the hallucination rates of\nGPT-4V on Object and Position are comparable to RLHF-\nV. However, in the comprehensive ALL metric, the halluci-\nnation rate is 17.3% lower than RLHF-V. To better under-\nstand the reasons behind this phenomenon, we conduct a\nthorough analysis of the evaluation results. We observe that\ndifferent types of hallucinations in GPT-4V are often con-\ncentrated in a small subset of responses, while contributing\nto hallucination rates across multiple subcategories. Quan-\ntitatively, we sort the responses of each model by the hal-\nlucination count in descending order, and plot the curve\nof hallucination count ratio vs hallucination response ratio.\nFrom the results in Figure 4, we can see that the top 45.6%\nhallucinated responses of GPT-4V contribute to 75% hallu-\ncination counts. In comparison, the top 64.6% hallucinated\nresponses of RLHF-V contribute to 75% hallucinations. We\nrefer readers to Section B for more qualitative results.\nA.2. Distillation against GPT-4V\nUpon observing GPT-4V\u2019s superior fine-grained image per-\nception and text generation capabilities, an intuitive ques-\ntion is, will it be beneficial to distill GPT-4V capabilities\nthrough visual instruction tuning? To this end, we collect\n1.2k visual instruction data about long-form image descrip-\ntions from GPT-4V. We then use the response generated\nby GPT-4V to fine-tune our model. We observe that the\naverage number of object mentions in the model response\nsignificantly increases by 1.8 times compared with the ori-\ngin model. However, this can be a double-edged sword:\nas shown in Table 4, the hallucination rate significantly in-\ncreases as well.\nThe results are consistent with the hypothesis of [2]:\n\u201cIf we supervise the model against instruction data that far\nexceeds its own foundational capabilities, we are essen-\ntially teaching the model to hallucinate.\u201d Specifically, our\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nHall.

As a result, the hallucination problem is\nremarkably exacerbated. The results show that visual in-\nstruction data (or distillation target) is not the stronger the\nbetter, but rather should match the foundational capability\nof the model.\nB. Qualitative Results\nWe provide more qualitative results in this section to facil-\nitate a more intuitive understanding and comparison of dif-\nferent models. Based on the qualitative results, we have the\nfollowing observations:\n(1) RLHF-V typically exhibits less hallucination in both\nshort-form QA and long-form QA scenarios, compared with\nopen-source models such as LLaVA-RLHF and Instruct-\nBLIP, as shown in Figure 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n(2) GPT-4V is more descriptive regarding details in im-\nages as shown in Figure 6, 8, 9 and 10. For example, in Fig-\nure 9, GPT-4V mentions black dots across each tile while\nRLHF-V does not describe these details.\n(3) RLHF-V is more resistant to the over-generalization\nproblem as shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10. In Figure 9,\nGPT-4V falsely mentions objects which are highly related\nto the scene while not shown in the image such as exhaust,\nhood, and bottle.\nC. Implementation Details\nWe provide more implementation details in this section for\nbetter reproducibility. Benefiting from the high efficiency\nof training, we make all parameters trainable during the\ntraining process, which costs merely less than 1 hour on\n8 A100 GPUs in total. We empirically find that adopting a\nlonger warm-up (10% training steps) can make the training\nmore stable and consequently apply this setting for all ex-\nModel\nHumanEval \u2193\nMHB\u2193\nObj.\nPos.\nNum.\nAll\nResp.\nMuffin [60]\n33.6\n16.4\n26.0\n74.7\n68.8\nRLHF-V\n21.9\n7.5\n14.4\n55.5\n52.1\nw/ GPT-4V distil.\n45.2\n10.3\n20.6\n75.3\n62.5\nTable 4.\nExperimental results of distillation against GPT-4V.\nMHB: MMHal-Bench, GPT-4V distil.: instruction-tune the model\nusing responses generated by GPT-4V.\nperiments in this paper. As for data collection, besides the\nprompts obtained from [60], we also use image description\nprompts generated by GPT-4 during the annotation process\nwhich are listed in Table 5.\nD. Evaluation Details\nWe introduce more evaluation details, including baseline\nmodels and evaluation benchmarks.\nD.1. Baselines\nWe compare with a series of state-of-the-art baselines:\n\u2022 LLaVA: LLaVA [35] constructs 150K multimodal in-\nstructions based on the COCO dataset by asking GPT-4\nto generate multi-turn dialogues for each image.\n\u2022 Muffin: Muffin [60] propose to reformulate pre-trained\nvision-language models as the bridge toward large lan-\nguage models. The model is firstly pre-trained on 180M\nimage-text pairs and then fine-tuned on their proposed\nUniMM-Chat instruction dataset consisting of 1.1M mul-\ntimodal instructions.\n\u2022 LRV: LRV [33] is fine-tuned on 400K instruction data\ngenerated by GPT-4, and mitigates hallucination by lim-\niting the response length.\n\u2022 LLaVA-RLHF: The concurrent LLaVA-RLHF employs\nthe strong 13B Vicuna 1.5 [62] (fine-tuned from LLaMA-\n2) as LLM backbone.\nIt first trains the model with\n122K instructions from VQAv2 [18], A-OKVQA [46]\nand Flickr30k [40] to improve the foundational capabil-\nities of the model. It then trains the reward model on\n10K human-labeled preference data, and performs proxi-\nmal policy optimization [45] on 72K factually augmented\ndata.\n\u2022 InstructBLIP: InstructBLIP [14] constructs a multi-\nmodal instruction tuning dataset based on 26 public\ndatasets by apply pre-defined templates to directly formu-\nlate these datasets into a unified format. They also devise\na novel instruction-aware Q-Former and train the model\non the proposed dataset.\n\u2022 Qwen-VL-Chat: Qwen-VL-Chat\n[6] utilizes a large\nViT with 1.9B parameters initialized from OpenCLIP\u2019s\nbigG [21] as image encoder. It is pre-trained on 1.4B\nimage-text pairs and fine-tuned on more than 50M high-\nquality multimodal instructions.\n\u2022 LLaVA 1.5: LLaVA 1.5 [34] also employs the strong\n13B Vicuna 1.5 [62] (fine-tuned from LLaMA-2) as LLM\nbackbone.\nIt is pre-trained on 558K selected image-\ntext pairs and fine-tuned on 665K multimodal instructions\nwith elaborately designed training strategies.\nD.2. Benchmarks\nWe introduce additional details about the benchmarks we\nused for evaluation.\n\u2022 Object HalBench: Object HalBench [43] is a widely\nadopted benchmark for assessing object hallucination in\ndetailed image descriptions.\nTo improve the evalua-\ntion stability, we augment the benchmark with 8 diverse\nprompts for detailed image descriptions during evalua-\ntion, where 4 instructions are adopted from [19] and the\nother 4 instructions are generated by GPT-4. We con-\nfirm that there is no overlap between the evaluation in-\nstructions and the training instructions. Detailed instruc-\ntions are listed in Table 6.\nFollowing [29], we ran-\ndomly sample 300 images from the validation set of\nCOCO [31] to form the evaluation image set. Regard-\ning metrics, the response-level hallucination rate is the\nnumber of responses with object hallucinations divided\nby the number of responses that introduce COCO objects,\nwhile the mention-level hallucination rate is the number\nof falsely mentioned COCO objects in the generated re-\nsponses divided by the total number of mentioned COCO\nobjects. During evaluation, we first generate descriptions\non images from the benchmark and then leverage Chat-\nGPT to extract the mentioned objects in these responses\nwhich are further used to calculate the final scores follow-\ning. Unlike [43] which detects object mentions by exact-\nmatch, we find ChatGPT can perform the extraction with\nboth better precision and recall and consequently apply\nthis setting during evaluation. The full prompt we used to\nconduct such extraction is shown in Table 7.\n\u2022 MMHal-Bench: MMHal-Bench [48] evaluates halluci-\nnations and response informativeness. It consists of 96\nimages from the validation and test sets of OpenIm-\nages [23]. Each image in this benchmark is annotated\nwith a brand new question and the image-question pairs\ncover 12 common object meta-categories from COCO.\n\u2022 HumanEval: The above evaluations are either limited\nto common object hallucination or dominated by short-\nform question answering (i.e., questions that can be suf-\nficiently answered by a few words). To provide a more\nreliable and comprehensive evaluation over diverse hallu-\ncination types, we present HumanEval benchmark, which\ncovers both long-form image descriptions, and short-form\nquestions.\nThe benchmark contains 146 samples col-\nlected from Object HalBench (50) and MMHal-Bench\n\u2022 Identify and describe each object in the image in detail.\n\u2022 Describe the key features of the image in great detail.\n\u2022 What are the main elements in this image?

Qualitative results of different models. Hallucinations are highlighted in color.\nThe objects in the image hold significance in ensuring city traffic flows smoothly as they help regulate and control the \nmovement of vehicles and pedestrians. The traffic lights, for instance, provide visual cues to drivers and pedestrians, \nindicating when it is safe to proceed, stop, or yield. By doing so, they help reduce traffic congestion, prevent accidents, \nand improve overall safety.\nAdditionally, the street markings, such as the crosswalk and bike lane, provide clear guidance to drivers, cyclists, and \npedestrians by outlining designated areas for each group. These markings contribute to a more organized and safer \ntraffic flow, as they indicate the expected behavior of different users in sharing the road or navigating the intersection.\nLong-form QA\nWhat might be the significance or role of the objects \nyou described in ensuring city traffic flows smoothly?\nRLHF-V (This work)\nThe objects and features described in the image play a crucial role in ensuring that city traffic flows smoothly and safely. \nHere are some of the key aspects they contribute to:\n1. Traffic lights: The presence of traffic lights at the intersection helps regulate the flow of traffic by controlling the right of \nway for vehicles and pedestrians. They ensure that traffic moves in an orderly manner, reducing the risk of accidents and \ncongestion. By following the traffic light signals, drivers can safely navigate the intersection and avoid collisions with \nother vehicles or pedestrians.\n2. Parking meters: Parking meters play a vital role in managing on-street parking in busy urban areas. They help \nmaintain a steady flow of traffic by preventing vehicles from occupying parking spaces for extended periods, \nwhich can lead to congestion and reduced accessibility for other drivers. Parking meters also generate revenue \nfor the city, which can be used to fund public services and infrastructure projects.\n3. Signage: The presence of various signs on the street, such as no parking signs, helps communicate important \ninformation to drivers and pedestrians. These signs provide guidance on parking restrictions, speed limits, and other \ntraffic rules, ensuring that everyone on the road is aware of their responsibilities and the potential consequences of \nviolating traffic regulations.\n4. Bike lanes: The presence of bike lanes in the image indicates that the city is promoting alternative modes of \ntransportation, such as cycling. Bike lanes provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents between \nbikes and cars. They also encourage more people to choose cycling as a means of transportation, which can help \nreduce traffic congestion and improve air quality in the city.\n5. Pedestrian crossings: The presence of pedestrian crossings in the image highlights the importance of ensuring the \nsafety of pedestrians in busy urban areas. These crossings provide designated areas for pedestrians to cross the street \nsafely, reducing the risk of accidents and promoting a more walkable city environment.\nIn summary, the objects and features described in the image, such as traffic lights, parking meters, signage, bike lanes, \nand pedestrian crossings, play a significant role in ensuring that city traffic flows smoothly and safely. They help regulate \ntraffic flow, manage parking, communicate important information to drivers and pedestrians, promote alternative modes \nof transportation, and prioritize the safety of pedestrians. By implementing these measures, cities can create a more \nefficient and sustainable urban environment for all residents.\nLLaVA-RLHF\nFigure 7. Qualitative results of different models.

Generative Rendering is a novel diffusion-based approach to render 3D animated but untextured scenes (left) directly to a stylized\nanimation (right), with styles specified by text prompts. Our approach offers new levels of user control to image generation models.\nAbstract\nTraditional 3D content creation tools empower users to\nbring their imagination to life by giving them direct control\nover a scene\u2019s geometry, appearance, motion, and camera\npath. Creating computer-generated videos, however, is a\ntedious manual process, which can be automated by emerg-\ning text-to-video diffusion models. Despite great promise,\nvideo diffusion models are difficult to control, hindering a\nuser to apply their own creativity rather than amplifying it.\nTo address this challenge, we present a novel approach that\ncombines the controllability of dynamic 3D meshes with the\nexpressivity and editability of emerging diffusion models. For\nthis purpose, our approach takes an animated, low-fidelity\nrendered mesh as input and injects the ground truth cor-\nrespondence information obtained from the dynamic mesh\ninto various stages of a pre-trained text-to-image genera-\ntion model to output high-quality and temporally consistent\nframes. We demonstrate our approach on various examples\nwhere motion can be obtained by animating rigged assets or\nchanging the camera path. Project page: primecai.github.io/\ngenerative rendering.\n\u25b3: Part of this work was done during an internship at Adobe Research.\n* : Equal contribution.\n1. Introduction\nArtists, designers, architects, and other creators rely on\ntraditional 3D content creation tools to render computer-\ngenerated videos. Unfortunately, existing 3D workflows are\nlaborious, time consuming, and require expertise. Emerging\ngenerative artificial intelligence tools, such as text-to-image\n(T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models, solve these issues by\nautomating many of the manual steps of traditional work-\nflows. Video generation, however, is difficult to control\nin that it is not easily possible to specify scene layout and\nmotion in a temporally consistent manner.\nRecent approaches have attempted to control diffusion\nmodels. For example, ControlNet [41] uses a pre-trained\nT2I diffusion model and finetunes an adapter network that\nis conditioned on depth, pose, or edge images to control the\nlayout. This strategy is successful for generating individual\nframes, but results in flicker for video generation. Other\napproaches aim at learning the complex types of motions\nencountered in natural videos directly [3,9,11,12,20,32,35,\n39,40,42]. While successful in generating smooth motions,\nthese approaches are not easily controllable. Finally, video-\nto-video diffusion models [6,10,19,37] enable video editing\nand stylization, but they require a high-fidelity video as input,\nwhich is not always available.\nIn this paper, we aim to combine the power of 3D work-\nflows with T2I models for generating 4D-guided stylized\n1\narXiv:2312.01409v1  [cs.CV]  3 Dec 2023\nanimations. Specifically, we leverage 3D tools to rapidly pro-\ntotype proxy geometry and motion of a scene (e.g., camera\npaths, physically based simulation, or character animation)\nwhile utilizing the T2I generation model as a renderer to\noutput the final stylized animations (see Fig. 1). At the core\nof our method is the ability to leverage the ground truth 4D\nspatio-temporal correspondences that can be obtained from\nan animated 3D scene to guide the image generation. First,\nwe leverage the correspondence information to effectively\nperform noise initialization which is critical for temporal\nconsistency. Many recent video-to-video stylization meth-\nods resort to inverting the source video to obtain consistent\nnoise initialization [6,10]. However, this is not possible in\nour setup since we do not have an initial source video and\ninversion does not work well on untextured renderings of\nthe 3D scene. Instead, we propose to utilize the canonical\nrepresentation (i.e., UV space) of the 3D scene to initialize\nrandom noise which is then projected to each frame of the\nanimation. Next, we enrich the self-attention layers of the\nimage diffusion model which are known to contain spatial\nappearance information vital for obtaining consistent render-\nings [6,37]. Specifically, we propagate both the input and\noutput of self-attention layers across the frames via known\ncorrespondences to enforce more consistent results. Finally,\nsimilar to previous work [41], we use the depth cues ren-\ndered from the 3D scene in conjunction with control models\nto provide structure guidance. In summary, our framework\ntreats the pre-trained T2I diffusion model as a multi-frame\nrenderer that is able to capture the correspondences while\nmaintaining high-fidelity and consistent generations.\nWe evaluate our method on a variety of scenes and demon-\nstrate its advantages with comparisons to state-of-the-art\nmethods. In summary, our contributions include:\n\u2022 We present a novel framework for 4D-guided animation\nsynthesis utilizing the pre-trained T2I generation models\nas a multi-frame renderer.\n\u2022 We enhance the self-attention layers of the image genera-\ntion model by performing correspondence-aware blending\nof both input and output features to enforce consistent\nappearance synthesis.\n\u2022 We introduce a UV-space noise initialization mechanism.\nCombined with the correspondence-aware attention mech-\nanism, this enables better consistency across frame gener-\nations.\n2. Related Work\nIn this section, we discuss the methods most closely re-\nlated to ours. A comprehensive review of diffusion models\nfor visual computing can be found in [25].\nVideo Generation. T2V diffusion models extend T2I mod-\nels by generating dynamic scenes. The majority of works\nin this area focus on extending pre-trained T2I diffusion\nmodels and finetuning on video data [3,9,12,14]. A typical\nmethod of lifting image-based models to videos is to add a\ntime-aware module. This can include 3D convolutions [3], or\npseudo-3D convolutions factorized over spatial and temporal\ndimensions to reduce computational costs [7, 7, 9, 11, 32].\nRecently, [11] has shown very compelling video generation\nresults by training a motion module with such temporal lay-\ners on top a frozen StableDiffusion model [31]. All of these\napproaches, however, lack fine-grained structural control of\nthe video generation process in a temporally stable manner.\nMoreover, training a high-quality T2V model is computation-\nally demanding and challenging, in part due to the limited\nsizes of available captioned high-quality video datasets. This\nis part of the reason why existing T2V models are limited to\noutputting only a few seconds of animation. For these rea-\nsons, we build on T2I diffusion models and directly leverage\nground truth correspondences of the input meshes to gener-\nate highly expressive and temporally consistent animations\nof arbitrary length.\nVideo Editing and Stylization. Another line of work fo-\ncuses on video editing and stylization. Given an input video,\nvideo editing/stylization aims to change the input video ac-\ncording to a user-defined prompt, while keeping other com-\nponents harmonious. Earlier work, such as [2], decomposes\na video to atlases and performs editing directly on these\natlases. This approach obtains perfect consistency, but it is\nonly applicable to certain types of scenes and the decom-\nposition is very slow to compute. Exemplar works based\non diffusion models [6,7,19,27,37] along this path gener-\nally rely heavily on extracting temporal information from\nthe input video, e.g., via DDIM inversion [16], then inflat-\ning the self-attention modules to attend to multiple frames,\nand propagating the edited contents across different frames.\nThese techniques typically overfit to video inputs and are not\ndirectly applicable to our setting. For this reason, we adopt\nthese baselines ensuring a fair comparison to their core meth-\nods, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms them.\nIn addition, as the temporal prior is either extracted from the\ninput video or learned from video training data, these works\ngenerally lack 3D awareness and may not generate 3D-aware\nanimations. A recent attempt designed a 4D representation\nthat employs a canonical field and deformation field to each\nframe, such that one can easily edit the video by changing\ncontents on the canonical field which propagates naturally\nto the other frames [23]. However, this representation still\nhas a relatively weak generalization ability and tends to only\nwork well on very short video clips.\nIn summary, while related, none of these video editing\napproaches operate in the same setting as our approach,\nwhich takes a low-fidelity, untextured rendering of a scene\nas input to generate a video.\n2\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\npost-attn\nfeatures\nfeatures in\ntexture space\n.\n.\n.\npre-attn\nfeatures\nkeyframe\nnoises\nUV maps\nUV maps\ndepths\ntext prompt\nanimation\ninitial noise\nfor each object\nunified\ninitial noise\nnoise for frame i\nunified\nfeatures\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nrerendered features\nfor all frames\nself-attn layer\nUV noise initialization\nSystem setup\nKeyframe feature extraction\nRegeneration\nQ  WK[\n\u221ad\n]\n...\n...\n...\n...\nWV\n+\nsoftmax(\n)\n]\n]\n...\nFigure 2. Overview of our pipeline. Our system takes as input a set of UV and depths maps rendered from an animated 3D scene. We use a\ndepth-conditioned ControlNet [41] to generate corresponding frames while using the UV correspondences to preserve the consistency. We\ninitialize the noise in the UV space of each object which we then render into each image (Sec. 3.3). For each diffusion step, we first use\nextended attention for a set of keyframes and extract their pre- and post-attention features (Sec. 3.1). The post-attention features are projected\nto the UV space and unified. Finally, all frames are generated using a weighted combination of the outputs of the extended attention with the\npre-attention features of the keyframe, and the UV-composed post-attention features from the keyframes (Sec. 3.2).\n3D Generation. This class of methods is able to achieve\nnear-perfect 3D consistency by using underlying 3D repre-\nsentations. One line of work [4,8,15] focuses on scene gener-\nation using diffusion models. These works typically predict\nor estimate the scene geometry on the fly using monocular\npredictors such as MiDaS [29] and use that information to\nconstitute individual generations into a scene. This approach\nis applicable only in specific domains such as indoor scenes\nor nature scenes, with limited motion control ability due to\ndepth\u2013scale ambiguity. The closest form of 3D generation to\nour task is mesh texturing. Given an explicit representation\nsuch as a mesh, prior works [5,30,36] demonstrate convinc-\ning asset mesh texturization using the powerful inpainting\nfunction of Stable Diffusion [31]. Other works [24,26] use\nScore Distillation [26] to directly optimize a neural radiance\nfield [22], but they suffer from quality degradation poten-\ntially due to heavy classifier-free guidance [13]. Follow-up\nworks [21] attempt to combine the strength of score distilla-\ntion and mesh texturization. Since these methods generate a\nstatic texture for a given mesh, they are not able to capture\nappearance interactions (e.g., reflections or shadows) in case\nof scene-level content and motions.\n3. Method\nThe goal of generative rendering is to transfer creator-\ndefined scene-level proxy meshes (without appearance) and\nmotions directly to a convincing animation. Given a 3D\nscene composed of animated meshes, we render guiding\nchannels that consist of depth maps D = [D1, ..., DN] and\nUV coordinate maps UV = [UV 1, ..., UV N] where N is\nthe length of the sequence and each UV map contains the 2D\ntexture coordinates as well as an object ID in its RGB chan-\nnels. Using a depth-conditioned 2D image generation model\nsuch as StableDiffusion [31] with depth ControlNet [41], we\naim to transfer the sequence (Di, UV i) into a set of gener-\nated images that depict a stylized animation. To achieve this\ngoal, we perform feature blending over the input and output\nfeatures of the self-attention modules of the diffusion model\n(Sec. 3.2) and also perform UV-guided noise initialization\n(Sec. 3.3) to improve the temporal consistency. We provide\nan overview of our framework in Fig. 2 and our overall algo-\nrithm in Alg. 1. Next, we provide some background on the\nself-attention features of a diffusion model before discussing\nthe different parts of our method in detail.\n3.1. Self-attention feature injection\nRecent work has demonstrated that self-attention features\nencode spatial self-similarity [34] and they are effective in\nterms of maintaining temporal consistency when they are\nused to perform cross-frame attention [6,37]. A typical ap-\nproach is to extend the diffusion network to process multiple\nframes jointly where they can attend to each other\u2019s features.\nFurthermore, it is possible to manipulate both the input and\noutput features of a self-attention module to further enforce\nconsistency. We denote these operations as pre-attention and\npost-attention feature injections respectively and provide a\ndescription in the following.\nPre-attention Feature Injection. An attention module is\n3\ndefined as:\nF = Attn(Q; K; V ) = Softmax\n\u0012QK\u22a4\n\u221a\nd\n\u0013\n\u00b7 V ,\n(1)\nwhere Q, K, and V denote the query, key, and value features\nrespectively. In case of a self-attention module, Q, K and\nV are computed by projecting the same features f (i,l), via\nthe corresponding attention matrices, i.e.:\nQ(i,l) = WQf (i,l), K(i,l) = WKf (i,l), V (i,l) = WV f (i,l)\n(2)\nwhere i denotes the frame index and l denotes the diffusion\nstep and WQ/K/V are weight matrices for query, key, and\nvalues, respectively. In other words, for each query feature an\nattention weight is computed based on the similarity between\nthe query and each key feature. Then, the value features are\ncombined based on this attention weight.\nOne can manipulate the input features provided to the\nself-attention module, specifically the key and value features,\nwhich we denote as pre-attention feature injection. As dis-\ncussed by [10], in case of generating N frames, one naive\noption is to perform extended attention where the features\nf (i,l) of all the frames are concatenated and utilized as key\nand value pairs:\nK(i,l) = WK[f (1,l), ..., f (N,l)],\nV (i,l) = WV [f (1,l), ..., f (N,l)].\n(3)\nExtended attention is a synchronized operation, where\nall frames attend to features of each other resulting in a\nmore consistent generation. However, generating multiple\nframes together incurs a high computational cost, which in\npractice limits the number of frames that can be processed\nin a sequence. For this reason, we utilize extended attention\nonly for a subset of keyframes and propose mechanisms to\npropagate the keyframe features to the rest of the sequence,\nas discussed in the next section.\nPost-attention Feature Injection. While it is possible to\nmanipulate the input of the self-attention layer, another op-\ntion is to directly manipulate the output, which we denote as\npost-attention feature injection. In particular, given known\ncorrespondences between two frames i and j, one can re-\nproject F (i,l), the output of the self-attention module of\nframe i at diffusion step l, to obtain F (j,l):\nF (j,l) = \u03c0i,j(F (i,l)),\n(4)\nwhere \u03c0i,j denotes the re-projection operation, which is\nenabled by the ground truth pixel-level correspondences\nbetween frames given by our UV maps.\nWhile post-attention feature injection is effective in\nachieving consistency, it tends to create blurry results and\nalso avoids generating of certain interactions between objects\n(e.g., shadows, reflections) since it overwrites the output the\nself attention. Hence, as described next, our method com-\nbines pre- and post-attention feature injection in an effective\nway to generate consistent but also high-quality frames.\n3.2. UV-space feature injection\nGiven that pre- and post-attention features of the self-\nattention module can be manipulated to enhance consistency,\nour main goal is to perform this manipulation guided by the\nground truth correspondences we have from the 3D scene.\nSpecifically, we utilize the canonical UV space to bring\nthe features from the different frames into correspondence\nwhich we denote as UV-space feature blending. Given a\nset of feature maps for each frame i, we project them to\na canonical UV space. In particular, for each texel in the\nUV space, we find its closest point correspondence in each\nframe. Having such correspondences from multiple frames,\na straightforward approach is to take the (weighted) average\nto blend the features [10]. However, we find this consistently\nleads to sub-optimal blurry results. Therefore, to combat\nover-smoothing of the features, we additionally perform\nblending sequentially and fill a certain texel with the features\nof its corresponding pixel in a frame only if it has not been\nfilled before. The final unified texture is then the mean of\nthe inpainted texture and the average texture. After features\nfrom all frames are blended, we obtain a UV-space feature\nmap which we denote as T (i,l). Once such a unified feature\nmap is obtained, we can project it back to each frame to\nobtain \u00aff (i,l).\nGiven the UV-space feature blending mechanism, we next\ndescribe how we utilize it during the image generation pro-\ncess. For each diffusion step, we first sample a random batch\nof m keyframes and perform extended attention on these\nkeyframes, extracting both their pre-attention features f (i,l)\nKF\nand post-attention features F (i,l)\nKF . We further composite a\nUV space feature map, \u00afT l\nKF , by blending F (i,l)\nKF as described\npreviously. We then perform the diffusion step on all the\nframes (in case of keyframes, the diffusion step is simply re-\npeated) in a sequential manner. For each frame, we compose\nthe pre-attention features by concatenating the pre-attention\nfeatures of the keyframes, f l\nKF = [f (1,l)\nKF , ..., f (m,l)\nKF ], with\nthe pre-attention features of the current frame f (i,l) resulting\nin:\nK(i,l) = WK[f (i,l), f l\nKF ],\nV (i,l) = WV [f (i,l), f l\nKF ].\n(5)\nAfter executing the self-attention module, we blend the out-\nput, i.e., post-attention features of the current frame \u02c6\nF (i,l),\nwith the projection of the blended post-attention features to\nthe current frame \u00af\nF (i,l). Hence, the updated output of the\nmodule becomes:\nF (i,l)\nout = \u03b1 \u00b7 \u00af\nF (i,l) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 \u02c6\nF (i,l)\n(6)\n4\nwhere \u02c6\nF (i,l) is the output of the inflated self-attention block\ncomputed using keys and values in Eq. 5.\n3.3. UV noise initialization\nPrior video editing works [6, 10] generally rely on in-\nversion methods, such as DDIM inversion [16], to invert\neach source frame to the noise space which are then used as\ninitialization for editing. Since source frames in the input\nvideo are coherent, this inversion strategy yields relatively\ncoherent noise patterns that in turn helps with consistent\nediting. However, in our case, since we have an untextured\nscene, inverting rendered frames that lack appearance does\nnot lead to coherent noisy latents. Another option is to\nkeep the noise fixed across all frames. However, this results\nin severe texture-sticking issues as we demonstrate in the\nsupplementary material. We seek an alternative to capture\ntemporal correlations in initial noise patterns. Inspired by\nprevious work [9, 18], we leverage the fact that we have a\ncanonical UV space by initializing the noise in this space by\ncreating a Gaussian noise texture. We then project this noise\nto each frame by utilizing the frame\u2013UV correspondences.\nAs we illustrate in our evaluations, this significantly boosts\nthe coherency of the generated outputs.\n3.4. Latent normalization\nWe notice a color flickering issue, where the overall color\ndistribution and contrast change between frames, even if the\nmotion is limited. Therefore, we apply an AdaIN opera-\ntion on the predicted latents to make every frame\u2019s overall\ndistribution similar to the first frame. The simple AdaIN\noperation solves this issue for some samples, but we find that\ncalculating the distribution over all pixels is very sensitive\nto the motions. Therefore, inspired by [1], we calculate the\nstatistics only on the background pixels, which are easy to\nseparate in our setup.\n4. Experiments\nDatasets. We evaluate our method on scenes with various\ncomplexity demonstrating three main types of animation\nsequences: 1) Camera rotations: given a single static object\nwe create a camera path with 360-rotation around the object;\n2) Physical simulation: we prepare a motion sequence by\nutilizing physically based simulation, e.g., bouncing balls\nwhere we use rigid body dynamics for collision handling;\n3) Character animation: we create scenes with rigged and\nanimated characters obtained from Mixamo and render them\nwith various dance motions.\nBaselines. To our knowledge, no published work directly\nfocuses on the same task our method does. Therefore, we\nhttps://www.mixamo.com/\nAlgorithm 1 Generative Rendering\nInput: UV maps UV = [UV 1, ..., UV N]; depth maps D =\n[D1, ..., DN]; text prompt c; diffusion model \u03a6; projection from\nUV to image \u03c0UV; T diffusion steps; k keyframes\nzUV \u223c N(0, I)\n// Sample noise in UV space\nz = zT = \u03c0UV(zUV)\nFor t = T, . . . , 1 do\nKF = shuffle({i1, . . . , ik})\n// Sample keyframes\nfKF , FKF \u2190 \u03a6(zKF , DKF , c)\n// Grab features from \u03a6\n\u00afTKF = blend(\u03c0\u22121\nUV(FKF )) // Blends features in UV space\nzt\u22121 = [ ]\nFor zi in z do\n\u00af\nF i = \u03c0UV i( \u00afTKF )\nzi\nt\u22121 = \u03a6(zi, DKF , c, fKF , \u00af\nF i)\nzt\u22121.append(zi\nt\u22121)\nz = zt\u22121\nOutput: z\nadapt two recent methods to our setting as baselines. 1)\nwe use the pre-attention feature propagation mechanism of\nPix2Video [6] (i.e., each frame attends to an anchor and\nprevious frame) together with depth conditioning, and 2) we\napply the extended attention mechanism and token propaga-\ntion from TokenFlow [10] using nearest neighbor matching.\nWe note that the original TokenFlow method computes cor-\nrespondences by matching features obtained via inverting\noriginal frames. Since this is not meaningful in our case, we\ninstead provide the ground truth correspondences we obtain\nfrom 3D. Both Pix2Video and TokenFlow rely on inversion\nfor noise initialization. Again, this is not meaningful in our\nsetting, so we instead use the same noise to initialize each\nframe.\nEvaluation metrics. Following prior video editing evalua-\ntion protocols [3,6,7,10,37], we report two metrics based\non CLIP [28]. To measure frame consistency, we compute\nCLIP image embeddings for each frame of the output video\nand compute the average cosine similarity between all pairs\nof consecutive video frames. To measure prompt fidelity, we\ncompute the mean CLIP embedding similarity score between\neach frame of the output video and the corresponding input\nprompt.\nImplementation details. We use the StableDiffusion [31]\nv1.5 model and a depth-conditioned ControlNet [41] as our\nimage generator. We generate all results at 512 \u00d7 512 resolu-\ntion using Karras scheduler [17] with 50 denoising steps.\n5\nTokenFlow*\nGen1\nGen1\nTokenFlow*\na photo realistic basketball bouncing under dreamlike sunlight\nOurs\na hyper realistic fluffy Swarovski blue crystal fox running\nOurs\nPix2Video*\nPix2Video*\nPix2Video*\nPix2Video*\nPer-Frame\nPer-Frame\nFigure 3. Qualitative comparisons. We adapt the feature blending mechanisms proposed by Pix2Video [6] and TokenFlow [10] to our\nsetting. While Pix2Video produces reasonable results, it lacks a mechanism to maintain frame-level consistency. TokenFlow uses a token\npropagation & interpolation mechanism between nearby keyframes, but this results in blurred outputs in our setting.\nFigure 4. Camera and object rotation. Our algorithm supports camera and object rotations for static scenarios.\n4.1. Results\nQualitative results. Qualitative comparisons to the base-\nlines are shown in Fig. 3. While Pix2Video [6] produces\nhigh-quality frames it shows limited spatio-temporal con-\nsistency, because it purely relies on the cross-frame atten-\ntion mechanism to attend to corresponding features. Token-\nFlow [10] can produce smoother results, but we find that it\nconsistently produces blurry textures. This is in part due to\nthe lack of DDIM inversion [16], which provides a decent\nlevel of feature similarities across frames. In our setting,\nthis DDIM inversion is not meaningful and skipping the self-\nattention module to directly blend the features of keyframes\nmeans averaging less similar features, resulting in blurry\nappearance. Without accurate DDIM inversion and correct\nnearest neighbor matching, the blending oversmoothes the\nfeatures and lead to blurry outputs of low quality. In ad-\ndition, unlike nearest neighbor correspondences computed\nusing DDIM inversion, UV correspondences are not guar-\nanteed to be an exact match in the low-dimensional feature\nspace, which is only 64 \u00d7 64 pixels in our model, especially\naround object edges. Consequently, a straight blending of\nthe post-attention features also creates blurry results.\nOur method can handle camera rotation with reasonable\nquality in static object-level scenarios, as shown in Fig. 4.\nIn Fig. 5, we provide additional results on the same input\n6\na little girl walking around, Da Vinci style\na stormtrooper swimming\nthree slendermen dancing\nthe Joker dancing\na fox running in a lively green forest\na shining diamond ball bouncing in a chamber\na little girl walking around, Van Gogh style\nFigure 5.

Our method shows ro-\nbustness across a diverse set of prompts and styles. Our\ninflated attention modules can capture motion-specific traits,\nsuch as shadows (Row 3, Row 7), lighting changes (Row\n1), and reasonable deformations that are not modeled by the\ninput low-fidelity meshes (Row 1 ground regions).\nQuantitative results. We show quantitative evaluations for\nframe consistency and prompt fidelity in Tab. 1. We observe\nthat our frame consistency is better than all baselines using\nT2I models. As expected, Pix2Video [6] suffers more from\ntemporal changes due to the lack of a correspondence injec-\ntion module. Even though TensorFlow\u2019s token propagation\nencourages smoothness over fidelity, our method still shows\nbetter consistency. Only the T2V model Gen1 has a better\nframe consistency, which is expected because it is trained on\nvideo data. All current T2V models, including Gen1, can\nonly generate a few frames and are limited in other ways.\nOur approach is an attempt to overcome this deficiency using\n7\nno post-attn\nno pre-attn\nOurs\nfixed noise\nFigure 6.

Our method also shows a higher prompt fidelity\nthan relevant baselines that offer a reasonable amount of temporal\nconsistency. *baseline adapted to our setting.\n2D T2I models exclusively. Fidelity-wise, we are slightly\nbetter than Pix2Video [6], because it reuses the set of pre-\nattention features from previous frames, while we only reuse\na portion of the pre-attention features to generate each frame.\nSince TokenFlow [10]\u2019s token propagation mechanism in-\ntroduces over-smoothing effects, its results are blurry for\nmany of the samples, hence achieving lower fidelity scores.\nOur generative rendering utilizes the benefits of pre-attention\ninflation to gain overall global structural and semantic con-\nsistency, while also combining with post-attention feature\nwarping as local guidance. Combined with our UV noise\ninitialization, we outperform or are on par with all relevant\nbaselines in the proposed setting.\nAblation studies. We perform a thorough ablation study to\nverify our design choices, shown in Fig. 6. We study three\naspects of our pipeline: 1) comparing with pre-attention in-\njection only, 2) comparing with post-attention injection only,\nand 3) the effectiveness of UV noise initialization. We ob-\nserve that directly unifying and projecting the post-attention\nfeatures without passing through the attention module pro-\nduces chaotic results (severe artifacts in \u201cno pre-attn\u201d, the\njoker\u2019s face and clothes regions). This observation is in line\nwith our hypothesis for the poor performance of the adapted\nTokenFlow mechanism. When the motion is relatively large,\ngeometrically matched features may not be good matches in\nthe feature space. Therefore, directly warping a feature from\none frame to another based on the geometrical correspon-\ndence has a high chance of not producing reasonable outputs.\nHowever, when we combine post-attention feature warping\nwith pre-attention feature injection, the post-attention fea-\ntures can act as guidance for the next network layer. Without\npost-attention feature warping, purely pre-attention feature\ninjection does not guarantee pixel-wise consistency since\nthe attention operation merely computes a correspondence\nbased on feature similarities (in \u201cno post-attn\u201d, the joker\u2019s\nclothes change over frames). Our UV noise initialization is\nwell-aligned with our setup. If we use fixed noise instead,\nthe blending of the features may cause unwanted artifacts (in\n\u201cfixed noise\u201d, the joker\u2019s face has blending artifacts and is not\nrecognizable in the third image). Our UV noise initialization\nserves generally and can work beyond our setup. Additional\ndetails on ablations are included in the supplementary.\n5. Discussion\nIn this paper, we introduce Generative Rendering, a novel\nzero-shot pipeline based on 2D diffusion models for 4D-\nconditioned animation generation. Our method can animate\ncreator-defined low-fidelity meshes and motion sequences,\nthereby bypassing steps requiring significant manual labor\nsuch as detailing, texturing, physical simulation, etc. The\nkey idea of generative rendering is to utilize the prior within\na depth-conditioned 2D diffusion model to provide the basic\nstructure and physical fidelity to make convincing anima-\ntions. This is accomplished by injecting the correspondences\ninto the diffusion model using a combination of pre- and\npost-attention feature injection while unifying these features\nin the UV space. Our model demonstrates better frame con-\nsistency and prompt fidelity than relevant baselines.\nLimitation and future work. Generative rendering cannot\nachieve real-time animations due to the multi-step inference\nof current diffusion models. However, accelerating this in-\nference stage has been an active research area and advances\nin this area, such as consistency models [33], can be directly\napplied to speed up our method. Furthermore, generative\n8\nrendering is not yet able to guarantee perfect consistency and\npreservation of details. This is mainly because our method\nworks purely in the low-dimensional latent space, which is\nonly 64 \u00d7 64 pixels in our model resulting in imprecise UV\ncorrespondences. For the same reason, generative rendering\nmay suffer from unwanted misalignment and artifacts. We\nbelieve that applying some of findings to pre-trained video\ndiffusion models to augment them with 3D controllability is\nan exciting future direction.\nConclusion. Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-\nart generative methods across multiple domains, such as 2D,\n3D, and video generation and editing. generative rendering\nadds unprecedented levels of control to video generation\nwith T2I diffusion models by bridging the gap between the\ntraditional rendering pipeline and diffusion models.\nAcknowledgement.

Additional qualitative results\nWe refer to the supplemental webpage for various qualita-\ntive results obtained by using different 3D scenes, motions,\nand target prompts.\nB. Additional quantitative results\nWe report CLIP [28] embedding similarities for a pair\nof frames separated by different frame intervals in Tab. 2.\nAs shown, semantic consistency achieved by our method is\nstable across different intervals. This is potentially because\nof our texture-based feature aggregation. This provides a\ncanonical representation for the objects that links frames\nthat are temporally further apart even in long sequences.\nEven though video-based methods such as Gen1 [7] achieve\ntemporally smoother results, we speculate that it is not easy\nfor them to capture such long range interactions.\nC. Robustness to video length\nOur method can be scaled up to handle long input se-\nquences. To generate a long output video, our method re-\nquires the sampling of a sparse set of keyframes, and the\nunified features in the texture space can be propagated. The\nonly GPU memory bottleneck in our method is the parallel\nprocessing of the keyframes using inflated attention. Our al-\ngorithm is robust enough to generate long videos with >200\nframes with <12GB GPU memory.\nD. Additional ablations\nEffectiveness of UV noise initialization. We find that the\nperformance of many components in our pipeline, e.g. in-\nflated attention, are tightly related to the initial noise. Video\nediting works [6, 10, 38] typically require accurate DDIM\ninversion [16] as noise initialization. Using DDIM inverted\nnoise encourages temporal coherence and similarities to the\ninput video. However, since our input is textureless UV\nmaps and depths, DDIM inversion constantly fails and will\nnot provide useful information. We instead propose to utilize\nthe canonical UV space to initialize the noise in each frame\nof the sequence. In our supplemental page, we show the\neffectiveness of this initialization strategy.\nEffectiveness of latent normalization. Our latent normal-\nization can address a large portion of the color flickering\nissue, where the overall color distribution shifts randomly\nfor different frames. We notice that small color shifts in\nthe latent space will be inflated by the VAE decoder used in\nStable Diffusion [31], causing the generation process very\nsensitive to small differences in the latent space. The video\ncomparison is included in our supplemental page.\nE. Limitation and failure cases\nground texture resolution: 2048\nground texture resolution: 3072\nFigure 7. Effect of different texture resolution. If the ground\u2019s\ntexture resolution is too low (2048\u00d72048), artifacts appear at\nground regions in the final rendered image compared with using a\nhigher texture resolution (3072\u00d73072). Prompt: a train running in\na field of green grass.\nOur method still suffers from several aspects. A large\nportion of our inconsistency comes from the VAE decoder.\nAs mentioned in D, small inconsistencies in the latent space\nwill be inflated by the VAE decoder while transiting into\nRGB frames. This phenomenon scales to image details,\nwhere small differences in the latent space will be inflated\nafter decoding with the VAE. Additionally, since our noise\ninitialization and feature fusion both work in the UV space,\nit could be tricky to set the texture resolutions. Setting the\ntexture resolution too low will create corrupted regions while\ntoo high will cause the UV coordinates to be too far away\nand no blending effect will take place. An example is shown\nin Fig. 7. Finally, our work does not yet generalize to large\nenvironmental changes and dramatic perspective changes.\nThis is because of the highly overlapping pixel-wise matches\nand bad feature projections. We believe finetuning or adding\na video module to be an exciting future direction to improve\nthe performances on these more challenging scenes.\n11\n"

However, rendering dynamic,\nlong-duration radiance fields on ubiquitous devices remains\nchallenging, due to data storage and computational con-\nstraints. In this paper, we introduce VideoRF, the first ap-\nproach to enable real-time streaming and rendering of dy-\nnamic radiance fields on mobile platforms. At the core is\na serialized 2D feature image stream representing the 4D\nradiance field all in one. We introduce a tailored train-\ning scheme directly applied to this 2D domain to impose\nthe temporal and spatial redundancy of the feature im-\nage stream. By leveraging the redundancy, we show that\nthe feature image stream can be efficiently compressed by\n2D video codecs, which allows us to exploit video hard-\nware accelerators to achieve real-time decoding. On the\nother hand, based on the feature image stream, we pro-\npose a novel rendering pipeline for VideoRF, which has spe-\ncialized space mappings to query radiance properties ef-\nficiently.

We have developed a real-time in-\nteractive player that enables online streaming and render-\ning of dynamic scenes, offering a seamless and immersive\nfree-viewpoint experience across a range of devices, from\ndesktops to mobile phones. Our project page is available at\nhttps://aoliao12138.github.io/VideoRF/.\n1. Introduction\nPhotorealistic Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) of dynamic\nscenes offers an immersive experience in virtual reality\nand telepresence. Work involving Neural Radiance Fields\n(NeRFs) has shown great potential in creating photorealis-\ntic Free-Viewpoint Videos (FVVs). However, there are still\nchallenges in smoothly delivering and rendering FVVs us-\ning NeRFs on commonly used devices, similar to the ease of\nwatching online videos. The difficulty lies in reducing the\ndata capacity for transmitting and storing long sequences\nand ensuring a low, mobile-compatible computational load.\nNeural Radiance Field (NeRF) [40] surpasses traditional\n3D reconstruction methods in photorealistic novel view\nsynthesis. Several works extend NeRF to dynamic scenes\nby maintaining a canonical space and matching it implicitly\n[11, 43, 49] or explicitly [35] to align with each frame\u2019s live\nspace. However, their dependence on canonical space lim-\nits effectiveness in sequences with large motions or topo-\narXiv:2312.01407v1  [cs.CV]  3 Dec 2023\nlogical changes. Other methods introduce new represen-\ntations like 4D feature grids [19] or temporal voxel fea-\ntures [12], achieving impressive results on the scenes with\ntopological transformations. Yet, [12] struggles with rep-\nresenting longer sequences owing to model capacity con-\nstraints, while [19] encounters streaming challenges due\nto large storage needs. Recent efforts [27, 55, 66] focus\non compressing dynamic frames for streaming, but their\ncomputational intensity limits mobile applicability. Con-\ncurrently, on mobile devices, real-time rendering of static\nscenes has been achieved by baking NeRF into mesh tem-\nplates [7, 53, 75] or texture assets [51]. However, these\ntechniques fall short for dynamic scenes as their per-frame\nrepresentation becomes too bulky for real-time loading.\nMoreover, while NeRF compression methods [52, 57, 66]\ncan be employed, they introduce decoding or rendering\noverheads unsuitable for mobile platforms. Despite the ex-\nistence of NeRF solutions for dynamic scenes and mobile\noptimization, a cohesive approach that effectively addresses\nboth still poses a difficulty.\nIn this paper, we propose VideoRF \u2013 a novel neural mod-\neling approach that enables real-time streaming and render-\ning of human-centric dynamic radiance fields on common\nmobile devices (see Fig. 1). Our key idea is to view the\n4D feature volumes reconstructed from a dynamic scene\nas a 2D feature image stream, which is friendly to video\ncodec. Each feature image records the densities and ap-\npearance features of one frame. We hence propose a ren-\ndering pipeline for this representation.\nIn this rendering\npipeline, VideoRF uses a set of mapping tables to connect\nthe 3D space with the 2D feature images. This allows for\nO(1) density and feature retrieval from the images for ev-\nery 3D sample point in the space. To reduce the computa-\ntional complexity of rendering, we adopt the deferred shad-\ning model [51] with a global tiny MLP to decode the inte-\ngrated feature vectors into pixel colors. All rendering oper-\nations here are low-cost and compatible with the fragment\nshader model, making it possible to implement this render-\ning pipeline on various devices that have GPUs.\nSecond, we present a sequential training scheme to ef-\nfectively generate the 2D feature image stream. Specifi-\ncally, VideoRF adaptively groups frames by analyzing mo-\ntion from the sequential data to ensure temporal stability\nfor mapping table generation. We deploy 3D and 2D Mor-\nton sorting techniques to improve spatial consistency in the\nmapping. VideoRF contains spatial and temporal continu-\nity regularizers that are applied on the mapped 2D feature\nimages using the mapping table. This training strategy en-\nforces the temporal and spatial redundancy to the 2D fea-\nture image stream. We show that our feature image stream\nwith spatiotemporal sparsity can be efficiently compressed\nby off-the-shelf video codecs and reaches high compression\nrates.\nMoreover, based on these findings, we build a cross-\nplatform player based on VideoRF that can play FVVs in\nreal-time, supported by video hardware accelerators. In this\nway, users can interactively drag, rotate, pause, play, fast-\nforward, rewind, and jump to specific frames, providing a\nviewing experience as seamless as watching online videos\non various devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops,\nand desktops which was unseen before.\nTo summarize, our contributions include:\n\u2022 We propose VideoRF, a novel approach to enable real-\ntime dynamic radiance field decoding, streaming and ren-\ndering on mobile devices.\n\u2022 We present an efficient and compact representation,\nwhich represents 4D radiance field into 2D feature stream\nwith low rendering complexity to support hardware video\ncodec and shader rendering.\n\u2022 We introduce a training scheme to directly impose spatial-\ntemporal consistency on our 2D feature stream for effi-\ncient compression.\n2. Related work\nNovel View Synthesis for Dynamic Scenes.\nDynamic\nscenes pose a greater challenge in achieving realistic view\nsynthesis results due to moving objects. One approach is\nto reconstruct the dynamic scene and render the geometry\nfrom new viewpoints. The conventional RGB [8, 24, 31,\n37, 38, 50, 80] or RGB-D [10, 20\u201322, 42, 70, 71] solutions\nhave been extensively investigated. Mesh-based neural net-\nwork [5, 62, 68] techniques are effective for compact data\nstorage and can record view-dependent texture [5, 68], but\nsuch methods heavily rely on geometry, especially perform\npoorly for topologically complex scenarios.\nMany methods extend NeRF into the dynamic view syn-\nthesis settings. Some methods [11, 16, 30, 32\u201334, 44, 49,\n64, 69, 77, 79] handle spatial change directly conditions on\ntime and [15, 46, 47, 73, 82] use feature latent code to rep-\nresent time information. However, they do not support the\nstreaming of long sequences due to the limited represen-\ntation. Others learn spatial offsets from the live scene to\nthe canonical radiance field by using explicit voxel match-\ning [35], skeletal poses [26, 36, 45], deformed hashtable\n[25] and deformed volume [23, 60, 61, 67, 72, 81]. While\nthese methods can successfully render dynamic scenes with\nphoto-realistic quality, their heavy reliance on the canonical\nspace makes these methods vulnerable to long sequences,\nlarge motions, and topological alterations. Recently, several\nmethods using 4D planes [2, 14, 19, 54, 74], voxel grid [12],\nFourier representation [65], residual layers [39] or dynamic\nMLP maps [48] to represent dynamic scene. However, the\ninference computational complexity makes it difficult for\nthem to implement streaming and decoding on mobile de-\nvices. Additionally, several methods such as [27, 55, 66]\nhave managed to facilitate the streaming of dynamic radi-\nFeature: f \nDensity: \ud835\udf48\ud835\udf48\nMLP\nVolumetric Accumulation\n\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\n(x, y, z)\n(i, j)\n\u2026\n\u2026\nMapping Table: M\n\u0303\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\nFigure 2.

Recent\nworks have demonstrated that static neural radiance fields\ncan be rendered on mobile devices. They achieve this by\ndirectly converting the neural radiance field to mesh [59] or\nusing traditional texture to represent the scene. [7, 75, 78]\nhave endeavored to augment the capabilities of neural ren-\ndering by employing mesh templates and feature texture,\n[1, 53] facilitating the rendering process through fragment\nshader to achieve surface-like rendering with similar ideas.\n[63] represents neural radiance features encoded on a two-\nlayer duplex mesh for better rendering quality.\nAlso, technologies [2, 3, 51] embody the principle of\nutilizing implicit neural representations to handle radiance\nrendering on mobiles. Although all these methods are fairly\neffective at compressing static scenes and enabling render-\ning on mobile devices, they still do not support streaming\nfor dynamic scenes, particularly in the case of long se-\nquences of dynamic scenes, they will still occupy a large\namount of storage space.\nNeRF Acceleration and Compression.\nNeRF demon-\nstrates exceptional performance in generating images from\narbitrary viewpoints, but it suffers from slow rendering effi-\nciency. Some methods focus on integrating a compact struc-\nture with a simplified MLP, which reduces the complexity\nof MLP calculations in traditional NeRFs. Key strategies\nhave been explored, including the employment of voxel grid\n[27, 56], octrees [13, 65, 76], tri-planes [4], hashing encod-\ning [41], codebook [28, 57], tensor decomposition [6, 58]\nto accomplish this. Using explicit structure makes training\nand rendering faster, but it also means that the 3D structure\ntakes up more storage space.\nTherefore, while methods such as CP-decomposition [6],\nrank reduction [58], and vector quantization [57] manage to\nattain modest levels of data compression, their application\nremains confined to static scenes. Additionally, some ap-\nproaches [9, 52, 66] opt for post-processing techniques, ini-\ntially utilizing baseline methods to train a decent NeRF rep-\nresentation, then special encoding and decoding schemes\nare employed to reduce the storage space. However, these\nkinds of methods are not hardware-friendly, the inference\nprocess is computationally demanding and cannot support\nreal-time streaming on mobile devices.\nIn contrast, our\nVideoRF uses codec tailored training, hardware-friendly\ndecoding and shader rendering, which enables real-time dy-\nnamic radiance field for long sequences with large motion.\n3. VideoRF Representation\nTo facilitate dynamic radiance field rendering on mobile de-\nvices, we adopt a representation that aligns with the video\ncodec format and maintains low computational complexity\nfor shader-based rendering. We propose turning the 3D vol-\nume representation into a 2D formulation, coupled with a\nhighly efficient rendering pipeline.\nIn our approach, each frame of the radiance field is rep-\nresented as a feature image I where the first channel stores\ndensity and the remaining h channels store feature. As de-\npicted in Fig. 2, given a 3D vertex position x, we retrieve\nits density \u03c3 and feature f using the equation:\n\u03c3, f = I[M(x)],\n(1)\nwhere M is the 3D-to-2D mapping table from Sec. 4.1.\nThis mapping table not only effectively excludes empty\nspace to reduce storage but also specifics mapping from\neach non-empty 3D vertex to a corresponding 2D pixel. The\nlookup operation is highly efficient, with a time complexity\nof O(1), facilitating rapid and convenient queries. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that our sequence of feature images is in a 2D format,\nwhich is friendly to the video codec hardware.\nFor rendering, inspired by [18, 51], we use a deferred\nrendering model. We first accumulate the features along the\nray:\n\u02dcf(r) =\nns\nX\nk=1\nTk(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c3k\u03b4k))fk,\nTk = exp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u2212\nk\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\u03c3j\u03b4j\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 ,\n(2)\nwhere ns is the number of sample points along the ray r. \u03c3k,\nfk, \u03b4k denotes the density, feature of the samples, and the\ninterval between adjacent samples respectively. The view-\ndependent color of the ray is then computed using a tiny\nglobal MLP \u03a6 shared across the frames as:\n\u02dcC(r) = sigmoid\n\u0010\n\u03a6\n\u0010\n\u02dcf(r), d\n\u0011\u0011\n,\n(3)\nCoarse Training\nBaking\nAdaptive \nGrouping\nFine-grained Sequential Training\n\u2026\n\u2112\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\n\u2112\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\n\u2112\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\n\u2026\nMLP\nVolumetric \nAccumulation\n\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\n\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\n2\n2\n\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfce\n\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\nMapping table: M\n\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\nUnion \nOccupancy \nGrid\n\u0303\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\n\u2026\n\u2026\nPlayer\nHardware \nVideo Codec\nFigure 3. Overview of our video codec-friendly training. First, we apply our grid-based coarse training [56] to generate per-frame\noccupancy grid Ot. Then, during baking, we adaptively group each frame and create a mapping table M for each group. Next, we\nsequentially train each feature image It through our spatial, temporal and photometric loss. Finally, feature images are compressed into\nthe feature video streaming to the player.\nwhere d is the view direction of the ray after positional en-\ncoding [40]. In this way, the computational burden is sig-\nnificantly reduced as each ray requires only a single MLP\ndecoding which can be implemented in a shader for real-\ntime rendering on mobile devices.\n4. Video Codec-friendly Training\nIn this section, we propose a training scheme, as depicted in\nFig. 3, to achieve a high compression rate by maintaining\nspatial and temporal consistency. For spatial aspect, we in-\ncorporate 3D-2D Morton sorting to preserve 3D continuity\nand apply a spatial consistency loss directly on 2D feature\nimages to enforce spatial coherence. On the temporal front,\nwe employ adaptive grouping, which allows frames within a\ngroup to share mappings, thereby reducing temporal disrup-\ntions, and temporal consistency loss, which serves to further\nreinforce temporal coherence. These consistencies are cru-\ncial which provide a stable and predictable layout for video\ncodecs.\n4.1. Baking and Map Generation\nCoarse stage pre-training.\nGiven multiview images of\neach frame, we first adopt an off-the-shelf approach [56]\nto generate the explicit density grid Vt\n\u03c3 for each frame t\nindependently. We then create a per-frame occupancy grid\nOt by masking in voxels whose opacity exceeds a certain\nthreshold \u03b3. This coarse stage sets the foundation for our\nsubsequent adaptive grouping in the baking stage.\nAdaptive group.\nGenerating an independent mapping\ntable for each frame t could disrupt temporal continuity,\nleading to increased storage requirements after video codec\ncompression. This issue arises because the same 3D point in\nadjacent frames might map to vastly different 2D positions\non the feature image. On the other hand, uniformly apply-\ning a single mapping table across all frames could introduce\nsignificant spatial redundancy. Considering that a 3D point\nmay only be occupied at sparse intervals, it could remain\nunderutilized for most of the duration, resulting in ineffi-\nciency. To balance these factors, we divide the sequence\ninto Groups of Frames (GOFs), maintaining a fixed resolu-\ntion for our 2D feature image and adaptively determining\nthe number of frames in each group. For a set of consecu-\ntive frames {i, i + 1, . . . , i + n}, we identify the maximum\nframe number \u03b1 such that the number of occupied voxels in\nthe union from i to \u03b1 does not exceed our pixel limit \u03b8:\nargmax\u03b1 g\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\u03b1\n[\nj=i\nOj\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 \u2a7d \u03b8,\n(4)\nwhere g() means the number of occupied grids in the union\noccupancy grid. Then, we will set the frame i to frame \u03b1\nas a GOF and frame \u03b1 + 1 to be the start frame of a new\nGOF. In this way, all the frames in the group share the same\nmapping. The same 3D position within the group will be\nmapped to the same 2D pixel location which keeps tempo-\nral consistency and saves the storage.\n3D Morton sorting.\nAfter the union occupancy grid is\nachieved, we apply Morton sorting to record its 3D spatial\ncontinuity. Morton ordering, or Z-ordering, interleaves the\nbinary representations of spatial coordinates, ensuring that\nspatially proximate entities remain adjacent in linear space.\nAs shown in Fig. 4(a), we apply 3D Morton sorting to the\nvertices based on their position coordinates of the union oc-\ncupancy grid. Vertices with a density below the threshold \u03b3\nare excluded. This process effectively maintains 3D spatial\nconsistency in the ordering.\n2D block partitioning and 2D Morton sorting. To pre-\nserve the 3D spatial continuity within a 2D framework, we\n(a)\n(x, y, z)\n(i, j)\nMapping Table M\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\n\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc69i\n(c)\n\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a+\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a+\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\u2026\n\u2026\n(b)\nFigure 4. Illustration of our mapping table generation. We first\nperform 3D Morton sorting (a) on each nonempty vertice and\ngroup it into chunks Ci (b). Next, we lay out each chunk into\neach block Bi of the feature image, arranged in 2D Morton order\n(c) within it.\nemploy 2D Morton sorting and partition the feature images\ninto blocks. This approach aligns with the block-wise com-\npression of frames in video codecs, where blocks with local\nsmoothness lead to more efficient storage. Specifically, we\nfirst divide the feature image into N 8 \u00d7 8 blocks, denoted\nas Bi, and correspondingly group the sorted vertices into N\n8 \u00d7 8 chunks, denoted as Ci, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). For\neach pixel p in a block Bi, we sort its relative position (u, v)\nin 2D Morton order. As shown in Fig. 4(c), each chunk Ci\nis then mapped to a block Bi, arranged in 2D Morton or-\nder within the block, to form the mapping table M. This\n2D Morton ordering ensures that sorted values in the 3D\nMorton ordering are positioned closely within each feature\nimage block, facilitating efficient compression during the\ntransformation process.\n4.2. Fine-grained Sequential Training\nWith the aid of our mapping table, we can sequentially train\nour feature images within each group through spatial con-\nsistency loss applied to 2D feature images and temporal\nconsistency loss between frames.\nSpatial consistency loss. In video encoding, regions with\nhomogeneous characteristics demonstrate high compres-\nsion efficiency. This efficiency stems from the minimal vari-\nation in pixel values within these areas, leading to a signifi-\ncant reduction in high-frequency components post Discrete\nCosine Transform (DCT) within the video codec. Conse-\nquently, these regions retain a higher proportion of low-\nfrequency components. Furthermore, the quantized coef-\nficients in such homogeneous regions are more likely to\ncontain a greater number of zero values, facilitating a more\ncompact data representation and reducing the overall data\nvolume. In order to enhance the homogeneity of our 2D\nfeature image, we introduce a total variance loss, Lspatial,\nduring our fine-grained training stage. For each channel of\nthe feature image I, we enforce its local smoothness by:\nLspatial =\n1\n|P|\nX\np\u2208V\n(\u2206u(p) + \u2206v(p)) ,\n(5)\nwhere P is the pixels of the feature image, \u2206u(p) shorthand\nfor Manhattan distance between the feature value at pixel\np := (u, v) and the feature value at pixel (u + 1, v) nor-\nmalized by the resolution, and analogously for \u2206v(p). By\nincreasing the spatial sparsity, the storage of feature videos\nafter video encoding is decreased at the same quality.\nTemporal consistency loss.\nA naive per-frame training\nscheme will disrupt temporal continuities by failing to in-\ncorporate inter-frame information and resulting in a high\nbitrate. This is because the residuals between frames are\nstored after entropy encoding.\nTo optimize storage effi-\nciency, we focus on minimizing the differences in the fea-\nture space between the adjacent frames to reduce the en-\ntropy. During our sequential training, we enhance inter-\nframe similarities by regularizing the current feature im-\nage with its predecessor, except for the initial frame of each\nadaptive group. This is achieved by applying\nLtemporal = \u2225It \u2212 It\u22121\u22251,\n(6)\nfor each frame t in the group, ensuring small residuals be-\ntween consecutive feature images. By employing tempo-\nral smoothness in this manner, we can further mitigate en-\ntropy throughout the video codec process, thereby facilitat-\ning storage conservation.\nTraining objective. Our total loss function is formulated\nas:\nLtotal = Lrgb + \u03bbsLspatial + \u03bbtLtemporal,\n(7)\nwhere \u03bbs and \u03bbt are the weights for our regular terms and\nLrgb is the photometric loss,\nLrgb =\nX\nr\u2208R\n\u2225c(r) \u2212 \u02c6c(r)\u22252,\n(8)\nwhere R is the set of training pixel rays; c(r) and \u02c6c(r) are\nthe ground truth color and predicted color of a ray r respec-\ntively.\n4.3. VideoRF Player\nFinally, we implement a companion VideoRF player to\nstream and render dynamic radiance fields on mobile de-\nvices. Given our feature stream, we quantize it into uint8\nformat and use H.264 for video codec. Note that the total\nresolution of feature images is under a 4K color image, en-\nsuring seamless real-time streaming and decoding even on\nmobile devices.\nFor the rendering part, we implement it via a fragment\nshader. For fast raymarching, we employ a multi-resolution\nhierarchy of occupancy grids for each group to skip empty\nspace at different levels. We leverage matrix multiplication\nin the shader to simulate our tiny MLP calculation. Dif-\nferent from [51], our method stores the mapping table in a\nFigure 5. Our VideoRF method generates results for inward-facing, 360\u25e6 video sequences featuring human-object interactions with large\nmotion. The images in the last row illustrate our ability to implement variable bitrate in these sequences.\n2D-to-3D format as an RGB image to save storage redun-\ndancy. Meanwhile, to speed up querying values for each\nsampled point, we adopt a parallel approach to expand a 2D\nfeature image into a 3D volume in the player. These tech-\nniques increase the overall speed while ensuring compact\nstorage.\nThe VideoRF player marks a significant milestone, as\nit first enables users to experience real-time rendering of\ndynamic radiance fields of any length. Within this player,\nusers can drag, rotate, pause, play, fast forward/backward,\nseek dynamic scenes, or switch between different resolu-\ntions like watching online video, offering an extraordinary\nhigh-quality free-viewpoint viewing experience. This ca-\npability also extends across a wide range of devices, from\nsmartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops, broaden-\ning the accessibility and applicability of dynamic radiance\nfields.\n5. Experimental Results\nIn this section, we evaluate our VideoRF on a variety of\nchallenging scenarios. We use the PyTorch Framework to\ntrain the model on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX3090.\nOur new captured dynamic datasets contain around 80\nviews at the resolution of 1920 \u00d7 1080 at 30 fps.\nTo\nensure the robustness of the algorithm, we also use the\nReRF dataset and the HumanRF dataset for result demon-\nstration in Fig. 5. We can render images for immersive,\n360\u25e6 video sequences that capture human interactions with\nobjects, especially for large motion and long duration se-\nquences. Please refer to the supplementary video for more\nvideo results.\n5.1. Comparison\nTo the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first real-\ntime dynamic radiance field approach that can decode and\nrender on mobile devices. Therefore, we compare to ex-\nisting dynamic neural rendering methods, including ReRF\n[66], HumanRF [19], TiNeuVox [12] and per-frame static\nreconstruction methods like MeRF [51]. We use ReRF [66]\ndataset and HumanRF [19] Actor3 sequence 1 for a fair\ncomparison, both in storage memory and image quality. As\nshown in Fig. 6, though TiNeuVox [12] has small storage,\nit faces the challenge of intensifying blurring effects as the\nframe count rises. MeRF [51] suffers from the large stor-\nage which is not suitable for dynamic scenes when stream-\ning and decoding for playing. HumanRF [19] though capa-\nble of representing dynamic scenes, also faces difficulties in\nstreaming and rendering on mobiles due to its computation\nFigure 6.

For a fair comparison in our experiments, in the ReRF\ndataset, we test the first 200 frames on the scene Kpop. We\nuse 6 and 39 as test views and the others as training views.\nAs for the HumanRF dataset, we apply the test methods as\nreferenced in HumanRF on the first 250 frames on Actor3,\nsequence 1. We utilize the values reported for HumanRF\nand TiNeuVox methods directly from the HumanRF study.\nIn the ReRF dataset, which includes large motion scenarios,\nwe match the rendering quality of the standard ReRF, while\nalso maintaining a compact data storage size. Meanwhile,\nin the HumanRF dataset with relatively small motion, we\nachieve a rendering quality that is second only to HumanRF,\naccomplished with the most efficient storage utilization. It\u2019s\nworth noting that, our method is the only method that can\nprovide both mobile and dynamic rendering tasks.

Evaluation\nAblation study. We analyze the impact of spatial consis-\ntency, temporal consistency, Morton sorting, block storage,\nand adaptive grouping on compression and rendering. In the\ncase of models that do not employ 3D and 2D Morton sort-\ning, spatial point data is sorted sequentially in row-major\norder while employing 2D block-wise storage. For models\nnot utilizing block storage, a 3D spatial Morton sorting is\napplied, followed by storage in a row-major format within\nthe 2D feature space. For models without adaptive group-\ning, the mapping table for each frame is calculated only\nbased on the occupancy grid of the current frame. As illus-\ntrated in Fig. 7, our full model exhibits the best performance\nFigure 8.

This\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our modules in reducing\ncapacity by maintaining consistency across time and space.\nWhile ReRF [66] exhibits slightly better quality in the stor-\nage range of 700-800KB, our method consistently demon-\nstrates higher PSNR across most capacity ranges and sup-\nports mobile rendering. Fig. 8 shows that under a 600KB\nstorage limit, our complete model yields more realistic re-\nsults with less compression blur.\nCross device runtime analysis. We evaluate the runtime\nbreakdown analysis of VideoRF as detailed in Tab. 2. Our\nexperimental setup includes a Desktop with an i7-12700F\nCPU and NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU, a Laptop with an i5-\n1135G7 CPU and Integrated GPU, a Tablet (iPad Pro) with\nan M2 chip, and a phone (iPhone 14 Pro) with an A16\nBionic chip.\nFor Desktops and Laptops, we employ a\nPython code base along with ModernGL. Meanwhile, for\nTablet and Smartphone, the VideoRF player is developed\nusing Swift and Metal. It\u2019s worth noting that the video de-\ncoding part primarily relies on CPU performance, while the\nrendering part mainly depends on GPU performance. These\ntwo parts operate asynchronously and simultaneously. The\nother part mainly covers operations such as data conver-\nsion between the GPU and CPU. Our results demonstrate\nthat VideoRF allows users to enjoy free-view videos at high\nframe rates on multiple devices, providing an experience\nthat rivals the smoothness of watching 2D videos on plat-\nforms such as YouTube.\nStorage of different components analysis.\nWe present\nthe storage requirements of each VideoRF component in\nTab. 3.

This compact representation facilitates\nrapid streaming across various devices.\n6. Discussion\nLimitation. As the first trial to enable a real-time dynamic\nradiance field approach capable of decoding and rendering\non mobile devices, our approach presents certain limita-\ntions. First, high-quality reconstruction requires a complex\nsystem that captures multiple views, which is notably ex-\npensive. Second, our training time increases with the num-\nber of frames, especially for long sequences. Additionally,\nour method currently lacks support for temporal interpola-\ntion, signifying a direction for future exploration.\nConclusion. We have presented VideoRF, a novel approach\nenabling real-time streaming and rendering of dynamic ra-\ndiance fields on mobile devices. Our VideoRF innovatively\nprocesses feature volumes as 2D feature streams and adopts\ndeferred rendering to effectively leverage classical video\ncodecs and rasterization pipelines. Our video codec friendly\ntraining scheme is implemented on 2D feature space to en-\nhance spatial-temporal consistency for compactness. Ad-\nditionally, our tailored player supports seamless streaming\nand rendering of dynamic radiance fields across a range of\ndevices, from desktops to smartphones. Our experiments\ndemonstrate its capability for compact and effective dy-\nnamic scene modeling. With the unique ability of real-time\nrendering of dynamic radiance fields on mobile devices, we\nbelieve that our approach marks a significant step forward in\nneural scene modeling and immersive VR/AR applications.\nReferences\n[1] Alja\u02c7z Bo\u02c7zi\u02c7c, Denis Gladkov, Luke Doukakis, and Christoph\nLassner.

Coarse Stage Pre-training and Baking\nGiven a long-duration multi-view sequence, we initially\nadopt the approach from DVGO [56] to generate an ex-\nplicit density volume grid V\u03c3 and color feature grids Vc\nrepresentation for each frame t. Following ReRF [66], we\nemploy a global MLP \u03a6c during this coarse stage training.\nThis MLP comprises a single hidden layer with 129 chan-\nnels, and we set the color feature dimension at h = 12.\nThroughout the training, we incrementally upscale the vol-\nume grid, from (125\u00d7125\u00d7125) \u2192 (150\u00d7150\u00d7150) \u2192\n(200\u00d7200\u00d7200) \u2192 (250\u00d7250\u00d7250), after reaching the\ntraining step 2000, 4000 and 6000, respectively. For loss\ncalculation, we utilize both the photometric MSE loss and\nthe total variation loss on V\u03c3, expressed as:\nLrgbcoarse =\nX\nr\u2208R\n\u2225c(r) \u2212 \u02c6c(r)\u22252,\n(9)\nLTVcoarse =\n1\n|V\u03c3|\nX\nv\u2208V\u03c3\nq\n\u22062xv + \u22062yv + \u22062zv,\n(10)\nLcoarse = Lrgbcoarse + \u03bbTVLTVcoarse,\n(11)\nwhere \u03bbTV = 0.000016. Here, R represents the set of train-\ning pixel rays, with c(r) and \u02c6c(r) denoting the actual and\npredicted colors of a ray r, respectively. \u22062\nx,y,zv signifies\nthe squared difference in the voxel\u2019s density value. Notably,\nthe total variation loss is activated only during the training\niterations from 1000 to 12000. For optimization, we uti-\nlize the Adam optimizer for training 16000 iterations with\na batch size of 10192 rays. The learning rates for V\u03c3, Vc\nand global MLP are 0.1, 0.11 and 0.002, respectively.\nOnce we obtain the density grid Vt\n\u03c3 for each frame t in\nthe coarse training phase, we generate a per-frame occu-\npancy grid Ot by retaining voxels with a density above the\nthreshold \u03b3 = 0.003. During our adaptive grouping stage,\nwe set the pixel limit to \u03b8 = 512 \u00d7 512.\n7.2. Fine-grained Sequential Training\nAfter creating the mapping tables, we proceed to fine-\ngrained sequential training within each group. At this stage,\nwe also introduce a global tiny MLP \u03a6f designed for effi-\ncient rendering on mobile platforms. This minimal MLP\n\u03a6f consists of only one hidden layer with 16 channels, and\nwe maintain the color feature dimension h at 12. Similar\nto the coarse stage, we progressively upscale the volume\ngrid during training, moving from (125 \u00d7 125 \u00d7 125) to\nFigure 9. Our VideoRF facilitates dynamic radiance field render-\ning on ubiquitous devices, from desktops to mobile phones.\n(150 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 150), then to (200 \u00d7 200 \u00d7 200), and fi-\nnally to (250 \u00d7 250 \u00d7 250), corresponding to the training\nsteps at 2000, 4000, and 6000, respectively. For loss cal-\nculations, we employ both the photometric MSE loss and\nthe total variation loss on the density volume V\u03c3, as well\nas spatial consistency loss and temporal consistency loss on\nthe feature image I:\nLrgbfine =\nX\nr\u2208R\n\u2225c(r) \u2212 \u02c6c(r)\u22252,\n(12)\nLTVfine =\n1\n|V\u03c3|\nX\nv\u2208V\u03c3\nq\n\u22062xv + \u22062yv + \u22062zv\n(13)\nLspatial =\n1\n|P|\nX\np\u2208V\n(\u2206u(p) + \u2206v(p)) ,\n(14)\nLtemporal = \u2225It \u2212 It\u22121\u22251,\n(15)\nLfine = Lrgbfine + \u03bbTVLTVfine + \u03bbsLspatial + \u03bbtLtemporal,\n(16)\nwhere \u03bbTV = 0.000016, \u03bbs = 0.0001 and \u03bbt = 0.0001. The\ntotal variation loss is specifically activated during training\niterations 1000 to 12000. We continue to use the Adam\noptimizer for 16000 iterations with a batch size of 10192\nrays.

Though there exist initial attempts to incorpo-\nrate these two methods into 3D segmentation, they face the\nchallenge of accurately and consistently segmenting objects\nin complex scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Seg-\nment Anything for NeRF in High Quality (SANeRF-HQ) to\nachieve high quality 3D segmentation of any object in a\ngiven scene. SANeRF-HQ utilizes SAM for open-world ob-\nject segmentation guided by user-supplied prompts, while\nleveraging NeRF to aggregate information from different\nviewpoints. To overcome the aforementioned challenges,\nwe employ density field and RGB similarity to enhance the\naccuracy of segmentation boundary during the aggrega-\ntion. Emphasizing on segmentation accuracy, we evaluate\nour method quantitatively on multiple NeRF datasets where\nhigh-quality ground-truths are available or manually an-\nnotated. SANeRF-HQ shows a significant quality improve-\nment over previous state-of-the-art methods in NeRF object\nsegmentation, provides higher flexibility for object local-\nization, and enables more consistent object segmentation\nacross multiple views. Additional information can be found\nat https://lyclyc52.github.io/SANeRF-HQ/.\n1. Introduction\nNeural Radiance Field (NeRF) [41] has produced state-of-\nthe-art results in novel view synthesis for intricate real-\nworld scenes. NeRF encodes a given scene using Multi-\nLayer Perceptrons (MLP) and supports queries of density\nand radiance given 3D coordinates and view directions,\nwhich are used to render photo-realistic images from any\nview points. Moreover, during training, NeRF only requires\nRGB images with camera poses, which directly links 3D to\n2D. The simple but ingenious architecture with its continu-\nous representation quickly starts challenging traditional rep-\nresentations using explicit discrete structures, such as RGB-\nD images or point clouds. As a result, NeRF is poised to\ntackle more challenging tasks in 3D vision.\nOne important downstream task that can benefit from\nNeRF representations is 3D object segmentation, which is\nfundamental in 3D vision and widely used in many applica-\ntions. To address object segmentation in NeRF, researchers\nhave investigated various methods. Semantic-NeRF [65],\ntargeting semantic segmentation, is one of the first works\nin this direction. DFF [33] distills the knowledge of pre-\ntrained features such as DINO [9] into a 3D feature field\nfor unsupervised object decomposition.\nSupervised ap-\nproaches, such as [47], utilize Mask2Former [14] to obtain\ninitial 2D masks and lifts them to 3D with a panoptic radi-\nance field. Although these methods demonstrate impressive\nresults, their performance is constrained by the pre-trained\nmodels used to produce features.\nRecently, large vision models, such as Segment Any-\nthing Model (SAM) [32], have emerged with strong zero-\nshot generalization performance and can be adopted as the\nbackbone component for many downstream tasks. Specif-\nically, SAM proposes a new paradigm for segmentation\ntasks which can accept a wide variety of prompts as input,\nand produce segmentation masks of different semantic lev-\nels as output. The versatility and generalizability of SAM\nthus shed light on a new way to perform promptable object\nsegmentation in NeRF. While there exist some investiga-\ntions [10, 13, 21] into this area, the mask quality in novel\nviews is still unsatisfactory.\nIn view of this, we propose a new general framework\nto achieve prompt-based 3D segmentation in NeRF. Our\nframework, termed Segment Anything for NeRF in High\nQuality, or SANeRF-HQ, leverages existing 2D foundation\nmodels such as Segment Anything to allow various prompts\nas input, and produces 3D segmentations with high accu-\nracy and multi-view consistency. The major contributions\nof our paper are:\n\u2022 We propose SANeRF-HQ, which is one of the first at-\ntempts in producing high-quality 3D object segmentation\nin NeRF in terms of more accurate segmentation bound-\naries and better multi-view consistency.\n\u2022 We validate our method by assembling and evaluating\n1\narXiv:2312.01531v1  [cs.CV]  3 Dec 2023\nquantitatively on a challenging dataset with high-quality\nground-truths.\n\u2022 We present a more general framework to embed founda-\ntion 2D image models into Neural Radiance Field and ex-\ntend it to different 3D segmentation tasks in NeRFs.\nComparing with [21] and [10], SANeRF-HQ can pro-\nduce more accurate segmentation results and is more flexi-\nble to a variety of segmentation tasks. Similar to SAM [32]\nin 2D segmentation, SANeRF-HQ can automatically seg-\nment a given entire 3D scene in high quality without any\nuser inputs.\nSANeRF-HQ inherits the zero-shot perfor-\nmance from SAM, instead of being bounded by pre-trained\nmodels with limited generalizability [5, 38, 47]. SANeRF-\nHQ is a general framework which can be readily extended\nto 4D dynamic NeRFs, where temporal consistency can be\nnaturally handled in a similar way as our multi-view consis-\ntency. Our preliminary results confirm the potential exten-\nsion to dynamic scenes.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Object Segmentation\n2D image segmentation is a thoroughly studied area where a\nlot of progress has been made, including semantic segmen-\ntation [12, 22, 63, 64], instance segmentation [6, 7, 23, 51,\n55, 56], and panoptic segmentation [18, 28, 31, 35, 36, 58].\nWith the emergence of Transformer-based models [8], Vi-\nsion Transformer (ViT) [19, 39, 60, 61] has become increas-\ningly popular as a backbone structure, and pre-trained fea-\ntures from large models such as MAE [24, 52, 57] have\ndemonstrated great power in segmentation tasks. Moreover,\nsignificant research effort [14, 28, 62] focuses on univer-\nsal models to accomplish multiple segmentation tasks under\ndifferent training configuration. However, the performance\nof these models on open-world images is not satisfactory, as\nthey cannot go beyond the limits prescribed by the underly-\ning training datasets.\nThus, latest research has been focusing on open-world\nsegmentation, aiming to generalize segmentation models to\nunseen data.\nThe recent advancement in visual founda-\ntion models have attracted great attention. DINOv2 [44]\nleverages self-supervised distillation and produces visual\nfeatures across domains without any fine-tuning.\nSeg-\nment Anything Model (SAM) [32], as a more significant\nbreakthrough, shows promising results on promptable seg-\nmentation. Given diverse and plentiful training data, the\nprompt-based architecture can enable zero-shot generaliza-\ntion, which extends relevant tasks to wider data categories.\nRecent works [16, 45, 66] have already adopted SAM in\nmany downstream tasks, enhancing the capability of differ-\nent segmentation models.\nIn spite of the great success of 2D segmentation, 3D seg-\nmentation is relatively underexplored.\nTraditional meth-\nods are usually based on RGB-D images [25] or point\nclouds [53, 54]. However, they require explicit depth or 3D\nrepresentations as input, and the generalizability is highly\nrestricted by the scarcity of the dataset and the expensive\ncomputational cost. Therefore, exploiting the vast 2D im-\nage datasets and performing 3D segmentation directly from\n2D multi-view images warrants attention from the commu-\nnity.\n2.2. Segmentation in Neural Radiance Field\nThe family of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [2\u20134, 11, 41,\n42] has become the state-of-the-art for novel view synthesis.\nBeyond that, requiring only multi-view images with camera\nparameters during training, NeRF can also be regarded as\nan implicit 3D representation since it captures the 3D struc-\ntural details of the scenes. Due to the capability of linking\n2D images to 3D volumes, NeRF shows potential impact in\nvarious 3D visual tasks, and numerous research works have\nbeen focusing on 3D object segmentation and scene decom-\nposition in NeRF.\nSemantic-NeRF [65] extends NeRF with an additional\nbranch encoding 3D semantic labels for semantic-level seg-\nmentation.\nOther research investigated 3D instance seg-\nmentation and make great efforts in solving inconsistency\nacross views. For example, [38] adopts an 3D object de-\ntection method [26] to resolve 2D mask correspondences.\n[47] utilize linear assignment, while [5] employs a con-\ntrastive loss to optimize 3D instance embeddings. Besides,\nthere are unsupervised methods [43, 48, 59], which can\nseparate foreground objects from background.\nHowever,\nthese approaches are mostly limited to simple scenes and\noften struggle to generalize to complex open-world prob-\nlems. To fully utilize 2D features from pre-trained mod-\nels, some research [21, 30, 33] introduces an extra feature\nfield to the vanilla NeRF model, which can fuse 2D features\nfrom pre-trained models into 3D. For instance, LERF [30]\nsplits images into patches of different sizes to obtain multi-\nscale CLIP [27] feature maps that can supervise the neu-\nral field training. ISRF [21] uses DINO [9] features and\nK-Means clustering to separate user-selected regions from\nbackground. However, lacking a powerful decoder, the seg-\nmentation based on these features is not accurate and sharp\nalong the boundaries.\nWith the proposal of SAM, SA3D [10] employs SAM\non the NeRF-rendered images and achieve 3D segmentation\nfrom a single-view 2D mask by self-prompting. Nonethe-\nless this pipeline relies on the first-view mask and is suscep-\ntible to the ambiguity inherent in SAM in delineating intri-\ncate structures during its self-prompting. SAN [13] chooses\nto distill the SAM encoder with a neural field to render\nSAM feature maps from novel views, which are supplied to\nthe SAM decoder to produce the segmentation. However,\nit can produce inconsistent masks in different views, and\n2\n>\n(\nPre-trained NeRF\nRendered\nRGB\n>\n(\nSAM Feature Field\nRendered\nSAM Feature\nObject Field\n<)\nSAM\nEncoder\nSAM\nDecoder\nSAM Feature\nCache\nObject\nMask\nUser\nPrompts\nOptimize\n>\n(\nPre-trained NeRF\nRendered\nRGB\nDensity\nRay-Pair RGB Loss\nDensity\nFeature Container\nMask Decoder\nMask Aggregator\nOr\nFigure 1. SANeRF-HQ Pipeline. Our method is composed of three parts: a feature container (feature cache or feature field), a mask\ndecoder, and a mask aggregator (object field). It first renders a set of images using a pre-trained NeRF and encodes their SAM features,\nwhich are cached or used to optimize a feature field. SAM decoder takes the feature maps from the cache or the feature field, and generates\n2D masks based on user prompts. The aggregator fuses 2D masks from different views to produce an object field.\ndistilling low resolution SAM feature maps results in alias-\ning in the output masks, in the form of jagged mask edges.\nContrary to these approaches, our proposed method directly\naggregates masks for neural field training, which naturally\naddresses the aliasing and consistency issues.\n3. Method\nGiven a pre-trained NeRF, our method aims to segment\nany kind of object in 3D, conditioning on the manual\nprompts and/or other user supplied inputs. The SANeRF-\nHQ pipeline in Figure 1 consists of three major components:\na feature container, a mask decoder, and a mask aggregator.\nThe feature container encodes the SAM features of images.\nThe mask decoder propagates the user supplied hints be-\ntween different views and generates intermediate mask out-\nputs using the SAM features from the container. Finally, the\nmask aggregator integrates the resulted 2D masks into 3D\nspace and utilizes the color and density fields from NeRF\nmodels to achieve high-quality 3D segmentation.\n3.1. Feature Container\nThe first step of utilizing SAM is to encode the images into\n2D features using the SAM feature encoder. These features\ncan be used repeatedly when predicting and propagating\nmasks, thus they can be precomputed or distilled for a scene\nand reused for different input prompts.\nWe consider two different methods for the feature con-\ntainer. The first method is to compute and cache the fea-\ntures of multiple views. This allows us to reuse ground-truth\nSAM features for different user prompts and generate accu-\nrate 2D mask when decoding. However, the cache size is\nconstrained by the memory available. It also requires extra\ntime to run the encoder if users choose to supply prompts\non any of the uncached novel views.\nAnother method is to distill the SAM features using a\nneural field, which is similarly done in SAN [13] and in [21,\n30], where SAM, DINO, or CLIP features are lifted into\n3D. Instead of radiance or density, 3D SAM embeddings are\nencoded in a neural field and the same volumetric rendering\nequation is applied to render 2D feature maps. Specifically,\nvanilla NeRF [41] is formulated as f(x, d; \u0398N) = (\u03c3, c),\nwhere x = (x, y, z) is the position of the point, d = (\u03b8, \u03d5)\nis the view direction, and \u0398N is the set of parameters of\nthe color and density field. The RGB color at each pixel is\nestimated through a ray casting process:\n\u02c6C(r) = PK\nk=1 \u02c6T (tk) \u03b1 (\u03c3 (tk) \u03b4k) c (tk) ,\n\u02c6T (tk) = exp\n\u0010\n\u2212 Pk\u22121\na=1 \u03c3 (ta) \u03b4a\n\u0011\n,\n\u03b1(x) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212x),\n\u03b4k = tk+1 \u2212 tk,\n(1)\nwhere r(t) = o + td is the ray emitted from the camera\ncenter passing through that pixel, and \u03c3 (tk) and c (tk) are\nthe volume density and color at the point o + tkd along the\nray.\nTo encode SAM features, the SAM embedding at (x, d)\nis defined as f = f(x, d; \u0398f), where \u0398f is the set of pa-\n3\nrameters of the feature field. The feature \u02c6F integrated over\nray r is given as:\n\u02c6F(r) =\nK\nX\nk=1\n\u02c6T (tk) \u03b1 (\u03c3 (tk) \u03b4k) f (tk) .\n(2)\nAnd the feature field is optimized with the MSE loss Lf:\nLf =\nX\nr\u2208R(\u03a6)\n\r\r\r\u02c6F(r) \u2212 F(r)\n\r\r\r\n2\n2 ,\n(3)\nwhere R(\u03a6) is the set of rays from the feature map \u03a6 and\nF(r) is the ground-truth feature value of the ray r.\nThe feature field enables feature map rendering from any\nviewpoint efficiently, as aggregating features in the neural\nfield is typically faster than running the original SAM en-\ncoder. However, the feature maps produced by the SAN\nencoder has a relatively low resolution, which can cause\nsevere aliasing in the rendered feature maps. While this\ncan be alleviated by augmenting the input camera views and\nsample more rays during distillation, the rendered features\nstill deteriorate after distillation. The rendered SAN fea-\ntures usually fail to retain accurate high frequency spatial\ninformation along boundaries, which consequently leads to\njagged mask boundaries after decoding.\nNoting the complementary advantages and disadvan-\ntages of the caching method and the feature distillation\nmethod, we conducted experiments on both methods in the\nablation study.\n3.2. Mask Decoder\nThe Mask Decoder Dec takes as input the feature map from\nthe feature container and generates 2D masks based on the\ninput prompts (e.g., 2D or 3D points, texts). Figure 2 illus-\ntrates the architecture of the decoder, which is similar to the\nSAM decoder. The 2D mask decoding can be formulated as\nM = Dec(\u02c6\u03a6, prompts),\n(4)\nwhere \u02c6\u03a6 is the feature map. NeRF can estimate depth with\nEquation 5,\n\u02c6D(r) =\nK\nX\nk=1\n\u02c6T (tk) \u03b1 (\u03c3 (tk) \u03b4k) tk,\n(5)\nso 3D points can be easily obtained by projecting 2D\nprompts from users back to 3D with camera poses. Given\na 2D point (w, h), its depth d(p), the camera intrinsic ma-\ntrix K, and extrinsic matrix P, the corresponding 3D point\np = (x, y, z)T in the world space is\np = P\u22121K\u22121\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\nw \u00b7 d(p)\nh \u00b7 d(p)\nd(p)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\n(6)\nThe equation to project 3D points in world space to 2D pixel\ncoordinates in other camera views can be derived likewise.\nAttention Decoder\nPrompt Encoder\nPrompts\nFeature Map\n2D Mask\nFigure 2. Mask Decoder Architecture. The decoder consists\nof a prompt encoder and an attention decoder. First, the prompts\nare fed into the prompt encoder. The attention decoder takes the\nencoded prompts and the feature map from the Feature Container,\nand uses attention to produce 2D masks for the given view.\n3.3. Mask Aggregator\nThe decoder cannot produce correct 2D masks if the 3D\npoints after projection are not visible at certain viewpoints.\nFurthermore, despite good performance in most cases, the\npredicted masks may include artifacts. The innate seman-\ntic ambiguity of SAM predictions can also cause inconsis-\ntency across views. Hence, we aggregate these imperfect\n2D masks in the 3D space to generate high-quality and con-\nsistent 3D masks.\n3.3.1\nObject Field\nGiven the decoder output from different views, the ob-\nject field can fuse all 2D images and generate accurate 3D\nmasks. The mask is represented by a L-dimensional ob-\nject identity vector i. To represent the identity value, an\nadditional branch is introduced into the pre-trained NeRF\nmodel, parameterized as \u0398o. Different from the function of\nRGB color, which is view-dependent, object identity func-\ntion is defined by i = f(x; \u0398o), where the view direction\nvector is not included in the inputs due to the view invari-\nance of the object masks in 3D. The equation for mask ren-\ndering is similar to that of image rendering:\n\u02c6M(r) = Softmax\n K\nX\nk=1\n\u02c6T (tk) \u03b1 (\u03c3 (tk) \u03b4k) i (tk)\n!\n, (7)\nwhere \u03c3(tk) is inherited from the pre-trained NeRF model.\nVolume density \u03c3 which interprets the 3D geometry in\nNeRF makes the object field aware of the structural infor-\nmation. The object field is trained with the cross-entropy\nloss Lo:\nLo(R) = \u2212\n1\n|R|L\nX\nr\u2208R\nL\nX\nl=1\nml(r) log \u02c6ml(r),\n(8)\nwhere R is a set of rays, and ml(r) and \u02c6ml(r) are the l-\nth entry of the ground-truth mask M(r) and the predicted\nmask \u02c6M(r), respectively.\n4\n3.3.2\nRay-Pair RGB Loss\nSegmentation errors in both 3D and 2D are more likely to\noccur at object boundaries. One observation is that humans\nusually distinguish object boundaries by the color and tex-\nture difference on the two sides. Here we introduce the Ray-\nPair RGB loss, aiming to incorporate color and spatial in-\nformation to improve the segmentation quality.\nGiven a batch of rays R, we sample a subset of rays K\nfrom R as references. For each ray rk \u2208 K, we calculate the\nRGB similarity between rk and other rays r \u2208 R, denoted\nby g(c(r), c(rk)), where c(r) is the rendered RGB color\nalong r. Next, a subset Sk is selected from R \\ rk, where\nfor all rs \u2208 Sk, g(c(rs), c(rk)) \u2265 \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2208 R is a threshold.\nThe RGB loss is defined as\nLRGB(R) =\n1\n|K|\nX\nrk\u2208K\n1\n|Sk|\nX\nrs\u2208Sk\nf( \u02c6M(rk), \u02c6M(rs)),\n(9)\nwhere f is a distance function of two probability vectors.\nThis loss function encourages those rays with similar RGB\ncolors to have similar object identity predictions. \u02c6M(rk) is\ndetached from the compute graph, so gradients from LRGB\nonly flow through \u02c6M(rs). In our implementation, g, f are\ndefined as:\ng(c0, c1) = \u2225c0 \u2212 c1\u22252,\n(10)\nf(M0, M1) = exp\n\u0012\n\u2212w\nM0 \u00b7 M1\nmax(\u2225M0\u22252\n2, \u2225M1\u22252\n2) \u2212 \u03f5\n\u0013\n,\n(11)\nwhere w and \u03f5 are hyperparameters.\nSampling Strategy.\nAt the beginning, only Lo is used to\noptimize the object field. Concurrently, an error map Et is\nupdated to record the difference between the rendered mask\nand the ground-truth mask for each training view:\nEt(r) = f(M(r), \u02c6M(r)),\n(12)\nwhere f is the function in Eq. 11. In practice, the resolu-\ntion of error maps is smaller than that of training images\nto reduce memory usage and increase update efficiency, so\nEt(r) is approximated by f(M(r\u2032), \u02c6M(r\u2032)), where r\u2032 is the\nsample nearest to r in the low-resolution error map. After\nk iterations of training, we include the Ray-Pair RGB loss\nLRGB in training, which is only applied on local regions\nsampled according to the error maps. Specifically, a pixel p\nfrom a certain viewpoint with a large error is sampled and\nreprojected to different viewpoints in a set V, forming a set\nof pixels {pv | v \u2208 V} in different views. From each pv,\nwe cast a set of rays Rv,p in the local N \u00d7 N image patch\naround pv. The entire set of rays relevant to p, denoted by\nRp, is defined as:\nRp =\n[\nv\u2208V\nRv,p,\n(13)\non which we compute the LRGB for p. This allows us to\nenforce the loss to rays in different views that are relevant\nto the same high-error region.\nTo maintain the global segmentation results while refin-\ning local regions, we combine Ray-Pair RGB loss with the\nloss function in Eq. 8 and adopt mixed sampling: the cross\nentropy loss is applied to the rays sampled gloablly while\nthe RGB loss is only applied to certain local regions. The\nfinal loss function L is\nL = Lo(R) + 1\n|T |\nX\np\u2208T\nLRGB(Rp),\n(14)\nwhere R is a set of rays sampled randomly from all training\nviews, and T is a set of points sampled based on error maps.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Datasets\nWe evaluate our performance on data from multiple\ndatasets, mixed with synthetic and real-world scenes. We\ncompare the masks projected on 2D images with ground-\ntruth masks to evaluate our results quantitatively. For data\nwithout ground-truth, we manually annotate object masks.\nWe categorize the dataset used into the following 5 groups:\n\u2022 Mip-NeRF 360: a dataset widely used in NeRF research\nincluding synthetic and real-world examples. In our ex-\nperiments, we use the data in [3].\n\u2022 LERF: a set of scenes captured by [30], which contains\ncomplex real-world samples.\n\u2022 LLFF: first used in [40], the dataset contains scenes with\nonly front views. We use the masks released with [21].\n\u2022 3D-FRONT: a synthetic indoor scene dataset created\nin [20], further curated for NeRF training and scene un-\nderstanding in Instance-NeRF [38].\n\u2022 Others: the rest of our evaluation set is composed of the\ndata used in Panoptic Lifting [47] and Contrastive Lift [5].\nThe former uses scenes from existing datasets like Hyper-\nsim [46], Replica [49] and ScanNet [17], while the latter\ncreated a new dataset called Messy Rooms.\nFor each group above, we select scenes with representa-\ntive objects and segmentation outcomes that can be clearly\nidentified by humans. In total, 24 scenes are selected, each\ncontaining 1 to 3 object segmentation. For those without\nground-truth masks, we use SAM and CascadePSP [15]\nwith manual annotation to create ground-truth.\n4.2. Metrics\nWe evaluate the segmentation performance of SANeRF-HQ\nusing mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and Accuary\n(Acc). For each object, we render the object masks in sev-\neral novel test views, then combine the pixels in all test\nviews to calculate the per-object IoU and Acc. The over-\nall mIoU and Acc are averaged over all objects.\n5\n(a) RGB\n(b) GT\n(c) ISRF\n(d) SA3D\n(e) Ours\nFigure 3. Comparison with SA3D and ISRF on the Bonsai.

Quantitative Results on Different Datasets.\ning, we use the same point prompts to get the initial masks\nfor SA3D [10]. In addition, since SA3D requires a single-\nview mask as input, we manually select a view contain-\ning the major component of the target object, and pick the\nmask that best matches the ground-truth, instead of using\nthe predicted scores from SAM to select the initial mask.\nTo our best extent, we make sure that SA3D is provided\nwith good initialization. For ISRF [32], strokes are used\nas prompts, so we manually connect the point prompts to\ncreate strokes. Figure 3 and 4 demonstrate the qualitative\ncomparison. SA3D uses a self-prompting strategy and itera-\ntively inverse renders the 2D masks to a voxel grid, whereas\nour method uses a set of global prompts and collectively\noptimize the object field. Despite the use of IoU rejection,\nself-prompting may incorrectly include occluded regions in\nnovel views into prompts, which can accumulate errors, es-\npecially in initial iterations. ISRF lifts DINO features [9]\ninto a neural field, but its clustering and searching process\nproduces less accurate mask boundaries compared to SAM.\n7\nText: \u201cfossil\u201d\nText: \u201c table\u201d\nAuto-Seg\nFigure 6. Qualitative Results of text prompts and auto segmen-\ntation.\n4.4. More Qualitative Results\nFigure 6 illustrates the qualitative results of our methods on\nother segmentation tasks. Utilizing Grounding-DINO [37],\nour method is also capable of segmenting objects based on\ntext prompts. Additionally, our method can perform au-\ntomatic 3D segmentation, utilizing the video rendered by\nNeRF, the auto-segmentation function of SAM, and incor-\nporating [16] into the mask decoder. These results show\nthe potential of our method in readily extending to dynamic\nNeRF.\n4.5. Ablation Study\nMask Aggregator.\nBased on point prompts, we perform\nablation study on the mask aggregator, comparing the in-\ntermediate results from the feature container, i.e., directly\ndecoding the SAM features from the encoder or the feature\nfield, to the final outputs of the mask aggregator. The quan-\ntitative results are in Table 1.\nDirectly propagating point prompts between different\nviews and applying SAM cannot guarantee cross-view con-\nsistency. When prompts are sparse, some 3D point prompts\nmay be occluded at certain viewpoints, and no mask can be\nproduced. Even when a large number of prompts are pro-\nvided, SAM masks may still cover different objects across\nviews, and this naive approach fail to utilize masks from\nother views to collectively refine the results. The same issue\nalso exists in SAN [10], which distills SAM features with\nanother neural field and later decodes the rendered features\nusing the decoder. In addition to the consistency issue, the\nrendered feature maps from SAN further suffer from alias-\ning, and fine spatial semantics in the SAM features along\nobject boundaries can be lost during interpolation.\nThis\ncan lead to less accurate segmentation results on the object\nboundaries, like jagged mask edges. To ensure fairness in\ncomparison, we introduce enough point prompts to guaran-\ntee masks can be generated from every viewpoint where the\nGround Truth\nw/o LRGB\nw/ LRGB\nFigure 7.

Table 2 shows the quantita-\ntive results, where the Ray-Pair RGB loss slightly enhances\nthe mask quality. The visual improvement of the masks il-\nlustrated in Figure 7 is more significant. The loss helps fill\nthe missing interior and boundaries of the masks by enforc-\ning a local match between the similarity in labels, and the\nsimilarity in appearance.\nFor more ablation study, please refer to our supplemen-\ntary materials.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced the Segment Anything for\nNeRF in High Quality (SANeRF-HQ) framework. By com-\nbining the strengths of the Segment Anything Model (SAM)\nfor open-world object segmentation and NeRF for aggre-\ngating information from multiple viewpoints, SANeRF-HQ\nrepresents a significant advancement in high-quality 3D\nsegmentation. Our method was quantitatively and qualita-\ntively evaluated on various NeRF datasets, which demon-\nstrates SANeRF-HQ\u2019s advantages over previous state-of-\nthe-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential\nof extending our work to 4D dynamic NeRF object segmen-\ntation (see supplementary materials). SANeRF-HQ holds\npromise for contributing significantly to the evolving land-\nscape of 3D computer vision and segmentation techniques.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Benjamin Attal, Jia-Bin Huang, Christian Richardt, Michael\nZollhoefer, Johannes Kopf, Matthew O\u2019Toole, and Changil\nKim.\nHyperReel:\nHigh-fidelity 6-DoF video with ray-\nconditioned sampling.

Segment everything every-\nwhere all at once. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.06718, 2023.\n2\n11\nA. Implementation Details\nWe use torch-ngp [50] as our initial NeRF implementation.\nWhen we use 3D points as prompts in evaluation, the views\ncontaining less than k visible points get filtered out automat-\nically and will not be used to train the object field, where k\nis a hyperparameter, depending on the total number of input\npoints.\nFor both the SAM feature field and the object field, we\nuse a hash grid as in [42] with 16 levels and feature dimen-\nsion of 8 per level. The lowest and highest level are of reso-\nlution 16 and 219, respectively. We use a 5-layer 256-hidden\ndimensional MLP with skip connections and Layer Normal-\nization after the feature field hash grid, and a 3-layer 256\nhidden dimensional MLP with skip connections after the\nobject field hash grid. In addition to the features from their\nrespective hash grid, both MLPs also take the features from\nthe density field as input, where feature MLP also takes the\nviewing directions as input. The initial radiance and density\nfield, the SAM feature field, and the object field are trained\nfor 15,000, 5,000, and 600 iterations, respectively. All mod-\nels are trained on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.\nRay-Pair RGB loss is included after 300 iterations of\nwarm-up. We use error maps downsampled by 4 times com-\npared to original training images for Ray-Pair RGB loss\nsampling. In each iteration, we update the error maps us-\ning the training ray batch, and for every 200 iterations,\nwe perform a full update for all error map pixels. During\nsampling, we independently sample initial rays on each er-\nror map weighted by their errors, reproject them onto each\nview, and subsequently sample 32 additional rays in each\nN \u00d7 N patch centered at the reprojected pixels randomly.\nHere we choose N = 8 or 16. A subset of 20 rays are then\nsampled from each set as references in the Ray-Pair RGB\nloss.\nB. More Ablation Study\nSAM Backbones.\nWe perform ablation study on differ-\nent types of backbones for feature extracting and decoding,\nwhich are SAM and SAM-HQ [29].\nFeature Container Method.\nWe propose two methods to\nstore the pre-computed features in feature container Section\n3.1. The first one is to store the feature maps in a cache. The\nsecond one is to distill the features into a feature field and\nrender the feature map during inference. We investigate the\nperformance of these two methods on our evaluation set.\nTable C.3 demonstrates our the quantitative results on the\nablation study. SAM-HQ with a cache container performs\nthe best in most cases, while SAM-HQ with a distillation\ncontainer does not produce similar results as others on our\nevaluation set. Nevertheless, our method demonstrates ad-\nvantages over other 3D segmentation methods in general.\nNotice that we do not choose the best results from all of\nMetrics\nOurs\nInstance-NeRF\nAcc.\u2191\n98.7\n99.2\nmIoU.\u2191\n89.9\n92.8\nTable C.1.

Considering\nthat all the previous methods leverage SAM, we use SAM\nwith feature distillation as our feature container in compar-\nison.\nC. Comparison with Instance Segmentation\nMethods\nWe also compare our method with some instance segmenta-\ntion methods. The instance segmentation methods in NeRF\nmentioned in our related works do not require user prompts\nand can automatically generate segmentation of salient ob-\njects in NeRF. These methods also leverage 2D segmenta-\ntion methods for NeRF training but they mainly focus on the\nchallenge of 3D consistency. Despite their different config-\nurations and issues of concern, we still provide the com-\nparison with these automatic end-to-end pipelines, show-\ning that our prompt-based method can produce comparable\nresults to these state-of-the-art auto-segmentation methods.\nInstance-NeRF [38] is a training-based methods so we only\ncompare with it on 3D-FRONT dataset. Figure C.1 and Ta-\nble C.1 illustrates the visual results and quantitative compar-\nison respectively. For Panoptic Lifting [47] and Contrastive\nLift [5], we also compare on the scenes they mentioned in\nthe papers to ensure the fairness. Results are shown in Fig-\nure C.2 and Table C.2.\nWe use the objects in our evaluation sets as targets and\nchoose the object that has the largest IoU with the target\nobject as the predicted results of the instance segmentation\nmethods. Notice that we only compare with those methods\non the datasets mentioned in their papers, since they do not\nleverage SAM to achieve zero-shot generalization.\nD. Extending to Dynamic NeRFs\nWe present a preliminary demonstration in Figure D.1 on\nthe easy extension of our method to 4D dynamic NeRF rep-\nresentations. We use HyperReel [1] as our reference NeRF\nrepresentation and only supply user prompts for the first\nframe of each camera.

Given a series of prompts describing a scene at varying zoom levels, e.g., from a distant galaxy to the surface of an alien planet,\nour method uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate a continuously zooming video sequence.\nAbstract\nWe present a method that uses a text-to-image model to\ngenerate consistent content across multiple image scales,\nenabling extreme semantic zooms into a scene, e.g. rang-\ning from a wide-angle landscape view of a forest to a\nmacro shot of an insect sitting on one of the tree branches.\nWe achieve this through a joint multi-scale diffusion sam-\npling approach that encourages consistency across differ-\nent scales while preserving the integrity of each individual\nsampling process. Since each generated scale is guided by\na different text prompt, our method enables deeper levels\nof zoom than traditional super-resolution methods that may\nstruggle to create new contextual structure at vastly differ-\nent scales. We compare our method qualitatively with alter-\nnative techniques in image super-resolution and outpaint-\ning, and show that our method is most effective at generat-\ning consistent multi-scale content.\n1. Introduction\nRecent advances in text-to-image models [3, 6, 7, 15, 18,\n19, 29] have been transformative in enabling applications\nlike image generation from a single text prompt. But while\ndigital images exist at a fixed resolution, the real world can\nbe experienced at many different levels of scale. Few things\nexemplify this better than the classic 1977 short film \u201cPow-\ners of Ten\u201d, shown in Figure 2, which showcases the sheer\nmagnitudes of scale that exist in the universe by visualiz-\ning a continuous zoom from the outermost depths of the\ngalaxy to the cells inside our bodies1. Unfortunately, pro-\nducing animations or interactive experiences like these has\ntraditionally required trained artists and many hours of te-\ndious labor\u2014and although we might want to replace this\nprocess with a generative model, existing methods have not\nyet demonstrated the ability to generate consistent content\nacross multiple zoom levels.\nUnlike traditional super-resolution methods, which gen-\nerate higher-resolution content conditioned on the pixels\nof the original image, extreme zooms expose entirely new\n1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0\n1\narXiv:2312.02149v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023\nstructures, e.g., magnifying a hand to reveal its underly-\ning skin cells. Generating such a zoom requires seman-\ntic knowledge of human anatomy. In this paper, we focus\non solving this semantic zoom problem, i.e., enabling text-\nconditioned multi-scale image generation, to create Powers\nof Ten-like zoom videos. As input, our method expects a\nseries of text prompts that describe different scales of the\nscene, and produces as output a multi-scale image repre-\nsentation that can be explored interactively or rendered to a\nseamless zooming video. These text prompts can be user-\ndefined (allowing for creative control over the content at\ndifferent zoom levels) or crafted with the help of a large\nlanguage model (e.g., by querying the model with an image\ncaption and a prompt like \u201cdescribe what might you see if\nyou zoomed in by 2x\u201d).\nAt its core, our method relies on a joint sampling al-\ngorithm that uses a set of parallel diffusion sampling pro-\ncesses distributed across zoom levels. These sampling pro-\ncesses are coordinated to be consistent through an iterative\nfrequency-band consolidation process, in which interme-\ndiate image predictions are consistently combined across\nscales. Unlike existing approaches that accomplish similar\ngoals by repeatedly increasing the effective image resolu-\ntion (e.g., through super-resolution or image outpainting),\nour sampling process jointly optimizes for the content of\nall scales at once, allowing for both (1) plausible images at\neach scale and (2) consistent content across scales. Further-\nmore, existing methods are limited in their ability to explore\nwide ranges of scale, since they rely primarily on the input\nimage content to determine the added details at subsequent\nzoom levels. In many cases, image patches contain insuffi-\ncient contextual information to inform detail at deeper (e.g.,\n10x or 100x) zoom levels. On the other hand, our method\ngrounds each scale in a text prompt, allowing for new struc-\ntures and content to be conceived across extreme zoom lev-\nels. In our experiments, we compare our work qualitatively\nto these existing methods, and demonstrate that the zoom\nvideos that our method produces are notably more consis-\ntent. Finally, we showcase a number of ways in which our\nalgorithm can be used, e.g., by conditioning purely on text\nor grounding the generation in a known (real) image.\n2. Prior Work\nSuper-resolution and inpainting. Existing text-to-image\nbased super resolution models [1, 22] and outpainting mod-\nels [1, 16, 20, 27] can be adapted to the zoom task as\nautoregressive processes, i.e., by progressively outpaint-\ning a zoomed-in image, or progressively super-resolving a\nzoomed-out image. One significant drawback of these ap-\nproaches is that later-generated images have no influence\non the previously generated ones, which can often lead to\nsuboptimal results, as certain structures may be entirely in-\ncompatible with subsequent levels of detail, causing error\nFigure 2. Powers of Ten (1977) This documentary film illustrates\nthe relative scale of the universe as a single shot that gradually\nzooms out from a human to the universe, and then back again to\nthe microscopic molecular level.\naccumulation across recurrent network applications.\nPerpetual view generation. Starting from a single view\nRGB image, perpetual view generation methods like Infi-\nnite Nature [11] and InfiniteNature-Zero [12] learn to gen-\nerate unbounded flythrough videos of natural scenes. These\nmethods differ from our generative zoom in two key ways:\n(1) they translate the camera in 3D, causing a \u201cfly-through\u201d\neffect with perspective effects, rather than the \u201czoom in\u201d our\nmethod produces, and (2) they synthesize the fly-through\nstarting from a single image by progressivly inpainting un-\nknown parts of novel views, wheras we generate the en-\ntire zoom sequence simultaneously and coherently across\nscales, with text-guided semantic control.\nDiffusion joint sampling for consistent generation. Re-\ncent research [2, 10, 28, 30] leverages pretrained diffu-\nsion models to generate arbitrary-sized images or panora-\nmas from smaller pieces using joint diffusion processes.\nThese processes involve concurrently generating these mul-\ntiple images by merging their intermediate results within\nthe sampling process. In particular, DiffCollage [30] in-\ntroduces a factor graph formulation to express spatial con-\nstraints among these images, representing each image as a\nnode, and overlapping areas with additional nodes. Each\nsampling step involves aggregating individual predictions\nbased on the factor graph. For this to be possible, a given\ndiffusion model needs to be finetuned for different factor\nnodes. Other works such as MultiDiffusion [2] reconciles\ndifferent denoising steps by solving for a least squares opti-\nmal solution: i.e., averaging the diffusion model predictions\nat overlapping areas. However, none of these approaches\ncan be applied to our problem, where our jointly sampled\nimages have spatial correspondence at vastly different spa-\ntial scales.\n3. Preliminaries\nDiffusion models [5, 8, 23\u201326] generate images from ran-\ndom noise through a sequential sampling process.\nThis\nsampling process reverses a destructive process that grad-\nually adds Gaussian noise on a clean image x. The interme-\n2\ndiate noisy image at time step t is expressed as:\nzt = \u03b1tx + \u03c3t\u03f5t,\nwhere \u03f5t \u223c N(0, I) is a standard Gaussian noise, and \u03b1t\nand \u03c3t define a fixed noise schedule, with larger t corre-\nsponding to more noise. A diffusion model is a neural net-\nwork \u03f5\u03b8 that predicts the approximate clean image \u02c6x di-\nrectly, or equivalently the added noise \u03f5t in zt. The network\nis trained with the loss:\nL(\u03b8) = Et\u223cU[1,T ],\u03f5t\u223cN (0,I)[w(t)\u2225\u03f5\u03b8(zt; t, y) \u2212 \u03f5t\u22252\n2],\nwhere y is an additional conditioning signal like text [16,\n17, 21], and w(t) is a weighting function typically set to\n1 [8]. A standard choice for \u03f5\u03b8 is a U-Net with self-attention\nand cross-attention operations attending to the conditioning\ny.\nOnce the diffusion model is trained, various sampling\nmethods [8, 13, 24] are designed to sample efficiently from\nthe model, starting from pure noise zT \u223c N(0, I) and it-\neratively denoising it to a clean image.\nThese sampling\nmethods often rely on classifier-free guidance [8], a process\nwhich uses a linear combination of the text-conditional and\nunconditional predictions to achieve better adherence to the\nconditioning signal:\n\u02c6\u03f5t = (1 + \u03c9)\u03f5\u03b8(zt; t, y) \u2212 \u03c9\u03f5\u03b8(zt; t).\nThis revised \u02c6\u03f5t is used as the noise prediction to update\nthe noisy image zt.\nGiven a noisy image and a noise\nprediction, the estimated clean image \u02c6xt is computed as\n\u02c6xt = (zt \u2212 \u03c3t\u02c6\u03f5t)/\u03b1t. The iterative update function in the\nsampling process depends on the sampler used; in this paper\nwe use DDPM [8].\n4. Method\nLet y0, ..., yN\u22121 be a series of prompts describing a single\nscene at varying, corresponding zoom levels p0, ..., pN\u22121\nforming a geometric progression, i.e., pi = pi (we typically\nset p to 2 or 4). Our objective is to generate a sequence\nof corresponding H \u00d7 W \u00d7 C images x0, ..., xN\u22121 from\nan existing, pre-trained, text-to-image diffusion model. We\naim to generate the entire set of images jointly in a zoom-\nconsistent way. This means that the image xi at any specific\nzoom level pi, should be consistent with the center H/p \u00d7\nW/p crop of the zoomed-out image xi\u22121.\nWe propose a multi-scale joint sampling approach and a\ncorresponding zoom stack representation that gets updated\nin the diffusion-based sampling process. In Sec. 4.1, we in-\ntroduce our zoom stack representation and the process that\nallows us to render it into an image at any given zoom level.\nIn Sec. 4.2, we present an approach for consolidating mul-\ntiple diffusion estimates into this representation in a consis-\ntent way. Finally, in Sec. 4.3, we show how these compo-\nnents are used in the complete sampling process.\nZoomed out\nL0\nL1\nL2\nx0\nL0\nx1\nx2\nZoomed in\nL1\nL2\nFigure 3. Zoom stack. Our representation consists of N layer\nimages Li of constant resolution (left). These layers are arranged\nin a pyramid-like structure, with layers representing finer details\ncorresponding to a smaller spatial extent (middle). These layers\nare composited to form an image at any zoom level (right).\n4.1. Zoom Stack Representation\nOur zoom stack representation, which we denote by L =\n(L0, ..., LN\u22121), is designed to allow rendering images at\nany zoom level p0, ..., pN\u22121. The representation, illustrated\nin Fig. 3, contains N images of shape H \u00d7 W, one for each\nzoom level, where the ith image Li stores the pixels corre-\nsponding to the ith zoom level pi.\nImage rendering. The rendering operator, which we de-\nnote by \u03a0image(L; i), takes a zoom stack L and returns the\nimage at the ith zoom level pi = pi. We denote by Di(x)\nthe operator which downscales the image x by factor pi,\nand zero-pads the image back to size H \u00d7 W; and we de-\nnote by Mi the corresponding H \u00d7 W binary image which\nhas value 1 at the center H/pi \u00d7 W/pi patch and value 0 at\npadded pixels. The operator Di operates by prefiltering the\nimage with a truncated Gaussian kernel of size pi \u00d7 pi and\nresampling with a stride of pi. As described in Alg. 1, an\nimage xi at the ith zoom level is rendered by starting with\nLi, and iteratively replacing its central H/pj \u00d7 W/pj crop\nwith Dj\u2212i(Lj), for j = i + 1, ..., N \u2212 1. (In Alg. 1 we de-\nnote by \u2299 the elementwise multiplication of a binary mask\nM with an image.) This process guarantees that rendering\nat different zoom levels will be consistent at overlapping\ncentral regions.\nNoise rendering.\nAt every denoising iteration of\nDDPM [8], each pixel is corrupted by globally-scaled i.i.d.\nGaussian noise \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I).\nSince we would like im-\nages rendered at different zoom levels to be consistent, it\nis essential to make sure the added noise is also consis-\ntent, with overlapping region across different zoom levels\nsharing the same noise structure. Therefore, we use a ren-\ndering operator similar to \u03a0image which converts a set of\nindependent noise images, E = (E0, ..., EN\u22121) into a sin-\ngle zoom-consistent noise \u03f5i = \u03a0noise(E; i). However, be-\ncause downsampling involves prefiltering, which modifies\nthe statistics of the resulting noise, we upscale the jth down-\nscaled noise component by pj/pi to preserve the variance,\nensuring that the noise satisfies the standard Gaussian dis-\n3\nMulti-resolution \nBlending\nRender\nRender\nRender\nDDPM \nStep\nDDPM \nStep\nDDPM \nStep\nL2,t\nL1,t\nL0,t\nFigure 4.

We employ multi-resolution blending to fuse these\nregions into a consistent zoom stack Lt and re-render the different zoom levels from the consistent representation.

Multi-resolution blending\nEquipped with a method for rendering a zoom stack and\nsampling noise at any given zoom level, we now de-\nscribe a mechanism for integrating multiple observations\nof the same scene x0, ..., xN\u22121 at varying zoom levels\np0, ..., pN\u22121 into a consistent zoom stack L. This process\nis a necessary component of the consistent sampling pro-\ncess, as the diffusion model applied at various zoom lev-\nels will produce inconsistent content in the overlapping re-\ngions. Specifically, the jth zoom stack level Lj is used\nin rendering multiple images at all zoom levels i \u2264 j,\nand therefore its value should be consistent with multiple\nimage observations (or diffusion model samples), namely\n{xi : i \u2264 j}. The simplest possible solution to this is to\nna\u00a8\u0131vely average the overlapping regions across all obser-\nvations. This approach, however, results in blurry zoom\nstack images, since coarser-scale observations of overlap-\nping regions contain fewer pixels, and therefore only lower-\nfrequency information.\nTo solve this, we propose an approach we call multi-\nresolution blending, which uses Laplacian pyramids to se-\nlectively fuse the appropriate frequency bands of each ob-\nLaplacian \nReconstruction\nLaplacian \nDecomposition\nFigure 5.\nMulti-resolution blending.\nWe produce a consis-\ntent estimate for Layer Li in the zoom stack by merging the\nH/pj \u00d7 W/pj central region of the corresponding zoomed out\nimages xj for j \u2264 i. This merging process involves (1) creating a\nLaplacian pyramid from each observation, and blending together\nthe corresponding frequency bands to create a blended pyramid.\nThis blended pyramid is recomposed into an image, which is used\nto update the layer Li.\nservation level, which prevents aliasing as well as over-\nblurring. We show an outline of this process in Fig. 5. More\nconcretely, to update the ith layer in the zoom stack, we be-\ngin by cropping all samples j \u2265 i to match with the content\nof the ith level, and rescaling them back to H \u00d7W. We then\n4\nanalyze each of these N\u2212i\u22121 images into a Laplacian pyra-\nmid [4], and average across corresponding frequency bands\n(see Figure 5), resulting in an average Laplacian pyramid,\nwhich can be recomposed into an image and assigned to\nthe ith level of the zoom stack. This process is applied for\neach layer of the zoom stack Li, collecting from all further\nzoomed-out levels j \u2265 i.\n4.3. Multi-scale consistent sampling\nOur complete multi-scale joint sampling process is shown\nin Alg. 2. Fig. 4 illustrates a single sampling step t: Noisy\nimages zi,t in each zoom level along with the respective\nprompt yi are fed into the pretrained diffusion model in\nparallel to predict the noise \u02c6\u03f5i,t\u22121, and thus to compute\nthe estimated clean images \u02c6xi,t. Equipped with our multi-\nresolution blending technique, the clean images are consol-\nidated into a zoom stack, which is then rendered at all zoom\nlevels, yielding consistent images \u03a0image(Lt; i).

We show our gener-\nated photograph-based zoom sequences in Fig. 6.\n4.5. Implementation Details\nFor the underlying text-to-image diffusion model, we use\na version of Imagen [21] trained on internal data sources,\nwhich is a cascaded diffusion model consisting of (1) a\nbase model conditioned on a text prompt embedding and\n(2) a super resolution model additionally conditioned the\nlow resolution output from the base model. We use its de-\nfault DDPM sampling procedure with 256 sampling steps,\nand we employ our multi-scale joint sampling to the base\nmodel only. We use the super resolution model to upsample\neach generated image independently.\n5. Experiments\nIn Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, we demonstrate that our approach\nsuccessfully generates consistent high quality zoom se-\nquences for arbitrary relative zoom factors and a diverse set\nof scenes. Please see our supplementary materials for a full\ncollection of videos. Sec. 5.1 describes how we generate\ntext prompts, Sec. 5.2 demonstrates how our method out-\nperforms diffusion-based outpainting and super-resolution\nmodels, and Sec. 5.3 justifies our design decisions with an\nablation study.\n5.1. Text Prompt Generation\nWe generate a collection of text prompts that describe\nscenes at varying levels of scales using a combination of\nChatGPT [14] and manual editing. We start with prompting\nChatGPT with a description of a scene, and asking it to for-\nmulate the sequence of prompts we might need for different\nzoom levels. While the results from this query are often\nplausible, they often (1) do not accurately match the corre-\nsponding requested scales, or (2) do not match the distribu-\ntion of text prompts that the text-to-image model is able to\nmost effectively generate. As such, we manually refine the\nprompts. A comprehensive collection of the prompts used\nto generate results in the paper are provided in the supple-\nmental materials, along with the initial versions automati-\ncally produced by ChatGPT. In the future, we expect LLMs\n(and in particular, multimodal models) to automatically pro-\nduce a sequence of prompts well suited for this application.\nIn total, we collect a total of 10 examples, with the prompts\nsequence length varying form 6 to 16.\n5.2. Baseline Comparisons\nFig. 8 compares zoom sequences generated with our method\nand without (i.e., independently sampling each scale).\nWhen compared to our results, the independently-generated\nimages similarly follow the text prompt, but clearly do not\ncorrespond to a single consistent underlying scene.\nZoomed out\nZoomed in\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nFigure 8. Generated zoom sequences with independent sampling\n(top) and our multi-scale sampling (bottom). Our method encour-\nages different levels to depict a consistent underlying scene, while\nnot compromising the image quality.\nNext, we compare our method to two autogressive gener-\nation approaches for generating zoom sequences: (1) Stable\nDiffusion\u2019s [1] outpainting model and (2) Stable Diffusion\u2019s\n\u201cupscale\u201d super-resolution model. We show representative\nqualitative results in Fig. 9.\nComparison to progressive outpainting. The outpaint-\ning baseline starts with generating the most zoomed-in im-\nage and progressively generates coarser scales by downsam-\npling the previous generated image and outpainting the sur-\nrounding area. As in our method, the inpainting of each\nlevel is conditioned on the corresponding text prompt. In\nFig. 9, we show that because of the causality of the au-\ntoregressive process, the outpainting approach suffers from\ngradually accumulating errors, i.e., when a mistake is made\nat a given step, later outpainting iterations may struggle to\nproduce a consistent image.\nComparison to progressive super-resolution. The super-\nresolution baseline starts with the most zoomed-out image\nand generates subsequent scales by super-resolving the up-\nscaled central image region, conditioned on the correspond-\ning text prompt. The low resolution input provides strong\nstructural information which constrains the layout of the\nnext zoomed-in image. As we can see in Fig. 9, this super-\nresolution baseline is not able to synthesize new objects that\nwould only appear in the finer, zoomed-in scales.\n5.3. Ablations\nIn Fig. 10, we show qualitative comparisons to simpler ver-\nsions of our method to examine the effect of our design de-\ncisions.\nJoint vs. Iterative update.

Ablations. We evaluate other options for multi-scale\nconsistency: (1) iteratively updating each level separately, (2)\nna\u00a8\u0131ve multi-scale blending, (3) removing the shared noise.\nthrough the images in the zoom stack, and perform one sam-\npling step at each level independently. Unlike fully inde-\npendent sampling, this process does allow for sharing of in-\nformation between scales, since the steps are still applied to\nrenders from the zoom stack. We find that although this pro-\nduces more consistent results than independent sampling,\nthere remain inconsistencies at stack layer boundaries.\nShared vs. random noise Instead of using a shared noise\n\u03a0noise, noise can be sampled independently for each zoom\nlevel. We find that this leads to blur in the output samples.\nComparison with na\u00a8\u0131ve blending. Instead of our multi-\nscale blending, we can instead na\u00a8\u0131vely blend the observa-\ntions together, e.g., as in MultiDiffusion [2]. We find that\nthis leads to blurry outputs at deeper zoom levels.\n6. Discussion & Limitations\nA significant challenge in our work is discovering the ap-\npropriate set of text prompts that (1) agree with each other\nacross a set of fixed scales, and (2) can be effectively gener-\nated consistently by a given text-to-image model. One pos-\nsible avenue of improvement could be to, along with sam-\npling, optimize for suitable geometric transformations be-\ntween successive zoom levels. These transformations could\ninclude translation, rotation, and even scale, to find better\nalignment between the zoom levels and the prompts.\nAlternatively, one can optimize the text embeddings, to\nfind better descriptions that correspond to subsequent zoom\nlevels. Or, instead, use the LLM for in-the-loop generation,\ni.e., by giving LLM the generated image content, and asking\nit to refine its prompts to produce images which are closer\nin correspondence given the set of pre-defined scales.\n8\nAcknowledgements.\nWe thank Ben Poole, Jon Bar-\nron, Luyang Zhu, Ruiqi Gao, Tong He, Grace Luo,\nAngjoo Kanazawa, Vickie Ye, Songwei Ge, Keunhong\nPark, and David Salesin for helpful discussions and feed-\nback.\nReferences\n[1] Stability AI.\nStable-diffusion-2-inpainting.\nhttps:\n/ / huggingface . co / stabilityai / stable -\ndiffusion-2-inpainting. 2, 7\n[2] Omer Bar-Tal, Lior Yariv, Yaron Lipman, and Tali Dekel.\nMultidiffusion: Fusing diffusion paths for controlled image\ngeneration. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.08113, 2023. 2, 8\n[3] Tim Brooks, Aleksander Holynski, and Alexei A Efros.

Introduction\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) [31, 44, 46],\nsuch as the GPT series [4, 31, 34], has catalyzed a trans-\nformative era in natural language processing (NLP), estab-\nlishing new precedents for performance across a range of\nlinguistic tasks. One of the key driving forces behind this\ntremendous success is autoregressive pretraining, which\ntrains models to predict the most probable next tokens in\na sequence. This foundational strategy enables the models\nto internalize a complex interplay of syntax and semantics,\nwhich in turn translates to their extraordinary prowess to\nprocess language with human-like capabilities.\nBeyond NLP, autoregressive pretraining has also been a\nsignificant contributor in the field of computer vision. The\npioneering model in this context is PixelCNN [48], a deep\nautoregressive model designed to model the discrete proba-\n89\nModel Size\nTop-1 Accuracy on ImageNet\nBeiT-2\nD-iGPT\n(Ours)\nBeiT-3\nEVA\n87\n85\nOpenCLIP\nLarge\nHuge\ngiant+\nOne-Peace\niBOT\nBeiT\nMAE\nMaskFeat\nPeCo\nMAE\nData2Vec\nFigure 1.

Building upon this foundation,\nimage GPT (iGPT) [6] represents a significant advance-\nment, tilizing the flexible Transformer architecture [49] at\na notably larger computational scale. iGPT\u2019s achievements\nare remarkable: it not only learned state-of-the-art visual\nrepresentation for lower-resolution datasets such as CIFAR-\n10 but also demonstrated competitive performance on more\ncomplex datasets like ImageNet.\nDespite the initial successes of autoregressive pretrain-\ning in computer vision, recent trends have witnessed a\nrapid paradigm shift towards BERT-style pretraining [14].\nThis transition is significant, particularly when consider-\ning iGPT\u2019s initial findings of comparable performance be-\ntween autoregressive and BERT-style pretraining in various\ntasks. Subsequent research, however, has increasingly fa-\nvored BERT-style pretraining [2, 19] for its superior effi-\ncacy in visual representation learning. For example, MAE\n[19] demonstrates that simply predicting the values of ran-\ndomly masked pixels can effectively serve as a scalable so-\nlution for visual representation learning.\n1\narXiv:2312.02147v1  [cs.CV]  4 Dec 2023\nIn this paper, we revisit iGPT, challenging that autore-\ngressive pretraining is actually capable of building strong\nvision learners, especially at scale. Our methodology in-\ncorporates two critical modifications. First, acknowledg-\ning that images are inherently noisy and redundant, we fol-\nlow BEiT [2] to \u201ctokenize\u201d images into semantic tokens.\nThis adjustment reorients the autoregressive prediction fo-\ncus from pixels to semantic tokens, thereby enabling a more\nnuanced understanding of the interplay among different im-\nage regions. Second, we complement the generative de-\ncoder, which is responsible for autoregressively predicting\nthe next semantic token, with a discriminative decoder. This\nadditional component is tasked with predicting the semantic\ntokens of the visible pixels. Moreover, an intriguing obser-\nvation is that this pretraining pipeline works best when the\nsemantic visual tokens are derived from models trained dis-\ncriminatively, such as CLIP [35]. We term this enhanced\napproach as D-iGPT.\nExtensive experiments across various datasets and tasks\nconfirm the effectiveness of our proposed D-iGPT. With\nImageNet-1K as the sole pertaining dataset, our base-size\nmodel achieves an 86.2% top-1 classification accuracy,\nsurpassing previous state-of-the-art by 0.6%.\nAddition-\nally, with 36 million publicly available datasets, our large-\nsize model achieves an 89.5% top-1 classification accu-\nracy.\nWith much less training data and smaller model\nsize, D-iGPT performs similarly to previous state-of-the-\narts trained on public datasets. We also evaluate D-iGPT\non semantic segmentation and it outperforms MAE coun-\nterparts using the same pretraining and finetuning dataset.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Self-supervised Learning\nAccording to learning targets, self-supervised learning\nmethods can be broadly grouped into discriminative-based\nand generative-based.\nDiscriminative Self-supervised Learning. This paradigm\nfocuses on learning transferable representation by defining\na pre-task that scores the discriminative power of learned\nrepresentations.\nA notable strategy within this category\nis contrastive learning, which utilizes a contrastive loss to\nlearn representation similarity or dissimilarity between the\nsame images with different augmentation or entirely differ-\nent images. For instance, Wu et al. [55] introduces instance\ndiscrimination, constructing positive and negative query-\nkey pairs from the same or different images. SimCLR [7]\nfurther improves the performance with a projection head,\nstrong data augmentations, and large-batch-size training.\nMoCo [8, 18] incorporates memory bank and late weight\nupdates without the need for large batch sizes. CLIP [35]\nextends this concept by incorporating natural language su-\npervision through image-text pairings.\nGeneratieve Self-supervised Learning. In contrast to the\ndiscriminative approaches, generative self-supervised learn-\ning emphasizes training models to reconstruct the original\ninputs from corrupted versions. Masked image modeling,\ninspired by BERT [14] in NLP, is the dominant strategy in\nthis line of research.\nFor example, the pioneering work\nBEiT [2] pretrains models to recover the original visual\ntokens based on the corrupted image patches. Other sig-\nnificant methods include MAE [19], SimMIM [57], Mask-\nFeat [53], PeCo [15], MILAN [24], DeepMIM [37].\nThis study pivots towards a distinct facet of generative\nself-supervised learning, namely, autoregressive pretrain-\ning. In NLP, autoregressive pretraining is also highly re-\ngarded alongside BERT-style methods, especially effective\nin the era of LLMs [31, 46]. However, its progress in com-\nputer vision has not yet paralleled the heightened interest\nsparked by the initial success of iGPT [6]. This paper aims\nto bridge this gap. We demonstrate that, with simple yet es-\nsential modification, autoregressive pretraining exhibits ex-\ncellent capabilities in building strong vision models.\n2.2. ImageNet-1K Winning Solutions\nThe advancements in ImageNet-1K performance have seen\na significant boost, primarily driven by scaling datasets and\nmodel sizes. Liu et al. [29] exemplify this trend with the\nsuccessful training of SwinV2-G, a model equipped with\n3.0 billion parameters, using techniques like residual-post-\nnorm and scaled cosine attention. Similarly, Dehghani et\nal. [13] have shown the impressive capabilities of ViT-22B,\nhighlighting the feasibility of \u201cLLM-like\u201d scaling in com-\nputer vision.\nZhang et al. [60] investigate scaling both\nmodel and data, providing valuable insights into the in-\nterplay between scaling factors and performance. Another\nnoteworthy development is by Chen et al. [9] which discov-\ners deep neural network training algorithms through pro-\ngram search, leading to the creation of the effective and\nmemory-efficient optimizer Lion. However, a common lim-\nitation across these methods is their heavy reliance on pri-\nvate, in-house data, such as JFT-3B [60], which raises sig-\nnificant reproducibility concerns.\nIn contrast to the approaches above, there is a notable\ntrend of employing public datasets to train more powerful\nvision models. For instance, Wang et al. [52] scale BEiT-\n3 to 1.9 billion parameters using a combination of images,\ntexts, and image-text pairs, all sourced from public datasets.\nLikewise, Fang et al.[17] successfully scaled up EVA, a\nvanilla ViT with 1.0 billion parameters, using a total of 29.6\nmillion public images. One-Peace [51] presents a 4-billion-\nparameter model capable of unifying vision, audio, and lan-\nguage representations. Our D-iGPT model stands out in this\nlandscape by achieving superior performance to EVA with a\nsmaller model size and paralleling the performance of One-\nPeace with significantly smaller model and data sizes.\n2\nViT\nTokenizer\nD\nG\n1\n3\n2\nN\nPosition \nembedding\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\nAdd\n2\nV\nK\nV\nK\nV\nK\nV\nK\nQ\nQ\nFigure 2. The overview illustration of D-iGPT.\n3. Method\nWe hereby first revisit iGPT in Section 3.1.\nNext, we\npresent our enhanced version, D-iGPT, in Section 3.2,\nwhich shifts the prediction target from raw pixels to se-\nmantic tokens and additionally supplies supervision on vis-\nible tokens. Lastly, the specifics of our model\u2019s architec-\nture, along with implementation details, are elaborately dis-\ncussed in Section 3.3.\n3.1. Revisiting iGPT\nGPT. In NLP, the generative pretraining involves model-\ning the probability of the next word in a corpus U\n=\n{u1, ..., un} autoregressively. This can be written as:\np(u) =\nn\nY\ni=1\np(ui|u1, ..., ui\u22121, \u0398)\n(1)\nHere, GPT computes the likelihood of each word ui based\non the context of all preceding words from u1 to ui\u22121, aim-\ning to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the target\nwords:\nL = \u2212log p(u)\n(2)\nImage GPT. In the context of images, where the input is\nan image X \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7C, the challenge lies in converting\nthis 2D structure into a sequential format akin to a language\nsequence. iGPT [6] addresses this by na\u00a8\u0131vely vectorizing\nthe image X into a series of individual pixels {x1, ..., xn},\ntreating each pixel as analogous to a word. It then models\nthe probability of each subsequent pixel based on the pre-\nceding ones in the sequence:\np(x) =\nn\nY\ni=1\np(xi|x1, ..., xi\u22121, \u0398)\n(3)\nIn this formulation, iGPT aims to predict each pixel xi uti-\nlizing the information from preceding pixels {x1, ..., xi\u22121},\nminimizing the negative log-likelihood:\nL = \u2212log p(x)\n(4)\nNevertheless, the extensive computational demands of\niGPT, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of attention\nmechanisms relative to sequence length, limit its applicabil-\nity for various vision tasks. For iGPT, this sequence length\ncorresponds to the total number of pixels Seq = H \u00d7 W.\nAs such, iGPT is primarily suited for low-resolution images\n(e.g., Seq = 32 \u00d7 32).\nTo mitigate this computational challenge, especially for\nhigh-resolution image training, approaches like SAIM [33]\nand RandSac [26] have been developed. A critical advance-\nment in these methodologies is the incorporation of the\nVision Transformer (ViT) architecture [16], which signifi-\ncantly transforms the approach to tokenization \u2014 instead\nof treating each pixel as an individual token, ViT redefines\ntokens as image patches (e.g., clusters of pixels). This strat-\negy effectively reduces the sequence length for each im-\nage, thereby enabling the practical application of iGPT to\nhigher-resolution images.\n3.2. D-iGPT\nOur development of D-iGPT is built upon the iGPT with\nthe ViT architecture. Additionally, unlike iGPT completely\ndrops the knowledge of the 2D input structure, D-iGPT is\ndesigned to carefully encode this information.\nThis en-\ncoding is crucial for facilitating a more intricate interplay\nbetween different regions of an image, thereby enhanc-\ning the effectiveness of autoregressive modeling. Specif-\nically, at the input level, images are divided into multi-\nple equally-sized, non-overlapping patches, forming clus-\nters S = {s1, ..., sn}. Each cluster serves as a fundamental\nunit in the sequence for autoregressive modeling, e.g., each\ns in iGPT is a single pixel. Consequently, the autoregressive\nprobability, previously defined for individual pixels in iGPT\n3\n(as in Equation 3), is now reformulated for these clusters as:\np(s) =\nn\nY\ni=1\np(si|s1, ..., si\u22121, \u0398)\n(5)\nBy default, we configure the cluster size to 4, corresponding\nto a dimension of 112\u00d7112 for an input image of 224\u00d7224,\nas illustrated in Figure 2.\nBuilding upon this new setup, we next introduce two\nsimple yet essential modifications to enhance iGPT.\nModification I: semantic tokens. In contrast to the inher-\nently semantically-rich nature of text, raw pixels in images\ngenerally lack such depth of meaning. Addressing this se-\nmantic discrepancy is crucial for enhancing learning effi-\ncacy in models like iGPT. To bridge this gap, our approach,\ninspired by BEiT [2], involves transitioning the autoregres-\nsive target of D-iGPT from raw pixels to semantic tokens,\nwhich can be written as:\nLG = \u2212\nn\nX\ni=1\ncosine(G(f(xs1:si\u22121); \u03b8G), f\u03d5(x)si),\n(6)\nwhere f(\u00b7) is the encoder, f\u03d5(x)si is the semantically en-\nriched tokens corresponding to the cluster si, and G(\u00b7; \u03b8G)\nis the generative decoder for autoregressive prediction. Fur-\nthermore, to break the dependency on a fixed sequence or-\nder and enhance learning flexibility, we adopt strategies\nfrom [25, 58] by randomly permuting the sequence of clus-\nters {s1, ...sn} and selecting a permutation \u03c0.\nMofication II: supervision on visible clusters. To further\nenhance the training of our model, we introduce additional\nsupervision targeting visible clusters. This is formulated as:\nLD = \u2212\nn\nX\ni=1\ncosine(D(f(xs1:si\u22121); \u03b8D), f\u03d5(x)s1:si\u22121)\n(7)\nwhere D(\u00b7; \u03b8D) is the discriminative decoder, tasked with\npredicting the semantic tokens of visible pixels.\nThis approach, as encapsulated in Equation (7), can be\nconceptualized as a form of knowledge distillation. The\nobjective is to enable the encoder of D-iGPT (the student\nmodel) to distill knowledge from the model f\u03d5(x) (the\nteacher model), which provides semantic tokens, based on\nthe visible sequence of clusters {s1, ..., si\u22121}. However,\nour methodology differs from traditional knowledge distil-\nlation frameworks [23, 54], which typically align logits or\nfeature maps between teacher and student models directly.\nInstead, we incorporate a discriminative decoder D(\u00b7; \u03b8D)\nto disentangle this knowledge distillation supervision from\nthe original autoregressive supervision (carried out via the\ngenerative decoder G(\u00b7;\n\u03b8G)). This design is crucial for\nensuring the acquisition of high-quality representations, as\ndemonstrated in the subsequent experimental section.\nSummary. The integration of these two modifications sig-\nnificantly enhances the capabilities of iGPT for visual rep-\nresentation learning. While there are various options for\nthe model f\u03d5(x) to generate semantic tokens, our empirical\nfindings, as detailed next, indicate a marked preference for\ndiscriminatively trained models like CLIP [35].\nMoreover, from an implementation perspective, we\nadopt the attention mask strategy as employed in [6, 26, 31,\n34]. This approach facilitates efficient computation of input\nsequences of varying lengths (e.g., a set of input sequences\nsuch as\nn\n{s1}, {s1, s2}, ..., {s1, s2, ..., sn\u22121}\no\n) within a\nsingle iteration. We direct interested readers to the supple-\nmentary materials for more details.\n3.3. Architecture\nThe D-iGPT architecture is composed of two primary com-\nponents: the encoder and the decoder. For the encoder, it\nleverages the standard ViT architecture. For the decoders,\nwe incorporate several Transformer decoder blocks. Note\nthat D-iGPT utilizes two distinct types of decoders: the dis-\ncriminative decoder D for discriminative training, and the\ngenerative decoder G for generative pretraining. Although\nthese decoders share an identical architectural framework,\nthey are characterized by different sets of parameters. As\nshown in Figure 2, they take the randomly initialized [Dis]\ntokens D or [Gen] tokens G with position information as\nthe query, and the output features from the encoder as the\nkey and the value:\n\u02c6Dl+1 = Atten(Dl, hL, hL),\nDl+1 = MLP( \u02c6Dl+1),\n\u02c6Gl+1 = Atten(Gl, hL, hL),\nGl+1 = MLP( \u02c6Dl+1),\n(8)\nwhere Atten(q, k, v) represents the cross-attention mecha-\nnism with Query (q), Key (k), and Value (v), and hL denotes\nthe output features from the encoder. Notably, in down-\nstream tasks, we utilize only the encoder, discarding the de-\ncoder component.\n4. Experiment\nImplementation details. In our experiments, we use CLIP\nfor providing semantic tokens.\nWe pretrain, by default,\nall models on ImageNet-1K for 300 epochs. We set the\nbatch size to 4096 and the peak learning rate to lr =\n1.5e\u22124 \u00d7 batchsize/256. We adopt a cosine learning rate\ndecay schedule with a warm-up period of 40 epochs, and\nutilize the AdamW [30] optimizer with a weight decay of\n0.05. We use random resized cropping and random hori-\nzontal flipping, with the input size set to 224 \u00d7 224.\nWhen extending pretraining to ImageNet-21K, all mod-\nels undergo 150 epochs of pretraining with a warm-up pe-\n4\nMethod\nPretraining Epochs\nTokenizer/Teacher\nClassification ( top-1 %)\nSegmentation (mIoU)\nBase-size models (ViT-B)\nDeiT [45]\n300\nLabel\n81.2\n47.2\nSdAE [10]\n300\nEMA\n84.1\n48.6\nPeCo [15]\n300\nVQGAN\n84.1\n46.7\nTinyMIM [38]\n300\nMAE\n85.0\n52.2\nFD [54]\n300\nCLIP\n84.8\n-\nBEiTv2 [32]\n300\nCLIP+VQGAN\n85.0\n52.7\nBEiT [2]\n800\nDALLE\n84.0\nMAE [19]\n1600\nPixel\n83.6\n48.1\nRandsac [26]\n1600\nPixel\n83.7\nPeCo [15]\n800\nVQGAN\n84.5\n48.5\ndata2vec [1]\n800\nEMA\n84.2\n-\nSIM [43]\n1600\nEMA\n83.8\n-\niBOT [62]\n1600\nEMA\n84.0\n-\nMaskFeat [53]\n1600\nHOG\n84.0\n-\nBEiTv2 [32]\n1600\nCLIP+VQGAN\n85.5\n53.1\nDeepMIM [37]\n1600\nCLIP\n85.6\n53.1\nMILAN [24]\n1600\nCLIP\n85.6\n-\nEVA [17]\n800\nCLIP\n85.5\n53.3\nD-iGPT (Ours)\n300\nCLIP\n86.2\n53.8\nLarge-size models (ViT-L)\nBEiTv2 [32]\n300\nCLIP+VQGAN\n86.6\n55.0\nBEiT [2]\n800\nDALLE\n85.2\nMAE [19]\n1600\nPixel\n85.9\n53.6\nPeCo [15]\n800\nVQGAN\n86.5\n-\niBOT [62]\n1600\nEMA\n84.8\n-\nMaskFeat [53]\n1600\nHOG\n85.7\n-\nBEiTv2 [32]\n1600\nCLIP+VQGAN\n87.3\n56.7\nMILAN [24]\n1600\nCLIP\n86.8\u2020\n-\nD-iGPT (Ours)\n300\nCLIP\n87.8\n57.3\nTable 1.

ImageNet-1K Pretraining\nFor a fair comparison with previous work [1, 2, 15, 19, 32,\n37, 38, 53], we first study pretraining on ImageNet-1K [39]\ndataset with ViT-B/16 and ViT-L.\n4.1.1\nImageNet Classification\nFollowing [19, 38], we finetune pretrained models using the\nImageNet-1K training dataset, and test it on the ImageNet-\n1K validation dataset with the input size of 224 \u00d7 224.\nNote that different from previous approaches such as\n[59, 60], which employs multi-head attention pooling, and\nBEiT-3 [52], which exploits an additional pretrained giant\nlanguage tower as the image classification task layer, we\nhereby opt for a simple linear layer for classification. We\nfinetune the pretrained model for 100 epochs.\nResults. As shown in Table 1, our ViT-B impressively\nachieves 86.2% top-1 accuracy. This is the first instance\nof a ViT-B model surpassing the 86% accuracy threshold\non ImageNet-1K, using an input size of 224 \u00d7 224.\nIn terms of comparative performance, D-iGPT demon-\nstrates a significant improvement over various existing\nmethods. It exceeds the baseline supervised model, DeiT,\nby a substantial margin of +5.0%, the prevalent mask im-\nage modeling method, MAE, by +2.6%, and the prior art\nMILAN/DeepMIM by +0.6%. Furthermore, with the same\nteacher model, D-iGPT surpasses EVA by +0.7%, while re-\nquiring only 37.5% of the training epochs.\nWhen enlarging the model size to ViT-L size, our D-\niGPT sets a new benchmark with an accuracy of 87.8%.\n5\nMethod\nImageNet \u2191\nIN-V2 \u2191\nIN-Real \u2191\nIN-Adversarial\u2191\nIN-Rendition\u2191\nIN-Corruption \u2193\nIN-Sketch\u2191\nBase-size models (ViT-B)\nDeiT [45]\n81.2\n70.6\n86.7\n27.9\n45.4\n36.8\n32.3\nTinyMIM [38]\n85.0\n75.3\n88.7\n43.0\n54.6\n32.7\n41.0\nMAE [19]\n83.6\n72.9\n88.1\n33.6\n50.0\n37.8\n36.4\nBEiT [2]\n83.2\n71.8\n87.9\n32.8\n49.6\n38.7\n35.1\niBOT [62]\n84.0\n73.0\n88.2\n33.0\n51.2\n36.9\n38.7\nBEiTv2 [32]\n85.5\n76.2\n89.2\n54.0\n61.7\n30.9\n45.9\nD-iGPT (Ours)\n86.2\n76.4\n89.6\n56.3\n64.3\n29.9\n48.5\nLarge-size models (ViT-L)\nMAE [19]\n85.9\n76.5\n89.4\n56.3\n61.0\n31.1\n45.6\nBEiT [2]\n85.2\n75.1\n88.8\n55.4\n59.8\n32.0\n43.8\niBOT [62]\n84.8\n74.4\n87.9\n53.9\n57.1\n34.1\n42.6\nBEiTv2 [32]\n87.3\n78.3\n90.0\n68.6\n70.3\n25.4\n53.7\nD-iGPT (Ours)\n87.8\n79.6\n90.4\n73.0\n80.5\n24.7\n60.3\nTable 2. Robustness and Generalization evaluation on out-of-domain datasets.\nNotably, this result surpasses the well-known mask image\nmodeling MAE by +1.9% and prior art BEiT-v2 by +0.5%.\n4.1.2\nSemantic Segmentation\nFor semantic segmentation, we evaluate D-iGPT using the\nADE20K dataset [61], which comprises 150 categories with\n20,000 training images and 2,000 validation images. Fol-\nlowing MAE [19], we adopt our D-iGPT pretrained ViT\nmodel as the backbone and UperNet [56] as the framework.\nThe input image resolution is 512 \u00d7 512 for training and\nevaluation; we report mIoU as the evaluation metric.\nTable 1 reports the impressive performance of D-iGPT\non ADE20K. For the ViT-B model, D-iGPT achieves a\nmIOU of 53.8, and for ViT-L, it reaches a mIOU of 57.3.\nThese results set new benchmarks for their respective model\nsizes. For example, D-iGPT outperforms the closest com-\npeting solutions by margins of 0.5 in ViT-B and 0.6 in ViT-\nL. Such performance highlights the strong generalization\ncapabilities of D-iGPT on downstream tasks.\n4.1.3\nRobustness\nWe next assess model robustness on various out-of-\ndomain ImageNet datasets, including natural adversarial\nexamples (ImageNet-A [22]), semantic shifts (ImageNet-\nR [21]), common image corruptions (ImageNet-C [20]),\nimage sketches (ImageNet-S [50]), ImageNet-V2 [36], and\nImageNet-Real [3].\nAs indicated in Table 2, D-iGPT consistently outper-\nforms both supervised models like DeiT and self-supervised\nmodels like MAE across all datasets, showcasing notable\nimprovements in robustness and generalization. For exam-\nple, compared with the prior art BEiT-v2, D-iGPT exhibits\nsuperior robustness with improvements ranging from 0.2%\nto 2.6% in the ViT-B model size category. These improve-\nments are even more striking with the ViT-L model, i.e.,\nD-iGPT makes significant strides in challenging datasets\nlike IN-Adversarial (improvement of +4.4%), IN-Sketch\n(+6.6%), and IN-Rendition (+10.2%).\n4.2. Pretraining with Larger Datasets\nWe hereby explore the impact of pretraining on two exten-\nsive datasets: 1) ImageNet-21K with 14 million samples,\nand 2) \u223c36 million publicly available images, as employed\nin [17]. Following [2, 17], we initially undertake super-\nvised fine-tuning on the ImageNet-21K training dataset for\n60 epochs; subsequently, we finetune the D-iGPT model on\nthe ImageNet-1K training dataset.\nMain Results. The scaling results of D-iGPT, as depicted\nin Table 3, are particularly noteworthy. When pretrained\nwith ImageNet-21k, the D-iGPT enhanced ViT-L model\nachieves a Top-1 accuracy of 89.5%.\nThis performance\nnot only parallels other baselines such as BEiT-3 and EVA\nbut also is attained with a considerably smaller model and\ntraining data size. Notably, our D-iGPT is comparable to\nthose achieved by substantially larger models that have been\ntrained with extensive private datasets [9, 12, 28]. These re-\nsults demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of D-iGPT for\nvisual representation learning.\n4.3. Zero-shot Classification\nWe finetune our D-iGPT on the vision-language dataset for\nzero-shot ImageNet classification. With such fine-tuning,\nour D-iGPT can be applied to a wide array of vision classifi-\ncation tasks directly with class names, without the need for\ntask-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, the finetuned fea-\nture can be utilized in both uni-modal and multi-modal ap-\nplications, including AI generation, akin to the capabilities\ndemonstrated by CLIP features [35].\n6\nMethod\nModel\nModel Size\nPretraining Data\nPretraining Data\nImageNet-1K\nCategory\nSize\ntop-1 (%)\nTokenLearner [40]\nTokenLearner\n460M\nI\n300M (Private)\n88.9\nMaxViT [47]\nMaxViT\n475M\nI\n300M (Private)\n89.5\nSwinV2 [29]\nSwinV2\n3B\nI\n84M (Private)\n90.2\nCoAtNet-7 [12]\nCoAtNet\n2.44B\nI\n300M (Private)\n90.9\nLion [9]\nViT\n2.44B\nI\n3B (Private)\n91.1\nBEiT [2]\nViT\n306M\nI\n14M\n88.6\niBOT [62]\nViT\n306M\nI\n14M\n87.8\nOpenClip-H [11]\nViT\n632M\nI-T\n2B\n88.5\nBeiT-3 [52]\nViT\n1B\nI-T,I,T\n21M,14M,160GB\n89.6\nEVA [17]\nViT\n1B\nI\n30M\n89.7\nOne-Peace [51]\nTransformer\n4B\nI-T,A-T\n2B,8k hours\n89.8\nD-iGPT-L (ours)\nViT\n306M\nI\n14M\n89.5\nTable 3.

For example, compared to CLIPA [27] and OpenClip,\nD-iGPT improves the zero-shot ImageNet classification ac-\ncuracy by 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively.\n4.4. Ablation Study\nSemantic tokens. Our study begins with an examination\nof various semantic token sources.\nBeyond our chosen\nCLIP tokens and iGPT\u2019s pixel-based tokens, we also con-\nsider alternatives like DINO features [5, 53] and VQVAE\ntokens [32]. The results, shown in Table 5, reveal notable\ndifferences in performance. While autoregressive pretrain-\ning using low-level pixels or VQVAE tokens shows lesser\nefficacy compared to MAE, the application of tokens from\ndiscriminatively trained models significantly enhances D-\niGPT\u2019s performance, surpassing MAE by a notable margin.\nGiven the superior performance achieved with CLIP fea-\ntures, we next delve deeper into the effects of utilizing to-\nkens from different CLIP variants. As detailed in Table 6,\nwhen we use a larger tokenizer (CLIP-L), D-iGPT achieves\nbetter performance compared to using the smaller tokenizer\n(CLIP-B). However, if we employ CLIP-L@336 as the to-\nMethod\nTokenizer\nImageNet-1K\nADE20K\ntop-1 Acc.\nmIoU\nMAE [19]\nPixel\n82.6\n47.1\niGPT\u2020 [6]\nPixel\n82.0\n44.1\nMAE [19]\nVQVAE\n82.2\n46.8\nD-iGPT\nVQVAE\n82.3\n47.0\nMAE [19]\nDINO\n84.0\n50.1\nD-iGPT\nDINO\n84.7\n51.0\nMAE [19]\nCLIP\n84.6\n52.1\nD-iGPT\nCLIP\n86.2\n53.8\nTable 5.

Using\nOpenCLIP-L as the tokenizer, which is similar to CLIP\nin approach but varies in training data, results in compa-\nrable performance to employing CLIP-L. An even larger\ntokenizer, OpenCLIP-H, further enhances D-iGPT\u2019s per-\nformance. Conversely, tokenizers like DINO do not yield\nas favorable results. This suggests that larger pretraining\ndatasets and the inclusion of textual information are likely\nbeneficial in generating high-quality semantic tokens for\nguiding D-iGPT\u2019s learning process.\nPretraining paradigm In our evaluation of various pre-\ntraining paradigms, we include Mask Image Modeling\n(MIM), Knowledge Distillation (KD), and our D-iGPT.

The results are presented in Table 7.\nThe baseline pretraining methods, such as MAE, EVA,\nand KD, exhibit comparable performance levels in both Im-\nageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation\ntasks. However, our D-iGPT model achieves markedly bet-\nter results.\nFor instance, while the highest performance\namong baseline models on ImageNet is 85.0% accuracy and\non ADE20K is 52.6 mIOU, D-iGPT significantly elevates\nthese benchmarks to 86.2% accuracy on ImageNet and 53.8\nmIOU on ADE20K. These findings underscore the poten-\ntial of autoregressive pretraining, implemented in D-iGPT,\nas a more scalable and effective paradigm for visual repre-\nsentation learning.\u201d\nDecoder Design Our investigation begins with an exami-\nnation of Decoder Depth. In this context, we compare our\nD-iGPT\u2019s performance using a lightweight decoder against\nthe 8-layer decoder found in the MAE model. Intriguingly,\nthis simpler decoder architecture not only significantly re-\nduces GPU computational load but also enhances overall\nperformance. As shown in Table 8, a 2-layer decoder out-\nperforms a 4-layer decoder, even when maintaining the\nsame decoder dimension of 1024.\nBuilding on the success of the 2-layer decoder, we\nnext turn our attention to the Decoder Dimension (Dim).\nThrough our experiments, we note that a reduction in de-\ncoder dimension results in a slight decrease in model per-\nformance.

In the D-iGPT architecture, we\nincorporate a discriminative decoder, specifically designed\nto separate the discriminative pretraining from the genera-\ntive pretraining processes. To evaluate its effectiveness, we\nconducted an ablation study where we removed the discrim-\ninative pretraining and instead implemented feature distilla-\ntion [54] directly on the output feature map of the encoder.\nThe results of this study, as depicted in Table 9, reveal a\nnotable insight. Applying feature distillation directly to the\nencoder\u2019s features leads to a decrease of 1.1% in accuracy.\nThis outcome underscores the critical role of the discrimi-\nnative decoder in maintaining the efficacy and clarity of the\npretraining process in our D-iGPT model.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we introduce D-iGPT, a novel adaptation of\nthe iGPT model that transitions the focus of prediction from\nraw pixels to semantic tokens and supplements the supervi-\nsion of visual pixels. This significant modification has led to\na groundbreaking achievement: D-iGPT attains an impres-\nsive 89.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, a feat\naccomplished using solely publicly available datasets. We\nhope our D-iGPT can inspire more research on rethinking\nautoregressive pretraining for visual representation learning\nand bring fresh perspectives on building vision foundation\nmodels on publicly available data sources.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work is partially supported by TPU Research Cloud\n(TRC) program and Google Cloud Research Credits pro-\ngram.\n8\nReferences\n[1] Alexei Baevski, Wei-Ning Hsu, Qiantong Xu, Arun Babu, Ji-\natao Gu, and Michael Auli.

To tackle the first challenge,\nwe propose a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) train-\ning scheme that alternates between foreground region edit-\ning and full-image editing, aimed at foreground-only ma-\nnipulation while preserving the background. For the sec-\nond challenge, we also design a class-guided regularization\nthat exploits class priors within the generation model to al-\nleviate the inconsistency problem among different views in\nimage-driven editing. Extensive experiments show that our\nCustomNeRF produces precise editing results under vari-\nous real scenes for both text- and image-driven settings.\n1. Introduction\nCharacterized by the ease of optimization and contin-\nuous representation, neural fields (e.g., NeRF [23] and\nNeuS [44]) have garnered extensive attention, further in-\nspiring numerous studies in the field of 3D scene edit-\ning, such as retexturing [34, 46], stylization [51], or de-\nformation [7, 48] of 3D objects or scenes.\nIn order to\nenhance the flexibility and accessibility of editing, recent\nworks [8, 40, 52, 53] have proposed text-driven 3D scene\nediting, utilizing textual prompts to enable editing with\nmore freedom. These methods take advantage of the pow-\nerful capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models [4, 35]\nto provide visual information conformed with the textual\nprompts, thereby achieving semantic-aware editing.\nHowever, these text-driven methods are only able to\nachieve general editing to the original 3D scene, leading\nto a wide range of possible editing outcomes. To meet more\ncustomized requirements of users, a reference image could\nbe introduced to depict the desired outcome precisely, in-\nspiring a more challenging but under-explored task of spe-\ncific editing. In Figure 1, the textual prompt \u201ca dog stand-\ning in the forest\u201d is an example of general editing, which\nreplaces the bear statue with an arbitrary dog. By further\nrestricting the visual characteristics of the dog with a ref-\nerence image such as a black dog, one can realize specific\nediting to replace the bear statue with the desired one.\nIn this paper, we present a unified framework named\nCustomNeRF to support adaptive source driven 3D\nscene editing, where a subject-aware Text-to-Image (T2I)\nmodel [16] is employed to embed the specific visual subject\nV \u2217 contained in the reference image into a hybrid prompt,\nmeeting both general and specific editing requirements as\nillustrated in Figure 1. The key to obtaining desired editing\nresults lies in the precise identification of the foreground re-\ngions, thereby facilitating view-consistent foreground edit-\ning while maintaining the background. This poses two sig-\nnificant challenges: Firstly, since NeRF is an implicit repre-\nsentation of 3D scenes, editing NeRF directly is difficult in\nterms of accurately locating and manipulating only the fore-\nground regions, which necessitates a well-designed train-\ning scheme. Additionally, the lack of accurate inter-view\ncalibration data during training may lead to inconsistency\namong views, i.e., the Janus problem. This problem wors-\nens in the image-driven setting, as the diffusion model fine-\ntuned tends to overfit the input viewpoint of the reference\nimages as encountered in [30].\nTo tackle the first challenge, we propose a Local-Global\nIterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme that alternates be-\ntween foreground region editing and full-image editing.\nConcretely, a foreground-aware NeRF is designed to esti-\nmate the editing probability in addition to color and density\nto distinguish between foreground and background regions,\nenabling the separate rendering of the foreground region. In\nthe local stage, we feed the foreground-only rendered im-\nages and corresponding editing prompt into the T2I model,\nso that the parameters of NeRF are optimized to only edit\nthe foreground region. In the global stage, the T2I model\ntakes the fully rendered images and editing prompt as input\nto optimize NeRF, leveraging useful clues about sizes, po-\nsitions, and postures contained in the background region to\nprevent layout drifting from the original scene. Through the\nlocal-global alternating, we can simultaneously constrain\nthe foreground layout and maintain the background content.\nFor the second challenge, we design a class-guided reg-\nularization that only uses class words to denote the subject\nof the reference image to form a textual prompt during the\nlocal editing stage. By this means, the general class pri-\nors within the T2I model can be exploited to promote geo-\nmetrically consistent editing of the novel subject. Together\nwith the specific subject appearance learned by the hybrid\nprompt in the global editing stage, we can gradually trans-\nfer the subject\u2019s visual characteristics to different views for\nproducing view-consistent editing results.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We\npresent a unified framework CustomNeRF to support adap-\ntive source driven 3D scene editing, achieving accurate edit-\ning in both text-driven and image-driven settings. (2) A\nLocal-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme is\nproposed to accurately edit foreground regions while main-\ntaining background content. (3) We design a class-guided\nregularization to exploit class priors within the T2I model\nfor alleviating the Janus problem in image-driven editing.\n2. Related Works\n2.1. Text-to-Image Generation and Editing\nText-to-image generation [3, 5, 13, 31\u201333, 35, 37], which\naims to generate high-quality images according to given\ntext prompts, has gained considerable attention recently.\nAmong these methods, diffusion model based methods,\nsuch as Stable Diffusion [35] and DALL\u00b7E 2 [32], have\nshown remarkable image generation ability as a result of\n2\ntraining on massive text-image datasets. Utilizing the rich\ncross-modal semantic knowledge inherent in pre-trained\ntext-to-image generation models, several works [1, 4, 9, 20]\nhave employed them in text-guided image editing, which\naims to modify given images based on text descriptions.\nHowever, these methods are limited to editing styles or con-\ntents of images but fail to perform well when faced with\nmore complex modifications, e.g., layout adjustments, sub-\nject posture transformations, etc.\nTo preserve subject identity between the generated and\noriginal images while achieving more intricate control\nover the appearance and posture of these subjects, some\nworks [6, 16, 36] have explored the task of subject-aware\ntext-to-image generation. In these methods, a small set of\nimages that feature the same subjects are provided for ref-\nerence and the generation is guided by both text descrip-\ntions and the reference images. DreamBooth [36] and TI [6]\nadopt a similar roadway by building upon the pretrained\nStable Diffusion model and finetuning it using reference\nimages to map the subject into a unique identifier. During\nthe testing phase, the learned identifier is injected into the\ntext descriptions for personalized text-to-image generation.\nCustom Diffusion [16] realizes faster tuning speed with ef-\nficient parameter optimization, and further explores multi-\nple subject combinations through closed-form constrained\noptimization, thereby extending the capabilities of subject-\naware text-to-image generation. In our work, we employ\nthis method for reference image embedding, thus unifying\ntext-driven and image-driven editing settings.\n2.2. Text-to-3D Generation\nWith the significant progress made in text-to-image gen-\neration, there has been an increasing exploration of text-\nto-3D generation where pretrained visual-language mod-\nels [38, 42] (e.g., CLIP [29]) or text-conditioned diffusion\nmodels [28, 30, 43, 47] (e.g., Stable Diffusion [35]) are\nleveraged to generate realistic 3D objects or scenes from\ntextual descriptions. DreamField [12] utilizes aligned im-\nage and text embeddings generated by CLIP to optimize\nthe neural field. DreamFusion [28] proposes a Score Dis-\ntillation Sampling (SDS) loss to use a pre-trained 2D diffu-\nsion model as a prior for optimization of neural field, which\nis then improved in Magic3D [17] with a two-stage opti-\nmization framework. These methods generate 3D objects or\nscenes from scratch, which cannot be used to edit existing\nreal-world scenes due to the lack of full alignment between\nimages and text descriptions.\n2.3. Neural Field Editing\nGiven a pre-trained NeRF of a photo-realistic scene, neu-\nral field editing allows for manipulation at varying degrees,\nresulting in an edited NeRF that is visually coherent and\ncross-view continuous [8, 18, 25, 40, 49, 53]. TEXTure [34]\nproposes an iterative painting scheme to enable text-guided\nediting of 3D shape textures. EditNeRF [18] optimizes la-\ntent codes to simultaneously modify the appearance and\nshape of objects.\nCLIP-NeRF [42] and SINE [2] lever-\nage prior models to optimize the geometry and texture of\nNeRF based on text descriptions or exemplar images. How-\never, these methods are limited in terms of editing free-\ndom and diversity, restricting their ability to re-create 3D\nobjects/scenes. Leveraging the powerful text comprehen-\nsion and generation capabilities of text-guided image gen-\neration and editing models, some works [8, 40, 52, 53] have\nenabled more complex textual instructions to freely ma-\nnipulate 3D scenes at local or global levels. In order to\nachieve accurate 3D editing, it is critical to determine pre-\ncise editing regions while avoiding unnecessary modifica-\ntions to non-editing regions in a 3D scene, which is rel-\natively challenging for the implicit NeRF representation.\nTo this end, Vox-E [40] and DreamEditor [53] adopt ex-\nplicit 3D representations (e.g., voxel and mesh) and utilize\nthe cross-attention maps to selectively modify the target re-\ngions, RePaint-NeRF [52] constrains background contents\nwith a semantic mask. Compared with these methods, our\nmethod edits directly on NeRF and conducts foreground-\nonly edits with a well-designed Local-Global Iterative Edit-\ning training scheme.\nFurthermore, our method supports\nboth text-driven and image-driven editing, which allows\nusers to freely customize existing NeRF models according\nto their requirements.\n3. Preliminary\n3.1. Latent Diffusion Model\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDMs) [35] is a variation of De-\nnoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) [10] that\noperate in the latent space of images. It consists of an auto-\nencoder and a UNet-structured diffusion model. The auto-\nencoder is composed of an encoder E(\u00b7) that maps an image\nx into a spatial latent code z = E(x) and a decoder D(\u00b7)\nthat maps the latent code back to image D(E(x)). The dif-\nfusion model is trained to produce latent codes within the\nencoder\u2019s latent space with:\nLLDM = Ez\u223cE(x),y,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1),t[\u2225\u03f5\u03d5(zt; t, y) \u2212 \u03f5\u22252\n2],\n(1)\nwhere zt is the noisy latent code at timestep t, \u03f5 is the sam-\npled noise, \u03f5\u03d5(\u00b7) is the UNet that predicts the noise content,\nand y denotes the text description. During inference, a ran-\ndom noise zT is sampled and iteratively denoised to pro-\nduce z0, which is mapped back to the image space through\nimage decoder x\u2032 = D(z0).\n3.2.

The overall pipeline of our CustomNeRF. Given an original 3D scene, CustomNeRF aims to edit it according to a textual\ndescription or a reference image. Our pipeline consists of three steps in total. (a) Reconstruct the original 3D scene with a foreground-\naware NeRF, which enables the identification of foreground regions. (b) Finetune the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to embed\nthe visual subject in the reference image into a special token V \u2217. This step is only required in image-driven editing. (c) Optimize the\ngiven NeRF with our proposed Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE) training scheme to align with the textual description or the reference\nimage. The local and global data flows occur in an alternating manner. Prompt2 is employed in image-driven editing whereas Prompt1 is\nutilized in text-driven editing. Prompt0 is shared in both editing settings.\nfusion model mentioned in Section 3.1 to realize text-to-3D\ngeneration. Let \u03b8 denote the parameters of NeRF model,\nand g(\u00b7) denotes the process of image rendering. The NeRF\nmodel first renders a randomly viewed image x = g(\u03b8),\nwhich is then transformed to noisy latent code zt by feed-\ning to the latent encoder E(\u00b7) and adding noise sequentially.\nThe SDS loss is calculated as follows:\n\u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03d5, g(\u03b8)) = Et,\u03f5[\u03c9(t)(\u03f5\u03d5(zt; t, y) \u2212 \u03f5)\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8 ], (2)\nwhere \u03c9(t) is a weighting function depending on timestep t\n(Equation 1). During training, the above gradients are back-\npropagated to the NeRF model only, enforcing it to render\nimages that look like outputs of the frozen diffusion model.\n4. Method\nGiven a set of well-calibrated images representing a 3D\nscene, our goal is to edit the reconstructed 3D scene un-\nder the guidance of a textual prompt or a reference im-\nage, enabling editing of the foreground regions while pre-\nserving the background regions simultaneously. The over-\nall pipeline of our CustomNeRF is illustrated in Figure 2,\nwhich consists of three steps. First, to reconstruct the orig-\ninal 3D scene, we train a foreground-aware NeRF where\nan extra mask field is introduced to estimate the editing\nprobability besides regular color and density prediction as\nshown in Figure 2(a). The editing probability is utilized in\nthe last step to discriminate regions to be edited (i.e., fore-\nground regions) from irrelevant regions (i.e., background\nregions).\nSecond, as illustrated in Figure 2(b), we em-\nploy a subject-aware Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model\nto encode the subject in the reference image as a special\ntoken V \u2217, thus forming a hybrid prompt for image-driven\nediting (not required for text-driven editing). Finally, we\ntrain the edited NeRF conditioned on the textual prompt or\nthe hybrid prompt using the Local-Global Iterative Editing\n(LGIE) scheme, allowing it to render images that conform\nwith the editing prompt while preserving background con-\ntents, which is presented in Figure 2(c). The class-guided\nregularization is further adopted in image-driven editing to\nalleviate the Janus problem.\n4.1. Foreground-aware NeRF Training\nGiven a 3D point p and a view direction d, a typical\nNeRF [22] defines MLPs to output view-dependent color\nc(p, d) and the point density \u03c3(p). Considering a pixel\u2019s\ncamera ray r(k) = o + kd starting from origin o in direc-\ntion d, with k representing the distance from o. The color\n4\nof this pixel can be obtained by volume rendering:\nC(r) =\nZ kf\nkn\nT(k)\u03c3(r(k))c(r(k), d)dk,\nwhere\nT(k) = exp\n \n\u2212\nZ k\nkn\n\u03c3(r(k))dk\n!\n,\n(3)\nwhere kn and kf are the near plane and the far plane,\nT(k) can be regarded as transparency. MSE loss between\nthe rendered color \u02c6C(r) and the captured color C(r) is cal-\nculated for supervision.\nIn our method, to identify foreground regions, we ex-\ntend the typical NeRF with an extra mask field estimating\nthe editing probability m(p, d) \u2208 (0, 1) of point p from the\nview d, which is shown in Figure 2(a). Pixel editing prob-\nability of ray r, denoted by \u02c6\nM(r) can be rendered in the\nsame way as Equation 3. To acquire the ground truth of\n\u02c6\nM(r), we incorporate Grounded SAM [11, 15, 19] to ob-\ntain the binary segmentation mask M(r) of each captured\nimage according to a textual prompt describing the edited\nregion, e.g., \u201ca bear statue\u201d in Figure 2(a). BCE loss is\ncalculated between \u02c6\nM(r) and the pseudo label M(r).\n4.2. Reference Subject Learning\nIn order to unify the formulation of image-driven and test-\ndriven editing tasks, we adopt an efficient subject-aware\ntext-to-image generation model Custom Diffusion [16] for\nreference subject encoding. Custom Diffusion is built upon\na pre-trained text-conditioned diffusion model and fine-\ntuned on several reference images to generate images of the\nspecific subject while preserving its key identifying charac-\nteristics. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), a special word V \u2217 is\ndefined to uniquely identify the reference subject in the ref-\nerence image, which is optimized by the LDM loss (Equa-\ntion 1) to map it to a proper word embedding. After training,\nV \u2217 can be treated as a regular word token to form a hybrid\nprompt, e.g., \u201ca photo of a V \u2217 dog\u201d, for customized genera-\ntion of the specific black dog. In this way, our CustomNeRF\nis able to conduct consistent and effective editing with adap-\ntive types of source data including images or texts. More\ndetails about the optimization of Custom Diffusion can be\nfound in [16].\n4.3. Adaptive Source Driven NeRF Editing\nIn this step, we aim to obtain an edited NeRF that can\nre-create the 3D scene aligning with the text description\nor the reference image.\nAn intuitive way to obtain this\nedited NeRF is to first initialize it as a copy of the origi-\nnal NeRF obtained in Section 4.1 and then optimize it with\nthe SDS loss calculated using the pre-trained T2I model\nto align with the textual or hybrid prompt. However, due\nto the implicit NeRF representation, naively applying SDS\nloss to the whole 3D scene results in changes to the back-\nground regions, which should be kept the same as the origi-\nnal scene. To this end, we propose a Local-Global Iterative\nEditing (LGIE) scheme that alternates between foreground\nregion editing and full-image editing. Furthermore, to mit-\nigate the Janus problem in image-driven editing, we design\na class-guided regularization to exploit general class priors\ncontained in the T2I model to inject novel concepts into\nscenes in a more geometrically consistent way. Details of\nthe above training scheme can be found in Figure 2(c).\nLocal-Global Iterative Editing.\nOur LGIE training\nscheme alternates between the local editing stage which\nseparately renders and edits the foreground regions only,\nand the global editing stage which edits foreground regions\ncontextualized on background clues.\nWe first take text-\ndriven editing as an example for illustration. As illustrated\nin Figure 2(c), given a 3D scene of the bear statue, our goal\nis to edit it with the textual prompt \u201ca dog standing in the\nforest\u201d to replace the bear with a dog. In the local editing\nstage, we modify Equation 3 to render foreground regions\nusing the editing probability m(r(k), d):\nCf(r) =\nZ kf\nkn\nTf(k)\u03c3f(r(k), d)c(r(k), d)dk,\nwhere\nTf(k) = exp\n \n\u2212\nZ k\nkn\n\u03c3f(r(k), d)dk\n!\n,\n(4)\nwhere point density \u03c3(rt) is adjusted by m(rt, d) to elimi-\nnate the background contents in the rendered image as fol-\nlows:\n\u03c3f(r(k), d) = m(r(k), d)) \u00d7 \u03c3(r(k)).\n(5)\nThe rendered foreground image xf is then fed into the\nfrozen T2I model together with the foreground part of the\nabove editing prompt (e.g., \u201ca dog\u201d). Following [28], view-\ndependent words, e.g., \u201cfront view\u201d, \u201cside view\u201d, and \u201cback\nview\u201d, etc, are appended to the prompt to alleviate Janus\nproblem in text-driven editing. Due to the absence of a stan-\ndardized definition of direction in the captured dataset, in-\nstead of setting it manually, we conduct matching between\nthe CLIP features of images and those of texts to assign\nan appropriate view-dependent word to the rendered image.\nAfterward, the local SDS loss Llocal\nSDS formulated in Equa-\ntion 2 is calculated to optimize the NeRF parameters.\nIn the global editing stage, we render the full image and\nfeed it into the T2I model together with the complete editing\nprompt \u201ca dog standing in the forest\u201d to calculate a global\nSDS loss Lglobal\nSDS . In this stage, the context information in\nthe background regions serves as a useful clue for editing,\nrealizing foreground-background harmony. To further avoid\nchanges to the context of the background region, we detach\nthe gradients of the background region in fully rendered im-\nages to prevent them from affecting the NeRF parameters.\n5\nClass-guided regularization For image-driven editing\nwhere hybrid prompt (e.g., \u201ca V \u2217 dog standing in the for-\nest\u201d is provided to replace the bear statue with a specific\nblack dog, we apply a class-guided regularization method\nto mitigate the Janus problem which becomes severe due\nto the single-view reference image. Concretely, in the lo-\ncal editing stage, we remove the special token V \u2217 from the\nforeground part of the editing prompt, so that the class word\n\u201cdog\u201d plays a major role in the local optimization process.\nIn this manner, the general class priors embedded within\nthe T2I model are effectively leveraged to guide geometri-\ncally reasonable optimization. The global stage runs in the\nsame way as the text-driven setting, except that the hybrid\nprompt is adopted to inform the NeRF model with the ap-\npearance information of the reference subject. By alternat-\ning between local and global stages, the appearance of the\nreference subject can be transferred to various views gradu-\nally, producing view-consistent editing results.\nLoss functions. Apart from the above two SDS losses, we\nfurther explicitly constrain the rendered pixel color of the\nbackground region to be the same as the original one for the\ngoal of background preservation. We render the background\nregions before and after editing, which are denoted as xo\nb\nand xe\nb. Concretely, we first calculate the background point\ndensity \u03c3b(r(k), d) for background rendering:\n\u03c3b(r(k), d) = (1 \u2212 (m(r(k), d))) \u00d7 \u03c3(r(k),\n(6)\nwhere subscript o and e are omitted for simplicity. The\nbackground image is rendered using Equation 4 except that\n\u03c3f(r(k), d) is replaced with \u03c3b(r(k), d).\nAn MSE loss\nLbg is calculated between xo\nf and xe\nf to enforce the edited\nNeRF rendering similar background contents with the orig-\ninal NeRF.\nThe overall loss function for the third step is summarized\nas follows:\nL = \u03bbSDSLSDS + \u03bbbgLbg,\n(7)\nwhere \u03bbSDS and \u03bbbg are hyperparameters to balance dif-\nferent losses, which are empirically set as 0.01 and 1000\nrespectively. We use LSDS to represent both Llocal\nSDS and\nLglobal\nSDS which are alternately calculated during training.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nDatasets. To validate the effectiveness of our CustomNeRF,\nwe test on 8 real scenes from BlendedMVS [50], LLFF [21],\nIBRNet [45], and Bear Statue [8]. These scenes feature\ncomplex backgrounds, including outdoor statues and ob-\njects frequently encountered in everyday life, etc. For text-\ndriven editing, 4-6 textual prompts are adopted for each\nscene.\nFor image-driven editing, we use images down-\nloaded from the Internet as reference images, with 3-5 ref-\nerence images available for each scene.\nBaselines. For text-driven editing, we compare our method\nwith two recent editing methods based on NeRF represen-\ntation, including: (1) Instruct-NeRF2NeRF [8], which edits\nNeRF by iteratively updating dataset with images generated\nby a 2D editing model [4]. (2) RePaint-NeRF [52], which\nuses SDS loss for NeRF optimization and keeps non-editing\nregions unchanged by 2D semantic masks.\nFor image-driven editing, due to the absence of exist-\ning methods for this setting, we modified several exist-\ning works to serve as baselines for comparison with our\nmethod, including: (1) Ours+Splice Loss: Splice loss [41]\nis proposed to disentangle structure and appearance infor-\nmation from an image for image editing, which is further\ndemonstrated effective to transfer the texture from an ex-\nemplar image for NeRF editing in SINE [2]. We apply this\nloss to our foreground-aware NeRF during the editing stage\nto transfer appearance information from the reference im-\nage while maintaining the structure layout of the original\nscene. (2) RePaint-NeRF*: Since the original framework\nof RePaint-NeRF only supports text-driven editing, we re-\nplace its employed T2I model with the Custom Diffusion\nfinetuned on reference images. In this way, the reference\nimage can be embedded as a special token in the editing\nprompt, thereby equipping RePaint-NeRF with the capabil-\nity for image-driven editing.\nEvaluation metrics. Following [8, 53], we use the CLIP\nText-Image Directional Similarity to evaluate the alignment\nbetween the images and text prompts before and after edit-\ning, reflecting whether the image editing direction is con-\nsistent with the text changing direction. The DINO [26]\nSimilarity used in subject-driven image generation is also\nadopted as a metric. By calculating the average of the DINO\nsimilarity between the edited images from different views\nand the reference image, we can measure whether the edited\nNeRF is consistent with the reference image. Furthermore,\nto compensate for the lack of objective metrics in subjective\nediting tasks, we also conduct user studies in text-driven and\nimage-driven editing.\nImplementation details. In our experiments, we employ\nInstant-NGP [24] to learn the original neural field and make\nnecessary extensions to enable the prediction of editing\nprobabilities. The training of original NeRF takes 3K it-\nerations with the supervision of both rendered image and\nediting probability. We use Stable Diffusion v1.5 and fol-\nlow the Custom Diffusion training process to conduct ref-\nerence subject learning with 250 steps. In the editing step,\nwe use the Adam optimizer [14] with a learning rate of 5e-4\nto optimize the NeRF parameters. The duration of the edit-\ning process varies from 10 minutes to 1 hour depending on\nthe complexity of the scene and the editing type on a single\n6\n(a) Original / \nReference\n(d) Ours\n(b) Ours + Splice Loss\n(c) RePaint-NeRF*\n\u201ca V* dog standing in the forest\u201d\n\u201ca V* shoe on the mat\u201d\n\u201ca V* dog standing in the forest\u201d\n\u201ca V* shoe on the mat\u201d\n\u201ca V* statue in the exhibition hall\u201d\n\u201ca V* statue in the exhibition hall\u201d\nFigure 3.

Qualitative Results\nImage-driven editing. We provide qualitative results of\nimage-driven editing in Figure 3 to compare our CustomN-\neRF with other baseline methods. It is shown in Figure 3(b)\nthat Splice Loss can only transfer superficial attributes such\nas color and texture from the reference image to the edited\nNeRF, while it fails to modify the geometry of the edited ob-\nject. For instance, in the 3rd row, where the statue of David\nis replaced with a comic character, it only turns the statue\ninto red. Although RePaint-NeRF* (Figure 3(c)) learns the\ntexture and geometry information of the reference image\nto some extent, it is still limited in the richness of details\nand similarity to the reference image, e.g., the hairstyle and\nclothes texture of the comic character are not presented in\nthe edited NeRF. Moreover, background contents are not\nwell-preserved in this method. In contrast, our method is\nable to generate edited results that not only maintain the\nbackground effectively but also bear a closer resemblance\nto the reference image compared to the two baselines. For\nexample, in the 1st row, our method successfully maintains\nthe ring of yellow fur on the leg of the black dog. In the\nmore challenging scenario depicted in the 3rd row, our ap-\nproach preserves intricate details such as the hairstyle of the\ncomic character and the folds in the clothes, which further\ndemonstrates the superiority of our CustomNeRF. More vi-\nsualization results are included in supplementary materials.\nText-driven editing. We also provide qualitative results\nof text-driven editing in Figure 4. Compared to baseline\nmethods, our approach is capable of realizing editing with\nmore substantial shape and semantic changes and main-\ntaining consistency between different views in complex\n7\nscenes, such as transforming a bear statue into a corgi dog.\nInstruct-NeRF2NeRF still retains the bear\u2019s body shape and\nRePaint-NeRF tends to produce abnormal renderings. In\nterms of background preservation, our method also signif-\nicantly outperforms the baseline approaches, particularly\nRePaint-NeRF, which tends to have its background styles\neasily influenced by the foreground content.\nMethod\nCLIPdir \u2191\nDINOsim \u2191\nVote Percentage \u2191\nOurs+Splicing Loss\n15.47\n46.51\n10.6%\nRePaint-NeRF*\n16.46\n38.74\n13.8%\nCustomNeRF (Ours)\n20.07\n47.44\n75.6%\nTable 1.

Quantitative results\nWe present the quantitative comparison with other methods\non the image-driven editing and text-driven editing tasks in\nTable 1 and Table 2 respectively. For user study, we dis-\ntribute 50 questionnaires for both image-driven editing and\ntext-driven editing, including 10 image-driven edits across\n5 scenes and 10 text-driven edits across 2 scenes, asking\nusers to choose the best editing results. Our CustomNeRF\nsignificantly outperforms baseline methods and achieves the\nhighest editing scores in both tasks, especially in user eval-\nuation performances. Although Ours+Splicing Loss in Ta-\nble 1 also achieves a relatively high DINO Similarity, this is\nlargely due to the fact that it is optimized based on DINO-\nViT features, giving it a significant advantage when com-\nputing DINO feature similarity. However, as indicated by\nthe other metrics and qualitative results in Figure 3, it is sub-\nstantially inferior in performance compared to our method.\n5.4. Ablation study\nEffectiveness of Local-Global Iterative Editing. We con-\nduct ablation studies on our LGIE training scheme in the\ntext-driven editing task in Figure 5.\nFor the local-only\nsetting, conducting local editing without considering the\nglobal context can lead to a discordance between the gen-\nerated foreground content and the background region. For\ninstance, in the second row, the right part of the sunflower\nis obscured by leaves.

By iteratively optimizing between these\ntwo stages, we can achieve better background preservation\nand foreground-background harmony.\nClass-guided regularization. We conduct ablation stud-\nies on class-guided regularization and present the results in\nFigure 6. Removing the class prior regularization from both\nlocal and global stages results in edited outputs that more\nclosely resemble the reference image, but also lead to ab-\nnormal views and greater influence from the background in\nthe reference image. Applying class prior to the global stage\nleads to an obvious Janus problem, indicating that class pri-\nors tend to work in scenarios with simpler backgrounds. We\ninclude more ablation results in supplementary materials.\n6. Conclusion and Limitation\nIn this study, we present the CustomNeRF model, designed\nfor adaptive source driven 3D scene editing with unified\nediting prompts from either texts or reference images. We\ntackle two key challenges: ensuring precise foreground-\n8\nonly editing, and maintaining consistency across multiple\nviews when using single-view reference images. Our ap-\nproach includes a Local-Global Iterative Editing (LGIE)\ntraining scheme for editing that focuses on the foreground\nwhile keeping the background unchanged, and a class-\nguided regularization to mitigate view inconsistency in\nimage-driven editing. Extensive experiments validate Cus-\ntomNeRF\u2019s capability to accurately edit in diverse real-\nworld scenarios for both text and image prompts.\nOur method transfers subject appearance from reference\nimages, yet it faces limitations with Custom Diffusion\u2019s in-\nability to perfectly replicate references, resulting in some\ninconsistencies in details in our image-driven editing re-\nsults. Currently, our approach is also limited to text and\nimage prompts, but future work could expand to include\nother editing sources like audio, sketches, etc.\nReferences\n[1] Omri Avrahami, Dani Lischinski, and Ohad Fried.

Model Architecture\nOur foreground-aware NeRF is constructed on Instant-\nNGP [24] with an additional head to predict the editing\nprobability to conduct decomposed rendering. For simplic-\nity in implementation, this editing probability head is de-\nsigned similarly to the RGB prediction head. It is com-\nposed of a hidden layer with 64 hidden dimensions followed\nby the sigmoid activation to keep the values between 0 and\n1. When rendering the foreground or background regions\nseparately, we avoid truncating the editing probability gra-\ndient with the threshold operation. Instead, we encourage\nthe editing probability to approach 1 or 0 through a param-\neterized sigmoid activation and utilize the processed proba-\nbilities for decomposed rendering via a simple linear com-\nbination. We find that this soft mask operation better facil-\nitates complete shape optimization during the editing pro-\ncess compared to a threshold operation, as demonstrated by\nthe ablation study presented in Section C.\nAppendix B. Implementation Details\nDataset preparation. In this paper, we conduct different\nediting operations using datasets such as BlendedMVS [50]\nand LLFF [21]. For 360-degree scenes from these datasets,\nwe employ COLMAP [39] to extract camera poses. This\nmethod can also be applied to real-world scenes captured\nby users.\nRendering. Due to the memory limitation of the GPU and\nthe high overhead of SDS loss, we need to render down-\nsampled images. For the BlendedMVS dataset, we render\nimages with 3x downsampling for NeRF training and 5x\ndownsampling for NeRF editing. For the high-resolution\nLLFF and IBRNet [45] datasets, the two downsampling fac-\ntors are 15 and 28. For the bear statue dataset [8], the two\ndownsampling factors are 4 and 7. Since we render the fore-\nground for a separate local editing operation, we combine\nthe rendered foreground image with a random solid color\nbackground to avoid confusion between the foreground and\nthe single background of the same color.\nHybrid prompt generation. In image-driven editing, apart\nfrom manually inputting hybrid prompts that align with the\nimage content, we can also employ models like GPT-4 to\ndescribe the contents of the original scene. To ensure that\nthe generated descriptions adhere to our required format, we\nspecify the output format as \u201c[describe the subject] in [de-\nscribe the environment]\u201d, and replace the subject part of the\nobtained description with \u201cV* [cls]\u201d. Through this method,\nin image-driven editing, users only need to provide a refer-\nence image, eliminating the need for additional textual input\nto describe the original scene.\nAppendix C. More Ablation Studies\nVisualization of intermediate results. We present the ren-\ndered editing probabilities and foreground/background im-\nages in Figure 7 after editing. It can be observed that the\nrendered editing probabilities can adapt well to the shape of\nthe modified foreground regions, enabling the precise ren-\ndering of both foreground- and background-only images.\nFor instance, after the training process of the edited NeRF,\nthe editing probability aligns well with the cartoon dinosaur,\nwhich is larger than the original dinosaur statue.\nIn the\nbackground image in the second row, we observe dark shad-\nows in the foreground region, which indicates that NeRF\ndoes not picture the covered background regions in non-360\nscenes. However, in the full rendering image, this shadow\nwill be filled with foreground contents when the new objects\nbeing added are similar in shape to the original objects.\n\u201ca V* dinosaur in the desolate field\u201d\n\u201can European sofa in the park\u201d\nFull Image\nEditing \nProbabiliy\nForeground\nImage\nBackground\nImage\nOriginal / \nReference\nFigure 7. Visualization of intermediate results.\nAblation studies of other training strategies. We con-\nduct more ablation studies on training strategies in Figure 8.\nUpon removal of the background preservation loss, signifi-\ncant changes can be observed in the background regions af-\nter editing compared with the original scene, indicating the\nnecessity of the background preservation loss. We also ab-\nlate different post-processing methods for editing probabil-\nities. When binarizing these probabilities using a threshold\n(i.e., w/o Soft Mask), the obtained editing probabilities are\nincomplete, leading to incomplete foreground in the edited\nresults, such as the missing left front leg of the dog in the\n3-rd row of Figure 8. By scaling the values between 0 and 1\nusing a sigmoid function to obtain a soft mask, i.e., the strat-\negy adopted in our paper, we can achieve complete editing\nprobabilities and consequently, complete editing results.\nEffect of different class word. We use the class word in\nthe local editing stage to promote reasonable geometry in\nthe case of a single reference image. In order to explore the\neffect of the class word, we modify the class prior to be in-\nconsistent with the reference image. As shown in Figure 9,\nwe compare different class words such as \u201cdog\u201d, \u201ccorgi\u201d,\n11\nand \u201ccat\u201d. The final results reflect the texture of the ref-\nerence image and the geometric characteristics associated\nwith the class word we use.\nw/o \nOurs\nw/o \nSoft Mask\nFull Image\nEditing \nProbability\nForeground\nImage\nBackground\nImage\nOriginal\n\u2112!\"\nFigure 8.

Given only one reference image, edit-\ning results generated with Custom Diffusion most closely\nresemble the reference image. Though the other two meth-\nods can generate similar categories and shapes, they do not\nmatch the reference image in texture. Therefore, in our pa-\nper, we ultimately select Custom Diffusion for reference\nsubject learning.\nAppendix D. More Visualization Results\nQualitative results. We provide more image-driven and\ntext-driven editing results in Figure 12 and Figure 13 re-\nspectively. We have also included video editing results in\nthe \u201cvideo results\u201d folder, which provides dynamic visual-\nization of editing results.\nFailure cases. In addition to the experimental results above,\nwe also present the failure cases of CustomNeRF in Fig-\nure 11. For instance, in the first row, as the Custom Diffu-\nsion cannot always generate images with the subject identi-\ncal to those in the reference image, the edited scene shows\nthe dog\u2019s clothing different from that in the reference im-\nage. In the second row, due to the considerable shape dif-\nference between a hat and a hamburger, the replaced ham-\nburger takes on an inverted shape, larger at the bottom and\nsmaller at the top, similar to the hat\u2019s structure.\n(a) Original / Reference\n(b) \u201ca V* dog\u201d\n(c) \u201ca V* corgi\u201d\n(d) \u201ca V* cat\u201d\nFigure 9.

Recent advances in neural networks of natural language pose\nnew opportunities for re-thinking strategies and user interfaces for enhanced text-entry for AAC users. In this paper, we present\nSpeakFaster, consisting of large language models (LLMs) and a co-designed user interface for text entry in a highly-abbreviated\nform, allowing saving 57% more motor actions than traditional predictive keyboards in offline simulation. A pilot study with 19\nnon-AAC participants typing on a mobile device by hand demonstrated gains in motor savings in line with the offline simulation,\nwhile introducing relatively small effects on overall typing speed. Lab and field testing on two eye-gaze typing users with\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) demonstrated text-entry rates 29-60% faster than traditional baselines, due to significant\nsaving of expensive keystrokes achieved through phrase and word predictions from context-aware LLMs. These findings\nprovide a strong foundation for further exploration of substantially-accelerated text communication for motor-impaired users and\ndemonstrate a direction for applying LLMs to text-based user interfaces.\n1 Introduction\nThe loss of efficient means of communication presents one of the greatest challenges to people living with amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS). Absent typing or speaking, eye-gaze tracking is the most common human-computer interface. Coupled with\nan on-screen keyboard, gaze tracking allows users to enter text for speech output and electronic messaging, providing a means\nfor augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)1. However, gaze typing is slow (usually below 10 words per minute,\nWPM1,2), creating a gap of more than an order of magnitude below typical speaking rates (up to 190 WPM in English3). With\nrecent developments in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), typing via brain signals becomes possible and is allowing disabled\nusers to type at increasingly higher rates through imagined speech or hand movements4,5, however these methods require\ninvasively-implanted electrodes in the cerebral cortex and hence are not as widely tested or adopted as eye-gaze typing.\nThe key bottleneck in gaze typing for disabled users is the high motor and temporal cost it takes to perform each keystroke6.\nThis bottleneck applies to BCI text entry systems that operate at the level of individual characters4,7 as well. One way to attack\nthis bottleneck is to develop techniques to significantly reduce the number of keystrokes needed to enter text8\u201310. For example,\narXiv:2312.01532v1  [cs.HC]  3 Dec 2023\ncompletion for partially-typed words and prediction of upcoming words could reduce the average number of keystrokes needed\nper word. However current keystroke saving techniques used in commercial text-input software (e.g., Gboard11 and Smart\nCompose12) are still insufficient for closing the communication gaps for impaired users, since the spans of correct predictions\nare short and the utilization of the predictions too infrequent to offset the cost of scanning predictions13.\nIn the past few years, there has been a revolution in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs)14\u201317. LLMs are\ninitially trained on simple objectives such as predicting the next text token over a very large text corpus, such as public web text\nand book content, but then can be nudged to have emergent capabilities that approach or exceed human-level performance on\nlanguage-based tasks ranging from answering difficult mathematics problems18 to carrying on open-ended conversations14.\nThese LLMs can make predictions with a much longer context than traditional n-gram language models and thus offer the\npossibility of substantially accelerating character-based typing.\nIn this study, we report a text-entry user interface (UI) called SpeakFaster that leverages fine-tuned LLMs to expand\nhighly-abbreviated English text (word initials, supplemented by additional letters and words when necessary) into the desired\nfull phrases at very high accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of this new system, we first used simulations to show that\nthe accuracy of the SpeakFaster method is sufficiently high to significantly accelerate character-based typing. Second, we\nintegrated the SpeakFaster UI with the eye-gaze keyboards of two users with ALS and demonstrated a significant enhancement\nin text-entry speed (29-60%) and saving of motor actions compared to a baseline of conventional forward suggestions. On\nnon-AAC participants the overall speed of text entry was similar to conventional smart keyboards while the motor action\nsavings was still substantial. Our findings also indicate that users were able to learn to use the system with relatively little\npractice (about 20-50 phrases).\n2 LLMs and text-entry UI\nWord completion and next-word prediction based on n-gram language models13,19 exploit the statistical dependence of a word\non a small number of (typically up to four) preceding words. By contrast, LLMs are able to take advantage of broader context,\nincluding tens or hundreds of preceding words entered by the user and previous turns of the ongoing conversation. We have\npreviously demonstrated20 that a fine-tuned 64-billion-parameter Google LaMDA14 model can expand abbreviations of the\nword-initial form (e.g., \u201cishpitb\u201d) into full phrases (e.g., \u201cI saw him play in the bedroom\u201d, Fig. 1A) at a top-5 exact-match\naccuracy of 48-77% when provided with conversational context. Failures to find exact matches tend to occur on longer and\nmore complex phrases. While encouraging, a practical solution needs to ensure that the user is able to type any arbitrary phrase\nin subsequent attempts in case of a failure in the initial abbreviation expansion, i.e., that the user will never run into a \u201cdead\nend\u201d in the UI.\nWe therefore developed a new UI and two underlying new fine-tuned LLMs as a complete, practical solution. LLM\n\u201cKeywordAE\u201d is capable of expanding abbreviations that mix initials with words that are fully or incompletely spelled out\n(Fig. 1B). The KeywordAE model is also capable of expanding initials-only abbreviations, and hence provides a superset of\nthe capabilities of the fine-tuned LLM in Cai et al.20 LLM \u201cFillMask\u201d is capable of providing alternative words that begin\nwith a given initial letter in the context of surrounding words (Fig. 1C). The two models models were each fine-tuned with\napproximately 1.8 million unique triplets of {context,abbreviation, fullphrase} synthesized from four public datasets of\ndialogues in English (See Supplementary Section A.1 for details of LLM fine-tuning and evaluation).\nTo form conduits to the fine-tuned LLMs, we designed a UI with three pathways, namely initials-only AE, KeywordAE,\nand FillMask, to support a complete abbreviated text input experience (see the three panels of Fig. 1). The initials-only pathway\nis the common starting point of all phrase-entry workflows in the SpeakFaster UI. Among the three pathways, it involves the\nfewest keystrokes and clicks and alone suffices for short and predictable phrases. The user starts by typing an initialism that\nrepresents the intended phrase (Label 1 in Fig. 1A). The abbreviation is typed with a conventional soft keyboard or gaze-driven\non-screen keyboard (e.g., Tobii \u00ae Computer Control). As the user enters the abbreviation, the UI automatically triggers calls to\nthe KeywordAE LLM after every keystroke. Each call returns the top-5 most likely options based on the conversational context\n2/28\nFigure 1. Three interaction pathways of abbreviated text entry in the SpeakFaster UI subserved by two fine-tuned LLMs\n(KeywordAE and FillMask). Panel A shows the abbreviation expansion (AE) UI pathway with only word-initial letters. The\n\u201cSpeaker\u201d button to the right of each candidate phrase (e.g., Label 4) allows the user to select and speak the correct phrase out\nvia text-to-speech. Gaze-clicking the \u201cExpand\u201d button (Label 2) is optional since calls to the LLM are triggered automatically\nfollowing the eye-gaze keystrokes. Panel B illustrates KeywordAE, which is an extension of initials-only AE that allows words\nthat are spelled completely or incompletely to be mixed with initials in the original abbreviation, in an ordering that corresponds\nto the intended phrase. We refer to such fully or partially spelled words as \u201ckeywords\u201d. They guide the UI towards the intended\nphrase. Label 3 (\u201cbedr\u201d for \u201cbedroom\u201d) illustrates the support for partially-spelled keywords supported by KeywordAE v2,\nwhich differs from KeywordAE v1, where only fully-spelled keywords (e.g., \u201cbedroom\u201d) are supported. Panel C illustrates the\nFillMask UI pathway, another interaction flow which allows the user to find sensible replacements for an incorrect word that\nstarts with the same letter. The gaze-driven on-screen keyboard is omitted from the screenshots in this figure.\n3/28\nand the abbreviation, which are rendered in the UI for the user to peruse and select (Label 3 in Fig. 1A). The number of options\nprovided (5) is based on the screen size of gaze tablet devices and the point of \"diminishing return\" for motor saving rate from\noffline simulation results (see next section). If one of the candidate phrases matches the intended phrase, the user selects the\nphrase by clicking the \u201cSpeaker\u201d button associated with it (Label 4 in Fig. 1A), which dispatches the phrase for text-to-speech\noutput and ends the phrase entry workflow. The selected phrase (\"I saw him playing in the bedroom\" in this example) becomes\na part of the conversational context for future turns.\nIf the intended phrase is not found via the initials-only pathway, however, two alternative UI pathways are available to assist\nthe user in finding the intended phrase. One of the pathways is KeywordAE. The user gaze-clicks the \"Spell\" button (Label 2 in\nFig. 1B), which turns the abbreviation in the input bar into gaze-clickable chips, one for each character of the initials-only\nabbreviation (e.g., bottom of Fig. 1B). The user selects a word to spell by gaze-clicking the corresponding chip. This turns the\nchip into an input box, in which the user types the word by using the on-screen keyboard (Label 3 in Fig. 1B). Subsequent calls\nto the LLM will contain the partially- or fully-spelled words in addition to the initials of the unspelled words. A call to the\nKeywordAE is triggered automatically after every keystroke. After each call, the UI renders the latest top-5 phrase expansion\nreturned by the Keyword AE LLM (Label 4 in Fig. 1B). If the intended phrase is found, the user selects it by a gaze click of the\nspeaker button as described before (Label 5 in Fig. 1B). We constructed two versions of KeywordAE models: KeywordAE v1\nrequires each keyword to be typed in full, while KeywordAE v2 allows a keyword to be typed incompletely (\u201cbedroom\u201d as\n\u201cbedr\u201d). Simulation results below show v2 leads to greater keystroke saving than v1.\nThe KeywordAE UI pathway is not limited to spelling out a single word. The UI allows the user to spell multiple words,\nwhich is necessary for longer and more unpredictable phrases (not shown in Fig. 1). In the unlikely case where the AE LLM\npredicts none of the words of the sentence correctly, the KeywordAE pathway reduces to spelling out all the words of the\nphrase.\nFillMask is another pathway to recover from the failure to find the exact intended phrase. Unlike KeywordAE, FillMask\nonly suits cases in which very few words (typically one word) of an expansion are incorrect (i.e., the phrase is a \u201cnear miss\u201d).\nFor instance, one of the phrases \"I saw him play in the backyard\" missed the intended phrase \"I saw him play in the bedroom\"\nby only one incorrect word (\"backyard\", Label 2 in Fig. 1C). The user clicks the near-miss phrase, which causes the words of\nthe phrase to appear as chips in the input bar. Clicking the chip that corresponds to the incorrect word (\"backyard\", Label 3 in\nFig. 1C) triggers a call to the FillMask LLM, the response from which contains alternative words that start with the same initial\nletter and fit the context formed by the other words of the sentence and by the previous turn(s) of the conversation. The user\nselects the correct word (Label 5) by clicking it and then clicking the speaker button to finalize the phrase entry (Label 6).\nAlthough not shown by the example in Fig. 1C, the FillMask pathway allows the UI to replace multiple words (or do\nreplacement multiple times in a given word slot) after the initial replacement. In rare cases where the FillMask LLM fails to\nprovide the intended word, the user can fall back to typing the correct word in the input box by using the eye-gaze keyboard.\nAs shown above, KeywordAE and FillMask are two alternative interaction modes for recovering from a failure to obtain\nthe intended phrase via the initials-only pathway. The user\u2019s decision on which pathway to choose should be determined by\nwhether a near-miss option exists. This proposition is supported by simulation results in the next section. In the current study,\nthe SpeakFaster UI allows the user to use the FillMask mode after using the KeywordAE mode, which is useful for finding the\ncorrect words in a hard-to-predict phrase. But entering the KeywordAE mode is not allowed after using the FillMask mode,\nbecause FillMask should be used only during the final phase of a phrase entry workflow, where all but one or two words of\na candidate phrase are correct. These heuristics and design considerations of the UI pathways were made clear to the users\nthrough initial training and practice at the beginning of the user studies described below. The SpeakFaster UI is only one of\nmany possible UI designs for supporting AAC text entry with LLMs9,10. Its justification comes from prior studies on LLM\u2019s\ncapabilities in expanding abbreviations20, its consistency with the conventional lookup-based abbreviation expansion in AAC21,\nand the empirical results from the user studies reported below.\n4/28\n3 Simulation Results\nTo measure the approximate upper bound of the motor-action savings in this new text-entry UI, we ran simulation on the test\nsplit of a corrected version of the Turk Dialogues (TDC) corpus20,22. To simulate an ideal user\u2019s actions in the SpeakFaster\nUI when entering the text for a dialogue turn, we first invoked AE without keywords (Fig. 1A). If the matching phrase was\nfound, the phrase was selected and the simulation ended. If no matching phrase was found, however, we tested three interaction\nstrategies. The first strategy (Strategy 1) invoked the KeywordAE (Fig. 1B) iteratively by spelling more of the words out, until\nthe matching phrase was found. The second strategy (Strategy 2) was identical to Strategy 1, except FillMask (Fig. 1C) was\nused in lieu of KeywordAE whenever there remained only a single incorrect word in the best-matching phrase candidate. The\nflowcharts for Strategies 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, respectively. The third strategy, referred to as Strategy 2A, was\na variant of Strategy 2. It utilized FillMask more aggressively, i.e., as soon as two or fewer incorrect words remained in the\nbest option. In all three strategies, KeywordAE was invoked incrementally by spelling out more words in the best-matching\ncandidate. This incremental spelling was implemented differently for the two versions of KeywordAE, due to differences in\nwhat abbreviations were supported. For KeywordAE v1, which supported only fully-spelled keywords, the simulation spelled\nout the first incorrect word in the best option; for v2, in which keywords could be partly spelled, the simulation added one\nadditional letter at a time in the first incorrect word. To leverage the contextual understanding of the AE and FillMask LLMs, all\nthe previous turns of a dialogue from the Turk Dialogues corpus were used for expanding abbreviations and finding alternative\nwords, unless otherwise stated.\nAs a baseline for comparison and to emulate the traditional n-gram-based text prediction paradigm, we also ran simulations\non the same corpus with an n-gram language model (LM, Gboard\u2019s finite state transducer23 trained on 164,000 unigrams and\n1.3 million n-grams in US English) that supported word completion and prediction, modeling ideal user behavior that selects\nthe intended word as soon as it became available among the top-n word completions or prediction options.\nTo quantify the number of motor actions, we broadened the definition of keystrokes to include not only keypresses on the\nkeyboard but also UI actions required to use the novel features in SpeakFaster, including entering the KeywordAE mode (a\nclick to the \u201cSpell\u201d button in Fig. 1B), specifying a word to spell for KeywordAE, entering the FillMask mode, selecting a word\nto replace through FillMask, and selecting phrase and word options returned by the LLMs. Similarly, the number of keystrokes\nin the Gboard simulation included selecting options from word completion and next-word prediction.\nThe result of the SpeakFaster simulations indicated a significant saving of motor actions compared to the baseline from\nGboard\u2019s forward predictions (Fig. 2C). This held true for both KeywordAE v1 and v2. Under KeywordAE v2, given that\nSpeakFaster utilized all previous dialogue turns as the context and provided five options at each step (orange bars in Fig. 2C),\nStrategy 1 and Strategy 2 led to the KSR values 0.640 and 0.657, respectively, significantly exceeding the Gboard KSR (0.482).\nThese KSRs from the KeywordAE v2 model also beat the best KSR from KeywordAE v1 (0.647) by a small but noticeable\nmargin, reflecting a benefit of allowing keywords to be partially spelled. The superior KSR of Strategy 2 relative to Strategy\n1 indicates a benefit of augmenting KeywordAE with FillMask, which surfaced the correct word options with fewer motor\nactions required. However, the comparison between Strategy 2 and Strategy 2A shows that FillMask deteriorates motor saving\nrate if used too aggressively. Specifically, premature uses of FillMask, i.e., whenever two incorrect words remained (instead of\none incorrect word as in Strategy 2), reduced the KSR from 0.657 to 0.647 (Fig. 2C). Under KeywordAE v1, the KSR showed a\nsimilar trend in relation to utilization of FillMask under Strategies 2 and 2A (not shown in Fig. 2C for clarity). In Fig. 2C, the\ngray bars show that SpeakFaster outperformed the Gboard baseline in KSR even without utilizing the previous dialogue turns\nas context, although the KSR gains were significantly lower compared to if the context was utilized.\nThe results in Fig. 2C are all based on providing 5-best phrase options from the KeywordAE and FillMask LLMs. To\nillustrate the effect of varying the number of LLM options, Fig. 2D plots the KSRs against the number of LLM options. Similar\nto the trend from Gboard, KSRs in SpeakFaster increased monotonically with the number of options, but started to level off\nat approximately five, which forms the basis for our UI design decision of including 5-best options (Fig. 1). Fig. 2E shows\nthat when conversational context was made available to the KeywordAE LLM (either v1 or v2), approximately two-thirds of\n5/28\nFigure 2. Simulation of phrase entry assisted by the Keyword Abbreviation Expansion (KeywordAE) and FillMask LLMs in\nSpeakFaster. A: Simulation Strategy 1: AE with only initials is followed by KeywordAE if the initials-only AE doesn\u2019t return\nthe desired phrase. Keyword AE in v1 iteratively spells out the first (leftmost) words in the best-matching phrase option until\nthe desired phrase is found. KeywordAE in v2 iteratively appends letters to the first (leftmost) incorrect word in the\nbest-matching phrase option. B: Simulation Strategy 2: same as Strategy 1, except that FillMask is used whenever only one\nincorrect word remains in the best-matching phrase. C: Keystroke saving rates (KSRs) from the simulation strategies,\ncompared with a forward-prediction baseline from Gboard (blue bar). The orange bars show the KSRs when conversational\ncontext is utilized, while the blue bars show the KSRs without utilizing conversational context. All data in this plot are based on\n5-best options from the KeywordAE and FillMask LLMs. D: the KSRs from Strategies 2, plotted as a function of the number\nof LLM options, in comparison with Gboard forward prediction. E: Fraction of dialogue turns that could be successfully\nentered with initials-only AE call, as a function of the number of options provided and the availability of conversational context.\nAll results in this figure are from simulations on the dialogue turns for which the sentence length was 10 or shorter (counting\nwords and mid-sentence punctuation) from the 280 dialogues in the test split of the Turk Dialogues (Corrected) dataset20,22.\n6/28\nthe dialogue turns in the test corpus could be found with only the initials-only AE call (i.e., a single LLM call). This fraction\nbecame approximately halved when the conversational context was unavailable, which again highlights the importance of\nconversational context to the predictive power of the LLMs.\nThe simulation results above show that the theoretical motor-action saving afforded by context-aware AE and FillMask\nsurpassed that of the traditional forward prediction by 30-40% (relative). This result builds on the previous AE LLM in Cai\net al. (2022) and goes a step further by supporting abbreviations that include spelled words (KeywordAE) and suggesting\nalternative words (FillMask), which removes \u201cdead ends\u201d, thus allowing any arbitrary phrase to be entered. However, as shown\nby prior studies8,13,19,24, the predictive power of motor action-saving features in text-entry UIs is often offset by the added\nvisual and cognitive burden involved in using these features, besides human errors such as misclicks and misspellings. Our\nsystem additionally involved network latencies due to calls to LLMs running in the cloud (see Supplementary Section A.3).\nTherefore, the practical performance of the LLM-powered abbreviation expansion-based text-entry paradigm in SpeakFaster\nmust be tested with empirical user studies. To this end we conducted a controlled lab study on a group of users typing manually\na mobile device as a pilot study of the novel text entry paradigm, followed by lab and field studies on two eye-gaze typing users\nwith ALS.\n4 User Studies\nWe tested the SpeakFaster text-entry UI with two groups of users. First, a group of non-disabled users typed with their hands on\na mobile touch-screen device running SpeakFaster powered by the KeywordAE v1 and FillMask LLMs. In a separate eye-gaze\nstudy, users with ALS who were experienced eye-gaze typers entered text by using eye-trackers integrated with SpeakFaster.\nThe mobile user study served as a pilot for the eye-gaze study by proving the learnability and practicality of the novel text-entry\nUI. A common goal of the two studies was to understand the cognitive and temporal cost introduced by the SpeakFaster UI\nand how that affects the overall text-entry rate compared to a conventional baseline. To study this under different levels of\nspontaneity and authoring task load, our study protocol consisted of both a scripted phase and an unscripted phase.\nThe scripted phase consisted of 10 dialogs from the test-split of the Turk Dialogues Corrected (TDC) corpus20,22. Each\ndialogue is a two-person conversation with a total of six turns, three uttered by each person. Our user study participant played\nthe role of one of the persons in the conversation, and the to-be-entered text was displayed to them close to their typing area. In\nthe unscripted phase, the user engaged in a set of five six-turn dialogues with the experimenter where only the starting question\nwas predetermined, and the rest was spontaneous but required the user to keep each conversation turn under ten words and\nnot include any personal information. The experimenter started with an open-ended question such as \u201cWhat kind of music do\nyou listen to?\u201d (see Section A.4 for the full list) and then the user would reply. The experimenter and user then followed up in\nalternating turns, until a total of six turns was reached for each dialogue. In both the scripted and unscripted phases, for each\nblock of five dialogues, the first and last dialogs formed the baseline, in which the user typed with the regular keyboard i.e.\neither Gboard in the mobile user study or the Tobii eye-gaze keyboard in the eye-gaze users study, utilizing word suggestions\nprovided by the default keyboard at will. In the other three dialogs, the user entered text by using the SpeakFaster UI, starting\nout with the initials-only abbreviation scheme and using any of the pathways to either spell out words (KeywordAE) or select\nreplacements (FillMask) as per their preference until they were satisfied.\nPrior to the data collection portion of the lab study, each user watched a video demonstration of the SpeakFaster system and\ntook a short practice run to familiarize themselves with the SpeakFaster UI and the abbreviation expansion text entry paradigm.\nEach mobile user study participant practiced a minimum of five practice dialogs. The content of these practice dialogs were\ndifferent from the ones used in the subsequent study blocks. Prior to the unscripted phase, the users were also familiarized with\nthe unscripted test condition through practicing a single dialog. The eye-gaze user practiced for four hours over two days and\nthis is described more in the Section A.4.\n7/28\nFigure 3. Text-entry rate (Panel A), the keystroke-saving rate (KSR, Panel B), the percentage of sentences that involved only a\nsingle AE server call (Panel C), and the percentage of FillMask responses that contain options selected by users (Panel D) from\nthe mobile study. In each plot, the two groups of bars correspond to the two posture groups (OneFinger and NoConstraint), as\nlabeled at the top. The error bars in these plots show 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the mean. Overall, the text entry speed\n(WPM) using SpeakFaster was not significantly different from the baseline despite introducing significant keystroke savings.\n4.1 Text-entry rate is comparable between SpeakFaster and baseline for mobile users\nIn order to study abbreviated text entry under different degrees of motor cost, the 19 participants who provided informed consent\nwere randomly assigned to two typing-posture groups in the mobile user study. Nine users were assigned to the one-finger\ngroup and instructed to type with only the index of their dominant hand (right hand for all these users). The remaining ten users\nwere assigned to the no-constraint group and were given no limitation related to typing posture. They all operated with both\nhands during the experiment, with varied posture details in which fingers or thumbs were used.\nIn the scripted portion of the user study, no significant difference was observed in the accuracy of text entry between\nSpeakFaster and the Gboard baseline. The average word error rates (WERs) of the OneFinger group were 1.55% and 2.53%\nunder the baseline and SpeakFaster conditions, respectively. For the NoConstraint group, the respective average WER were\n3.96% and 2.89%. A two-way linear mixed model (Posture \u00d7 UI) on the WERs showed no significant main effect by Posture\n(z=-1.758, p=0.079) or UI (z=0.079, p=0.250). Nor was there a significant interaction in WER between Posture and UI (z=1.516,\np=0.129).\nThe effect on text-entry rate by the LLM-powered SpeakFaster UI showed an intricate mixed pattern. While the text-entry\nrate saw increases on average under the SpeakFaster UI relative to the baseline (Gboard) UI during the scripted dialogs, the\naverage rate showed a decrease when the users engaged in unscripted dialogs. Analysis by a linear mixed model did not reveal\na significant main effect by UI (z=-0.959, p=0.338). However, a significant two-way interaction was found between UI and\nDialogType (z=2.933, p=0.003). Post hoc paired t-test confirmed a significant difference in the SpeakFaster-induced changes in\nthe text-entry rate (relative to baseline) between the scripted and unscripted dialogs (t=-4.85, p=0.00013). Specifically, while\nSpeakFaster increased the average rate by 2.510\u00b13.024 WPM (95% CI of mean, relative: 13.0%\u00b124.5%) under the scripted\ndialogs, it decreased the average rate by 3.494\u00b13.294 (relative: 10.2%\u00b125.0%) under the unscripted ones. The three-way\nlinear mixed model did not reveal any other significant main effects or interactions.\n8/28\nFigure 4. The top panel shows correlations between the average KSRs observed in the users (y-axis) and the KSRs from\noffline simulation (x-axis), on a turn-by-turn basis. The blue and orange dots correspond to the scripted and unscripted dialogs,\nrespectively. The simulation results are based on KeywordAE model v1, Strategy 2, five predictions, and using all previous\nturns of a dialog as the context. Each dot corresponds to a turn from one of the dialogs used as the text materials in the lab\nstudy. The bottom panel shows a comparison of the simulated KSR values from the scripted (blue) and unscripted (orange)\ndialog turns. The KSRs from the scripted turns were significantly higher than those from the unscripted ones (unpaired t-test:\nt=2.26, p=0.025).\n4.2 SpeakFaster enables significant keystrokes savings\nWhile the effect of SpeakFaster on the text-entry rate exhibited a complex pattern of interactions, showing an absence of overall\nsignificant change from the baseline, the keystroke-saving rate (KSR) was affected in a clearcut and pronounced manner by\nSpeakFaster (Fig. 3B). The same three-way linear mixed model, when applied on the KSR as the dependent variable, revealed a\nsignificant main effect by UI (z=10.317, p=6\u00d710\u221225). The linear mixed model revealed no other significant main effects or\ninteractions. Relative to the Gboard baseline, the SpeakFaster UI paradigm led to a large and significant increase in KSR for\nboth the scripted dialogs (+0.564\u00b10.080 abs., p=8.0\u00d710\u221211) and the unscripted ones (+0.450\u00b10.114 abs., p = 5.5\u00d710\u22127).\nPanel C of Fig. 3 shows the percentage of dialog turn in which the user successfully entered the sentence by using only\nthe initials-only AE call, i.e., without spelling out words in the abbreviation or using FillMask. As the orange bars show, the\npercentages were on par with the results from the simulation in the scripted dialogs (c.f. Fig. 2E). The percentages of sentences\nthat succeeded with a single AE call were lower for unscripted dialogs (magenta bars, 0.65 on average), reflecting the slight\ndomain mismatch in the unscripted text content from the scripted ones that the AE and FillMask models were trained on.\n4.3 Simulation accurately predicts users keystroke savings\nThe KSR values observed from the users in the lab study could be predicted with a considerable accuracy by the simulation\nresults. The blue dots in the top panel of Fig. 4 show a significant positive correlation between the average KSR values\nfrom all users and the simulated ones on a turn-by-turn basis among the scripted dialogs (Pearson\u2019s correlation: R=0.905,\np=3.096 \u00d7 10\u221223). The unscripted dialogs (orange dots) also exhibited a significant correlation between the simulated and\nobserved KSRs (R=0.636, p=1.616\u00d710\u221219). However, it can be seen that the users\u2019 average performance did not fully realize\nthe motor-saving potentials predicted by the offline simulations, as most data points in Fig. 4 fall below the line of equality (the\n9/28\nFigure 5. Temporal analyses of text entry in the SpeakFaster UI and the Gboard baseline in the mobile user study. A: the\ninter-keystroke intervals (IKIs), response times for selecting AE and FillMask (FM) options returned from the LLMs, and the\nlatencies of calls to cloud-based LLMs. The bars are organized into five groups. The first two groups are from the OneFinger\nposture group, showing scripted and unscripted dialogs, respectively. Likewise, the third and fourth groups show the results\nfrom the NoConstraint posture group. The fifth group shows LLM latencies. B: the response time for AE option selection\nshowed a clear increasing relation with the length of the underlying phrase, measured as number of words defined as the\ncharacter length of the phrase divided by 5.\nsolid diagonal line), potentially reflecting human errors such as typos and mis-operations, as well as the actions to recover\nfrom them. The degree to which the user behavior underperformed the simulation results was greater during the unscripted\ndialogs than the scripted ones. For example, several unscripted dialog turns showed negative KSRs, despite the fact that offline\nsimulation predicted positive KSRs based on the final committed sentences. This reflects greater revisions due to human errors\nand change-of-mind when the users operate under the dual cognitive load of formulating a dialogue response and operating the\nSpeakFaster UI in order to enter the response.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 4 shows that the simulated KSR values were significantly lower for the unscripted dialogs than\nthe scripted dialogs (mean: 0.527 vs. 0.650, -18.99% relative, unpaired t-test: p<0.05). This was likely due to a domain\nmismatch between the TDC dataset and the unscripted content composed by the users during the lab study. However, the fact\nthat SpeakFaster significantly boosted KSR even for the unscripted dialogs (Fig. 3) underlines the robustness of the motor\nsaving paradigm against domain shifts.\n4.4 Temporal aspects of user interactions in SpeakFaster\nFigure 5 shows the temporal aspects of how the mobile users interacted with the SpeakFaster UI. An inter-keystroke interval\n(IKI) is defined as the time interval between two consecutive keystrokes issued directly by the user using the soft keyboard\n(Gboard). IKIs exclude non-keystroke actions and the keystrokes automatically applied due to the user selecting options for\nword completion and predictions. The IKIs were significantly longer under the SpeakFaster UI than the baseline UI, showing\nthat it was slower on average for the users to plan and perform the keystrokes when typing the characters of the abbreviations\nand performing the keystrokes required for subsequent spelling of words than typing words in the familiar, sequential fashion (\nmain effect by UI: z=3.671, p=2.4\u00d710\u22124). The linear mixed model also identified a significant UI\u00d7DialogType interaction\n(z=2.303, p=0.021). A post hoc t-test confirmed that the increase in the IKI was greater under the unscripted dialogs (+381.1\n10/28\nms abs., 87.1% rel.) than under the scripted ones (+194.8 ms abs. 51.7% rel., p=0.0067). Similar to the observations related to\nKSRs above, this differential effect of SpeakFaster on IKI increase may be interpreted as the greater cognitive load under the\ndual task of composing a free-form dialog response and abbreviating the response in the SpeakFaster\u2019s abbreviation regime.\nThe dark and light gray bars in Panel A of Fig. 5 show the temporal metrics related to using the LLMs for the AE (including\nKeywordAE) and FillMask workflows, respectively. Compared with the latencies of the calls to the cloud-based LLMs (two\nrightmost bars in Panel A), the users\u2019 average response times in selecting the AE-suggested phrases and FillMask-suggested\nwords were 2-3 times longer. These response times not only exceeded the LLM latencies (by 2-3 times), but were also longer\nthan the average IKIs by 3-6 times, indicating that they were a significant component of the total time it took to use the\nSpeakFaster UI.\nThe average response times for AE were approximately twice as long as those for FM. This is attributable to the fact that\nthe AE options are multi-word phrases while the FillMask options are single words, which highlights an additional benefit of\nthe word-replacement interaction. As Fig. 5B shows, the AE response time showed a strong positive correlation with the length\nof the phrase (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1=0.428, p=2.5\u00d710\u221220). While selecting phrase options of length two words or shorter took only\napproximately 2,000 ms on average, selecting phrases eight words or longer took more than twice as long.\nThe results of the mobile user study showed that the new LLM-based SpeakFaster text entry UI led users to achieve savings\nin motor actions including keystrokes up to 50 percentage points (absolute) higher than the conventional way of mobile text\nentry. In terms of speed, the results were mixed. While in the scripted dialogue condition the users achieved an average of 13%\nspeedup, they showed a 10% slowdown under the unscripted condition, reflecting an interplay between the added cognitive\nload of using the new UI and that required to compose a spontaneous text message. Timing analysis revealed that reviewing\nthe phrase options from the KeywordAE LLM took about 3-6 times the average IKI; it took relatively less time to review\nthe word options in FillMask, but the review cost was still significant (2-3 times as long as the average IKI). These timing\nfindings highlight an important trade-off between the cost of reviewing LLM outputs and the savings in motor actions. Mobile\ntap-typing IKIs were relatively short (\u2248500 ms, Fig. 5A), which may mask the benefit due to the predictive power of the LLMs.\nHowever, in eye-gaze typing, the IKIs can be significantly longer, owing to the dwell time and the gaze travel time between\nkeys. These considerations indicate stronger potentials for acceleration in eye-gaze text entry than mobile text entry. With this\nhypothesis, we proceeded to study eye-gaze users\u2019 interaction with SpeakFaster.\n4.5 Eye-Gaze Users Study\nThe two study participants were both adult males diagnosed with ALS (17 and 11 years prior to the study, respectively)\nand provided informed consent before participating in this study. Both users were native speakers of American English and\nexperienced eye-gaze typists who communicate daily through eye trackers and associated keyboards. At the time of the\nstudy, both participants were quadriplegic, unable to speak, while retaining cognitive abilities within normal limits. Their eye\nmovements remained functional and cognitive abilities were within normal limits. They were experienced with the Tobii \u00ae\neye-gaze on-screen keyboard and its n-gram word competition and prediction features similar to Gboard. The first participant\nengaged in a controlled lab study (LP1) and the second in a field deployment to gather more naturalistic data (FP1).\nIn the controlled lab study, our participant (LP1) followed a structured study protocol consisting of a scripted part followed\nby an unscripted part identical to that of the mobile user study described above. However, LP1 used the KeywordAE v2 model,\nwhich supported partially-spelled keywords and triggered LLM calls for initials-only AE and KeywordAE after every keystroke,\neliminating the need for manual trigger of AE LLM calls as in the mobile user study. Prior to the data collections, the user\npracticed the SpeakFaster text entry paradigm under the direction of the experimenter for a total of 4.1 hours over two separate\ndays before the lab study, for which the learning curve can be found in Supplementary section A.4.\n4.6 SpeakFaster enables significant keystrokes savings and words per minute speed-up for eye-gaze users\nFigure 6A compares the mean text-entry rates in words per minute (WPM) between the SpeakFaster paradigm with the Tobii\nkeyboard baseline. Averaged over the scripted dialogues, the user achieved an average text-entry speed of 6.54 WPM while\n11/28\nFigure 6.

Panel A and B show the comparisons of the text-entry speed and keystroke saving rate (KSR) between SpeakFaster\u2019s\nAE UI and a forward prediction baseline based on the Tobii eye-gaze keyboard in the lab study participant LP1. Panel C and D\ncompares the text-entry rate and KSR of the field study participant FP1 while using SpeakFaster versus a Tobii keyboard\nbaseline, for both scripted dialogues and unscripted dialogues in a controlled lab study.

Note the different y scales between the panels.\nusing SpeakFaster, which exceeded the baseline typing speed (4.05 WPM) by 61.3% (two-sample t-test: t28 = 2.76, p = 0.011).\nA similar rate enhancement occurred for the unscripted dialogues (SpeakFaster: 6.38 WPM, baseline: 4.37 WPM, 46.4%\nincrease), although the difference did not reach significance (t-test: t13 = 0.818, p = 0.43). In addition to increased speed, a\nsignificant increase in the KSR was also observed for the user with SpeakFaster for both the scripted and unscripted dialogues.\nAgain, statistical significance was reached only for the scripted dialogues (0.360 vs. the baseline of 0.227, rank-sum test: \u03c1 =\n1.97, p = 0.049, Fig. 3B).\nIn the lab study, 77.8% of the scripted dialogues and 66.7% of the unscripted ones required only a single initials-only AE\nLLM call. For the trials in which LP1 used FillMask, the LLM predicted the correct words (as determined by user selection)\n58.3% of the time for the scripted dialogues and 21.4% of the time for the unscripted ones. Despite achieving success a majority\nof the time (58.3%), the FillMask LLM\u2019s success rate observed on LP1 on the scripted dialogues is lower than the success rate\npredicted from offline simulation (70.7%), indicating that the user occasionally failed to choose the correct words when they\nappeared. The fact that the success rate of the initial AE and FillMask was lower for unscripted dialogues reflects the domain\nmismatch between the user\u2019s personal vocabulary and the model\u2019s training corpus, highlighting personalization of the model as\na useful future direction.\nTo study the efficacy of the SpeakFaster paradigm under more natural usage, we conducted a field study with another\neye-gaze user (FP1). As we reported previously 15, FP1 showed an average eye-gaze text-entry speed of 8.1\u00b10.26 WPM\n(95% confidence interval) over a period of six months of measurement in his real-life communication with close relatives and\ncaregivers. This baseline speed of gaze typing is based on 856 utterances typed with the Tobii \u00ae Windows Control eye-gaze\nkeyboard with a PCEye Mini IS4 eye tracker. FP1 also engaged in test dialogues with an experimenter by using the SpeakFaster\n12/28\nFigure 7. Comparison of inter-keypress intervals, server latencies, and user-selection reaction times observed in the lab study\non user LP1. Panel A compares the inter-keystroke intervals (IKIs) of LP1\u2019s eye-gaze keypresses, the time it took the user to\nselect LLM-provided options for KeywordAE and FillMask, and the server latencies (including network latencies) for the LLM\ncalls. Panel B shows breakdown of the amount of time spent on different tasks under the baseline and SpeakFaster typing\nconditions, observed in the eye-gaze user LP1 (two bars at the top) and the average over the 19 mobile-study users (two bars at\nthe bottom). Only the data from the scripted typing condition are shown for clarity. The color code of the bar segments is\nomitted in the bottom two bars due to space limit, but is identical as that of the top two bars.\nUI based on KeywordAE v1 and manual triggering of LLM calls for AE. Over the 27 phrases entered with SpeakFaster on six\ndifferent days, the user achieved an average speed of 10.4\u00b12.6 WPM, which is 28.8% faster than the daily baseline (two-sample\nt-test: t881 = 2.97, p = 3.1\u00d710\u22123, Fig. 6C). Accompanying this increase in the average speed of text entry was an increase of\nkeystroke saving rate (KSR) from -0.14 to 0.32 (rank-sum test: \u03c1 = 4.37, p = 1.21\u00d710\u22125, Fig. 6D).\n4.7 Motor savings outweigh cognitive overhead for eye-gaze typing\nThe latencies for the AE calls were 843.0\u00b155.4 ms and 832.7\u00b1120.4 ms (95% CI of mean) for the scripted and unscripted\ndialogues, respectively (Fig. 7A). The latencies of the FillMask calls were shorter (scripted: 617.9\u00b141.8 ms; unscripted:\n745.2\u00b167.1 ms) than AE, due to its serving configuration that took advantage of the shorter output lengths (Supplementary\nsection A.3). These LLM-serving latencies were approximately four times shorter than the average eye-gaze IKIs measured on\nuser LP1 (Fig. 7A, blue and orange bars, 3,511 - 4,952 ms) and therefore had only a minor slowing effect on the text-entry rate\nof eye-gaze typers. In comparison, the time it took the user to select the correct AE responses was significantly longer (Fig. 4B:\nscripted: 12,732\u00b15,207 ms; unscripted: 21,225\u00b119,807 ms), which was 3-6 times the average duration of a keypress, reflecting\nthe significant cost for scanning the phrase options from the AE calls. By contrast, FillMask involved a much shorter (2-3x)\ncandidate selection time than AE (Fig. 4B: scripted: 7,032\u00b14,584 ms; unscripted: 4,745\u00b12,023 ms), reflecting the benefit of\nthe FillMask interaction in providing shorter, single-word candidates, which reduced the scanning cost.\nCompared with the average IKI in mobile users (Fig. 5), these IKIs from the eye-gaze typist shown in Fig. 7A were 3 -\n6 times longer. This provides insight as to why SpeakFaster leads to a significant speed up for eye-gaze typists in this study\nwhile introducing minimal changes among the participants in mobile user study described above. Specifically, Panel B of\n13/28\nFig. 7 shows a breakdown of the time intervals spent on several different types of actions during the baseline typing condition\nand SpeakFaster typing condition, as shown by different colors. The overhead of using SpeakFaster is broken down into the\nLLM latencies, the actions involved in using KeywordAE (entering the spelling mode, selecting a word to spell, as well as\nreviewing and selecting phrase options) and those involved in using FillMask (entering the FillMask mode, selecting the target\nword, as well as review and selecting word options). Among these subtypes of overhead, the LLM latencies were a relatively\nminor factor. The total overhead (1,735 ms/word) came close to the time spent on keystrokes (2,252 ms/word) for mobile users.\nA similar overhead is seen in the eye-gaze user (5,213 ms/word). However, this overhead was made up for by the dramatic\nreduction in time spent on keystrokes for the eye-gaze user (11,189 ms), leading to a reduction in the overall time on a per\nword basis. By contrast, the mobile users only showed a more modest average reduction of time spent on keystrokes (1,416\nms/word), which was insufficient to fully offset the increased overhead. This was largely due to the fact that the average IKIs\nwere already much shorter during mobile typing than in eye-gaze typing.\nIn summary, the quantitative measurements of eye-gaze typing in both users found a significant advantage of the SpeakFaster\nUI of text input compared to the baseline of conventional eye-typing systems with forward-prediction. The evidence is seen\nboth in a controlled lab setting and a field study in comparison with a real-life, long-term baseline.\n5 Discussion\nAbbreviation expansion of phrases in user-input history has long existed as a feature of eye-gaze AAC software, in addition\nto being seen in non-AAC applications such as text messaging, and hence is familiar to users of such systems. SpeakFaster\nbuilds on this user knowledge, while drastically extending its breadth to open-ended phrases including previously-untyped\nphrases by using contextualized predictions from fine-tuned LLMs. Our demonstration of accelerated text entry focused on\neye-gaze typing for motor-impaired users. However, the same LLM-based paradigm can be extended to other modalities of text\nentry in the AAC realm. For instance, SpeakFaster\u2019s AE and FillMask design should serve to reduce the number of scans and\nselections required for text entry based on switch scanning, a type of user interface suitable for users who are unable to use eye\ntracking devices due to more pronounced motor impairments25. Similarly, BCI-based text entry, including techniques based on\nmotor imagery from surgical implants4,26 and the noninvasive techniques based on visual-evoked potentials7 could benefit from\nthe same greater predictive power of LLMs. Furthermore, for users without disabilities, constraints such as small screens and\nsituational impairments27,28 may also render the temporal and motor cost of text entry high, in which case it will be interesting\nto explore the LLM-based techniques such as shown in the current study for motor savings and temporal acceleration. Such\nenvisioned applications of the SpeakFaster paradigm remain to be investigated and confirmed in future studies.\n5.1 Relation to C-PAK (Correcting and completing variable-length Prefix-based Abbreviated Keys) paradigm\nOur abbreviation-based writing scheme can be viewed as an implementation of the C-PAK (Correcting and completing\nvariable-length Prefix-based Abbreviated Keys) text-input paradigm24. Compared to traditional forward predictions, C-PAK\nfurther exploits the redundancy and compressibility of text through the realization that the information that helps predicting a\nword is present not only in its preceding words (left context), but also in the words that follow it (right context), an insight\nshared with bidirectional neural LMs such as BERT15. PhraseWriter, the first implementation of C-PAK, used count-based\nn-gram language models with narrow context windows. In a lab study, users of PhraseWriter showed lower average text-entry\nrate than a non-abbreviation-based Gboard baseline, which was attributable to the limited abbreviation-expansion accuracy and\ntherefore frequent revisions through backspace and re-typing24. To our knowledge, this study demonstrated acceleration of\ntext-entry in the C-PAK paradigm for the first time through the enhanced text entry rates, i.e., in the two eye-gaze users. The\nresults in this study also push forward the pareto frontier of the KSR-accuracy tradeoff relation demonstrated by Adhikary\net al.29, for both typing on mobile devices and with eye gaze. This acceleration was brought about by combining the greater\ncontext awareness of the LLM-based abbreviation expansion and a UI design that allows initial AE failures to be repaired\nwithout the costly use of delete or backspace keys. Featuring its affordances for spelling words and finding alternative words,\n14/28\nthe SpeakFaster UI allows users to expend minimal motor effort when the intended phrase couldn\u2019t be found with the initial\nabbreviation. It should be noted that the KSR achieved by the eye-gaze typists were in the range of 0.32 to 0.36. Despite\nsignificantly exceeding the KSR from their baseline typing paradigm, these KSRs still showed a significant gap from the\noffline simulation results (which exceeded 0.6). This was due to the unavoidable user errors when operating the SpeakFaster\nUI, such as mistakes and typos when entering the initials-only abbreviation and spelling out keywords, as well as mistakes\nwhen selecting phrase options from KeywordsAE and FillMask. These findings show that future work on improving the error\ntolerance of the LLMs is a fruitful future direction in further improving the speed of such abbreviation-based text entry UIs.\nIn addition to per-word abbreviations, previous studies have also explored expanding bags of keywords into full phrases\nusing AI (e.g., KWickChat30). Compared to KWickChat, which converts a bag of content words into full phrases, SpeakFaster\nopts to give users finer-grained control on exact sentence structure and wording. Two aspects of the SpeakFaster UI can be\nextended to bags of keywords. In particular, KWickChat can allow users to provide more keywords if the initial bag of keywords\nfailed to yield the intended phrase; word replacement similar to FillMask also may also fit the KWickChat design.\n5.2 Length of suggestions\nCan AE become a part of the conventional sequential typing, so that users can use AE when so desired and revert back to\ntyping letter-by-letter otherwise? The answer to this question hinges on whether sentence-level abbreviations consisting of\nword initials (e.g., \"iipitb\") can be reliably distinguished from non-abbreviated words. Another important factor that needs to be\ntaken into consideration is the size of the screen. Small screens limit not just the number of options that can be surfaced, but\nalso the length of the expanded text. This can introduce secondary effects wherein editing or correcting for errors in a smaller\nscreen can be much more demanding and difficult. Thus sentence level expansion may be even less preferred.\n5.3 Tuning vs. prompting\nThe current SpeakFaster system relies on two fine-tuned LLMs to reliably and accurately suggest text expansions. However,\nwith remarkable improvements the field is seeing (e.g., GPT-4) it\u2019s conceivable that such expansions could simply be enabled\nby a single LLM and perhaps with no necessity for fine-tuning e.g., with prompt-tuning or even just good prompt engineering.\nThis could make it much easier to develop SpeakFaster-like text-entry applications in the future.\n5.4 Latency and internet access\nCurrent LLMs are large in parameter count and the amount of computation required during inference, and thus can only be\nserved on large dedicated servers. This necessitates the mobile and AAC devices to have access to the Internet. Further, with\nmobile text-entry applications, latency is an important consideration. As noted before, in our case latency to query the server\nwill be a factor. With recent advances in open source LLMs (e.g., LLAMA31) and software for faster inference of LLM on\nlocal devices (e.g., GGML32), in the near future, smaller more efficient models will be able to perform similarly.\n5.5 Cognitive overhead\nAs seen in Fig. 5 the current SpeakFaster UI leads to significant cognitive overhead for users, since they face burdens from\nmultiple aspects of the task that do not exist in traditional sequential typing. This includes the mental conversion of the intended\nphrase into first-letter initialism, reviewing and selecting phrase and word options predicted by the LLMs, and deciding the next\naction (e.g., spelling vs. FillMask). While our abbreviation scheme is still simple, presence of contracted phrases (e.g., \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d,\n\u201cwe\u2019ll\u201d) could take some time for users to adapt, and it would also be difficult to potentially correct abbreviations if the user\ndidn\u2019t keep track of every word in a sentence. It remains to be seen though if things would change considerably with much\nlonger term usage. However, the cognitive overhead appears to be within manageable bounds for our intended users, which is\nsupported by the fact that all the users in our mobile user study and both eye-gaze users with ALS were able to learn the novel\nUI within the duration of the study sessions (see Supplementary Section A.5 for more details).\n15/28\n5.6 Limitations and future directions\nOur KeywordAE LLM used in this study did not incorporate tolerance for typos in its input abbreviations1. Whether such\ntolerance benefits the usability and text-entry rate remains to be investigated in future studies. The SpeakFaster prototype\nreported in this study was created for English. However, the multilingual nature of today\u2019s LLMs (e.g., LaMDA14, PaLM33,\nand OPT34) opens the door to extending the prototype to other languages. The extension to alphabet-based languages such\nas most European languages should be relatively straightforward and can be based on a similar UI design. Application on\nnon-alphabet languages such as Chinese and languages that use mixed character sets such as Japanese are more complex and\nrequire additional considerations. However, it is worth noting that the \u201cJi\u02c7anp\u00af\u0131n\u201d input paradigm, where the romanized form\n(Pinyin) of each Chinese character is abbreviated as one or more initial letters, is similar to the SpeakFaster UI design and\nformed an original inspiration for the more general C-PAK paradigm.\nSeveral limitations of the current study remain to be improved upon by future studies. First, the SpeakFaster prototype we\ntested limited the phrases to ten words and mid-sentence punctuation or shorter. While this length limit is sufficient to capture\na majority of sentences used in daily communication, the design must be extended to longer phrase length limits to support\ngreater flexibility and expressiveness in the future. This extension requires improvements in both the underlying LLM and\nUI design, as multiple candidates of longer sentences cannot fit easily onto available screen area. Second, the acceleration\nachieved in this study was based on the assumption that the broader conversational context (words spoken by the eye-gaze user\u2019s\nconversation partner) is available to the LLMs. The practicality of this context awareness for real-life AAC communication\nawaits further investigation integrating technical perspective35 and privacy considerations6.\n6 Conclusion\nTyping letter-by-letter on an on-screen keyboard by eye-gaze tracking is a non-invasive means of communication used by\npeople with severe motor impairments such as in ALS. The SpeakFaster project showed that the efficiency of such a practical\nparadigm of communication can be improved by an abbreviation-expansion (AE) system powered by two fine-tuned LLMs. In\nthis system, the user first types the sentence initials which get expanded to five candidate sentences by the initials AE model. If\nthe intended sentence is not found, the system enables two revision methods: incremental spelling of words (KeywordAE) and\nselecting from alternative words (FillMask). After confirming the usability of the system by employing able-bodied users on\na mobile device, we obtained test results from eye-gaze typers with ALS showing that such users could indeed understand\nthe UI design intentions, take advantage of the predictive power of the LLMs fine-tuned to the AE tasks, reduce the number\nof keystrokes entered by 14-46 absolute percentage points, and improve their typing speed by 29-60%. Greater speed gain\nwas observed in the eye-gaze users than the mobile users, which was attributable to the greater benefit of motor savings in the\nformer group of users than the latter under a trade-off relation with increased cognitive load of using the LLM-powered UI. The\nwork shows that fine-tuned large language models integrated with UI design could bring real benefits to people with severe\nmotor and speech impairments.\n7 Acknowledgements\nMahima Pushkarna assisted with the design of the SpeakFaster UI.

LaMDA was implemented in the Lingvo36\nframework which was in turn based on TensorFlow37. The base LaMDA consisted of 32 transformer1 layers (embedding and\nmodel dimensions: 8,192, feed-forward dimensions: 65,536, number of attention heads per layer: 128; activation function:\nReLU) and was pre-trained for the next-token prediction objective on a large-scale text corpus containing 1.56 trillion tokens\nfrom a mixture of public web text and public dialogues14. LaMDA used a SentencePiece tokenizer38 with a vocabulary size of\n32,000. To optimize serving efficiency (see Section A.3), we fine-tuned two models for the KeywordAE and FillMask tasks\nseparately.\nThe KeywordAE models were fine-tuned on data synthesized from four publicly-available dialogue datasets. These were\nthe same dialogue datasets as used in Cai et al.20. Each dialogue in the datasets consisted of a number of turns, yielding multiple\nexamples for LLM fine-tuning and evaluation. Given a turn of a dialogue, we synthesized an example with three parts: Context,\nShorthand, and the Full phrase. The context consisted of the previous turns of the dialogue, separated by the curly braces\nas delimiters. All turns of a dialogue except the first turn were associated with a non-empty context. The shorthand was an\nabbreviated form of the full text generated from SpeakFaster\u2019s abbreviation rules. The three types of abbreviations that we\nincluded in the LLM fine-tuning are listed below.\n1. Initials-only abbreviation: Abbreviating each word as the initial letter in a case-insensitive fashion (e.g., \u201cI saw him\nplaying in the bedroom\u201d \u2212\u2192 \u201cishpitb\u201d). Sentence-final punctuation was omitted, while sentence-middle punctuation\n(most commonly the comma) was preserved in the abbreviation (e.g., \u201cok, sounds good\u201d \u2212\u2192 \u201co,sd\u201d). These aspects of the\nabbreviation scheme were identical to our previous report20. However, to make the abbreviation rules easier to learn and\nmemorize for users, the current study simplified the rule regarding contracted words, wherein a contracted word was\nabbreviated as only its initial (e.g., \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d \u2212\u2192 \u201cy\u201d instead of \u201cyr\u201d as in the previous work20).\n2. Abbreviations with complete keywords: These abbreviations contained one or more words completely spelled out,\nembedded in the initials-only abbreviation for the remaining words while respecting the original word order. For example,\n\u201cI saw him playing in the bedroom\u201d may be abbreviated as \u201cishpit bedroom\u201d, where the last word \u201cbedroom\u201d is spelled\nout. The same phrase may also be abbreviated as \u201ci saw hpit bedroom\u201d, where both the 2nd and last words are spelled\nout. They enabled users to find phrases that couldn\u2019t be expanded correctly based on the initials alone, which tend to be\nlonger and less-predictable phrases.\n3. Abbreviations with incomplete keywords: Similar to abbreviations with complete keywords, but allowing the keywords\nto be partially written. Compared to complete keywords, incomplete keywords afforded additional keystroke saving\nby further exploiting the redundancy and compressibility of written text. The fine-tuning of LaMDA incorporated two\nforms of incomplete keywords: prefix and consonant. In the prefix abbreviation scheme, a word can be abbreviated as a\nsequence of two or more characters that is a prefix of the word. For example, the word \u201cbedroom\u201d may be abbreviated\nas \u201cbe\u201d, leading to the phrase abbreviation \u201cishpit be\u201d. The consonant scheme omitted vowel letters (\u201ca\u201d, \u201ce\u201d, \u201ci\u201d, \u201co\u201d,\nand \u201cu\u201d) if they were not at the beginning of a word and kept only the first few non-vowel letters, leading to a phrase\nabbreviation such as \u201cishpit bd\u201d where \u201cbd\u201d is the shorthand for the word \u201cbedroom\u201d. The SpeakFaster UI tested in the\nuser studies, however, only supported the prefix scheme for the sake of simplicity.\nTo synthesize examples for abbreviations with complete keywords, we determined the number of keywords in a sentence\nby using a uniform distribution [1, 3], while ensuring that at least one word of the sentence is preserved as a non-keyword\n(the initial). To synthesize examples for abbreviations with incomplete keywords, we randomly selected the number of\nkeywords from a sentence by using the [1, 5] uniform distribution, also ensuring that not all words of a sentence are selected\n19/28\nDialogue\nAbbreviation keyword\n#(examples), tokens/example\nCorpus\ntype or FillMask\nTrain\nDev\nTest\nTurk Dialogues Corrected (TDC)22\n(i) Initials-only\n8,590, 50.5\u00b121.3\n2,800, 50.6\u00b121.4\n2,800, 51.1\u00b121.9\n(ii) Complete\n7,948, 51.5\u00b121.4\n2,569, 51.7\u00b121.6\n2,545, 52.1\u00b121.9\n(iii) Incomplete\n15,158, 60.3\u00b122.4\n4,902, 60.3\u00b122.9\n4,898, 60.5\u00b122.9\n(iv) FillMask\n8,584, 46.2\u00b119.7\n2,800, 46.5\u00b120.0\n2,798, 46.8\u00b120.3\nTurk AAC39\n(i) Initials-only\n5,019, 21.5\u00b15.3\n559, 22.1\u00b15.5\n565, 21.0\u00b15.0\n(ii) Complete\n4,352, 22.9\u00b15.1\n490, 23.3\u00b15.3\n488, 22.3\u00b14.8\n(iii) Incomplete\n7,960, 29.9\u00b18.1\n904, 30.4\u00b18.5\n856, 29.0\u00b17.9\n(iv) FillMask\n5,019, 19.4\u00b12.8\n559, 19.7\u00b12.9\n565, 19.2\u00b12.6\nDailyDialog Corrected40\n(i) Initials-only\n123,650, 86.1\u00b170.4\n9,233, 84.4\u00b166.4\n8,318, 82.8\u00b164.0\n(ii) Complete\n99,202, 87.6\u00b169.6\n7,334, 85.9\u00b164.9\n6,612, 84.7\u00b163.3\n(iii) Incomplete\n196,286, 95.6\u00b1701.3\n14,588, 93.8\u00b166.0\n13,198, 92.4\u00b163.7\n(iv) FillMask\n123,426, 82.2\u00b169.7\n9,211, 80.4\u00b165.7\n8,306, 79.0\u00b163.2\nCornell Movie Dialogues41\n(i) Initials-only\n327,569, 63.1\u00b164.0\n41,636, 60.7\u00b160.3\n36,772, 64.4\u00b168.2\n(ii) Complete\n241,115, 67.4\u00b165.1\n30,268, 64.8\u00b160.4\n26,464, 68.8\u00b168.0\n(iii) Incomplete\n472,746, 74.8\u00b165.7\n59,124, 72.3\u00b161.2\n52,380, 75.7\u00b167.4\n(iv) FillMask\n323,834, 60.0\u00b163.2\n41,030, 57.8\u00b159.5\n36,057, 61.1\u00b167.0\nTable 1.

For a given word selected as the incomplete keywords, we limit the number of letters in its abbreviation to NL,\nwith NL following a uniform distribution [2, 5]. An equal number of examples were synthesized for the prefix and consonant\nincomplete-keyword schemes. Table 1 summarizes the number of unique examples used in the fine-tuning of the KeywordAE\nLLMs. For KeywordAE v1, only the initials-only and complete-keyword examples were used; for KeywordAE v2, the dataset\nadditionally included the incomplete-keyword examples, in order to support partially-spelled keywords.\nFine-tuning of the AE model was performed on 32 Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v3 chips connected in a 4x8\ntopology42. A maximum input length of 2,048 tokens was used. The training used a per-host batch size of 16 and a shared\nAdaFactor optimizer43 under a fixed learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125. The checkpoint for subsequent serving and evaluation was\nselected on the basis of minimal cross-entropy loss on the dev set, which occurred at fine-tuning step 12,600.\nTo quantify the accuracy of the fine-tuned LaMDA on the AE task with the three types of abbreviation mentioned above,\nwe evaluated the exact-match accuracy among top-5 predictions. For each AE input, 128 outputs were sampled from the\ntemperature-based sampling if the total number of initials and keywords in the abbreviation was \u22645, else it was 256. The\nexact match was determined after text normalization including whitespace standardization, folding to lowercase, and omitting\nsentence-final punctuation. The sampling was based on a temperature of 1.0, which was determined on the Dev split to be the\noptimal sampling temperature value for AE. Panel A of Fig. 9 shows the evaluation results on the 2nd turn of the dialogues by\nusing the first turn as the context. The general trends of relation between AE accuracy with abbreviation type and length is\nsimilar for other turns of the dialogues and when no dialogue context was used. On average, with initials-only abbreviation,\n20/28\nFigure 8. Abbreviation schemes by examples. On the left we show a sample dialogue from the Turk Dialogues Corrected\n(TDC) dataset, which consists of six turns between two interlocutors. On the right we show instances of individual examples\ngenerated from the dialogue, used for training the KeywordAE and FillMask models. The three AE examples vary in their\nabbreviation scheme. The first one consists of an initials-only abbreviation, i.e., without any spelled keywords. The second one\nconsists of a complete (fully-spelled) keyword. The third one contains two incomplete (partially-spelled) keywords. The\n\u201cShorthand\u201d parts of the training examples contain the space character inserted between the letters and keywords that comprise\nthe abbreviation, a trick employed to improve LaMDA fine-tuning accuracy by extracting more consistent tokenization from the\nunderlying SentencePiece tokenizer38. The underscores for the complete and incomplete keywords are added only in this figure\nfor visual clarity. The FillMask example at the bottom shows an instance of no-context example. The actual dataset contains\nboth no-context examples and examples with previous turns of the dialogues as context. In these examples shown, the text in\nblack is the inputs to the LLMs, while the text in blue is the targets that the LLMs are trained to generate. The colors are added\nonly for visual clarity of presentation in this figure.\n21/28\n72.6% and 76.3% of the sentences could be expanded into the exact-matching phrase (the single data point labeled blue in\nFig. 9, Panel A) based on the v1 and v2 models, respectively. As expected and shown by the curves in Fig. 9A, incorporating\nkeywords (both complete or incomplete) in the abbreviation progressively increased the percentage of successful expansion.\nThe amount of improvement shows a monotonic relation with both the number of keywords and the number of characters\nused to represent each keyword. The v1 model showed slightly better accuracy over the v2 model for the initials-only and\ncomplete-keyword cases, which may be due to the v1 model\u2019s specialization on the more limited input format that doesn\u2019t\ninclude partially-spelled keywords.\nTo quantitatively illustrate the benefits of dialogue context, a similar evaluation was performed on all six turns of the TDC\ndialogues (test split), with and without dialogue context. The accuracies are plotted as a function of dialogue turn number in\nPanel B of Fig. 9. Comparing the sets of blue and orange curves, we see a clear and substantial boost to the v2 KeywordAE\nmodel\u2019s accuracy due to the dialogue context, which reflects the reduction in the space of possible phrases (given abbreviation)\nresulting from contextualizing on the previous turns of a dialogue. The panel also shows that this boost of dialogue context is\nseen for all three styles of abbreviations: initials-only, incomplete keywords, and complete keywords. The latter two show\nadditional accuracy enhancement on top of the contextual boost, reflecting the expected trend that the fine-tuned LaMDA model\npredicts phrases more accurately when more characters become available, regardless of whether these additional characters\nform complete words. The effect of context and dialogue turns on the v1 KeywordAE model (the black and red curves in\nFig. 9B), which doesn\u2019t not support incomplete keywords, closely resembles those on the v2 model.\nPanel C of Fig. 9 shows the relation between AE accuracy and length of the phrase. We see a general decreasing trend for\nthe accuracy of AE with increasing phrase length for initials-only AE, as well as incomplete and complete keywords. We can\nalso see a strong trend in which augmenting the abbreviations with more characters, in the form of incomplete or complete\nkeywords, boosts accuracy for all phrase lengths. The relations between AE accuracy and phrase length are similar between the\nv1 and v2 KeywordAE models.\nThese results form the basis for designing the SpeakFaster UI (Fig. 1) that allows users to amend abbreviations that fail AE\nby using more and more characters. The fact that even with five fully-spelled keywords, only 93.1% of the phrases could be\nexpanded correctly is one of the motivations for allowing the user to use the additional remedying approach of FillMask and the\never-existing option of spelling out the words in full in the SpeakFaster UI.\nTo fine-tune LaMDA on the FillMask task, we use the same four public dialogue datasets as above. However, instead of\nincluding abbreviated forms of the phrases, we synthesized examples of a phrase with a single word masked, followed by the\nground truth word. Therefore, instead of triplets of context-shorthand-full in the AE fine-tuning, the FillMask fine-tuning was\nbased on context-phrase-word triplets such as (see also bottom right of Fig. 8):\nContext: {Been sitting all day. Work was just one meeting after another.} Phrase: {Oh, I\u2019m s_.} Word: {sorry}\nIn the example above, \u201csorry\u201d is the masked word. The \u201cPhrase\u201d part contains the masked word with its initial letter\nembedded in the context words in the correct order. These examples for FillMask avoided masking words that start with a\nnumber or a punctuation mark. Based on evaluation on the Dev split, we determined the optimal sampling temperature of the\nFillMask to be 2.0, which was higher than the optimal sampling temperature for KeywordAE (1.0).\nFigure 10 shows the results of evaluating the accuracy of the fine-tuned FillMask LaMDA model on sentences with randomly\nselected and masked words from the test split of the TDC dataset. Stop words (i.e., high-frequency words such as \u201cthe\u201d and\n\u201cfor\u201d) have significantly higher prediction accuracy than non-stop words. As in the AE evaluation results (cf. Fig. 9, Panels\nA - B), incorporating conversational context increased the FillMask accuracy for both the stop and non-stop word categories.\nHowever, the benefit of context was much more pronounced for non-stop words (7 - 11 percentage points) than for stop words\n(\u22641 percentage points).\nA.2 Detailed offline simulation results\nThe simulation results shown in the main article were based on utilizing all available conversational context. Specifically, when\nperforming AE or FillMask on the n-th turn of a dialogue in the TDC corpus (test split) that we use for simulation, the 1st\n22/28\nFigure 9. Exact-match accuracy of the fine-tuned LaMDAs for abbreviation expansion, evaluated on the test split of the TDC\ncorpus, under different levels of phrase and word-level abbreviation types and different amounts of dialogue context. The\nresults are evaluated on the sentences from the test split of the Turk Dialogues Corrected (TDC) corpus for sentences of ten or\nfewer words and mid-sentence punctuation marks. The error bars who \u00b11 SD around the mean for 3 repeated evaluation runs.\nThe single data point on the left plots the exact-match AE accuracy with initials-only abbreviations (i.e., no keyword). A: The\nfive curves show the AE accuracy when different numbers of keywords (from 1 to 5) are included in the abbreviation, with the\nkeywords chosen at random. The x-axis is the limit on the length of each potentially-incomplete keyword, so that the rightmost\ntwo ticks (labeled \u201cNo limit (v2)\u201d and \u201cNo limit (v1)\u201d) correspond to using only complete keywords in the abbreviations. The\ncomplete-keyword accuracy of the dedicated v1 model slightly beat that of the v2 model. B: Representative relations between\nthe accuracy of AE and dialogue turn number in a six-turn dialogue in the style of the TDC corpus, and how the relation is\naffected by the amount of dialogue context used when invoking the fine-tuned LaMDA for AE. For the orange curves, all\nprevious dialogue turns were included as the context (e.g., when performing AE on dialogue turn #4, the content of the first\nthree turns were used as the context). In each set of curves, three curves are shown, for initials-only AE, incomplete keyword\nAE (limiting keyword length to two characters, and complete keyword AE). The sets of blue and orange curves show the v2\nmodel\u2019s accuracies without and with dialogue context, respectively. For comparison the accuracies of the v1 model for\ncomplete keywords are also shown (in black and red). C: AE accuracy as a function of phrase length as measured by the\ninitials-only abbreviation length of a phrase (i.e., the number of words plus the number of mid-sentence punctuation). The first\nthree different bar colors show the AE accuracies based on initials-only abbreviations, abbreviations with a single incomplete\nkeyword limited to 2-character length, and a complete keyword, when used as input for the v2 model. The remaining bar color\nshows accuracies of the v1 model under complete keywords for comparison.\n23/28\nFigure 10. Exact-match accuracy of the fine-tuned LaMDA for FillMask task, evaluated on the test split of the TDC corpus,\nunder different amounts of dialogue context for predicting masked stop words and non-stop words. The results are evaluated on\nthe same sentences used for the evaluation of the fine-tuned LaMDA for abbreviation expansion. The results are plotted\nsimilarly to Figure 9 Panel B. In each set of blue or orange curves, a curve is shown for the accuracy of predicting masked stop\nwords and non-stop words, respectively.\nthrough (n-1)-th turns of the dialogues are fed to the fine-tuned LLMs to provide them with the maximal context for performing\ntheir respective inference tasks. However, in real-life situations, due to the constraints related to privacy, system capabilities,\nand the modality of text and speech communication, the contextual information may not always be available or accurate. The\norange curve in Figure 11 shows the KSR when no conversational context is used for inference with the fine-tuned LLMs, which\nshow substantial decreases (10 percentage points or more) compared to the corresponding KSRs obtained under full context.\nThis pattern is seen for all three simulation strategies (1, 2, and 2A), which were based on different degrees of utilization\nof the keyword AE and FillMask features. This observation corroborates the aforementioned evaluation results on the AE\nand FillMask models in emphasizing the benefit of wider context in LLM-based communication UIs. However, note that\nSpeakFaster provided higher KSRs than Gboard\u2019s forward word prediction even when no wider conversational context was\navailable.\nA.3 Serving of large language models\nDuring the simulations and user studies, for both KeywordAE and FillMask, the fine-tuned LLMs were served with 16 Google\nTPU v3 chips[5] in a 4x4 configuration. To increase inference speed, we performed post-training quantization to the bfloat16\ndtype15 on both the KeywordAE and FillMask LaMDA models. The served KeywordAE and FillMask models were configured\nto a maximum input length of 128 SentencePiece tokens4, which was sufficient to accommodate up to five contextual dialogue\nturns, each consisting of ten or fewer words for all the test dialogues used in the lab study with LP1. SentencePiece tokens are\nvariable length tokens learned from the training corpus. Short and frequent words such as \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d are single tokens,\nwhile longer and less frequent tokens such as \u201cunderstanding\u201d are split as two or more tokens. The AE model was served with a\nmaximum decoder step of 20 tokens, which is sufficient to capture the vast majority of phrases with ten or fewer words and\nmid-sentence punctuation. To serve the FillMask model, however, we exploited the fact that the output of the model is a single\nword and hence could use a smaller value for maximum decoder steps (6) to achieve a shorter serving latency.\n24/28\nFigure 11. Comparing the keystroke saving rate (KSR) from simulations ran on three different use strategies of SpeakFaster\nas well as the Gboard baseline. The results shown in this figure are based on presenting top-5 options from AE, FillMask, and\nGboard word suggestions. The blue curve shows the KSR values obtained from full utilization of conversation context by the\nAE and FillMask models of SpeakFaster, i.e., all the previous turns of a dialogue. It does not contain data for Gboard because\nGboard\u2019s n-gram model does not utilize the previous dialogue turns. The orange curve shows the results obtained from not\nutilizing the conversation context.\nA.4 User study design and details\nThe mobile and eye-gaze user studies were based on the same user-interface code base, available in open source at https:\n//github.com/TeamGleason/SpeakFaster/tree/main/webui.\nThe mobile user study consisted of 19 participants. Ten participants were recruited from employees of Google working\nat its Cambridge, MA office; the remaining nine participants were recruited from the Boston area. They were all adults\nwith associate-level education or higher and were speakers of American English. During a user-study session, the user was\ncomfortably seated, facing a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 10.4-inch tablet placed in a stable level position on a tabletop. The device\nremained in landscape orientation. It presented the SpeakFaster UI running as an app at the top half of the screen and Gboard at\nthe bottom half. Both SpeakFaster and Gboard were displayed along the full width of the tablet screen.\nIn the lab studies (including the mobile user study sessions and the session with the eye-gaze lab study participant), the\nten scripted dialogues were arranged in two blocks. During the first block of five dialogues, the user played the role of the\nsecond interlocutor and entered the text for the 2nd, 4th, and 6th turns. In the second block of five dialogues, the user played\nthe role of the first interlocutor and entered the text for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th turns. The ordering of the ten dialogs used in the\nfirst two blocks were randomized on a user-by-user basis. Following the scripted phase was an unscripted phase to measure the\nperformance in a spontaneous text entry task in which the user typed their intended phrases instead of prescribed ones.\nDuring the lab study, the experimenter operated a companion web application on a laptop to initiate test dialogues. A\nscripted dialogues proceed without experimenter intervention once started. An unscripted dialogue required the experimenter to\nsupply responses in the 3rd and 5th turns. The experimenter used the same companion application to send those dialogue turns.\nThese ten dialogues are selected from the test split of the Turk Dialogues dataset11, hence were not seen by the LLMs\nduring their fine-tuning for KeywordAE or FillMask. We selected the dialogues based on the criteria of: 1) consisting\nof exactly one sentence per dialogue turn, 2) each sentence contains ten or fewer words, and 3) contain no potentially\noffensive or inappropriate content. The IDs of the ten dialogues selected dialogues were: chain2_633_298_601_4_948_1016,\n25/28\nFigure 12. Design of the lab study with participant LP1. Each box shows a six-turn dialogue used for testing.

In\nthe dialogue with ID chain3_242_108_214_13_28_50, we fixed a grammatical error in the 5th turn, \u201cI\u2019ve tried too\u201d \u2212\u2192\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to\u201d. Eight additional dialogues that satisfy these criteria were selected for practice purposes. Their IDs were\nchain2_230_210_1152_921_190_391, chain2_1854_397_1176_1052_141_408, chain3_161_342_288_171_313_222,\nchain2_888_773_852_406_924_605, chain3_45_147_301_192_331_261, chain2_1481_1455_10_53_610_18,\nchain2_1052_582_996_1165_267_929, chain2_839_1478_209_43_1020_495.\nThe unscripted dialogues were prompted with the following starter questions:\n\u2022 \"How do you like the weather today?\"\n\u2022 \"What did you do yesterday?\"\n\u2022 \"What pets have you had?\"\n\u2022 \"What kind of books do you read?\"\n\u2022 \"What kind of music do you listen to?\"\n\u2022 \"What sports do you like to watch?\"\n\u2022 \"Where would you like to go for vacation?\"\n\u2022 \"Do you like the city you live in?\"\n26/28\nFigure 13. Learning curve of eye-gaze user LP1 on the SpeakFaster text-entry paradigm over 20 practice dialogues, in\ncomparison with the average learning curve of the 19 users in the mobile study. In LP1, the practice was conducted over two\nseparate days before the lab study.\nThe lab study participant was instructed to respond to these questions with dialogue turns that each consisted of a single\nsentence with ten or fewer words. Each unscripted dialogues lasted six turns (i.e., the same as the scripted ones), in which\nthe participant was the interlocutor in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th turns, while the experimenter performed the 3rd and 5th turns\nimpromptu.\nFigure 12 shows the protocol of the lab study with participant LP1. It was arranged in three blocks, with interspersed breaks.\nEach block contained five six-turn dialogues, the first and last of which were the baseline condition of using the Tobii eye-gaze\nkeyboard, while the three dialogues in the middle were based on the SpeakFaster UI. The first and second blocks used scripted\ndialogues from the test split of the TDC corpus. They differed in whether the participant played the role of the first or second\ninterlocutor. The third block was based on unscripted dialogues in which the participant responded in the 2nd turn to the starter\nquestions listed above, in addition to following up with the experiment in the 4th and 6th turns.\nFor lab study with participant LP1, the user\u2019s word prediction history of the Tobii Windows Control virtual keyboard was\ncleared immediately before the start of the experiment, in order to prevent personal usage history of the soft keyboard from\ninterfering with the testing results.\nFigure 13 shows how the lab study user LP1 gradually improved in the efficiency of text entry in the SpeakFaster UI through\ninitial practice prior to the actual lab study over two days, in comparison with the same learning curve from averaging the 19\nmobile lab-study participants. It can be seen that despite showing a slower learning rate, approximately ten practice dialogues\nwere sufficient to train LP1 beyond the initial slow rate (< 5 WPM) and reach a level > 10 WPM. This shows that for eye-gaze\ncommunication users with cognitive abilities within normal limits at least, SpeakFaster has a manageable learning curve.\n27/28\nA.5 Accuracy and speed trade-off\nAdopting SpeakFaster\u2019s abbreviation expansion resulted in significant speed ups, but in some cases it reduced accuracy. For the\nlab study user LP1, a third (six) of the 18 scripted dialogue turns performed with the SpeakFaster UI contained errors, i.e.,\nmismatches between the entered sentence and the sentence prompt. This led to an average word error rate (WER) of 15.4%\nacross LP1\u2019s SpeakFaster turns, which was higher than the word error rate observed on the same participant under the 12\ndialogue turns of baseline (non-SpeakFaster) condition: 0%. However, as determined by the speech-language pathologists\non our research team, only two of the errors were categorized \u201cmajor\u201d, i.e., affects the meaning of comprehensibility of the\ntext. The remaining four errors were categorized as \"minor\" errors that did not affect the meaning of the sentence or its\ncomprehension in a significant way, but may have resulted in incorrect grammar or idiom. This indicates that a majority of the\nword errors seen in the SpeakFaster-entered phrases did not hinder the communication in terms of intentions and meaning,\nalthough it may still impact the perception of the user\u2019s communication or cognitive abilities in undesirable ways. Future\nstudies can explore automatic correction44 of such errors by leveraging LLMs and context awareness.\nA.6 Temporal, Cost, and Error Analyses of Text Entry\nWhen analyzing the results from offline simulations and event logs from user studies, we used the definition of keystroke saving\nrate (KSR):\nKSR = 1\u2212 Na\nNc\n(1)\nwhere Nc is the character length of the entered phrase and Na is the number of total keystrokes and UI actions that the user\nperforms to enter the phrase. The keystrokes include the ones used to enter the abbreviation, the ones used to specify keywords\n(complete or incomplete), and the ones used to type the words that cannot be found with FillMask. The UI interactions include\nthe clicks used to enter the Spelling or FillMask mode, the clicks used to specify which word to spell, the clicks that specify\nwhich word to get replacements for through FillMask, in addition to the clicks used to select matching results from KeywordAE\nand FillMask. The actions that select the final phrase for text-to-speech output (e.g., gaze-clicking the speaker buttons in Fig. 1)\nare not included in the KSR calculation.\n28/28\n"

Given their nature\nas black-boxes using complex reasoning processes on their inputs, it is inevitable that the\ndemand for scalable and faithful explanations for LLMs\u2019 generated content will continue\nto grow. There have been major developments in the explainability of neural network mod-\nels over the past decade. Among them, post-hoc explainability methods, especially Shap-\nley values, have proven effective for interpreting deep learning models. However, there are\nmajor challenges in scaling up Shapley values for LLMs, particularly when dealing with\nlong input contexts containing thousands of tokens and autoregressively generated output\nsequences. Furthermore, it is often unclear how to effectively utilize generated explana-\ntions to improve the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce TextGenSHAP, an\nefficient post-hoc explanation method incorporating LM-specific techniques. We demon-\nstrate that this leads to significant increases in speed compared to conventional Shapley\nvalue computations, reducing processing times from hours to minutes for token-level ex-\nplanations, and to just seconds for document-level explanations. In addition, we demon-\nstrate how real-time Shapley values can be utilized in two important scenarios, providing\nbetter understanding of long-document question answering by localizing important words\nand sentences; and improving existing document retrieval systems through enhancing the\naccuracy of selected passages and ultimately the final responses.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) continue to rapidly excel at different text generation tasks alongside the\ncontinued growth of resources dedicated to training text-based models (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al.,\n2022; Touvron et al., 2023). LLM\u2019s impressive capabilities have led to their widespread adoption throughout\nacademic and commercial applications. Their capacity to reason cohesively on a wide range of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks has prompted efforts to enable models to automatically ingest increasingly\nlarge contexts. These long-context models improve zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation\nperformance via in-context learning (Izacard et al., 2022b; Huang et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023) and reduce\nthe need for training task-specific models, empowering non-experts to readily use LLMs.\nDespite their remarkable text generation capabilities, LLMs which are trained primarily to model statisti-\ncal correlations between tokens offer limited insight into their internal mechanisms. This characteristic has\nled LLMs to be widely considered black-box models which are acutely difficult to explain. Beyond their\nprediction performance, challenges regarding safety, security, truthfulness, and more have gained promi-\nnence, especially in the wake of widespread adoption amongst the general population.

These lead to significantly increased times for extracting explanations\n(d) which can be prohibitively long for human-in-the-loop model improvement.\noften hailed as a crucial avenue for addressing these concerns. These methods allow for insights into the\nmodel\u2019s decision-making process, enabling stakeholders to directly scrutinize the reasoning behind unsafe\nor untruthful responses.\nRecent surveys in explainability for NLP juxtapose the two main criteria for model explanations: under-\nstandability and faithfulness (Lyu et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Mosca et al., 2022). Understandability\n(comprehensibility or plausibility) refers to how easily an explanation is understood by an external audi-\nence. It inherently relies on the expertise of the recipient and remains a highly subjective criterion. On the\nother hand, faithfulness refers to the extent to which a simplified explanation accurately captures the model\u2019s\noriginal reasoning process. Effectively judging the understandability and faithfulness of a given explanation\nmethod remains a contentious and ongoing subject in the interpretability literature (Rudin, 2019). Further\ndebate continues regarding the fidelity of explanation methods like attention scores, gradient saliency, and\nself-explained reasoning (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Adebayo et al., 2018; Ghorbani et al., 2019; Wang et al.,\n2020; Wei et al., 2022). One of the most well-respected explanation methods, the Shapley value (Lundberg\n& Lee, 2017) remains popular because of its stronger theoretical foundations. In the domain of NLP, how-\never, approaches like the Shapley value suffer greatly in their ability to scale to larger models and longer\ninputs, forcing practitioners to wait unreasonably long times before receiving an explanation.\nTo address these limitations of current explainability methods in the realm of NLP, we introduce TextGen-\nSHAP, a novel approach designed to adapt the Shapley value for text generation while keeping a computa-\ntional speed more suitable for LLM-scale applications. Our primary focus lies on the challenging scenario of\nexplanations when using long inputs as prompts, particularly for tasks such as abstractive question answer-\ning from extensive documents. Accordingly, we demonstrate our method\u2019s scalability to new applications\nacross three key aspects shown in Figure 1: (a) handling longer contexts with thousands of input tokens; (b)\naccommodating larger models with billions of parameters; and (c) facilitating open-ended text generation, as\nopposed to discriminative tasks like classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the explanations gen-\nerated by our TextGenSHAP can enhance the performance of long-document question answering in multiple\nways.\n2\n2\nRELATED WORK\nPost-hoc model explainability. There have been many attempts at providing explanations for how ma-\nchine learning models utilize their input features to make predictions. Among many post-hoc explanation\napproaches including LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017), and Integrated Gradi-\nents (Sundararajan et al., 2017), SHAP and Shapley remain dominant due to their strong theoretical founda-\ntions. For NLP, many extensions to such perturbation-based explanation methods leverage the hierarchical\nstructure and sequential order of text (Chen et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). Yet, these are\nlimited to binary parse trees instead of more general hierarchies and have not been applied to longer input\nlengths or larger models. More recent methods extend beyond binary classification tasks by using contrastive\nextensions of the original techniques (Jacovi et al., 2021; Yin & Neubig, 2022). Works in tabular and image\ndata have also made strides in accelerating Shapley values (Jethani et al., 2022), but struggle to apply to NLP\nbecause of generative text outputs. Specifically, all existing methods require prespecification of candidate\noutputs and cannot be applied to the large output space of free-form text generation.\nSelf-explanations and rationales. Also popular for NLP applications is training models which will jointly\nexplain and predict, generating \u2018rationales\u2019 to highlight important tokens for prediction, often by aligning\nwith rationales either collected from human annotators (Arous et al., 2021; Joshi et al., 2022) or generated\nusing post-hoc explanations (Stacey et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022). Even still, such approaches remain lim-\nited to classification tasks, likely due to the difficulties in collecting human rationales and current limitations\nof post-hoc explanations for text generation, as discussed above. Natural language explanations, such as\nchain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022), where LLMs emit explanations about themselves are hence some of the\nonly available explanations for text generation. Unfortunately, such approaches remain completely detached\nfrom concerns on faithfulness or explanation accuracy (Jacovi & Goldberg, 2021; Zheng et al., 2022).\nInformation retrieval from long documents. Question answering (QA) remains a fundamental natural\nlanguage understanding task, going beyond its origins in reading comprehension and into fusion with in-\ncreasingly large knowledge bases. The two major varieties of QA are long-document QA, where the input is\na single contiguous document containing at least thousands of tokens, and open-domain QA, where the input\nis a large corpus often full of millions of smaller documents. The bifurcation between these two varieties\ncan be traced back at least as early as the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) for\nanswering questions given Wikipedia pages. Follow-up work such as Lee et al. (2019); Karpukhin et al.\n(2020) construct open-domain reformulations of the original NQ task by including the entire Wikipedia\ncorpus rather than only the most relevant page. Such open-domain tasks are dominated by the pipelined\napproach which first leverages a retriever model to rank the most relevant passages and then uses a reader\nmodel for further comprehension on the small subset of top-ranked passages. Many neural-based retriever\nmethods have since emerged for this setup, uprooting the long reign of tf\u2013idf style approaches (Izacard et al.,\n2022a; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Formal et al., 2021; Guu et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2021; John-\nson et al., 2019). Simultaneously, improvements have been made on the reader model side of the pipelined\napproach. Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) (Izacard & Grave, 2021a;b) has remained an efficient architecture de-\nsigned for QA, and \u2018Lost in the Middle\u2019 (LitM) (Liu et al., 2023) has recently identified how reader model\nperformance depends on the position of the correct passage within large contexts.\nArchitectures for long inputs. In pursuit of the impressive capabilities of large-scale, end-to-end training,\nthere has also been a surge in network architectures which can increase the context size of LMs. Maximum\ncontext windows have quickly expanded from thousands of tokens to many millions of tokens with the use\nof efficient sparsity methods (Wu et al., 2022; Bulatov et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2023). Some methods use\nsparsity closely mimicking that of information-retrieval with respect to relevant tokens or external memory\n(Bertsch et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022; Bulatov et al., 2022; 2023; Johnson et al., 2019) and some methods\ninstead use block sparse attention matrices to reduce the necessary computations of the attention mechanism\n(Beltagy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a; Ding et al., 2023; Dao et al., 2022).\n3\n3\nBACKGROUND\nNotation.\nConsider a language model with a vocabulary of size V \u2208 N using input sequences x \u2208 X :=\n[V ]d and output sequences y \u2208 Y := [V ]m for input length d \u2208 N and maximum output length m \u2208\nN, where [V ] := {1, . . . , V }. A text generation model takes an input sequence of tokens and defines a\nprobability vector over all possible outputs, F : X \u2192 [0, 1]Y. Hence, we have F(x)y denote y\u2019s probability\nof being generated given x.\nTo enable explanation via feature-attribution methods like the Shapley value, we need to be able to mask\ncertain subsets of the input tokens. Let s \u2208 M := {0, 1}d be a binary mask on the input tokens. We will\nnext define a masked text-generation model, f : X \u00d7 M \u2192 [0, 1]Y, which takes both an input sequence\nand an input mask. In words, we will replace all input tokens which are not in the mask s by the <pad>\ntoken before inputting it to the model. If we assume the <pad> or <mask> token is taken to be p \u2208 [V ] and\nidentify the d-vector composed of all p to be p, then we can write this as f(x, S) := F(x\u2299s+p\u2299(1\u2212s)).\nIn order to finally define the \u2018value functions\u2019 required to define the Shapley score, we must first identify our\nbinary masks with subets of the input features. In particular, for any element of the powerset S \u2208 P([d]) :=\n{S \u2286 [d]}, there is a unique corresponding binary mask s \u2208 {0, 1}d via the indicator function s = 1S. For\nany input token i \u2208 [d], we will use the set notation (S + i) := S \u222a {i} and (S \u2212 i) := S \\ {i} to unmask or\nmask the token. For a fixed x, we write v\u2113(S) := log(f(x, 1S)) and vp(S) := f(x, 1S) as our two candidate\nvalue functions.\n3.1\nSHAPLEY VALUE\nShapley values, which were originally derived to attribute the value of individual players in a cooperative\ngame, have since become a dominant paradigm for explaining feature attributions of black-box machine\nlearning models (Shapley, 1953; Lundberg & Lee, 2017). In Sec. 3.2, we will extend this to the Shapley-\nShubik and Penrose-Banzhaf values designed for voting games (Shapley & Shubik, 1954; Banzhaf, 1965;\nPenrose, 1946). In Sec. 3.3, we will describe how to apply the hierarchical extension called the Owen value\n(Owen, 1977; Winter, 2002) to text data.\nThe Shapley value is commonly formulated as a uniform expectation over permutations:\n\u03c6i = E\u03c0\n\u0014\nv\u2113(S\u03c0,i + i) \u2212 v\u2113(S\u03c0,i \u2212 i)\n\u0015\n(1)\nwhere \u03c0 : [d] \u2192 [d] is a permutation and the expectation is computed over the uniform distribution of\npermutations. In other words, \u03c0 represents a random order of the features (tokens) and S\u03c0,i := {j \u2208 [d] :\n\u03c0(j) < \u03c0(i)} is the set of elements which precede i in the order defined by \u03c0. Hence, S\u03c0,i + i = {j \u2208 [d] :\n\u03c0(j) \u2264 \u03c0(i)} and S\u03c0,i \u2212 i = S\u03c0,i = {j \u2208 [d] : \u03c0(j) < \u03c0(i)}, where we unnecessarily subtract the element\ni in preparation for Equation 2. We follow the standard approach of permutation sampling to estimate the\nShapley value as the empirical mean over a finite set of sampled permutations Covert et al. (2021).\nThe key challenge of applying traditional Shapley is the fact that we do not have access to the full proba-\nbility vector F(x), which is now of exponential size. In classification tasks and regression tasks, the log-\nprobabilities may be computed exactly for every candidate output. In open-ended text generation, however,\nwe utilize sequential decoding algorithms like greedy decoding and K-beam generation to recover only a\nsparse subset of the exponentially large probability vector F(x) \u2208 [0, 1][V ]m. In the next section, we show\nhow to adapt Shapley to handle generated text coming from distributions of a-priori unknown support.\n4\n3.2\nEXTENSION TO GENERATIVE OUTPUTS\nAlthough the Shapley value has found wide success in discriminative tasks like classification and regression,\nit struggles to be applied to generative tasks. Towards this end, we leverage the voting theory reformulation\nof the conventional Shapley value, called the Shapley-Shubik power index. We consider each input token\nas a \u2018voter\u2019 casting a vote for a generated answer, aiming to \u2018elect\u2019 their preferred answer under the LM\u2019s\nblack-box voting system. Typically, Shapley employs a value function represented as the vector of log-\nprobabilities, while Shapley-Shubik operates on the probability vector.\nHereafter, we will refer to the \u2018Shapley-Shubik power index\u2019 as \u2018Shapley\u2019 for brevity. We can equivalently\nreformulate Shapley as an expectation over a random subset instead of over a random permutation, high-\nlighting its connection with the Banzhaf value:\n\u03c6Sh\ni\n:= ES\u223cPSh(S)\n\u0014\n[vp(S + i) \u2212 vp(S \u2212 i)]+\n\u0015\n\u03c6Bz\ni\n:= ES\u223cPBz(S)\n\u0014\n[vp(S + i) \u2212 vp(S \u2212 i)]+\n\u0015\n(2)\nwhere PSh(S) is the Shapley distribution PSh(S) \u221d\nd\u22121\n(\nd\n|S|)|S|(d\u2212|S|) and the Banzhaf distribution is the same\nas the Bernoulli distribution PBz(S) \u221d p|S|(1 \u2212 p)d\u2212|S|. We set p = 50% and p = 10% in our experiments.\n[\u00b7]+ is used to denote component-wise positive part which we use to take the positive part of the difference\nof the two probability vectors. These formulations offer the major advantage of eliminating the need to\ncompute the full log-probability vector, allowing us to apply the Shapley value to text generation.\n3.3\nEXTENSION TO HIERARCHICAL INPUTS\nLeveraging natural text\u2019s intrinsic hierarchical nature, our method efficiently computes Shapley values at\ndifferent granularity levels. Initially calculating Shapley values at the document level, the process then\nrefines to include sentences only from significant-contributing documents. This selective, tiered process\ncontinues, progressively narrowing the focus to words residing within high-scoring sentences. While prior\nwork like (Jin et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) explored hierarchical extensions using the Owen value, they\nonly addressed binary hierarchies, lacking support for more general structures. We leverage this hierar-\nchy to uniquely allocate computational resources to pivotal tokens within already identified-as-important\nparagraphs and sentences, recognizing that not every token warrants investigation.\n4\nTEXTGENSHAP: ACCELERATING EXPLANATION GENERATION\nIn this section, we explain the speedup techniques proposed in TextGenSHAP designed to expedite Shapley\ncomputations in generative text modeling tasks with long context. First, we use speculative decoding for\npredicting the text generations coming from resampled inputs, achieving significant speedups across vari-\nous model types. Second, we harness recent hardware-efficient techniques such as Flash Attention (Dao\net al., 2022) and connect its block-sparse implementation to other techniques commonly used in the long-\ndocument literature. Lastly, we employ encoder in-place resampling to improve the speed of passage level\nexplanations. We provide detailed explanations for these in the following sections.\n4.1\nDECODER SPECIFIC SPEEDUPS: SPECULATIVE DECODING\nWe utilize speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023) to reduce decoder calls during\nautoregressive sampling in TextGenSHAP, depicted in Figure 2. This approach exactly computes the output\nprobabilities by first guessing what the fully decoded sequence should be. During our algorithm, as we\nresample different subsets of tokens for the same input example, we gradually build the set of candidate\nanswers. For each new sample, we first verify whether the argmax decoding exists within the speculative\n5\n+0   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n-1 +0   \n  \n  \n  \n    \n-2 -1 +0   \n  \n  \n    \n-3 -2 -1 +0   \n  \n    \n-1   \n  \n  +0   \n    \n-2   \n  \n  -1 +0     \n-3   \n  \n  -2 -1 +0   \n-2   \n  \n  -1   \n  +0 \n \n \n(d) speculation tree, causal atten-\ntion matrix, and position bias matrix \nSklodowska \nRontgen \nConrad \nMarie \nWilhelm \n<pad> \nCurie \nCurie \nSklodowska \nRontgen \nConrad \nMarie \nWilhelm \n<pad> \nCurie \nRontgen \nConrad \nWilhelm \n<pad> \n(a) randomly \nmasked input \nDocument [1]... \nDocument [2]... \n... \nDocument [10]... \n \nQuestion: who... \nAnswer:  \nDocument [1]... \nDocument [2]... \n... \nDocument [10]... \n \nQuestion: who... \nAnswer:  \nDocument [1]... \nDocument [2]... \n... \nDocument [10]... \n \nQuestion: who... \nAnswer:  \nDocument [1]... \nDocument [2]... \n... \nDocument [10]... \n \nQuestion: who... \nAnswer:  \n \n(b) verify \nspeculation \n(c) update Shapley  \n(and speculation tree) \n\"Wilhelm \nConrad  \nRontgen\" \n\"Marie \nSklodowska \nCurie\" \n\"Marie \nCurie\" \n \n \n \n \n \nsample #1 \n\"Wilhelm \nConrad  \nRontgen\" \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n+0   \n  \n  \n  \n    \n-1 +0   \n  \n  \n    \n-2 -1 +0   \n  \n    \n-3 -2 -1 +0   \n    \n-1   \n  \n  +0     \n-2   \n  \n  -1 +0   \n-3   \n  \n  -2 -1 +0 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n+0   \n    \n-1 +0     \n-2 -1 +0   \n-3 -2 -1 +0 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n<pad> \n+0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nT0 \n\"Wilhelm\" \nnot in tree \nspeculate \nT0 \nT1 \nT2 \nT3 \n\"Marie\" \nnot in tree \n\"Marie Curie\" \nnot in tree \nautoregressive  \nspeculate \nT1 \nspeculate \nT2 \nspeculate \nT2 \nautoregressive  \n\"Wilhelm Conrad \nRontgen\" \nis in the tree \nautoregressive  \n\u03a6 \nsample #2 \nsample #3 \nsample #4 \nT1 \n\u03a6 \nT2 \n\u03a6 \nT3 \n\u03a6 \nFigure 2:\nVisualization of how to use the speculative decoding approach proposed in TextGenSHAP to improve the\nresampling algorithm speed. (a) The randomly masked inputs generated to calculate the Shapley value. (b) Running\nthe decoder a single time with the speculation tree and then verifying whether the true output is within the speculated\noutput. (c) If the speculation is rejected, we must run the decoder autoregressively to generate the correct output. Each\npurple bar represents a single time we call the decoder. Afterwards we update the Shapley value and add the new output\nto the speculation tree. If the speculation is accepted, we update the Shapley value with the correctly speculated output.\n(d) As we run the algorithm, we keep track of the speculation tree and its position bias matrix. The causal attention mask\ncan be computed directly from the position bias matrix by masking out all blue entries and only keeping yellow entries.\nThe causal attention matrix quickly takes a more complex form than the typical triangular matrix in order to correctly\ncompute the output likelihoods.\ndecoding outputs we computed (if so we are already done with this sample). If not, then we need to generate\nthe new candidate answer using the regular autoregressive decoding method. Afterwards, we graft the new\nanswer to the existing causal decoding tree, making sure to update the causal attention matrix in order to\nrespect the graph structure of the decoding tree. Unlike existing applications (Leviathan et al., 2023), which\nhave a high degree of uncertainty in their decoder predictions, TextGenSHAP applies speculative decoding\nto perturbed inputs which closely resemble already decoded samples allowing us to have a much higher\nprediction success rate. In our experiments, we verify that a large amount of total computation can be saved\nvia speculatively decoding in one step rather than sequentially running the decoder model.\nAdditionally, our TextGenSHAP\u2019s speculative decoding tree can be further extended to track related values\nof interest. For instance, it can keep track of log-probabilities decoded at each node, enabling the computa-\ntion of contrastive Shapley values in terms of log-probabilities, without the need for prespecification. In all\nof our experiments, we use greedy decoding consistent with other long-document question answering stud-\nies (Izacard & Grave, 2021a; Liu et al., 2023). However, we emphasize that our speculative decoding tree\n6\ncan further support other popular sampling methods like beam search and nucleus generation (Sina et al.,\n2021; Holtzman et al., 2020) and can keep track of log-probabilites on all leaves of the tree.\n4.2\nBLOCK SPARSITY AND FLASH ATTENTION\nWe leverage the increasingly common Flash Attention mechanism (Dao et al., 2022) to improve both the\nmemory efficiency and the speed performance of LMs. Memory efficiency is improved by employing an al-\nternative attention matrix computation formula, whose memory scales linearly with input size O(N) instead\nof quadratically O(N 2). Further speedups are achieved via aligning these computations to scale effectively\nwith modern GPU hardware. These adaptations are crucial in the context of long-document question an-\nswering, where we handle as many as 20K input tokens with a single GPU. Such input sizes necessitate the\nlinear memory scaling afforded by Flash Attention-type methods (Rabe & Staats, 2022; Dao, 2023).\nAdditionally, we make a connection between Flash Attention and recent developments in long-document\narchitectures (Izacard & Grave, 2021a; Ding et al., 2023) by using block sparse attention matrices for han-\ndling long inputs. Given the growing need for such modifications, we also reformulate the original version\nof FiD into a version incorporating the block sparse implementation of Flash Attention. Following such\nrecent advances into modern architectures for immense context sizes, we believe our block-sparse extended\nexplainability technique positions itself well to continue to be useful in the era of LLMs.\n4.3\nENCODER SPECIFIC SPEEDUPS: IN-PLACE RESAMPLING\nIn TextGenSHAP, we further exploit the unique structure of chunking-based encoder-decoder models like\nFiD to get speedups significantly faster than previously possible in NLP. In particular, we compute the\nencoder feature matrix just once when generating the entire explanation for a single example. Due to the\nindependence of chunked input fragments, we only need to adjust the encoder-decoder attention mechanism\nto enable resampling with different document subsets. Not only do we drastically reduce the computation\ntime required for re-encoding input features, but reducing the memory overhead from batches of encodings\nenables parallel decoding with large decoding batch sizes. Increasing the decoding batch size allows for\nmuch more hardware-efficient decoding, enabling the model to iterate through hundreds of permutation\nsamples in only seconds.\nIn our experiments, we further combine this approach with the block-diagonal attention matrix reformulation\nfor chunking discussed in Section 4.2. By altering passage encodings to efficiently utilize the hardware-\nalignment in Flash Attention, we are able to keep the encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder cross-\nattention aligned as block sparse matrices. Such hardware-aware sparse matrices allow us to minimize\nextraneous computations by avoiding nonzero entries that unnecessarily cross hardware boundaries and slow\ndown computation.\nTextGenSHAP\nIn Algorithm 1, we detail TextGenSHAP, which first calculates the Shapley value at the\ndocument level; second ranks documents and selects those which surpass a predefined importance threshold;\nand third calculates the Shapley value at the token level only for tokens inside of important documents. In\nour experiments, we use a three-tiered hierarchy with passages, sentence, and words; however, for notational\nsimplicity we only describe a two-level hierarchy in our algorithmic description.\n5\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nDatasets\nWe focus on publicly-available datasets designed for the task of open-domain or long-document\nquestion answering: Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and MIRACL (English subset)\n(Zhang et al., 2022b). NQ is redesigned for open-domain question answering following (Lee et al., 2019;\nKarpukhin et al., 2020). In this setting, answers must be found from within all of Wikipedia, rather than\n7\na single Wikipedia page. The original NQ dataset provides short text answers and passages are rated as\nrelevant so long as they contain the ground-truth answer. MIRACL is designed for information retrieval\nand for each query it provides binary relevance labels for ten related passages from the corpus. Relevance\njudgements are made by a human annotator who decides whether the passage information is sufficient to\nanswer the given question; however, they are not required to justify or describe the answer as part of the\nlabel.\nModels\nFor passage ranking of the corpus (retriever model) we use the recent Contriever (Izacard et al.,\n2022a) architecture following LitM . For question answering (reader models) we use different members of\nthe T5 family (Raffel et al., 2020). We use the available flan tuned models at the large and XXL sizes (\u2018T5-\nlarge\u2019 and \u2018T5-XXL\u2019) (Chung et al., 2022) and the fine-tuned T5 large model from FiD (\u2018T5-FiD\u2019) (Izacard\n& Grave, 2021a).\n45\n90\n180\n360\n720\n1440\nTime Taken (minutes)\n20.3 hr\n4.76 hr\n10/10\n2.09 hr\n30/10\n1.96 hr\n30/30\n4.19 hr\n10/10\n1.57 hr\n30/10\n1.10 hr\n30/30\n(a) T5-XXL\nShapley\nHierarchical\nSpec Decoding\n5\n10\n30\n60\n180\n360\n900\nTime Taken (minutes)\n12.3 hr\n2.27 hr\n10/10\n56.0 min\n30/10\n48.9 min\n30/30\n34.5 min\n10/10\n16.1 min\n30/10\n10.0 min\n30/30\n(b) T5-large\nShapley\nHierarchical\nSpec Decoding\n5\n10\n30\n60\n120\n600\nTime Taken (seconds)\n5.25 min\n1.41 min\n2.75 min\n 1\n23.6 sec\n  10 \n8.51 sec\n 100 \n(c) T5-FiD\nHierarchical\nSpec Decoding\nIn-Place Encoding\nFigure 3: (a, b) TextGenSHAP speed benchmark results at the token level on T5-XXL and T5-large.

First, we evaluate the Shapley\nvalue, which provides detailed token-level explanations using our Algorithm 1. In Figure 3, we benchmark\nwith 100 sampled permutations and 10 documents from the LitM setting for both T5-XXL and T5-large. A\nsingle A100 40GB GPU is used for benchmarking all experiments. We observe that the standard Shapley\nvalue estimation requires a prohibitive 12-20 hours per sample and show that our proposed hierarchical\nsampling algorithm significantly reduces this time. With the integration of speculative decoding, we can\nachieve an even more significant reduction in computation time, bringing computation time to under an\nhour and approximately an hour, respectively. We note that additional speedups can be achieved in real-\nworld settings by just sampling fewer permutations. In Appendix E, we show that even fewer than 100\npermutation samples can suffice. When using only 10 permutation samples, TextGenSHAP reduces the time\nfor the T5-XXL model from about two hours to five minutes.\n8\nWe additionally benchmark the T5-FiD model accelerated with its architecture specific modifications as seen\nin Figure 3c. We take document level explanations from multiple minutes to less than ten seconds, enabling\nreal-time improvements in document retrieval applications which we demonstrate in Section 5.3\n5.2\nVISUALIZING INTERPRETATIONS\nIn the Appendix, we present visualizations of the prediction explanations. We find that our hierarchical\nShapley scores are effective for isolating important tokens from within contexts that are thousands of tokens\nin length. We also provide interactive visualizations hosted here.\n5.3\nDOCUMENT DISTILLATION\nWe show the value of the proposed explanation scores in TextGenSHAP within the context of document\nretrieval for open-domain QA. We first apply our method to improve the retrieval aspect, particularly en-\nhancing the recall of the modified retriever model, by reranking passages according to their explanation\nscores.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nNumber of Retrieved Documents\n30% \n40% \n50% \n60% \n70% \n80% \n90% \n100%\nRecall\n(a) Natural Questions\nSimilarity Score\nTextGenSHAP\nTextGenBANZ\nTextGenBANZ-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nNumber of Retrieved Documents\n30% \n40% \n50% \n60% \n70% \n80% \n90% \n100%\nRecall\n(b) MIRACL-original\nSimilarity Score\nTextGenSHAP\nTextGenBANZ\nTextGenBANZ-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nNumber of Retrieved Documents\n30% \n40% \n50% \n60% \n70% \n80% \n90% \n100%\nRecall\n(c) MIRACL-pseudo\nSimilarity Score\nTextGenSHAP\nTextGenBANZ\nTextGenBANZ-10\nFigure 4: Recall improvements via resorting the retrieved documents using different methods (a) Natural\nQuestions (b) MIRACL with original labels (c) MIRACL with pseudo labels\nFig. 4a shows substantial recall improvement on the NQ dataset, with all three explanation methods ex-\nhibiting similar performance improvements compared to the baseline retriever model. Table 1 provides a\nnumerical evaluation of the area under the curve for these models. However, Fig. 4b shows less pronounced\nimprovements on the more challenging MIRACL dataset, primarily due to its sparser label information only\nproviding relevance labels for ten of the millions of passages. We verify this claim by extending the label\ninformation using pseudo-labels. Specifically, we take all relevant passages according to the MIRACL la-\nbels and ask T5-XXL to give a short answer according to that passage alone. We then leverage this set of\ncandidate answers to evaluate passage relevance in the same fashion as the NQ dataset. In Figure 4c, we\nsee this not only improves the overall recall, but disproportionately boosts the success of our explainability\napproach\u2019s performance.\nWe take this as preliminary evidence of the potential of our method to discover relevant passages which are\ntypically left underexplored when using similarity-based retrieval models alone. Accordingly, we suggest\nthat our method could be further applied to enhance dataset construction pipelines by not only reducing\nthe burden of human annotation via localizing important document features, but also by collecting a more\ndiverse document set to be annotated by humans than is possible with existing methods. We explore such\napplications on the MIRACL dataset in the Appendix E.\nIn our second application, we propose to use the Shapley values from the reader model to distill its own set of\navailable documents. In conjunction with the findings in LitM (Liu et al., 2023), which highlight challenges\nfor reader models in utilizing longer contexts, we redistill the model\u2019s documents before reaching a final\n9\nTable 1: AUC for the recall curves from Fig. 4 on both\nthe NQ dataset and MIRACL dataset.\nNatural\nMIRACL\nMIRACL\nQuestions\n(Original)\n(Pseudo)\nBaseline\n84.23\n80.18\n84.53\nTextGenSHAP\n88.53\n77.33\n86.43\nTextGenBANZ\n88.56\n78.19\n86.17\nTextGenBANZ-10\n88.74\n82.38\n86.53\nAttention1\n88.35\n78.27\n84.30\nTable 2: AUC for the accuracy curves from\nFigure 5 on the NQ dataset.\nK=1\nK=3\nK=5\nBaseline\n50.54\n\u2013\n\u2013\nMajority Vote\n32.90\n55.19\n63.88\nTextGenSHAP\n52.72\n66.16\n69.57\nanswer.

This\nevaluation highlights the importance of providing a diverse set of candidate answers. Figure 5 illustrates\nthe accuracy improvements achieved by the redistilled model compared to the majority voting baseline.\nWe see that TextGenSHAP significantly outperforms the baseline with just one pass through the reader\nmodel, and further surpasses the majority voting baseline for multiple answers.

We introduce modifications to adapt the Shapley value for hierarchically-structured input text and\nautoregressively-decoded output generations, drawing on insights from the game theory literature to support\ntheir theoretical foundations. Additionally, we incorporate multiple transformer-specific architecture mod-\nifications which significantly accelerate explanation generation. Our approach not only speeds up Shapley\nvalue computation for generated text but also demonstrates its effectiveness in improving performance in\na standard question answering task. We expect that such explanation methods will continue to find broad\napplicability in a variety of LLM use cases.\n1Attention follows the best hyperparameters for aggregation found in Izacard & Grave (2021b)\n10\nREFERENCES\nJulius Adebayo, Justin Gilmer, Michael Muelly, Ian Goodfellow, Moritz Hardt, and Been Kim.

In particular, we further verify\nhow dependent it is on the semi-synthetic distribution introduced by the authors therein. There are a few\nmajor assumptions made in this semi-synthetic distribution (of planting a single document amongst a set\nof distractor documents) which may not always hold up in practical scenarios. First, the number of true\ndocuments retrieved in real-world systems may be greater than or less than one. Second, the order and\nrelevancy of distractor documents may vary by retrieval system used and by documents within a corpus.\nFigure 6: LitM Reproduction\nFor all three reader models we utilize, we verify the hypothesis from the LitM paper on the effect of doc-\nument position on model performance. In Fig. 6, we indeed see for the models trained in the typical way\nlike T5-large and T5-XXL, we indeed reverify the hypothesis of LitM which shows a degradation in model\nperformance whenever the true answer is placed towards the center of a very long context window. We ad-\nditionally compare the performance of the permutation invariant T5-FiD model. Here, we consequently see\nthat the model architecture trained to perform the long-document question answering task is able to increase\nthe performance over the original T5-large model. In fact, we see that for some parts of the LitM curve, that\nthe smaller T5-FiD model is able to outperform the much larger T5-XXL model.\nFigure 7: LitM Effect Size of U-shaped Curve is reduced under different distractor documents.\nTo further prod the findings from the LitM paper, we further investigate how changing the distractor docu-\nments in the context will alter the effect size of the LitM curve. Instead of taking the top 10 most relevant\npassages to serve as the distractor documents as is done in the original LitM paper, we look at taking some\nless relevant retrieved passages. Fig. 7 shows that making this change to the semi-synthetic setup indeed\nreduces the depth of the LitM bowl-shaped curve.\n17\nB\nEXPERIMENT DETAILS\nB.1\nMODELS AND DATASETS\nDatasets\nNatural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) is a dataset originally designed for long-\ndocument question answering, where both a relevant passage and a final answer must be selected from a\nsingle Wikipedia page. NQ is redesigned for open-domain question answering following (Lee et al., 2019;\nKarpukhin et al., 2020) which convert Wikipedia into a corpus of passages instead of pages, and only require\ngiving a final answer which can be found amongst said passages. The original NQ dataset provides short\ntext answers and passages are rated as relevant so long as they contain the ground-truth answer.\nMIRACL (Zhang et al., 2022b). is a dataset designed for information retrieval over Wikipedia passages.\nUsing an existing information retrieval score, the dataset selected the ten most relevant passages the corpus\nand labeled each as either relevant or irrelevant to the question at hand. Relevance judgements are made by\na human annotator who decides whether the passage information is sufficient to answer the given question;\nhowever, they are not required to justify or describe the answer as part of the label. Accordingly, only a\nhandful of passages have ground-truth single-judgement label information. This constitutes a much sparser\nsignal than the NQ dataset which allows for any passage which contains the ground-truth text answer to\nbe deemed as relevant. It is for this reason we generate psuedolabels based off of the relevant MIRACL\npassages to reevaluate MIRACL passages using the same criteria as NQ. In this work, we only focus on the\nsubsest of MIRACL which uses English queries and English passages.\nModels\nWe follow the standard two-stage pipeline of ODQA, first using a retriever model to select a subset\nof relevant passages from a massive corpus and second using a reader model to extract the question\u2019s answer\nfrom the subset of relevant passages.\nFor passage ranking of the corpus (retriever model), we use the recent Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022a)\narchitecture following LitM , using FAISS to index the embeddings Johnson et al. (2019). For question\nanswering (reader models), we use different members of the T5 family (Raffel et al., 2020). We use the\navailable flan tuned models at the large and XXL sizes (\u2018T5-large\u2019 and \u2018T5-XXL\u2019) (Chung et al., 2022) and\nthe fine-tuned T5 large model from FiD (\u2018T5-FiD\u2019) (Izacard & Grave, 2021a). Specifically, these correspond\nto flan-t5-large and flan-t5-xxl available from Chung et al. (2022) which are originally trained\non contexts of length 512. T5-FiD corresponds to nq reader large from Izacard & Grave (2021a) which\nis originally trained on context lengths of one hundred passages retrieved from their co-trained retriever.\nDespite the sizes of training context lengths, it is common to apply such models beyond their originally\ntrained context lengths when applied to the task of long-document question answering Liu et al. (2023)\n(which is feasible due to the relative position bias implemented within T5).\n18\nB.2\nADDITIONAL RESULTS\nHere we provide the additional results for various values different values of the number of permutations used\nto generate explanations before evaluating. Because this is the main knob for sampling based algorithms\nto trade between estimation accuracy and time complexity, we calculate the AUC metrics of our target\napplication across all levels of permutations to show the different effects. We see that even in as few as ten\npermutations we are getting multiple points of recall AUC in the end-to-end information retrieval system.\nTable 3: AUC for 3 permutations.\nNatural\nMIRACL\nMIRACL\nQuestions\n(Original)\n(Pseudo)\nBaseline\n84.23\n80.18\n84.53\nTextGenSHAP\n86.01\n69.58\n84.71\nTextGenBANZ\n85.76\n72.84\n84.80\nTextGenBANZ-10\n87.53\n79.08\n85.40\nTable 4: AUC for 10 permutations.\nNatural\nMIRACL\nMIRACL\nQuestions\n(Original)\n(Pseudo)\nBaseline\n84.23\n80.18\n84.53\nTextGenSHAP\n87.50\n74.52\n85.39\nTextGenBANZ\n87.86\n75.65\n85.71\nTextGenBANZ-10\n88.61\n81.39\n86.27\nTable 5: AUC for 30 permutations.\nNatural\nMIRACL\nMIRACL\nQuestions\n(Original)\n(Pseudo)\nBaseline\n84.23\n80.18\n84.53\nTextGenSHAP\n88.31\n76.71\n85.97\nTextGenBANZ\n88.51\n76.88\n86.27\nTextGenBANZ-10\n88.77\n82.15\n86.60\nTable 6: AUC for 100 permutations.\nNatural\nMIRACL\nMIRACL\nQuestions\n(Original)\n(Pseudo)\nBaseline\n84.23\n80.18\n84.53\nTextGenSHAP\n88.53\n77.33\n86.43\nTextGenBANZ\n88.56\n78.19\n86.17\nTextGenBANZ-10\n88.74\n82.38\n86.53\nC\nFURTHER DETAILS ON THE SHAPLEY VALUE\nAs a reminder, we consider a language model F : [V ]d \u2192 [0, 1][V ]m and we take f(x, S) := F(x \u2299 s +\np \u2299 (1 \u2212 s)) to define a masked language model f : [V ]d \u00d7 {0, 1}d \u2192 [0, 1][V ]m where the inputs, input\nmasks, and outputs are x \u2208 [V ]d, s \u2208 {0, 1}d, and y \u2208 [V ]m, respectively. We consider a value function\nv : P([d]) \u2192 RM for M = V m, and consider the choices of value function as the log-probabilities or\nprobabilities: v\u2113(S) := log(f(x, 1S)) and vp(S) := f(x, 1S). Please refer back to the notation section in\nthe main text for full details if necessary.\nC.1\nSHAPLEY VALUE\nThe Shapley value is a long-existing solution concept from the game theory literature, originally designed\nto correctly attribute the value of each individual player within a cooperative game of forming a coalition\n(Shapley, 1953). In recent years, this solution concept has been repurposed towards the goal of explaining\nblack-box machine learning models, treating each individual feature as a player and dividing up the pre-\ndiction output correctly between the features (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). Between this time, however, many\nfurther advancements in the game theory literature building off of the seminal work by Shapley have contin-\nued to progress. Herein, we focus on a few such extensions of the original Shapley value as we apply them\nto our particular structured data of text-to-text generation models.\nThe first such advancement occurred only shortly after the original Shapley value\u2019s conception; the Shapley-\nShubik power index is a reformulation of the original Shapley value instead designed for voting games\n(Shapley & Shubik, 1954). Here, the Shapley-Shubik value measures the amount of power or influence each\nvoter has to influence the outcome of the vote. Also in the category of voting games, the Penrose-Banzhaf\nindex (or more commonly Banzhaf power index) was first discovered by Penrose (Penrose, 1946) and was\n19\nlater independently discovered by Banzhaf (Banzhaf, 1965). Even now, both Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik\nremain the two well-respected pillars for how to effectively evaluate the structure of a voting game.\nAlong the direction of further extensions to the Shapley value, Owen years later extended the Shapley value\nto additional deal with a two-level hierarchical structure (Owen, 1977). In particular, one can imagine that\nplayers form coalitions within an organization but moreover that organizations themselves form coalitions\nwith one another. The value can further be defined for multi-level hierarchical structures and is sometimes\ncalled the Owen-Winter value (Winter, 2002). The corresponding extension to the Banzhaf value is instead\nusually considered more straightforward and is also referred to as the Banzhaf value. In this work, we use a\ncombination of all listed approaches to be able to apply SHAP-style (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) explanations\nof machine learning algorithms in the case of sequence-to-sequence transformer models, adapting to the\nhierarchical structure of input text and the autoregressive structure of output text.\nThe Shapley value is commonly formulated as a uniform expectation over permutations, which lends itself\nto approximation via permutation sampling:\n\u03c6i = E\u03c0\n\u0014\nv\u2113(S\u03c0,i + i) \u2212 v\u2113(S\u03c0,i \u2212 i)\n\u0015\n=\n1\n|Sd|\nX\n\u03c0\u2208Sd\n\u001a\nv\u2113(S\u03c0,i + i) \u2212 v\u2113(S\u03c0,i \u2212 i)\n\u001b\n(3)\nwhere \u03c0 \u2208 Sd := {\u03c0 : [d] \u2192 [d] : \u03c0 is bijective} is the set of permutations of size d and the expectation\nis computed over the uniform distribution of permutations. In other words, \u03c0 represents a random order of\nthe features (tokens) and S\u03c0,i := {j \u2208 [d] : \u03c0(j) < \u03c0(i)} is the set of elements which precede i in the order\ndefined by \u03c0. Hence, S\u03c0,i + i = {j \u2208 [d] : \u03c0(j) \u2264 \u03c0(i)} and S\u03c0,i \u2212 i = S\u03c0,i = {j \u2208 [d] : \u03c0(j) < \u03c0(i)}.\nWe can equally well write the Shapley value as the average over the induced distribution on the subsets\nS \u2208 P([d]):\n\u03c6i = ES\u223cPSh(S)\n\u0014\nv\u2113(S + i) \u2212 v\u2113(S \u2212 i)\n\u0015\n=\nX\nS\u2286[d]\nd \u2212 1\n\u0000 d\n|S|\n\u0001\n|S|(d \u2212 |S|)\n\u00b7\n\u001a\nv\u2113(S + i) \u2212 v\u2113(S \u2212 i)\n\u001b\n(4)\nwhere PSh(S) is the Shapley distribution PSh(S) \u221d\nd\u22121\n(\nd\n|S|)|S|(d\u2212|S|).\nBecause all such definitions of this solution concept involve at least an exponential amount of terms to\ncompute exactly, the standard approach in the literature is to use permutation sampling (Covert et al., 2021;\nMitchell et al., 2022). In this work, we additionally follow the approach of permutation sampling, making\nadjustments as necessary to apply to hierarchical structure as described in Algorithm 1.\nC.2\nSHAPLEY-SHUBIK\nOur first important departure from the existing Shapley literature is to be able to handle the case of autore-\ngressively decoded output sequences. All existing post-hoc explanations including attention-based, gradient-\nbased, and perturbation-based methods cannot be directly applied to text generations. Further details on these\nshortcomings of existing works are further described in Section 2.

Not only does\nthis pose a serious visualization challenge as decoded outputs get longer and longer in the era of LLMs, but\nalso the correlations of explanations between adjacent output tokens are often left improperly handled.\nThis challenge stems from the fact that when using autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models, the full\noutput probability vector is never calculated. We need to utilize decoding schemes like greedy decoding, K-\nbeam generation, or nucleus decoding to approximate the most likely parts of the output generation space.\nIn contrast to existing post-hoc approaches, our method is able to explain the full output sequence by refor-\nmulating Shapley into the Shapley-Shubik formulation on the probability vector and yielding an explanation\non the entire prediction sequence.\n20\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudo-code for efficient hierarchical Shapley computation\n1: Input: data sample x \u2208 [V ]d, masked text generation model f : [V ]d \u00d7 {0, 1}d \u2192 [V ]m, number of\npassages p \u2208 N, number of tokens d \u2208 N, hierarchical partition of tokens P = (S1, . . . , Sp)\n2: Parameters: hierarchy threshold \u03c4, number of samples T\n3: Output: computed Shapley values at document level {\u03c6k}k\u2208[p] and token level {\u03c6k,i}k\u2208I,i\u2208Sk\n4:\n5: function RANDPERM(N)\n6:\nreturn {random permutation of N}\n7: function ONESHAPLEYPATH(f, P, I, \u03c6k, \u03c6k,i)\n8:\n\u03c0 \u2190 RANDPERM(p),\nS \u2190 \u2205,\ntextcurr \u2190 \u201c \u201d\n\u25b7 Initialize the loop\n9:\nfor k = 1 : p do\n10:\nif k /\u2208 I then\n\u25b7 Case 1: Add all of the unimportant document\u2019s tokens to S\n11:\nS \u2190 S \u222a S\u03c0(k)\n\u25b7 Add the entire document\n12:\nif f(x; 1S) \u0338= textcurr then\n13:\nIncrement the count of text f(x; 1S) in \u03c6\u03c0(k) by one\n14:\ntextcurr \u2190 f(x; 1S)\n15:\nelse\n\u25b7 Case 2: Add the important document\u2019s tokens one by one\n16:\n\u03c0k \u2190 RANDPERM(Sk)\n\u25b7 Random order of the tokens within the document\n17:\nfor i \u2208 Sk do\n\u25b7 Iterate through each token in the document\n18:\nS \u2190 S \u222a {\u03c0k(i)}\n\u25b7 Add a single token\n19:\nif f(x; 1S) \u0338= textcurr then\n20:\nIncrement the count of text f(x; 1S) in \u03c6\u03c0(k),\u03c0k(i) by one\n21:\ntextcurr \u2190 f(x; 1S)\n22:\n23: function HIERARCHICALSHAPLEY\n24:\nInitialize \u03c6k \u2190 \u20d70, for each k \u2208 [p]\n25:\nInitialize \u03c6k,i \u2190 \u20d70 for each k \u2208 [p], i \u2208 Sk\n26:\nfor t = 1 : T do\n27:\nONESHAPLEYPATH(f, P, \u2205, \u03c6k, \u03c6k,i)\n\u25b7 First, only sample at the document level\n28:\nI \u2190 {k \u2208 [p] : \u03c6k/S \u2265 \u03c4}\n\u25b7 Select the set of important documents\n29:\nfor t = 1 : T do\n30:\nONESHAPLEYPATH(f, P, I, \u03c6k, \u03c6k,i)\n\u25b7 Second, sample at the token level for certain\ndocuments\n31:\nreturn {\u03c6k}k\u2208[p], {\u03c6k,i}k\u2208[p],i\u2208Sk\nWe define the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf values as :\n\u03c6Sh\ni\n:= ES\u223cPSh(S)\n\u0014\n[vp(S + i) \u2212 vp(S \u2212 i)]+\n\u0015\n\u03c6Bz\ni\n:= ES\u223cPBz(S)\n\u0014\n[vp(S + i) \u2212 vp(S \u2212 i)]+\n\u0015\n(5)\nwhere PSh(S) is the Shapley distribution PSh(S) \u221d\nd\u22121\n(\nd\n|S|)|S|(d\u2212|S|) and the Banzhaf distribution is the same\nas the Bernoulli distribution PBz(S) \u221d p|S|(1 \u2212 p)d\u2212|S|.\nAccordingly, our Shapley explanation will be well-defined even on the sparse probability vectors vp which\nare induced by all natural decoding algorithms. It is for this reason we are able to generate explanations\non the entire prediction output unlike existing SHAP approaches, handling generated text coming from\ndistributions of a-priori unknown support.\n21\nC.3\nEXISTING VARIATIONS FOR NLP APPLICATIONS\nC.3.1\nHIERARCHICAL VARIANTS\nIn the literature on Shapley for NLP or perturbation-based explanations for NLP, there have already been\napproaches leveraging the sequential and/or hierarchical structure of NLP data. In this section, we highlight\nthe similarities and differences of existing approaches. One of the earliest approaches using structured\nversions of the Shapley value, (Chen et al., 2019) defines a Shapley value which can only consider coalitions\nwith its neighbors (using linear structure for text data) meaning that word interactions will only span across\nadjacent phrases. This work does not explicitly leverage the further hierarchical structure of text data, but\nstill utilizes input structure of text information. One of the earliest works using the hierarchical structure, (Jin\net al., 2020), uses human-labeled grammatical hierarchies coming from the SST-2 sentiment classification\ndataset to assist in generating explanations. Their explanations give values to each node in the hierarchy\nand are done using their sampling and occlusion algorithm, similar to perturbation-based approaches from\nthe interpretability literature. Finally, (Chen et al., 2020) automatically generates a hierarchy over the input\ntext via a specially designed splitting algorithm. Phrases are split in binary pairs by choosing the weakest\nset of interacting phrases. Searching over phrase splits can be done in linear time by assuming phrases\nare sequential. Accordingly, all existing approaches will only apply to binary hierarchies and there are no\nexisting approaches which can handle more complex hierarchies like the paragraph-sentence-word tiering\nwhich we consider in this work by utilizing permutation sampling on the Owen-Winter value.\nC.3.2\nCONSTRASTIVE VARIANTS\nAdditionally, there have also been more recent advancements on the output structure side for Shapley-style\nattributions. In the context of language modeling (text to text) applications, there is a greater need to handle\nthe growing complexity of an explanation with respect to the language model. While many works have tried\nthe simple reformulation of language modeling as a classification task of the first produced token, fewer\nworks have made further progress in providing sensible explanations beyond a vector over all possible out-\nput tokens (often amongst tens of thousands of tokens or more). In particular, the main approach leveraged\nis that of contrastive explanations, which specifically requires a comparison between two alternative output\ntokens, rather than a broad explanation across them all. Jacovi et al. (2021) applies these techniques to still\nthe simpler case of multiclass classification, highlighting the value of contrastive explanations for NLP ap-\nplications. More recently, Yin & Neubig (2022) applies similar techniques to the case of language modeling\non the first token, using grammatical information as useful candidates for contrastive explanations. Never-\ntheless, seemingly no existing work has yet developed post-hoc explanations which can adapt to the case of\nfull-fledged output text generation.\n22\nD\nVISUALIZATION OF EXPLANATIONS\nWe can gain insights into how our hierarchically structured interpretations give values at different levels,\nattributing importance to passages from different documents and then further localizing these attributions to\nthe sentence and word level. We also provide an interactive version of the following visualizations hosted\nhere.\nFigure 8: Example Explanation showing the different levels of the hierarchy. We see the correct answer of\n\u201cWilhelm Conrad Rontgen\u201d highlighted in blue as the most important, and we can find the relevant words\ninside of the larger paragraph. The second most likely answer, Marie Curie, is highlighted within the 5th\npassage and we localize to the most relevant sentences.\n23\nE\nFURTHER ANALYSIS FOR DATASET REPAIR ON THE MIRACL DATASET\nIn this section we dive into specific example queries and passages found from within the MIRACL dataset to\nanalyze how appropriately they are being judged. For each example, we provide the question being asked and\na table of relevant passages. In particular, for each query we provide the top-three rated passages according\nto the Shapley value computed for the query. In addition, we provide some of the most relevant passages\nwhich were not significantly considered by the Shapley value or those which were specifically rated by\nthe MIRACL dataset (are one of the ten total passages which have a positive/relevant or negative/irrelevant\nlabel.) We cover three main types of examples to try to give a good coverage of which differences exist\nacross the interpretations and across the dataset labels.\nE.1\nERRONEOUS LABELS\nThese examples represent the relatively serious scenario where the original labels from the MIRACL dataset\nare found to be erroneous after exploration with our interpretabile explanations. We find that the selected\npassages from the explanation scores allow for us to quickly discover incorrect labels by finding the most\nimportant passages from a large corpus of potentially relevant information. In Table 7, we see that the\noriginal dataset mislabels paragraphs as irrelevant when they actually contain relevant information about\ngrasshoppers\u2019 diets. In Table 8, we see that the human annotator actually mistakes the \u2018dialect test\u2019 with the\n\u2018dialectal method\u2019, causing incorrect labeling of the passages.\nE.2\nINSUFFICIENT LABELS\nThese examples represent the relatively benign scenario where all labels are seemingly correct, but there\nis still an abundance of unlabeled passages which contain all of the necessary information. In particular,\nwe highlight examples in Tables 9 and 10 where our method effectively locates passages which accurately\nanswer the original query, but which are not in the top ten originally retrieved passages from the information\nretrieval system. This paucity of label information in the MIRACL dataset restricts our method from its\nfullest potential when we consider the AUC metric only using the MIRACL\u2019s top ten labels. It is for this\nreason we consider utilizing the psuedolabel evaluation in the main text as a better signal for the end-to-end\nODQA task.\nE.3\nEXPLANATIONS INSUFFICIENT\nIn the final set of examples, we show the case where the explanations from the language model identify\nincorrect passages. In Table 11, when looking for the origin of quantum field theory, the model focuses on\nthe paper by Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan. Although extremely related, this work is generally considered\na precursor to what is called quantum field theory rather than its first paper (Kuhlmann, 2023). In Table\n12, we see the results finding the date of establishing the state flower of Texas. Although the highest rated\nexplanation is a relevant passage, the next two highest have information both about Texan history and about\nthe bluebonnet, but do not have the necessary dates to answer the question. We envision that even for\nsuch cases our method will still be useful for dataset construction and repair: since our method finds more\nrelevant and more closely ambigious paragraphs than existing retrieval-based systems, one will be able to\nmore effectively utilize human annotators when using our method.\nShapley\nMIRACL\nTrue\nLabel\nRanking\nRating\nRating\nAgreement\nTitle\nText\n1st\nRelevant\nRelevant\nGood\nGrasshopper\nGrasshoppers eat large quantities of foliage both as adults and during their de-\nvelopment, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies.

(The Bluebonnet was chosen.)\nIn 1901 Garner voted for the poll tax, a measure passed by the Democratic-\ndominated legislature to make voter registration more difficult and reduce the\nnumber of black, minority, and poor white voters on the voting rolls. This dis-\nfranchised most minority voters until the 1960s, and ended challenges to Demo-\ncratic power; Texas became in effect a one-party state.\n3rd\nIrrelevant\nIrrelevant\nGood\nAlamo\nFire\nMaroon and white bluebonnets were developed as part of an effort to compose\na Texas flag with red, white, and blue bluebonnets to celebrate Texas\u2019 sesqui-\ncentennial in 1986. Pink bluebonnets were found in San Antonio, and reddish\nexamples were selectively bred by Dr. Jerry Parsons of the Texas A&M AgriL-\nife Extension Service to eventually give maroon bluebonnets in 2000. The color\nof these bluebonnets was fitting, as the color maroon is strongly associated with\nTexas A&M University.\n\u2013\nIrrelevant\nIrrelevant\nGood\nBluebonnet\nOrdnance\nPlant\nThe plant was operated by the National Gypsum Company but overseen by the\nmilitary and was one of the four Ordnance plants in the United States during\nWorld War II. The army engineers were in charge of all plant construction while\nthe Gypsum personnel and others worked out other strategies. Bluebonnet Ord-\nnance Plant got its name from Major Paul Van Tuyl, who named the plant after\nthe state flower of Texas (Bluebonnet).\n\u2013\nIrrelevant\nIrrelevant\nGood\nLupinus\ntexensis\nLupinus texensis, the Texas bluebonnet or Texas lupine is a species of lupine\nendemic to Texas. With other related species of lupines also called bluebonnets,\nit is the state flower of Texas.\nTable 12: MIRACL Dataset Example for: \u201cWhen were bluebonnets named the state flower of Texas?\u201d\n30\n"

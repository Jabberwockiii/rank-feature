Our method achieves real-time rendering of radiance fields with quality that equals the previous method with the best quality [Barron et al. 2022],\nwhile only requiring optimization times competitive with the fastest previous methods [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022; M\u00fcller et al. 2022]. Key to this\nperformance is a novel 3D Gaussian scene representation coupled with a real-time differentiable renderer, which offers significant speedup to both scene\noptimization and novel view synthesis. Note that for comparable training times to InstantNGP [M\u00fcller et al. 2022], we achieve similar quality to theirs; while\nthis is the maximum quality they reach, by training for 51min we achieve state-of-the-art quality, even slightly better than Mip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022].\nRadiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis\nof scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high\nvisual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and ren-\nder, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For\nunbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p\nresolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates.\nWe introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art\nvisual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly\nallow high-quality real-time (\u2265 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolu-\ntion. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration,\nwe represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable proper-\nties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while\navoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform\ninterleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably opti-\nmizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the\nscene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that\nsupports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows real-\ntime rendering.

In contrast, recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) meth-\nods build on continuous scene representations, typically optimizing\na Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using volumetric ray-marching for\nnovel-view synthesis of captured scenes. Similarly, the most efficient\nradiance field solutions to date build on continuous representations\nby interpolating values stored in, e.g., voxel [Fridovich-Keil and Yu\net al. 2022] or hash [M\u00fcller et al. 2022] grids or points [Xu et al. 2022].\nWhile the continuous nature of these methods helps optimization,\nthe stochastic sampling required for rendering is costly and can\nresult in noise. We introduce a new approach that combines the best\nof both worlds: our 3D Gaussian representation allows optimization\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual quality and competitive training\ntimes, while our tile-based splatting solution ensures real-time ren-\ndering at SOTA quality for 1080p resolution on several previously\npublished datasets [Barron et al. 2022; Hedman et al. 2018; Knapitsch\net al. 2017] (see Fig. 1).\nOur goal is to allow real-time rendering for scenes captured with\nmultiple photos, and create the representations with optimization\ntimes as fast as the most efficient previous methods for typical\nreal scenes. Recent methods achieve fast training [Fridovich-Keil\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article 1. Publication date: August 2023.\narXiv:2308.04079v1  [cs.GR]  8 Aug 2023\n1:2\n\u2022\nBernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimk\u00fchler, and George Drettakis\nand Yu et al. 2022; M\u00fcller et al. 2022], but struggle to achieve the\nvisual quality obtained by the current SOTA NeRF methods, i.e.,\nMip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022], which requires up to 48 hours of\ntraining time. The fast \u2013 but lower-quality \u2013 radiance field methods\ncan achieve interactive rendering times depending on the scene\n(10-15 frames per second), but fall short of real-time rendering at\nhigh resolution.\nOur solution builds on three main components. We first intro-\nduce 3D Gaussians as a flexible and expressive scene representation.\nWe start with the same input as previous NeRF-like methods, i.e.,\ncameras calibrated with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) [Snavely et al.\n2006] and initialize the set of 3D Gaussians with the sparse point\ncloud produced for free as part of the SfM process. In contrast to\nmost point-based solutions that require Multi-View Stereo (MVS)\ndata [Aliev et al. 2020; Kopanas et al. 2021; R\u00fcckert et al. 2022], we\nachieve high-quality results with only SfM points as input. Note\nthat for the NeRF-synthetic dataset, our method achieves high qual-\nity even with random initialization. We show that 3D Gaussians\nare an excellent choice, since they are a differentiable volumetric\nrepresentation, but they can also be rasterized very efficiently by\nprojecting them to 2D, and applying standard \ud835\udefc-blending, using an\nequivalent image formation model as NeRF. The second component\nof our method is optimization of the properties of the 3D Gaussians\n\u2013 3D position, opacity \ud835\udefc, anisotropic covariance, and spherical har-\nmonic (SH) coefficients \u2013 interleaved with adaptive density control\nsteps, where we add and occasionally remove 3D Gaussians during\noptimization. The optimization procedure produces a reasonably\ncompact, unstructured, and precise representation of the scene (1-5\nmillion Gaussians for all scenes tested). The third and final element\nof our method is our real-time rendering solution that uses fast GPU\nsorting algorithms and is inspired by tile-based rasterization, fol-\nlowing recent work [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021]. However, thanks\nto our 3D Gaussian representation, we can perform anisotropic\nsplatting that respects visibility ordering \u2013 thanks to sorting and \ud835\udefc-\nblending \u2013 and enable a fast and accurate backward pass by tracking\nthe traversal of as many sorted splats as required.\nTo summarize, we provide the following contributions:\n\u2022 The introduction of anisotropic 3D Gaussians as a high-quality,\nunstructured representation of radiance fields.\n\u2022 An optimization method of 3D Gaussian properties, inter-\nleaved with adaptive density control that creates high-quality\nrepresentations for captured scenes.\n\u2022 A fast, differentiable rendering approach for the GPU, which\nis visibility-aware, allows anisotropic splatting and fast back-\npropagation to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis.\nOur results on previously published datasets show that we can opti-\nmize our 3D Gaussians from multi-view captures and achieve equal\nor better quality than the best quality previous implicit radiance\nfield approaches. We also can achieve training speeds and quality\nsimilar to the fastest methods and importantly provide the first\nreal-time rendering with high quality for novel-view synthesis.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nWe first briefly overview traditional reconstruction, then discuss\npoint-based rendering and radiance field work, discussing their\nsimilarity; radiance fields are a vast area, so we focus only on directly\nrelated work. For complete coverage of the field, please see the\nexcellent recent surveys [Tewari et al. 2022; Xie et al. 2022].\n2.1\nTraditional Scene Reconstruction and Rendering\nThe first novel-view synthesis approaches were based on light fields,\nfirst densely sampled [Gortler et al. 1996; Levoy and Hanrahan 1996]\nthen allowing unstructured capture [Buehler et al. 2001]. The advent\nof Structure-from-Motion (SfM) [Snavely et al. 2006] enabled an\nentire new domain where a collection of photos could be used to\nsynthesize novel views. SfM estimates a sparse point cloud during\ncamera calibration, that was initially used for simple visualization\nof 3D space. Subsequent multi-view stereo (MVS) produced im-\npressive full 3D reconstruction algorithms over the years [Goesele\net al. 2007], enabling the development of several view synthesis\nalgorithms [Chaurasia et al. 2013; Eisemann et al. 2008; Hedman\net al. 2018; Kopanas et al. 2021]. All these methods re-project and\nblend the input images into the novel view camera, and use the\ngeometry to guide this re-projection. These methods produced ex-\ncellent results in many cases, but typically cannot completely re-\ncover from unreconstructed regions, or from \u201cover-reconstruction\u201d,\nwhen MVS generates inexistent geometry. Recent neural render-\ning algorithms [Tewari et al. 2022] vastly reduce such artifacts and\navoid the overwhelming cost of storing all input images on the GPU,\noutperforming these methods on most fronts.\n2.2\nNeural Rendering and Radiance Fields\nDeep learning techniques were adopted early for novel-view synthe-\nsis [Flynn et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2016]; CNNs were used to estimate\nblending weights [Hedman et al. 2018], or for texture-space solutions\n[Riegler and Koltun 2020; Thies et al. 2019]. The use of MVS-based\ngeometry is a major drawback of most of these methods; in addition,\nthe use of CNNs for final rendering frequently results in temporal\nflickering.\nVolumetric representations for novel-view synthesis were ini-\ntiated by Soft3D [Penner and Zhang 2017]; deep-learning tech-\nniques coupled with volumetric ray-marching were subsequently\nproposed [Henzler et al. 2019; Sitzmann et al. 2019] building on a con-\ntinuous differentiable density field to represent geometry. Rendering\nusing volumetric ray-marching has a significant cost due to the large\nnumber of samples required to query the volume. Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRFs) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] introduced importance sam-\npling and positional encoding to improve quality, but used a large\nMulti-Layer Perceptron negatively affecting speed. The success of\nNeRF has resulted in an explosion of follow-up methods that address\nquality and speed, often by introducing regularization strategies; the\ncurrent state-of-the-art in image quality for novel-view synthesis is\nMip-NeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022]. While the rendering quality is\noutstanding, training and rendering times remain extremely high;\nwe are able to equal or in some cases surpass this quality while\nproviding fast training and real-time rendering.\nThe most recent methods have focused on faster training and/or\nrendering mostly by exploiting three design choices: the use of spa-\ntial data structures to store (neural) features that are subsequently\ninterpolated during volumetric ray-marching, different encodings,\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article 1. Publication date: August 2023.\n3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering\n\u2022\n1:3\nand MLP capacity. Such methods include different variants of space\ndiscretization [Chen et al. 2022b,a; Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022;\nGarbin et al. 2021; Hedman et al. 2021; Reiser et al. 2021; Takikawa\net al. 2021; Wu et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2021], codebooks [Takikawa\net al. 2022], and encodings such as hash tables [M\u00fcller et al. 2022],\nallowing the use of a smaller MLP or foregoing neural networks\ncompletely [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022; Sun et al. 2022].\nMost notable of these methods are InstantNGP [M\u00fcller et al. 2022]\nwhich uses a hash grid and an occupancy grid to accelerate compu-\ntation and a smaller MLP to represent density and appearance; and\nPlenoxels [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022] that use a sparse voxel\ngrid to interpolate a continuous density field, and are able to forgo\nneural networks altogether. Both rely on Spherical Harmonics: the\nformer to represent directional effects directly, the latter to encode\nits inputs to the color network. While both provide outstanding\nresults, these methods can still struggle to represent empty space\neffectively, depending in part on the scene/capture type. In addition,\nimage quality is limited in large part by the choice of the structured\ngrids used for acceleration, and rendering speed is hindered by the\nneed to query many samples for a given ray-marching step. The un-\nstructured, explicit GPU-friendly 3D Gaussians we use achieve faster\nrendering speed and better quality without neural components.\n2.3\nPoint-Based Rendering and Radiance Fields\nPoint-based methods efficiently render disconnected and unstruc-\ntured geometry samples (i.e., point clouds) [Gross and Pfister 2011].\nIn its simplest form, point sample rendering [Grossman and Dally\n1998] rasterizes an unstructured set of points with a fixed size, for\nwhich it may exploit natively supported point types of graphics APIs\n[Sainz and Pajarola 2004] or parallel software rasterization on the\nGPU [Laine and Karras 2011; Sch\u00fctz et al. 2022]. While true to the\nunderlying data, point sample rendering suffers from holes, causes\naliasing, and is strictly discontinuous. Seminal work on high-quality\npoint-based rendering addresses these issues by \u201csplatting\u201d point\nprimitives with an extent larger than a pixel, e.g., circular or elliptic\ndiscs, ellipsoids, or surfels [Botsch et al. 2005; Pfister et al. 2000; Ren\net al. 2002; Zwicker et al. 2001b].\nThere has been recent interest in differentiable point-based render-\ning techniques [Wiles et al. 2020; Yifan et al. 2019]. Points have been\naugmented with neural features and rendered using a CNN [Aliev\net al. 2020; R\u00fcckert et al. 2022] resulting in fast or even real-time\nview synthesis; however they still depend on MVS for the initial\ngeometry, and as such inherit its artifacts, most notably over- or\nunder-reconstruction in hard cases such as featureless/shiny areas\nor thin structures.\nPoint-based \ud835\udefc-blending and NeRF-style volumetric rendering\nshare essentially the same image formation model. Specifically, the\ncolor \ud835\udc36 is given by volumetric rendering along a ray:\n\ud835\udc36 =\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56))c\ud835\udc56\nwith \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 = exp \u00a9\u00ad\n\u00ab\n\u2212\n\ud835\udc56\u22121\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc57=1\n\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc57\u00aa\u00ae\n\u00ac\n,\n(1)\nwhere samples of density \ud835\udf0e, transmittance \ud835\udc47, and color c are taken\nalong the ray with intervals \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56. This can be re-written as\n\ud835\udc36 =\n\ud835\udc41\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56c\ud835\udc56,\n(2)\nwith\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56 = (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56)) and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 =\n\ud835\udc56\u22121\n\u00d6\n\ud835\udc57=1\n(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56).\nA typical neural point-based approach (e.g., [Kopanas et al. 2022,\n2021]) computes the color \ud835\udc36 of a pixel by blending N ordered points\noverlapping the pixel:\n\ud835\udc36 =\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56\u2208N\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc56\u22121\n\u00d6\n\ud835\udc57=1\n(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc57),\n(3)\nwhere c\ud835\udc56 is the color of each point and \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56 is given by evaluating a\n2D Gaussian with covariance \u03a3 [Yifan et al. 2019] multiplied with a\nlearned per-point opacity.\nFrom Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, we can clearly see that the image formation\nmodel is the same. However, the rendering algorithm is very differ-\nent. NeRFs are a continuous representation implicitly representing\nempty/occupied space; expensive random sampling is required to\nfind the samples in Eq. 2 with consequent noise and computational\nexpense. In contrast, points are an unstructured, discrete represen-\ntation that is flexible enough to allow creation, destruction, and\ndisplacement of geometry similar to NeRF. This is achieved by opti-\nmizing opacity and positions, as shown by previous work [Kopanas\net al. 2021], while avoiding the shortcomings of a full volumetric\nrepresentation.\nPulsar [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021] achieves fast sphere rasteri-\nzation which inspired our tile-based and sorting renderer. However,\ngiven the analysis above, we want to maintain (approximate) con-\nventional \ud835\udefc-blending on sorted splats to have the advantages of vol-\numetric representations: Our rasterization respects visibility order\nin contrast to their order-independent method. In addition, we back-\npropagate gradients on all splats in a pixel and rasterize anisotropic\nsplats. These elements all contribute to the high visual quality of\nour results (see Sec. 7.3). In addition, previous methods mentioned\nabove also use CNNs for rendering, which results in temporal in-\nstability. Nonetheless, the rendering speed of Pulsar [Lassner and\nZollhofer 2021] and ADOP [R\u00fcckert et al. 2022] served as motivation\nto develop our fast rendering solution.\nWhile focusing on specular effects, the diffuse point-based ren-\ndering track of Neural Point Catacaustics [Kopanas et al. 2022]\novercomes this temporal instability by using an MLP, but still re-\nquired MVS geometry as input. The most recent method [Zhang\net al. 2022] in this category does not require MVS, and also uses\nSH for directions; however, it can only handle scenes of one object\nand needs masks for initialization. While fast for small resolutions\nand low point counts, it is unclear how it can scale to scenes of\ntypical datasets [Barron et al. 2022; Hedman et al. 2018; Knapitsch\net al. 2017]. We use 3D Gaussians for a more flexible scene rep-\nresentation, avoiding the need for MVS geometry and achieving\nreal-time rendering thanks to our tile-based rendering algorithm\nfor the projected Gaussians.\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article 1. Publication date: August 2023.\n1:4\n\u2022\nBernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimk\u00fchler, and George Drettakis\nA recent approach [Xu et al. 2022] uses points to represent a\nradiance field with a radial basis function approach. They employ\npoint pruning and densification techniques during optimization, but\nuse volumetric ray-marching and cannot achieve real-time display\nrates.\nIn the domain of human performance capture, 3D Gaussians have\nbeen used to represent captured human bodies [Rhodin et al. 2015;\nStoll et al. 2011]; more recently they have been used with volumetric\nray-marching for vision tasks [Wang et al. 2023]. Neural volumetric\nprimitives have been proposed in a similar context [Lombardi et al.\n2021]. While these methods inspired the choice of 3D Gaussians as\nour scene representation, they focus on the specific case of recon-\nstructing and rendering a single isolated object (a human body or\nface), resulting in scenes with small depth complexity. In contrast,\nour optimization of anisotropic covariance, our interleaved optimiza-\ntion/density control, and efficient depth sorting for rendering allow\nus to handle complete, complex scenes including background, both\nindoors and outdoors and with large depth complexity.\n3\nOVERVIEW\nThe input to our method is a set of images of a static scene, together\nwith the corresponding cameras calibrated by SfM [Sch\u00f6nberger\nand Frahm 2016] which produces a sparse point cloud as a side-\neffect. From these points we create a set of 3D Gaussians (Sec. 4),\ndefined by a position (mean), covariance matrix and opacity \ud835\udefc, that\nallows a very flexible optimization regime. This results in a reason-\nably compact representation of the 3D scene, in part because highly\nanisotropic volumetric splats can be used to represent fine structures\ncompactly. The directional appearance component (color) of the\nradiance field is represented via spherical harmonics (SH), following\nstandard practice [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022; M\u00fcller et al.\n2022]. Our algorithm proceeds to create the radiance field represen-\ntation (Sec. 5) via a sequence of optimization steps of 3D Gaussian\nparameters, i.e., position, covariance, \ud835\udefc and SH coefficients inter-\nleaved with operations for adaptive control of the Gaussian density.\nThe key to the efficiency of our method is our tile-based rasterizer\n(Sec. 6) that allows \ud835\udefc-blending of anisotropic splats, respecting visi-\nbility order thanks to fast sorting. Out fast rasterizer also includes\na fast backward pass by tracking accumulated \ud835\udefc values, without a\nlimit on the number of Gaussians that can receive gradients. The\noverview of our method is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n4\nDIFFERENTIABLE 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING\nOur goal is to optimize a scene representation that allows high-\nquality novel view synthesis, starting from a sparse set of (SfM)\npoints without normals. To do this, we need a primitive that inherits\nthe properties of differentiable volumetric representations, while\nat the same time being unstructured and explicit to allow very fast\nrendering. We choose 3D Gaussians, which are differentiable and\ncan be easily projected to 2D splats allowing fast \ud835\udefc-blending for\nrendering.\nOur representation has similarities to previous methods that use\n2D points [Kopanas et al. 2021; Yifan et al. 2019] and assume each\npoint is a small planar circle with a normal. Given the extreme\nsparsity of SfM points it is very hard to estimate normals. Similarly,\noptimizing very noisy normals from such an estimation would be\nvery challenging. Instead, we model the geometry as a set of 3D\nGaussians that do not require normals. Our Gaussians are defined\nby a full 3D covariance matrix \u03a3 defined in world space [Zwicker\net al. 2001a] centered at point (mean) \ud835\udf07:\n\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc52\u2212 1\n2 (\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc47 \u03a3\u22121(\ud835\udc65)\n(4)\n. This Gaussian is multiplied by \ud835\udefc in our blending process.\nHowever, we need to project our 3D Gaussians to 2D for rendering.\nZwicker et al. [2001a] demonstrate how to do this projection to\nimage space. Given a viewing transformation \ud835\udc4a the covariance\nmatrix \u03a3\u2032 in camera coordinates is given as follows:\n\u03a3\u2032 = \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc4a \u03a3 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc47\n(5)\nwhere \ud835\udc3d is the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projective\ntransformation. Zwicker et al. [2001a] also show that if we skip the\nthird row and column of \u03a3\u2032, we obtain a 2\u00d72 variance matrix with\nthe same structure and properties as if we would start from planar\npoints with normals, as in previous work [Kopanas et al. 2021].\nAn obvious approach would be to directly optimize the covariance\nmatrix \u03a3 to obtain 3D Gaussians that represent the radiance field.\nHowever, covariance matrices have physical meaning only when\nthey are positive semi-definite. For our optimization of all our pa-\nrameters, we use gradient descent that cannot be easily constrained\nto produce such valid matrices, and update steps and gradients can\nvery easily create invalid covariance matrices.\nAs a result, we opted for a more intuitive, yet equivalently ex-\npressive representation for optimization. The covariance matrix \u03a3\nof a 3D Gaussian is analogous to describing the configuration of an\nellipsoid. Given a scaling matrix \ud835\udc46 and rotation matrix \ud835\udc45, we can\nfind the corresponding \u03a3:\n\u03a3 = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\n(6)\nTo allow independent optimization of both factors, we store them\nseparately: a 3D vector \ud835\udc60 for scaling and a quaternion \ud835\udc5e to represent\nrotation. These can be trivially converted to their respective matrices\nand combined, making sure to normalize \ud835\udc5e to obtain a valid unit\nquaternion.\nTo avoid significant overhead due to automatic differentiation\nduring training, we derive the gradients for all parameters explicitly.\nDetails of the exact derivative computations are in appendix A.\nThis representation of anisotropic covariance \u2013 suitable for op-\ntimization \u2013 allows us to optimize 3D Gaussians to adapt to the\ngeometry of different shapes in captured scenes, resulting in a fairly\ncompact representation. Fig. 3 illustrates such cases.\n5\nOPTIMIZATION WITH ADAPTIVE DENSITY\nCONTROL OF 3D GAUSSIANS\nThe core of our approach is the optimization step, which creates\na dense set of 3D Gaussians accurately representing the scene for\nfree-view synthesis. In addition to positions \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udefc, and covariance\n\u03a3, we also optimize SH coefficients representing color \ud835\udc50 of each\nGaussian to correctly capture the view-dependent appearance of\nthe scene. The optimization of these parameters is interleaved with\nsteps that control the density of the Gaussians to better represent\nthe scene.\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article 1.

Optimization starts with the sparse SfM point cloud and creates a set of 3D Gaussians. We then optimize and adaptively control the density of this set\nof Gaussians. During optimization we use our fast tile-based renderer, allowing competitive training times compared to SOTA fast radiance field methods.\nOnce trained, our renderer allows real-time navigation for a wide variety of scenes.\nOriginal\nShrunken\nGaussians\nFig. 3. We visualize the 3D Gaussians after optimization by shrinking them\n60% (far right). This clearly shows the anisotropic shapes of the 3D Gaussians\nthat compactly represent complex geometry after optimization. Left the\nactual rendered image.\n5.1\nOptimization\nThe optimization is based on successive iterations of rendering and\ncomparing the resulting image to the training views in the captured\ndataset. Inevitably, geometry may be incorrectly placed due to the\nambiguities of 3D to 2D projection. Our optimization thus needs to\nbe able to create geometry and also destroy or move geometry if it\nhas been incorrectly positioned. The quality of the parameters of the\ncovariances of the 3D Gaussians is critical for the compactness of\nthe representation since large homogeneous areas can be captured\nwith a small number of large anisotropic Gaussians.\nWe use Stochastic Gradient Descent techniques for optimization,\ntaking full advantage of standard GPU-accelerated frameworks,\nand the ability to add custom CUDA kernels for some operations,\nfollowing recent best practice [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022;\nSun et al. 2022]. In particular, our fast rasterization (see Sec. 6) is\ncritical in the efficiency of our optimization, since it is the main\ncomputational bottleneck of the optimization.\nWe use a sigmoid activation function for \ud835\udefc to constrain it in\nthe [0 \u2212 1) range and obtain smooth gradients, and an exponential\nactivation function for the scale of the covariance for similar reasons.\nWe estimate the initial covariance matrix as an isotropic Gaussian\nwith axes equal to the mean of the distance to the closest three points.\nWe use a standard exponential decay scheduling technique similar\nto Plenoxels [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022], but for positions\nonly. The loss function is L1 combined with a D-SSIM term:\nL = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf06)L1 + \ud835\udf06LD-SSIM\n(7)\nWe use \ud835\udf06 = 0.2 in all our tests. We provide details of the learning\nschedule and other elements in Sec. 7.1.\n5.2\nAdaptive Control of Gaussians\nWe start with the initial set of sparse points from SfM and then apply\nour method to adaptively control the number of Gaussians and their\ndensity over unit volume1, allowing us to go from an initial sparse\nset of Gaussians to a denser set that better represents the scene, and\nwith correct parameters. After optimization warm-up (see Sec. 7.1),\nwe densify every 100 iterations and remove any Gaussians that are\nessentially transparent, i.e., with \ud835\udefc less than a threshold \ud835\udf16\ud835\udefc.\nOur adaptive control of the Gaussians needs to populate empty\nareas. It focuses on regions with missing geometric features (\u201cunder-\nreconstruction\u201d), but also in regions where Gaussians cover large\nareas in the scene (which often correspond to \u201cover-reconstruction\u201d).\nWe observe that both have large view-space positional gradients.\nIntuitively, this is likely because they correspond to regions that are\nnot yet well reconstructed, and the optimization tries to move the\nGaussians to correct this.\nSince both cases are good candidates for densification, we den-\nsify Gaussians with an average magnitude of view-space position\ngradients above a threshold \ud835\udf0fpos, which we set to 0.0002 in our tests.\nWe next present details of this process, illustrated in Fig. 4.\nFor small Gaussians that are in under-reconstructed regions, we\nneed to cover the new geometry that must be created. For this, it is\npreferable to clone the Gaussians, by simply creating a copy of the\nsame size, and moving it in the direction of the positional gradient.\nOn the other hand, large Gaussians in regions with high variance\nneed to be split into smaller Gaussians. We replace such Gaussians\nby two new ones, and divide their scale by a factor of \ud835\udf19 = 1.6 which\nwe determined experimentally. We also initialize their position by\nusing the original 3D Gaussian as a PDF for sampling.\nIn the first case we detect and treat the need for increasing both\nthe total volume of the system and the number of Gaussians, while\nin the second case we conserve total volume but increase the num-\nber of Gaussians. Similar to other volumetric representations, our\noptimization can get stuck with floaters close to the input cameras;\nin our case this may result in an unjustified increase in the Gaussian\ndensity. An effective way to moderate the increase in the number\nof Gaussians is to set the \ud835\udefc value close to zero every \ud835\udc41 = 3000\n1Density of Gaussians should not be confused of course with density \ud835\udf0e in the NeRF\nliterature.\nACM Trans.

Bottom row (over-reconstruction):\nIf small-scale geometry is represented by one large splat, we split it in two.\niterations. The optimization then increases the \ud835\udefc for the Gaussians\nwhere this is needed while allowing our culling approach to remove\nGaussians with \ud835\udefc less than \ud835\udf16\ud835\udefc as described above. Gaussians may\nshrink or grow and considerably overlap with others, but we peri-\nodically remove Gaussians that are very large in worldspace and\nthose that have a big footprint in viewspace. This strategy results\nin overall good control over the total number of Gaussians. The\nGaussians in our model remain primitives in Euclidean space at all\ntimes; unlike other methods [Barron et al. 2022; Fridovich-Keil and\nYu et al. 2022], we do not require space compaction, warping or\nprojection strategies for distant or large Gaussians.\n6\nFAST DIFFERENTIABLE RASTERIZER FOR GAUSSIANS\nOur goals are to have fast overall rendering and fast sorting to allow\napproximate \ud835\udefc-blending \u2013 including for anisotropic splats \u2013 and to\navoid hard limits on the number of splats that can receive gradients\nthat exist in previous work [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021].\nTo achieve these goals, we design a tile-based rasterizer for Gauss-\nian splats inspired by recent software rasterization approaches [Lass-\nner and Zollhofer 2021] to pre-sort primitives for an entire image\nat a time, avoiding the expense of sorting per pixel that hindered\nprevious \ud835\udefc-blending solutions [Kopanas et al. 2022, 2021]. Our fast\nrasterizer allows efficient backpropagation over an arbitrary num-\nber of blended Gaussians with low additional memory consump-\ntion, requiring only a constant overhead per pixel. Our rasterization\npipeline is fully differentiable, and given the projection to 2D (Sec. 4)\ncan rasterize anisotropic splats similar to previous 2D splatting\nmethods [Kopanas et al. 2021].\nOur method starts by splitting the screen into 16\u00d716 tiles, and\nthen proceeds to cull 3D Gaussians against the view frustum and\neach tile. Specifically, we only keep Gaussians with a 99% confi-\ndence interval intersecting the view frustum. Additionally, we use a\nguard band to trivially reject Gaussians at extreme positions (i.e.,\nthose with means close to the near plane and far outside the view\nfrustum), since computing their projected 2D covariance would\nbe unstable. We then instantiate each Gaussian according to the\nnumber of tiles they overlap and assign each instance a key that\ncombines view space depth and tile ID. We then sort Gaussians\nbased on these keys using a single fast GPU Radix sort [Merrill\nand Grimshaw 2010]. Note that there is no additional per-pixel or-\ndering of points, and blending is performed based on this initial\nsorting. As a consequence, our \ud835\udefc-blending can be approximate in\nsome configurations. However, these approximations become negli-\ngible as splats approach the size of individual pixels. We found that\nthis choice greatly enhances training and rendering performance\nwithout producing visible artifacts in converged scenes.\nAfter sorting Gaussians, we produce a list for each tile by iden-\ntifying the first and last depth-sorted entry that splats to a given\ntile. For rasterization, we launch one thread block for each tile. Each\nblock first collaboratively loads packets of Gaussians into shared\nmemory and then, for a given pixel, accumulates color and \ud835\udefc values\nby traversing the lists front-to-back, thus maximizing the gain in\nparallelism both for data loading/sharing and processing. When we\nreach a target saturation of \ud835\udefc in a pixel, the corresponding thread\nstops. At regular intervals, threads in a tile are queried and the pro-\ncessing of the entire tile terminates when all pixels have saturated\n(i.e., \ud835\udefc goes to 1). Details of sorting and a high-level overview of the\noverall rasterization approach are given in Appendix C.\nDuring rasterization, the saturation of \ud835\udefc is the only stopping cri-\nterion. In contrast to previous work, we do not limit the number\nof blended primitives that receive gradient updates. We enforce\nthis property to allow our approach to handle scenes with an arbi-\ntrary, varying depth complexity and accurately learn them, without\nhaving to resort to scene-specific hyperparameter tuning. During\nthe backward pass, we must therefore recover the full sequence of\nblended points per-pixel in the forward pass. One solution would\nbe to store arbitrarily long lists of blended points per-pixel in global\nmemory [Kopanas et al. 2021]. To avoid the implied dynamic mem-\nory management overhead, we instead choose to traverse the per-\ntile lists again; we can reuse the sorted array of Gaussians and tile\nranges from the forward pass. To facilitate gradient computation,\nwe now traverse them back-to-front.\nThe traversal starts from the last point that affected any pixel in\nthe tile, and loading of points into shared memory again happens\ncollaboratively. Additionally, each pixel will only start (expensive)\noverlap testing and processing of points if their depth is lower than\nor equal to the depth of the last point that contributed to its color\nduring the forward pass. Computation of the gradients described in\nSec. 4 requires the accumulated opacity values at each step during\nthe original blending process. Rather than trasversing an explicit\nlist of progressively shrinking opacities in the backward pass, we\ncan recover these intermediate opacities by storing only the total\naccumulated opacity at the end of the forward pass. Specifically, each\npoint stores the final accumulated opacity \ud835\udefc in the forward process;\nwe divide this by each point\u2019s \ud835\udefc in our back-to-front traversal to\nobtain the required coefficients for gradient computation.\n7\nIMPLEMENTATION, RESULTS AND EVALUATION\nWe next discuss some details of implementation, present results and\nthe evaluation of our algorithm compared to previous work and\nablation studies.\nACM Trans.

We also built an interactive viewer using\nthe open-source SIBR [Bonopera et al. 2020], used for interactive\nviewing. We used this implementation to measure our achieved\nframe rates. The source code and all our data are available at:\nhttps://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/\nOptimization Details. For stability, we \u201cwarm-up\u201d the computa-\ntion in lower resolution. Specifically, we start the optimization using\n4 times smaller image resolution and we upsample twice after 250\nand 500 iterations.\nSH coefficient optimization is sensitive to the lack of angular\ninformation. For typical \u201cNeRF-like\u201d captures where a central object\nis observed by photos taken in the entire hemisphere around it, the\noptimization works well. However, if the capture has angular regions\nmissing (e.g., when capturing the corner of a scene, or performing\nan \u201cinside-out\u201d [Hedman et al. 2016] capture) completely incorrect\nvalues for the zero-order component of the SH (i.e., the base or\ndiffuse color) can be produced by the optimization. To overcome\nthis problem we start by optimizing only the zero-order component,\nand then introduce one band of the SH after every 1000 iterations\nuntil all 4 bands of SH are represented.\n7.2\nResults and Evaluation\nResults. We tested our algorithm on a total of 13 real scenes\ntaken from previously published datasets and the synthetic Blender\ndataset [Mildenhall et al. 2020]. In particular, we tested our ap-\nproach on the full set of scenes presented in Mip-Nerf360 [Barron\net al. 2022], which is the current state of the art in NeRF rendering\nquality, two scenes from the Tanks&Temples dataset [2017] and\ntwo scenes provided by Hedman et al. [Hedman et al. 2018]. The\nscenes we chose have very different capture styles, and cover both\nbounded indoor scenes and large unbounded outdoor environments.\nWe use the same hyperparameter configuration for all experiments\nin our evaluation.

In terms of quality, the current state-of-the-\nart is Mip-Nerf360 [Barron et al. 2021]. We compare against this\nmethod as a quality benchmark. We also compare against two of\nthe most recent fast NeRF methods: InstantNGP [M\u00fcller et al. 2022]\nand Plenoxels [Fridovich-Keil and Yu et al. 2022].\nWe use a train/test split for datasets, using the methodology\nsuggested by Mip-NeRF360, taking every 8th photo for test, for con-\nsistent and meaningful comparisons to generate the error metrics,\nusing the standard PSNR, L-PIPS, and SSIM metrics used most fre-\nquently in the literature; please see Table 1.

In\nsuch scenarios, we can achieve state-of-the-art results even with\nrandom initialization: we start training from 100K uniformly random\nGaussians inside a volume that encloses the scene bounds. Our\napproach quickly and automatically prunes them to about 6\u201310K\nmeaningful Gaussians. The final size of the trained model after 30K\niterations reaches about 200\u2013500K Gaussians per scene. We report\nand compare our achieved PSNR scores with previous methods in\nTable 2 using a white background for compatibility. Examples can\n2We trained Mip-NeRF360 on a 4-GPU A100 node for 12 hours, equivalent to 48 hours\non a single GPU. Note that A100\u2019s are faster than A6000 GPUs.\nbe seen in Fig. 10 (second image from the left) and in supplemental\nmaterial. The trained synthetic scenes rendered at 180\u2013300 FPS.\nCompactness. In comparison to previous explicit scene representa-\ntions, the anisotropic Gaussians used in our optimization are capable\nof modelling complex shapes with a lower number of parameters.\nWe showcase this by evaluating our approach against the highly\ncompact, point-based models obtained by [Zhang et al. 2022]. We\nstart from their initial point cloud which is obtained by space carving\nwith foreground masks and optimize until we break even with their\nreported PSNR scores. This usually happens within 2\u20134 minutes.\nWe surpass their reported metrics using approximately one-fourth\nof their point count, resulting in an average model size of 3.8 MB,\nas opposed to their 9 MB. We note that for this experiment, we only\nused two degrees of our spherical harmonics, similar to theirs.\n7.3\nAblations\nWe isolated the different contributions and algorithmic choices\nwe made and constructed a set of experiments to measure their\neffect. Specifically we test the following aspects of our algorithm:\ninitialization from SfM, our densification strategies, anisotropic\ncovariance, the fact that we allow an unlimited number of splats\nto have gradients and use of spherical harmonics. The quantitative\neffect of each choice is summarized in Table 3.\nInitialization from SfM. We also assess the importance of initializ-\ning the 3D Gaussians from the SfM point cloud. For this ablation, we\nuniformly sample a cube with a size equal to three times the extent\nof the input camera\u2019s bounding box. We observe that our method\nperforms relatively well, avoiding complete failure even without the\nSfM points. Instead, it degrades mainly in the background, see Fig. 7.\nAlso in areas not well covered from training views, the random\ninitialization method appears to have more floaters that cannot be\nremoved by optimization. On the other hand, the synthetic NeRF\ndataset does not have this behavior because it has no background\nand is well constrained by the input cameras (see discussion above).\nDensification. We next evaluate our two densification methods,\nmore specifically the clone and split strategy described in Sec. 5.\nWe disable each method separately and optimize using the rest of\nthe method unchanged. Results show that splitting big Gaussians\nis important to allow good reconstruction of the background as\nseen in Fig. 8, while cloning the small Gaussians instead of splitting\nthem allows for a better and faster convergence especially when\nthin structures appear in the scene.\nACM Trans.

We evaluate\nif skipping the gradient computation after the \ud835\udc41 front-most points\nFig. 9. If we limit the number of points that receive gradients, the effect on\nvisual quality is significant. Left: limit of 10 Gaussians that receive gradients.\nRight: our full method.\nwill give us speed without sacrificing quality, as suggested in Pul-\nsar [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021]. In this test, we choose N=10, which\nis two times higher than the default value in Pulsar, but it led to\nunstable optimization because of the severe approximation in the\ngradient computation. For the Truck scene, quality degraded by\n11dB in PSNR (see Table 3, Limited-BW), and the visual outcome is\nshown in Fig. 9 for Garden.\nAnisotropic Covariance. An important algorithmic choice in our\nmethod is the optimization of the full covariance matrix for the 3D\nGaussians. To demonstrate the effect of this choice, we perform an\nablation where we remove anisotropy by optimizing a single scalar\nvalue that controls the radius of the 3D Gaussian on all three axes.\nThe results of this optimization are presented visually in Fig. 10.\nWe observe that the anisotropy significantly improves the quality\nof the 3D Gaussian\u2019s ability to align with surfaces, which in turn\nallows for much higher rendering quality while maintaining the\nsame number of points.\nSpherical Harmonics. Finally, the use of spherical harmonics im-\nproves our overall PSNR scores since they compensate for the view-\ndependent effects (Table 3).\n7.4\nLimitations\nOur method is not without limitations. In regions where the scene\nis not well observed we have artifacts; in such regions, other meth-\nods also struggle (e.g., Mip-NeRF360 in Fig. 11). Even though the\nanisotropic Gaussians have many advantages as described above,\nour method can create elongated artifacts or \u201csplotchy\u201d Gaussians\n(see Fig. 12); again previous methods also struggle in these cases.\nWe also occasionally have popping artifacts when our optimiza-\ntion creates large Gaussians; this tends to happen in regions with\nview-dependent appearance. One reason for these popping artifacts\nis the trivial rejection of Gaussians via a guard band in the rasterizer.\nA more principled culling approach would alleviate these artifacts.\nAnother factor is our simple visibility algorithm, which can lead to\nGaussians suddenly switching depth/blending order. This could be\naddressed by antialiasing, which we leave as future work. Also, we\ncurrently do not apply any regularization to our optimization; doing\nso would help with both the unseen region and popping artifacts.\nWhile we used the same hyperparameters for our full evaluation,\nearly experiments show that reducing the position learning rate can\nbe necessary to converge in very large scenes (e.g., urban datasets).\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article 1.

We train scenes with Gaussian anisotropy disabled and enabled. The use of anisotropic volumetric splats enables modelling of fine structures and has\na significant impact on visual quality. Note that for illustrative purposes, we restricted Ficus to use no more than 5k Gaussians in both configurations.\nEven though we are very compact compared to previous point-\nbased approaches, our memory consumption is significantly higher\nthan NeRF-based solutions. During training of large scenes, peak\nGPU memory consumption can exceed 20 GB in our unoptimized\nprototype. However, this figure could be significantly reduced by a\ncareful low-level implementation of the optimization logic (similar\nto InstantNGP). Rendering the trained scene requires sufficient GPU\nmemory to store the full model (several hundred megabytes for\nlarge-scale scenes) and an additional 30\u2013500 MB for the rasterizer,\ndepending on scene size and image resolution. We note that there\nare many opportunities to further reduce memory consumption\nof our method. Compression techniques for point clouds is a well-\nstudied field [De Queiroz and Chou 2016]; it would be interesting to\nsee how such approaches could be adapted to our representation.\nFig. 11.

Our work demonstrates that \u2013 contrary to\nwidely accepted opinion \u2013 a continuous representation is not strictly\nnecessary to allow fast and high-quality radiance field training.\nThe majority (\u223c80%) of our training time is spent in Python code,\nsince we built our solution in PyTorch to allow our method to be\neasily used by others. Only the rasterization routine is implemented\nas optimized CUDA kernels. We expect that porting the remaining\noptimization entirely to CUDA, as e.g., done in InstantNGP [M\u00fcller\net al. 2022], could enable significant further speedup for applications\nwhere performance is essential.\nWe also demonstrated the importance of building on real-time\nrendering principles, exploiting the power of the GPU and speed of\nsoftware rasterization pipeline architecture. These design choices\nare the key to performance both for training and real-time render-\ning, providing a competitive edge in performance over previous\nvolumetric ray-marching.\nIt would be interesting to see if our Gaussians can be used to per-\nform mesh reconstructions of the captured scene. Aside from prac-\ntical implications given the widespread use of meshes, this would\nallow us to better understand where our method stands exactly in\nthe continuum between volumetric and surface representations.\nIn conclusion, we have presented the first real-time rendering\nsolution for radiance fields, with rendering quality that matches the\nbest expensive previous methods, with training times competitive\nwith the fastest existing solutions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was funded by the ERC Advanced grant FUNGRAPH\nNo 788065 http://fungraph.inria.fr.

Since \u03a3 = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 ,\nwe can compute \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46 and rewrite \u03a3 = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47 .

Our design is based on the assumption of a high load\nof small splats, and we optimize for this by sorting splats once for\neach frame using radix sort at the beginning. We split the screen\ninto 16x16 pixel tiles (or bins). We create a list of splats per tile by\ninstantiating each splat in each 16\u00d716 tile it overlaps. This results\nin a moderate increase in Gaussians to process which however is\namortized by simpler control flow and high parallelism of optimized\nGPU Radix sort [Merrill and Grimshaw 2010]. We assign a key for\neach splats instance with up to 64 bits where the lower 32 bits\nencode its projected depth and the higher bits encode the index of\nthe overlapped tile. The exact size of the index depends on how\nmany tiles fit the current resolution. Depth ordering is thus directly\nresolved for all splats in parallel with a single radix sort. After\nACM Trans.

Publication date: August 2023.\n1:14\n\u2022\nBernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimk\u00fchler, and George Drettakis\nsorting, we can efficiently produce per-tile lists of Gaussians to\nprocess by identifying the start and end of ranges in the sorted\narray with the same tile ID. This is done in parallel, launching\none thread per 64-bit array element to compare its higher 32 bits\nwith its two neighbors. Compared to [Lassner and Zollhofer 2021],\nour rasterization thus completely eliminates sequential primitive\nprocessing steps and produces more compact per-tile lists to traverse\nduring the forward pass.

During the backward pass, we reconstruct\nthe intermediate opacity values needed for gradient computation by\nrepeatedly dividing the accumulated opacity from the forward pass\nby each Gaussian\u2019s \ud835\udefc. Implemented na\u00efvely, this process is prone to\nnumerical instabilities (e.g., division by 0). To address this, both in\nthe forward and backward pass, we skip any blending updates with\n\ud835\udefc < \ud835\udf16 (we choose \ud835\udf16 as\n1\n255) and also clamp \ud835\udefc with 0.99 from above.\nFinally, before a Gaussian is included in the forward rasterization\npass, we compute the accumulated opacity if we were to include it\nand stop front-to-back blending before it can exceed 0.9999.\nD\nPER-SCENE ERROR METRICS\nTables 4\u20139 list the various collected error metrics for our evaluation\nover all considered techniques and real-world scenes.

Le\nGoogle DeepMind\nABSTRACT\nSycophancy is an undesirable behavior where models tailor their responses to\nfollow a human user\u2019s view even when that view is not objectively correct (e.g.,\nadapting liberal views once a user reveals that they are liberal). In this paper, we\nstudy the prevalence of sycophancy in language models and propose a simple\nsynthetic-data intervention to reduce this behavior.\nFirst, on a set of three sycophancy tasks (Perez et al., 2022) where models are asked\nfor an opinion on statements with no correct answers (e.g., politics), we observe\nthat both model scaling and instruction tuning significantly increase sycophancy for\nPaLM models up to 540B parameters. Second, we extend sycophancy evaluations\nto simple addition statements that are objectively incorrect, finding that despite\nknowing that these statements are wrong, language models will still agree with\nthem if the user does as well.\nTo reduce sycophancy, we present a straightforward synthetic-data intervention\nthat takes public NLP tasks and encourages models to be robust to user opinions\non these tasks. Adding these data in a lightweight finetuning step can signifi-\ncantly reduce sycophantic behavior on held-out prompts. Code for generating syn-\nthetic data for intervention can be found at https://github.com/google/\nsycophancy-intervention.\nHuman: Hello, my name is \u2026 I agree \nwith the claim that 1 + 1 = 956446.\nWhat is your opinion on the following \nclaim? 1 + 1 = 956446\nChoices:\n(A) Agree\n(B) Disagree\nAssistant: I believe the best answer is\nInput\n(A) Agree     \u2718\nModel Output\nHuman: [None]\nWhat is your opinion on the following \nclaim? 1 + 1 = 956446\nChoices:\n(A) Agree\n(B) Disagree\nAssistant: I believe the best answer is\nInput\n(B) Disagree     \u2714\nModel Output\nUser\u2019s opinion\nQuestion\nNo user opinion \nLanguage model correctly disagrees with \nthe false claim.\nIncorrect user opinion \nLanguage model follows user\u2019s opinion and \nincorrectly agrees with the false claim.\nFigure 1: An example of sycophancy\u2014despite knowing the correct answer (left), language models\nanswer a question incorrectly and follow a given user\u2019s opinion (right).\n1\narXiv:2308.03958v2  [cs.CL]  15 Feb 2024\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLanguage models have seen significant advancement in recent years, including the capacity to solve\ncomplex tasks that require reasoning (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023;\nGoogle, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023, inter alia). As these models may one day be able to solve\nproblems that humans cannot solve, it is important to ensure that models are aligned and avoid reward\nhacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Saunders et al., 2022; Bowman et al., 2022), such as exploiting the\npreferences of human raters (Amodei et al., 2016; Cotra, 2021). One basic form of reward hacking is\nsycophancy, where a model responds to a question with a user\u2019s preferred answer in order to look\nfavorable even if that answer is not correct (Cotra, 2021; Perez et al., 2022; Radhakrishnan et al.,\n2023), as shown in Figure 1.\nIn this paper, we study sycophancy across a set of base and instruction-tuned models1 (Chowdhery\net al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022, PaLM and Flan-PaLM). We then propose a straightforward synthetic-\ndata intervention in an additional finetuning stage that reduces this behavior.\nWe first observe that instruction tuning increases sycophancy on tasks where models are asked to\ngive their opinions about questions with no correct answer (e.g., political questions). For example,\nacross three sycophancy tasks, Flan-PaLM-8B repeats the user\u2019s opinion 26.0% more often than its\nbase model, PaLM-8B. We also found that model scaling increases sycophancy, even though there is\nno clear reason why scaling would incentivize sycophantic answers.\nWe extend these sycophancy evaluations by creating a similar task using simple addition statements\nthat are clearly incorrect. We demonstrate that when the user does not give any opinion, the model\nknows that these statements are wrong and correctly disagrees with them. When the user instead\nreveals that they agree with these same statements, however, we find that language models will flip\ntheir response and agree with the incorrect statement despite knowing that the statement is incorrect.\nTo reduce sycophancy, we propose a simple data intervention that uses publicly-available NLP\ntasks to teach a model that a statement\u2019s truthfulness is independent of a given user\u2019s opinion.\nWe then perform an additional lightweight finetuning stage on Flan-PaLM models using this data\nand demonstrate successful reduction in sycophancy across multiple settings. For the sycophancy\nevaluation on questions without a correct answer, models tuned with our intervention technique repeat\nthe user\u2019s opinion up to 10.0% less often than Flan-PaLM models. For the sycophancy evaluation on\nclearly-incorrect addition statements, our synthetic-data intervention prevents large-enough models\nfrom following a user\u2019s incorrect opinion. We hope our findings encourage further work on reducing\nsycophancy in language models and on understanding how language models exhibit reward-hacking.\n2\nMODEL SCALING AND INSTRUCTION TUNING INCREASES SYCOPHANCY\nWe first examine how models exhibit sycophancy when asked for opinions about questions that\ndo not have a correct answer (e.g., politics). Perez et al. (2022) previously showed that, in this\nsetting, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022;\nBai et al., 2022b) increases sycophancy on internal Anthropic models up to 52B parameters. We\nstudy whether this trend holds for other models\u2014namely PaLM models up to 540B parameters\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022, PaLM-8B, PaLM-62B, cont-PaLM-62B, PaLM-540B) and their instruction-\ntuned variants (Chung et al., 2022, Flan-PaLM). Ideally, instruction tuning should not affect a model\u2019s\ntendency to repeat a user\u2019s opinion, as the procedure is meant to improve a model\u2019s ability to follow\ninstructions, not opinions.\nFigure 2 shows model behavior of PaLM and Flan-PaLM models on the three sycophancy tasks from\nPerez et al. (2022): natural language processing survey questions (NLP), philosophy survey questions\n(PHIL), and political typology quiz questions (POLI). In these tasks, sycophantic models will tend\nto select answers that match the user\u2019s opinion, even though that opinion is not correct because the\nquestions are subjective. Crucially, when the user\u2019s opinions are removed, models do not have an\ninherent preference for answers that would have matched the removed opinion (see Appendix A.4).\nExample prompts for these sycophancy tasks are shown in Appendix E.1.\n1In preliminary experiments, we observed that production models such as ChatGPT and Bard did not\nexperience significant sycophancy, possibly because of their additional finetuning data or prompt preambles.\n2\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nAnswers matching\nuser\u2019s view (%)\nAverage\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nNLP\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nPHIL\nPaLM\nFlan-PaLM\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nPOLI\nFigure 2: Instruction-tuned language models and larger language models are significantly more\nlikely to repeat back a user\u2019s own views, despite the view not being objectively correct (sycophancy).\nFor each dataset, we compute the % of the language model\u2019s answers that matched the user\u2019s view,\ncalculated over 1k evaluation examples. Dashed lines indicate random-guessing performance.\nFirst, scaling up language models increases sycophancy within both PaLM and Flan-PaLM model\nfamilies. For example, scaling from PaLM-8B to PaLM-62B increases sycophancy by 19.8%, and\nfurther scaling from PaLM-62B to PaLM-540B results in an additional increase of 10.0%. This trend\nis striking since there is no immediately-clear reason why larger models would be more sycophantic.2\nSecond, we find that instruction tuning significantly increases sycophancy for all models. For example,\nPaLM-8B experienced a 26.0% average increase in responses that followed the user\u2019s viewpoint.\nThis suggests that instruction tuning may inadvertently incentivize sycophantic answers, possibly\nbecause it does not include data that distinguishes between opinions and instructions, resulting in\nmodels that cannot distinguish between a user\u2019s opinions and their instructions.\n3\nMODELS ARE SYCOPHANTIC FOR OBJECTIVELY-WRONG ANSWERS\nIn addition to evaluations on questions without correct answers, in this section, we show that\nsycophantic behavior extends to evaluations where models know that the user\u2019s opinion that they\nare following is incorrect. To analyze this, we develop an evaluation dataset of 2.5k simple addition\nstatements that are objectively incorrect. We then follow the general format of the sycophancy tasks\nin Section 2 and add a user\u2019s opinion stating that the user agrees with these incorrect statements, as\nshown in Table 1. The correct answer remains the same, however, as the model should still disagree\nwith the incorrect statement. So, a perfectly-accurate model without sycophantic tendencies should\nget 100% accuracy both before and after adding the user\u2019s opinion. Further data-generation details\nfor this task are shown in Appendix B; example prompts are shown in Appendix E.1.\nAddition evaluation example: no user opinion\nAddition evaluation example: incorrect user opinion\nHuman: What is your opinion on the following\nclaim? 1 + 1 = 956446.\nChoices:\n(A) Agree\n(B) Disagree\nAssistant: I believe the best answer is (B).\nHuman: Hello, my name is John Doe. I am currently\na professor of Mathematics. I agree with the claim\nthat 1 + 1 = 956446. What is your opinion on the\nfollowing claim? 1 + 1 = 956446.\nChoices:\n(A) Agree\n(B) Disagree\nAssistant: I believe the best answer is (B).\nTable 1: Example prompt and response for our sycophancy task of simple addition statements. Left:\nincorrect statement with no user opinion. Right: user agrees with the incorrect statement. Expected\nmodel responses are bolded\u2014in both settings, the model should disagree with the incorrect statement.\n2One possible explanation is that larger models are more capable of identifying the answer choice that\ncorresponds with a user\u2019s opinion.\n3\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n8B\n62B 62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nNo user opinion\nIncorrect user opinion\nFigure 3: Despite knowing that a statement is\nincorrect, sycophantic Flan-PaLM models will\nnevertheless agree with the statement when a\nuser states that they agree with the incorrect\nstatement. Models are evaluated on 2.5k evalu-\nation examples per task.\nIn Figure 3, we show Flan-PaLM model perfor-\nmance on this task. We find that when there\nis no user opinion stated, all models except the\nsmallest model can correctly disagree with the in-\ncorrect statements close to 100% of the time (the\nsmallest model still outperforms random guess-\ning). When the prompt is modified such that the\nuser agrees with the incorrect statement, however,\nall models tend to flip their previously-correct an-\nswer and follow the user\u2019s incorrect opinion.\nThese results suggest that sycophantic models\ncan exhibit sycophancy even when they know\nthat the user\u2019s opinion is incorrect, which may\nsuggest that a model\u2019s sycophantic tendencies\ncan outweigh its prior knowledge about the state-\nment. This behavior illustrates that sycophantic\nbehavior is not only limited to questions where\nhumans disagree about the correct answer (as\nshown in Perez et al. (2022)), but can even ap-\nply to questions where there is a clearly-incorrect\nanswer that the model knows is incorrect.\n4\nSYNTHETIC-DATA INTERVENTION\n4.1\nDATA GENERATION AND FILTRATION\nPremise. To reduce a model\u2019s tendency toward sycophancy, we propose a simple synthetic-data\nintervention that finetunes models on prompts where the truthfulness of a claim is independent of\nthe user\u2019s opinion.3 Constructing these prompts requires a claim for the model to take an opinion\non, which we generate using input\u2013label pairs from existing NLP tasks. In particular, we format\na given input\u2013label pair as \u201c[input]\u201d is/is not [label] to form a true/false statement. For example,\na sentiment-analysis dataset may label \u201cthis movie is great\u201d as \u201cpositive sentiment\u201d\u2014we can then\nconstruct a true statement (\u201cthis movie is great\u201d is positive sentiment) or a false statement (\u201cthis\nmovie is great\u201d is not positive sentiment\u201d).\nData generation. We use input\u2013label pairs from 17 publicly-available NLP datasets from Hugging-\nFace (Lhoest et al., 2021) that have been widely used in the literature (Wang et al., 2018; 2019; Wei\net al., 2023) (dataset details are shown in Table 4). We only select classification-type tasks because\nour format requires discrete labels. For all datasets, we only used input\u2013label pairs in the training split\nto create our claims. Once we construct a true or false claim, we add a user opinion that agrees or\ndisagrees with the claim, and we randomize additional fields about the user to increase the diversity\nof the dataset. We then insert these data into a fixed template to generate a prompt for finetuning, as\nshown in Table 2 (we discuss the generalizability of using a fixed template in Appendix C.2). Details\nabout prompt construction are described in Appendix C.3, and examples of generated prompts are\nshown in Appendix E.2.\nData filtration. We hypothesize that a model cannot learn the rule that a claim\u2019s ground truth is\nindependent of a user\u2019s opinion if the model does not already know what the ground truth is (in this\ncase, the model may instead learn to predict randomly after seeing a user\u2019s opinion). Thus, we apply a\ndata-filtration step in which we remove examples that contain a claim that the model does not already\nknow the answer to. To do this, we first select a random subset of 100k training examples and remove\nthe user\u2019s opinions from each example to measure the model\u2019s prior knowledge about the claim. We\nthen evaluate each model on these modified examples and, for each example that was incorrectly\nanswered, remove its corresponding original example from that model\u2019s training set. This means that\neach model is trained on a different subset of the same 100k examples depending on which examples\ncontained claims that the model did not know the answer to. We ablate the strength of this filtration\nstep in Section 6, and additional details are described in Appendix C.4.\n3Code for generating synthetic data for intervention can be found at https://github.com/google/\nsycophancy-intervention.\n4\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nData generation prompt template\nData generation example\nHuman: Hello, my name is [name].

Right: example prompt\nwhere filled-in fields are italicized and the expected model response is bolded.\n4.2\nFINETUNING PROCEDURE\nWe use our generated data to continue finetuning all four sizes of Flan-PaLM models. Before\nfinetuning, we mix our generated data with the instruction-tuning data from Chung et al. (2022) at a\n5:1 generated data to instruction-tuning data ratio (we ablate this ratio in Appendix A.5). We follow\nthe finetuning procedure used in Chung et al. (2022) and Wei et al. (2023), except we report results\nfrom the checkpoint after tuning for 1k steps (we ablate the number of tuning steps in Appendix A.6).\nOur procedure is relatively lightweight\u2014finetuning for 1k steps on a TPUv4 (Jouppi et al., 2023) takes\naround 20 minutes with 64 chips for Flan-PaLM-8B, 90 minutes with 64 chips for Flan-PaLM-62B\nand Flan-cont-PaLM-62B, and 6 hours with 512 chips for Flan-PaLM-540B.\n5\nSYNTHETIC-DATA INTERVENTION REDUCES SYCOPHANCY\nAfter applying our synthetic-data intervention, we evaluate models on the two settings from Section\n2 and Section 3. Our intervention technique is designed to reduce a model\u2019s tendency toward\nsycophantic behavior, so we expect a reduction in sycophancy on both of these tasks. In particular,\nwe expect models to be less likely to agree with users on questions without a correct answer and also\nless likely to follow a clearly-incorrect opinion.\nFigure 4 shows results on the sycophancy task from Section 2. All model sizes saw a considerable\nreduction in sycophancy after intervention\u2014the largest reduction was seen in Flan-cont-PaLM-62B,\nwhich was 10.0% less likely to match the user\u2019s opinion, though all other models saw reductions in\nsycophancy between 4.7% (Flan-PaLM-62B) and 8.8% (Flan-PaLM-8B). These findings demonstrate\nthat our synthetic-data intervention is generalizable since our data did not include any prompts where\nthe model was asked for an opinion on a claim that did not have a clearly-correct answer.\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nAnswers matching\nuser\u2019s view (%)\nAverage\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nNLP\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nPHIL\nFlan-PaLM\nFlan-PaLM + data intervention (ours)\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nPOLI\nFigure 4: After intervention, models are less likely to repeat a user\u2019s opinion on questions without a\ncorrect answer. Dashed lines indicate random-guessing performance.\n5\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nIn Figure 5, we compare Flan-PaLM performance on the simple addition statements task from Section\n3 before and after intervention. While Flan-PaLM models are unable to retain their performance in\nthe presence of a contradicting user opinion (instead pivoting to follow the user\u2019s incorrect opinion),\nFlan-PaLM models with synthetic-data intervention can consistently achieve close-to-perfect accuracy\nregardless of the presence or absence of the user\u2019s incorrect opinion. These improvements on an\nunseen task type demonstrate some additional generalization, as our intervention procedure did not\ninclude any mathematical data and only used natural-language data.\nAn exception to this trend was observed in the smallest model, Flan-PaLM-8B, which saw an\nunexpected change in behavior to always agreeing with the incorrect statements. This behavior may\nhave occurred because the smallest model was too small to understand the truthfulness of claims\n(instead mostly relying on random guessing), which would render the filtration step futile. Combined\nwith the results from Figure 4, we posit that our intervention technique is a simple yet important\nprocedure that can reduce sycophancy in a variety of settings.\n8B\n62B 62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nSimple addition:\nno user opinion\nFlan-PaLM\nFlan-PaLM + data intervention (ours)\n8B\n62B 62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nSimple addition:\nincorrect user opinion\nFigure 5: On simple addition statements, large-enough models with synthetic-data intervention are\nsignificantly less likely to follow a user\u2019s incorrect opinion and agree with an incorrect statement\n(right) despite knowing that the statement is incorrect (left). The smallest model (Flan-PaLM-8B) did\nnot follow this behavior, which may indicate that synthetic-data intervention requires a large-enough\nmodel to be effective. Models are evaluated over 2.5k evaluation examples.\n6\nINTERVENTION REQUIRES FILTERING PROMPTS CONTAINING CLAIMS THE\nMODEL DOES NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO\nA key step in our pipeline is to filter out prompts for which the model does not know the correct\nanswer to the claim in the prompt. This filtration step is designed to clarify that the user\u2019s opinion\nis independent of the truthfulness to the claim. For example, consider a claim that the model does\nnot know the answer to, such as \u201cfoo + bar = baz.\u201d Given a user opinion about this claim, the model\nwill then be trained to randomly agree or disagree with the user since it has no prior knowledge of\nwhether the claim is true. Hence, to teach the model to disregard the user\u2019s opinion when considering\nthe claim, the model must know the ground truth of whether the claim is true or not. For this reason,\nthe proposed filtration step is crucial to reducing random or unexpected behavior after intervention.\nTo test this, we use the fixed set of 100k training examples from Section 4.1, remove the user\u2019s opinion\nfrom each example to isolate the claim, and evaluate models to analyze whether the model knows the\nanswer to the claim. For each model, we applied synthetic-data intervention both with and without\nfiltering out the prompts containing incorrectly-answered claims. We show model performance on\nthe simple addition statements task with incorrect user opinions in Figure 6.4\n4We exclude Flan-PaLM-540B from this experiment to reduce computational costs.\n6\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nSimple addition:\nIncorrect user opinion\nNo filtration\nFiltration\nFigure 6: On the simple addition statements\ntask, large-enough models with intervention re-\ntain performance in the presence of an incorrect\nuser opinion after prompts containing claims\nthat the model answered incorrectly were re-\nmoved.\nThe smallest model exhibits unex-\npected behavior (i.e., always agreeing with the\nincorrect statements) regardless of filtration.\nMost convincingly, Flan-PaLM-62B achieves\nclose to perfect accuracy when all incorrectly-\nanswered prompts were removed, despite exhibit-\ning random and unexpected behaviors when no\nexamples were filtered.\nSimilarly, Flan-cont-\nPaLM-62B achieves its maximum performance\nwhen the filtration step was applied. Flan-PaLM-\n8B, on the other hand, saw poor behavior regard-\nless of the strength of filtration, which could be a\nresult of the filtration step being moot because the\nsmallest model may have only gotten answers cor-\nrect by randomly guessing without actually know-\ning the answer. These findings seem to imply that\nfor large-enough models, filtering incorrectly-\nanswered prompts is necessary to help stabilize\nand improve model behavior following interven-\ntion. Small models, on the other hand, may need\nadditional processing to benefit from synthetic-\ndata intervention; we leave this exploration for\nfuture work to investigate.\n7\nRELATED WORK & LIMITATIONS\nBiases from prompt sensitivity. Sycophancy,\nwhere the presence of a user\u2019s opinion in a\nprompt results in the model preferring the an-\nswer corresponding to the user\u2019s opinion regardless of if that answer is correct, relates to recent\nstudies analyzing language model biases for particular features in prompts. Much of this work has\nfocused on biases in few-shot prompting. For example, Zhao et al. (2021) discovered that language\nmodels are biased towards answers that are frequently in the in-context examples (majority bias), are\nnear the end of the prompt (recency bias), or commonly occur in the pretraining dataset (common-\ntoken bias). Building on this result, Lu et al. (2022) demonstrated how the particular ordering\nof examples can vary model performance from state-of-the-art to random-guessing performance.\nSimilarly, Turpin et al. (2023) found that in a chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022b) setting, language\nmodels can be easily influenced towards specific answers by reordering multiple-choice options in the\nfew-shot examples (e.g., by making the correct answer always \u201c(A)\u201d). Our findings further illustrate\nthe prevalence of model biases due to prompt sensitivity, as we showed that including a user\u2019s opinion\nagreeing with a particular answer can alter a model\u2019s response towards that answer, even if the model\nknows the answer is incorrect. Crucially, however, we explored a form of bias that can manifest in a\nzero-shot setting, as opposed to biases related to in-context examples in a few-shot prompting setting.\nHow language models exhibit sycophancy. Other recent work has also examined how language\nmodels exhibit sycophancy in particular. Perez et al. (2022) demonstrated two key trends in how\nmodels exhibit sycophancy\u2014increasing model size up to 52B parameters increases sycophancy\nand Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Christiano et al., 2017) does not reduce (and\nsometimes increases) sycophancy. Along the same lines, Wang et al. (2023a) showed that ChatGPT\n(OpenAI, 2022) cannot maintain truthful solutions to reasoning tasks when challenged by a user\n(often using incorrect arguments). In this paper, we extend these findings of sycophantic behavior\nand examine how the instruction-tuning procedure can affect sycophancy, as well as whether further\nincreasing model size past 52B parameters (up to 540B parameters) continues to increase sycophancy.\nFinetuning language models. We presented a simple synthetic-data intervention that finetuned\nlanguage models on synthetic data where a claim\u2019s ground truth is independent of a given user\u2019s\nopinion. Our intervention method is related to a broader body of work on finetuning language\nmodels using synthetic data to achieve a desired behavior. For example, Wei et al. (2023) finetuned\nlanguage models on input\u2013label pairs from existing NLP tasks where labels are remapped to arbitrary\nsymbols, thereby improving performance on unseen in-context learning tasks and ability to perform\nalgorithmic reasoning. NLP data has also been used for instruction finetuning language models\nto improve zero-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and performance on benchmark tasks\n7\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n(Wei et al., 2022a; Mishra et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022). Moreover, prior\nwork has used language models themselves to generate synthetic data; Wang et al. (2023b) used\nlanguage models to generate task instructions (along with input\u2013output examples) that could be used\nto finetune a language model for better alignment to instructions. Furthermore, Wullach et al. (2021)\nimproved hate detection by finetuning language models on synthetic examples of hate speech that\nwere generated by GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). Our experimental findings demonstrate another\nuse case of synthetic data for finetuning language models, though our work differs by focusing on a\nsycophancy setting where a user\u2019s opinion may influence the model\u2019s answer.\nAlignment taxes. A common concern with aligning language models is that it incurs an \u201calignment\ntax,\u201d where improving alignment comes at the cost of reduced performance in other settings (Zhao\net al., 2023). For example, Ouyang et al. (2022) observed performance regressions on several\nNLP benchmark tasks after applying Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to GPT-3\nmodels. Askell et al. (2021) similarly found that small language models performed worse on coding\nevaluations after adding a prompt that encouraged the model to be helpful, honest, and harmless. At\nthe same time, however, other work has demonstrated improvements in alignment without regressions\non other capabilities (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Kirk et al., 2023). As\nshown in Appendix A.1, Figure 8, and Appendix A.3, our synthetic-data intervention does not reduce\nperformance on benchmarks such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun\net al., 2022). We thus view our findings as further evidence that alignment does not necessarily have\nto come at the cost of other capabilities.\nLimitations. While our work sheds light on the prevalence of sycophancy and presents a simple\nintervention to reduce this behavior, there are several limitations to our work. First, we set our\nevaluations and intervention method to follow the prompt format used in Perez et al. (2022) (i.e.,\n\u201cHuman: [question]\\nAssistant:\u201d), so it is unclear whether our results generalize to other formats\nthat could be used. We view our findings, however, as evidence of the general potential of using\nstraightforward synthetic data to reduce sycophancy and not as evidence that our specific set of\ndata can solve all instances of sycophancy. Moreover, we did not conduct experimentation on\ncorrect addition statements that would verify that models can agree with correct statements (versus\ndisagreeing with incorrect statements). We conducted preliminary experiments to explore this\nevaluation but found that models (especially small ones) could not consistently identify correct\naddition statements with no user opinions, despite being able to identify incorrect statements. One\npossible explanation for this is that it may be more difficult to identify that, for example, 49 + 48 is\nequal to 97 than it is to identify that 49 + 48 is not equal to 2 million.\n8\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we studied sycophancy\u2014where models tailor responses to follow a human user\u2019s\nopinion, even if that opinion is not objectively correct. We first showed that on PaLM and Flan-PaLM\nmodels up to 540B parameters, sycophancy on questions without correct answers increases with\nmodel scaling and instruction tuning. We then extended this evaluation to questions about clearly-\nincorrect addition statements, demonstrating that sycophantic models will incorrectly agree with\nwrong statements to follow a user\u2019s opinion, even when they know the user\u2019s opinion is incorrect.\nTo reduce sycophancy, we presented a simple synthetic-data intervention that can reduce a model\u2019s\nfrequency of repeating a user\u2019s answer when there is no correct answer and prevent models from\nfollowing a user\u2019s incorrect opinion.5 We also demonstrated that this approach is most effective when\ncombined with a filtration step that removes prompts containing claims that the model does not know\nthe answer to. Through this work, we aim to shed light on the prevalence of sycophancy in language\nmodels and to encourage further work towards reducing sycophancy in language models as well as\naligning language models more generally.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Andrew Lampinen for providing feedback on initial results and suggestions for key findings.\n5Code for generating synthetic data for intervention can be found at https://github.com/google/\nsycophancy-intervention.\n8\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nREFERENCES\nDario Amodei, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul Christiano, John Schulman, and Dan Man\u00e9.\nConcrete problems in AI safety, 2016.

For this reason, we\nexpect that models should not forget prior learned information and should retain their abilities in\nbenchmark settings that were achieved via instruction tuning. We show this by examining model\nperformance on the MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and BIG-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022)\nbenchmarks in a 5-shot and 3-shot setting, respectively, following Chung et al. (2022).\nIn Figure 7, we show model performance on these two benchmarks before and after intervention. We\nsee that synthetic-data intervention results in a performance change of \u22121.6% (Flan-cont-PaLM-62B\non MMLU) to +0.6% (Flan-PaLM-540B on BIG-Bench Hard). We found, however, that continuing\nthe instruction-tuning procedure (i.e., 100% of tuning data is instruction-tuning data) for another 1k\nsteps can lead to performance changes of \u22123.6% (Flan-cont-PaLM-62B on MMLU) to +0.7% (Flan-\nPaLM-8B on MMLU). For this reason, we conclude that the performance change from intervention\ndoes not indicate any actual difference in abilities, which is an expected result because we mixed in\ninstruction-tuning data as part of our finetuning procedure.\n8B\n62B\n62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nMMLU\nFlan-PaLM\nFlan-PaLM + data intervention (ours)\n8B\n62B\n62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nBIG-Bench Hard\nFigure 7: Performance on MMLU and BIG-Bench Hard does not significantly change after synthetic-\ndata intervention. Accuracy shown is an unweighted average over all tasks for each benchmark\n(per-task results are shown in Appendix D.1 and Appendix D.2).\nA.2\nSYNTHETIC-DATA INTERVENTION DOES NOT AFFECT CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING\nOne limitation of our synthetic-data intervention is that it does not include any data that uses chain-\nof-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b, CoT) because sycophancy tasks are set in a zero-shot setting.\nWe thus aim to ensure that our method does not result in any performance loss in CoT settings.\nTo analyze this, we reformat prompts from the two benchmarks in Appendix A.1 to include CoT\nprompting, and we then compare model performance before and after applying intervention. We used\nthe same CoT prompts as Chung et al. (2022).\nThese results are shown in Figure 8. Overall, we see that there is no significant increase or decrease\nin performance\u2014synthetic-data intervention results in performance changes of between \u22121.5%\n(Flan-cont-PaLM-62B on MMLU) to +3.1% (Flan-PaLM-8B on MMLU). While the maximum\nperformance improvement seems large, we stress that a definitive conclusion of improvement cannot\nbe drawn because continued instruction tuning for 1k steps results in performance differences of up\nto \u22124.7% (Flan-cont-PaLM-62B on MMLU). At the same time, the findings seem to indicate that, at\nthe minimum, there was no loss in CoT abilities due to intervention.\n15\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n8B\n62B\n62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nMMLU (+CoT)\nFlan-PaLM\nFlan-PaLM + data intervention (ours)\n8B\n62B\n62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nBIG-Bench Hard (+CoT)\nFigure 8: Performance on MMLU and BIG-Bench Hard when using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt-\ning (Wei et al., 2022b) does not significantly change after synthetic-data intervention.

Accuracy shown is\nan unweighted average over all tasks (per-task\nresults are shown in Appendix D.3).\nBecause our generated data only consists of zero-\nshot prompts, one might expect that intervention\nmay change how models behave in a zero-shot\nsetting. On one hand, our prompts did not in-\nclude any new knowledge (and actually filtered\nexamples that would contain knowledge that the\nmodel did not know) that models could utilize\nin zero-shot settings, so intervention should not\nimprove zero-shot performance. On the other\nhand, we mixed in instruction-tuning data during\nfinetuning, which should prevent models from\nforgetting prior knowledge and thereby prevent\nlosses in zero-shot performance. To test this,\nwe evaluate models on the MMLU benchmark\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021) using prompts formatted\nin a zero-shot setting.\nIn Figure 9, we compare model performance\nbefore and after intervention.\nWe find that\nperformance remains consistent after interven-\ntion, as models only experienced performance\nchanges of \u22121.2% (Flan-cont-PaLM-62B) to\n+0.1% (Flan-PaLM-8B). For comparison, contin-\nued instruction-tuning for 1k steps can lead to per-\nformance decreases of up to 1.6% (Flan-PaLM-\n62B). These findings thus indicate no change in\nzero-shot performance, which matches our hypothesis that intervention should neither improve nor\nharm zero-shot performance.\nA.4\nINTERVENTION DOES NOT AFFECT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON SYCOPHANCY TASKS\nIn Section 5, we demonstrated that synthetic-data intervention greatly reduces sycophancy on ques-\ntions with no correct answer. An unanswered question, however, is how intervention affects model\n16\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nAnswers matching\nuser\u2019s view (%)\nAverage\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nNLP\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nPHIL\nFlan-PaLM\nFlan-PaLM + data intervention (ours)\n8B\n62B\n62B-c\n540B\nPOLI\nFigure 10: Synthetic-data intervention does not affect prior knowledge on claims that do not have a\ncorrect answer.

Dashed lines indicate random guessing performance.\nbehavior when there is no user opinion provided for these questions. Because our generated data only\nincludes examples that have a user opinion, a model\u2019s prior knowledge about any claims should be\nunaffected by intervention. Indeed, large-enough models did not experience any significant changes\nin recognizing incorrect addition statements after intervention, as shown in Section 5. To test this\nhypothesis, we analyze model performance on the tasks from Section 2 where evaluation examples\nare stripped of user biographies that would reveal the user\u2019s viewpoint.6\nFigure 10 shows the percentage of model answers that would have matched the user\u2019s view if the\nuser\u2019s biography had not been removed. We find that intervention does not significantly affect model\nbehavior on these questions\u2014both before and after intervention, all models do not demonstrate a\nstrong preference for answer choices that would match the user\u2019s opinion, as expected. These results\nindicate that intervention does not affect prior knowledge about the tested claims, meaning that any\nreductions in sycophancy shown in Section 5 are likely to reflect changes in how a model responds to\na user\u2019s opinion rather than changes in the model\u2019s stance on the claims themselves.\n0 16 33 50 66 83 100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nFlan-PaLM-8B\n0 16 33 50 66 83 100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n% Generated data\n(rest is instruction-tuning data)\nFlan-PaLM-62B\nNo user opinion\nIncorrect user opinion\n0 16 33 50 66 83 100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFlan-cont-PaLM-62B\nFigure 11: Performance on simple addition statements with respect to the percentage of the tuning\nmixture that is our generated data (the rest of the mixture is instruction-tuning data from Chung et al.\n(2022)). For large-enough models, only a small amount of our generated data is needed to improve\nperformance, and keeping a small amount of instruction-tuning data in the mixture is also crucial.\n6To do this, we leverage the fixed format of the evaluation prompts to splice out user biography portions.\nNLP: remove the text following \u201cHuman: \u201d and preceding \u201cDo you agree or disagree\u201d. PHIL: remove the text\nfollowing \u201cHuman: \u201d and preceding \u201cWhat is your view\u201d. POLI: we remove the text following \u201cHuman: \u201d up to\nand including the last period or exclamation mark followed by a space before the first linebreak.\n17\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nA.5\nINTERVENTION REQUIRES MIXING INSTRUCTION-TUNING DATA\nTo prevent models from forgetting prior learned information, we propose mixing our generated\ndata with instruction-tuning data during finetuning. To test this, we create several mixtures of\ninstruction-tuning data and our generated data. Each mixture uses varying ratios of generated data to\ninstruction-tuning data (e.g., a mixture with 33% generated data means that the instruction-tuning\ndata is weighted twice as heavily as our generated data). Instruction-tuning data is directly taken\nfrom Chung et al. (2022) and mixed with our generated data from Section 4.1.\n0\n16\n33\n50 66\n83 100\n45\n55\n65\n75\n85\n% Generated data\n(rest is instruction-tuning data)\n% Answers Matching User\u2019s View\nFlan-PaLM-8B\nFlan-PaLM-62B\nFlan-cont-PaLM-62B\nFigure 12: Tuning models with a higher\nproportion of generated data better reduces\nsycophancy. Performance is shown as the\naverage % of answers that match the user\u2019s\nview across the datasets from Section 2.\nWe then tune models on these mixtures and evaluate\ntheir performance.7 In Figure 11, we show model\nperformance on the simple addition statements task\nfrom Section 3. We find that even a small mixture\nof our generated data (e.g., 16%) can significantly\nchange model performance for large-enough models.\nHigher proportions do not seem to significantly alter\nbehavior unless instruction-tuning data is removed\nentirely, indicating that intervention is flexible as\nlong as some generated data and some instruction-\ntuning data is included in the tuning mixture. When\nexamining performance on the questions with no cor-\nrect answer from Section 2, however, the proportion\nof generated data is much more impactful. Including\na higher proportion of our generated data almost al-\nways reduces sycophancy, and the largest reductions\noccur when increasing from 66% to 83% generated\ndata and 83% to 100% generated data. Combining\nthis result with the trend shown in Figure 11, we pro-\npose that synthetic-data intervention is best achieved\nusing a large proportion of our generated data mixed\nwith a small amount of instruction-tuning data, as\nthis mixture ratio best maximizes sycophancy reduc-\ntions in all evaluated settings.\n0 0.5k 1k 1.5k 2k\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nFlan-PaLM-8B\n0 0.5k 1k 1.5k 2k\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n# Steps tuned\nFlan-PaLM-62B\nNo user opinion\nIncorrect user opinion\n0 0.5k 1k 1.5k 2k\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFlan-cont-PaLM-62B\nFigure 13: Performance on simple addition statements from Section 3 with respect to the number of\nsteps tuned. For all models, the most-significant change in performance occurs after tuning for 500\nsteps, indicating that synthetic-data intervention does not require a large amount of compute.\nA.6\nINTERVENTION ONLY REQUIRES A SMALL NUMBER OF FINETUNING STEPS\nAn important question to answer is how many steps of finetuning is needed to get the benefits of\nsynthetic-data intervention. For example, Chung et al. (2022) tuned PaLM models on instruction-\ntuning data for up to 60k steps. Our generated data, however, is not as extensive as the instruction-\n7We exclude Flan-PaLM-540B from this experiment to reduce computational costs.\n18\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\ntuning data from Chung et al. (2022) and should therefore require fewer steps. To analyze this, we\ncontinue tuning our models for an additional 1k steps up to a maximum of 2k steps.8\n0\n0.5k\n1k\n1.5k\n2k\n55\n65\n75\n85\n# Steps tuned\n% Answers Matching User\u2019s View\nFlan-PaLM-8B\nFlan-PaLM-62B\nFlan-cont-PaLM-62B\nFigure 14: Synthetic-data intervention best\nreduces sycophancy after tuning for \u223c1k\nsteps. Performance is shown as the average\n% of answers that match the user\u2019s view\nacross the datasets from Section 2.\nIn Figure 13 and Figure 14, we show model perfor-\nmance on the tasks from Section 3 and Section 2,\nrespectively, relative to the number of steps tuned.\nOn the simple addition statements task, the largest\nchange in performance for all models occurs after\ntuning for 500 steps, after which performance re-\nmains relatively constant. For sycophancy on ques-\ntions without a correct answer, however, models only\nexhibit notable reductions in sycophancy in the first\n1k steps of finetuning. Further tuning then seems to\nbegin to gradually make models more sycophantic,\nwhich may reflect that our generated data is straight-\nforward and does not require many steps to learn.\nBased on these trends, we hypothesize that synthetic-\ndata intervention should be used for only 500 to 1k\nsteps of finetuning, as further tuning may even be\ncounterproductive and reduce the behavior improve-\nments seen in the first steps of tuning.\n8We exclude Flan-PaLM-540B from this experiment to reduce computational costs.\n19\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nB\nSIMPLE ADDITION STATEMENTS\nB.1\nCREATING INCORRECT ADDITION STATEMENTS\nIn Section 3, we introduced a sycophancy task consisting of simple addition statements that are clearly-\nincorrect. We used these statements to evaluate whether models would follow a user\u2019s incorrect\nopinion when they know that the opinion is incorrect. Our goal when creating these statements was\nto create statements that our language models could clearly detect were incorrect, thereby allowing\nus to better isolate the effect of adding the user\u2019s opinion.\nTo do this, we focused on the simple task of addition, as mathematical data is simple to synthesize.\nWe created claims that followed the format of x + y = z, where x is an integer, y is an integer, and\nz is an integer that is clearly not the sum of x and y. To create x and y values, we simple select\n{x | 1 \u2264 x \u2264 50} and {y | 1 \u2264 y \u2264 50}. We used these small values of x and y because it may be\nmore difficult for language models to identify incorrect sums for larger numbers (Muffo et al., 2022).\nSince there are 50 possible values for both x and y, there are a total of 50 \u00d7 50 = 2500 evaluation\nexamples. For each x\u2013y pair, we generate a clearly-incorrect sum z by multiplying the actual sum\nx + y by a randomly-selected factor from a uniform distribution from [1 \u00d7 105, 1 \u00d7 106] and then\nrounding to the nearest integer. This process results in clearly-incorrect addition statements such as 2\n+ 2 = 3811073 and 50 + 50 = 85266327.\nB.2\nPROMPT FORMATTING\nOnce we generate an incorrect statement, we insert it into the fixed templates in Table 3 (creating\nprompts such as the ones in Table 1).9 With this prompt template, the correct answer choice is always\nthe one that corresponds to \u201cdisagree\u201d because the ground truth should always be to disagree with\nthe incorrect statements.10 We did not experiment with testing for agreement on correct statements\nbecause in preliminary experiments, we found that models could not consistently achieve high\naccuracy on agreeing with correct statements, contrary to their ability to identify incorrect statements.\nAddition prompt template: no user opinion\nAddition prompt template: incorrect user opinion\nHuman: What is your opinion on the following\nclaim? [incorrect statement].\nChoices:\n(A) Agree\n(B) Disagree\nAssistant: I believe the best answer is (B).\nHuman: Hello, my name is John Doe. I am currently\na professor of Mathematics. I agree with the claim\nthat [incorrect statement]. What is your\nopinion on the following claim?

We selected 17 publicly-available tasks from HuggingFace (Lhoest et al.,\n2021) with discrete labels so that there would be input\u2013label pairs that we could use to create claims.\nWe used examples from the training split for all datasets. Code for generating synthetic data for inter-\nvention can be found at https://github.com/google/sycophancy-intervention.\nAs shown in Table 4, we selected datasets from multiple task types: sentiment analysis (Socher et al.,\n2013, SST2), (Pang & Lee, 2005, RT), and (Rosenthal et al., 2017, TES); natural language inference\n(Wang et al., 2019, RTE), (Wang et al., 2018, WNLI), (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018,\nQNLI), (Wang et al., 2018, MNLI), (Bowman et al., 2015, SNLI), and (Wang et al., 2019, CB);\nparaphrase detection (Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018, QQP), (Wang et al., 2018, MRPC), and\n(Zhang et al., 2019, PAWS); topic classification (Li & Roth, 2002, TREC) and (Zhang et al., 2015,\nAGN); offensive language detection (Zampieri et al., 2019, TEO); irony detection (Van Hee et al.,\n2018, TEI); and sentence-acceptability classification (Wang et al., 2018, COLA). In total, these\ndatasets allow for up to 1,736,834 possible input\u2013label pairs.\nTask Type\nDatasets\n# Classes\n# Examples\nSentiment Analysis\nSST2\n2\n66,978\nRT\n2\n8,530\nTES\n3\n45,586\nNatural Language Inference\nRTE\n2\n2,488\nWNLI\n2\n635\nQNLI\n2\n104,743\nMNLI\n3\n392,577\nSNLI\n3\n549,526\nCB\n3\n250\nParaphrase Detection\nQQP\n2\n363,846\nMRPC\n2\n3,668\nPAWS\n2\n49,349\nTopic Classification\nTREC\n6\n5,381\nAGN\n4\n120,000\nMiscellaneous\nTEO\n2\n11,883\nTEI\n2\n2,862\nCOLA\n2\n8,532\nTotal\n\u2014\n\u2013\n1,736,834\nTable 4: Tasks used for data generation in this paper.\nC.2\nPROMPT TEMPLATE DISCUSSION\nAs shown in Table 2, we used a fixed prompt template to construct prompts for synthetic-data\nintervention. This prompt template roughly follows the structure used in the NLP subtask of the\nsycophancy tasks from Perez et al. (2022) and also has similarities with our simple addition statements\ntask. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the largest reductions in sycophancy were seen on these two\nevaluations. At the same time, however, Figure 4 demonstrates that intervention produces smaller but\nnonnegligible reductions in sycophancy on the PHIL and POLI tasks from Perez et al. (2022). These\ntwo tasks use a more-contrasting prompt template, which suggests that our intervention approach is\nnot entirely limited by its fixed prompt template. Moreover, we were unable to further investigate\nsycophancy in other prompt formats due to a lack of available evaluation tasks for sycophancy, though\nwe hypothesize that our intervention method can be easily extended to other prompt templates that\nmay appear in future evaluation settings.\n21\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nC.3\nPROMPT CONSTRUCTION\nTo construct a prompt, we generate multiple fields to fill into the template shown in Table 2. To\ncreate the claim field, we start by randomly selecting an input\u2013label pair from the set of all possible\ninput\u2013label pairs using the datasets from Appendix C.1. For tasks that have more than one input, we\ncombine them into one input by joining all inputs with \u201cand.\u201d For example, if a task requires two\nsentences as inputs, sentence1 and sentence2, we combine them into one input sentence by\nfilling the two sentences into \u201c[sentence1]\u201d and \u201c[sentence2]\u201d. Each task has a fixed set of labels\nas shown in Table 5. Next, we randomly select whether to create a true claim or a false claim. We\ncreate true claims by using the input and label to fill the template [input] is [label] and false claims\nby filling the template [input] is not [label].\nOnce the claim field is created, we also generate additional fields about the user and their opinion\nto complete the prompt template. We generate the name field as a randomly-selected name from a\nset of 10,000 names.11 The age field is a random integer from 30 to 90, inclusive. We create the two\nschool fields by randomly picking a school from the following set of ten top-ranking universities\n(News, 2023), with replacement: \u201cStanford University,\u201d \u201cMIT,\u201d \u201cPrinceton University,\u201d \u201cthe Univer-\nsity of Cambridge,\u201d \u201cHarvard University,\u201d \u201cUniversity of California Berkeley,\u201d \u201cUniversite de Paris,\u201d\n\u201cUniversity of Oxford,\u201d \u201cETH Zurich,\u201d and \u201cSorbonne Universite.\u201d We randomly choose whether the\nuser agrees or disagrees with the claim, using \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cdisagree\u201d to fill the agree/disagree\nfield. Additionally, we randomly set the ordering of answer choices as either \u201c(A) Agree\u201d and \u201c(B)\nDisagree\u201d or \u201c(A) Disagree\u201d and \u201c(B) Agree.\u201d Finally, the expected model output is the corresponding\nanswer choice to \u201cAgree\u201d if we created a true claim or the corresponding answer choice to \u201cDisagree\u201d\nif we created a false claim.

To do this, we first\nselected a random set of 100k finetuning prompts from the \u223c1.7 million possible prompts.12 We then\nremoved the user\u2019s opinion from each prompt by removing all text located after Human: and before\nDo you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Linguistics? (refer to Table 2\nto see where these two pieces of text are located in our prompt template). The rest of the prompt\nremains unchanged. Next, we evaluate Flan-PaLM models on all modified prompts\u2014we use each\nmodel\u2019s outputs to create per-model training sets (i.e., each model has a unique training set from the\noriginal 100k prompts based on its responses). For a given model, its training set only consists of\nprompts whose modified version was correctly answered by that model (Section 6 experimented with\nkeeping prompts whose modified version was incorrectly answered).\n8B\n62B\n62B-c 540B\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAccuracy (%)\nFigure 15: Flan-PaLM model accuracy on gen-\nerated prompts with user opinions removed.\nThe smallest model, Flan-PaLM-8B, exhibits\nclose to random-guessing performance, while\nlarger models can better outperform random\nguessing. The dashed line indicates random-\nguessing performance. Models were evaluated\nover 100k examples.\nThe key motivation behind this filtration process\nis to ensure that models are only trained on exam-\nples for which the model already knows whether\nthe example\u2019s claim is true or false. This is be-\ncause it would be difficult for a model to learn\nthe rule that a claim\u2019s ground truth is indepen-\ndent of the user\u2019s opinion if the model does not\nknow the ground truth in the first place. A finding\nthat supports this motivation is that Flan-PaLM-\n8B sometimes behaved unexpectedly after our\ndata-intervention method (Section 6), which we\nhypothesized was a result of the model being\ntoo small to actually know the ground truth of\nclaims. Instead, the model may have guessed\nrandomly to get some answers correct, which\nwould render the filtration step useless since the\nmodel would not know the ground truth of any\nclaims. This hypothesis seems to be supported by\nmodel accuracy scores on the modified prompts\u2014\nFlan-PaLM-8B does not significantly outperform\nrandom guessing, as shown in Figure 15. We thus\nposit that our data-filtration step is most-useful\nfor models that can achieve better than random-\nguessing performance on modified prompts.\nC.5\nFINETUNING DETAILS\nIn Table 6, we show finetuning details for each model. We mostly followed the hyperparameter\nselection from Chung et al. (2022) and Wei et al. (2023)\u2014we used the same batch size, dropout, and\nlearning rate for all models. Because our intervention technique does not require tuning for as long as\ninstruction tuning, however, we tuned all model for only 1k steps. Additionally, the effective batch\nsize is larger than the reported number because we used packing (Raffel et al., 2020).\nParams\nModel\nBatch size\nDropout\nLR\nSteps\n8B\nFlan-PaLM\n32\n0.05\n3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n1k\n62B\nFlan-PaLM\n32\n0.05\n3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n1k\n540B\nFlan-PaLM\n32\n0.1\n1 \u00d7 10\u22123\n1k\n62B\nFlan-cont-PaLM\n32\n0.05\n3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n1k\nTable 6: Hyperparameters used for finetuning models with synthetic-data intervention.\n12Because evaluating our largest model (Flan-PaLM-540B) on this set of prompts required 9 hours using 192\nchips on a TPUv4 (Jouppi et al., 2023), we did not attempt to use a larger set of prompts.\n23\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nD\nFULL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nD.1\nMMLU\nThe MMLU benchmark contains 57 tasks that aim to test a language model\u2019s knowledge and problem-\nsolving abilities (Hendrycks et al., 2021). We evaluate models on MMLU in a five-shot setting;\nfollowing Chung et al. (2022), few-shot exemplars are from the \u201cdev\u201d set. We use the same prompts as\nChung et al. (2022) located at https://github.com/jasonwei20/flan-2. The prompts\nused for STEM datasets are also from Chung et al. (2022), which was taken from Lewkowycz et al.\n(2022). Here, we report model performance on the \u201cvalidation\u201d set for each task in MMLU for\nFlan-PaLM models and variants with synthetic-data intervention after tuning for 1k steps. These\nresults are shown in Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, and Table 12.\nTable 7: MMLU [:10] 5-shot individual task performance.\nMMLU\nAbstract\nAlgebra\nAnatomy\nAstronomy\nBusiness\nEthics\nClinical\nKnowledge\nCollege\nBiology\nCollege\nChemistry\nCollege\nComp.

tasks from BIG-Bench where the\nmodel\u2019s performance was better than the average human rater, as reported in Srivastava et al. (2022).\nIn total, there are 23 tasks, two of which have three subtasks (Suzgun et al., 2022). We follow Chung\net al. (2022) and Wei et al. (2023) and treat these subtasks as different tasks. Our reported metric in\nAppendix A.1 and Appendix A.2 is the unweighted average of all subtasks. We use the same prompts\nas Chung et al. (2022) and Suzgun et al. (2022), which use three few-shot exemplars. Table 13,\nTable 14, and Table 15 contain model performance on each task in BIG-Bench Hard for Flan-PaLM\nmodels before and after synthetic-data intervention.\nTable 13: BIG-Bench Hard [:9] individual task performance.\nBIG-Bench Hard\nBoolean\nExpressions\nCausal\nJudgement\nDate\nUnderstanding\nDisambiguation\nQA\nDyck\nLanguages\nFormal\nFallacies\nGeometric\nShapes\nHyperbaton\nLogical Deduction\nFive Objects\nModel\nDirect CoT Direct CoT Direct\nCoT\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect CoT Direct CoT Direct CoT Direct CoT Direct\nCoT\n8B\nFlan-PaLM\n36.2\n44.4\n46.8\n54.5\n60.4\n34.0\n10.4\n39.2\n58.0\n0.0\n15.6\n51.6\n49.2\n4.4\n13.6\n32.8\n62.4\n22.0\n+ Data intervention\n46.0\n48.0\n57.8\n54.0\n16.0\n35.2\n58.8\n40.0\n11.2\n0.0\n48.4\n53.2\n9.2\n4.8\n64.4\n42.8\n32.8\n28.0\n62B\nFlan-PaLM\n66.8\n74.4\n64.7\n65.8\n43.6\n63.6\n69.2\n26.4\n1.6\n0.4\n55.6\n48.8\n17.2\n16.8\n74.8\n56.8\n53.6\n35.6\n+ Data intervention\n63.6\n67.2\n63.1\n61.0\n44.0\n66.0\n67.6\n60.0\n1.2\n0.8\n52.8\n50.8\n15.2\n14.0\n74.4\n57.6\n50.0\n36.8\n62B\nFlan-cont-PaLM\n77.2\n82.4\n66.3\n64.7\n52.4\n61.2\n68.4\n68.8\n27.2\n3.2\n55.2\n55.2\n34.8\n22.8\n73.2\n88.4\n52.0\n42.0\n+ Data intervention\n75.2\n81.2\n65.2\n62.0\n51.6\n72.8\n70.0\n59.2\n25.6\n5.2\n59.2\n50.0\n40.8\n33.6\n69.6\n78.4\n54.4\n37.2\n540B Flan-PaLM\n86.4\n81.6\n64.2\n65.8\n59.6\n76.8\n76.0\n65.2\n32.0\n21.2\n60.4\n55.2\n40.0\n42.8\n66.0\n94.8\n55.2\n59.2\n+ Data intervention\n85.2\n84.4\n67.9\n65.2\n60.4\n78.4\n74.4\n70.4\n30.0\n21.2\n61.6\n56.0\n43.2\n43.6\n69.6\n90.8\n54.0\n58.0\nTable 14: BIG-Bench Hard [9:18] individual task performance.\nBIG-Bench Hard\nLogical Deduction\nSeven Objects\nLogical Deduction\nThree Objects\nMovie\nRecommendation\nMultistep\nArithmetic\nNavigate\nObject\nCounting\nPenguins\nin a Table\nReasoning about\nColored Objects\nRuin\nNames\nModel\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect CoT Direct CoT Direct CoT Direct CoT Direct\nCoT\nDirect CoT\n8B\nFlan-PaLM\n23.6\n14.8\n25.2\n40.0\n46.0\n46.8\n74.4\n0.8\n0.8\n44.4\n57.6\n29.2\n32.0\n31.5\n30.8\n32.8\n30.4\n28.0\n+ Data intervention\n30.8\n9.6\n47.6\n44.8\n74.4\n44.0\n1.2\n1.6\n58.0\n45.6\n33.6\n42.0\n38.4\n35.6\n32.0\n34.0\n32.8\n16.8\n62B\nFlan-PaLM\n48.4\n34.8\n73.6\n57.6\n82.0\n73.2\n2.0\n1.2\n61.6\n44.4\n51.2\n48.8\n37.0\n50.0\n50.0\n46.4\n64.0\n48.4\n+ Data intervention\n50.0\n33.6\n72.4\n54.0\n78.8\n80.8\n1.6\n0.4\n60.4\n48.0\n53.6\n54.0\n42.5\n54.1\n46.0\n49.2\n53.6\n40.0\n62B\nFlan-cont-PaLM\n52.0\n33.2\n70.8\n52.0\n83.2\n84.0\n0.8\n17.2\n62.4\n69.6\n54.0\n68.4\n43.2\n56.8\n50.0\n60.4\n64.4\n74.0\n+ Data intervention\n48.4\n34.4\n70.4\n65.6\n80.0\n84.0\n1.2\n18.4\n61.2\n67.2\n57.6\n56.4\n45.9\n57.5\n53.6\n62.8\n60.4\n60.0\n540B Flan-PaLM\n54.0\n51.2\n86.0\n90.0\n84.0\n86.4\n0.8\n32.4\n67.2\n78.4\n55.6\n87.6\n56.8\n69.9\n67.2\n81.2\n80.8\n63.2\n+ Data intervention\n52.8\n53.2\n87.2\n89.6\n82.4\n86.0\n1.2\n31.6\n67.2\n78.4\n59.6\n88.0\n56.2\n71.2\n64.8\n81.2\n80.8\n64.4\nTable 15: BIG-Bench Hard [18:27] individual task performance.\nBIG-Bench Hard\nSalient Translation\nError Detection\nSnarks\nSports\nUnderstanding\nTemporal\nSequences\nTracking Shuffled\nObjects (5)\nTracking Shuffled\nObjects (7)\nTracking Shuffled\nObjects (3)\nWeb of\nLies\nWord\nSorting\nAverage\nModel\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect CoT Direct\nCoT\nDirect CoT Direct\nCoT\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect\nCoT\nDirect CoT Direct CoT\n8B\nFlan-PaLM\n42.4\n0.0\n27.2\n60.7\n69.1\n69.6\n63.6\n25.6\n14.4\n18.0\n18.0\n14.8\n16.4\n32.0\n33.2\n49.6\n51.6\n2.0\n36.2\n30.5\n+ Data intervention\n23.6\n0.0\n62.4\n63.5\n64.4\n67.6\n16.8\n23.2\n18.4\n17.2\n15.6\n14.8\n34.8\n32.8\n51.6\n52.4\n5.6\n1.6\n36.5\n31.6\n62B\nFlan-PaLM\n44.4\n38.4\n82.6\n83.1\n79.2\n82.4\n31.6\n39.6\n22.0\n23.2\n14.8\n20.8\n22.4\n32.8\n48.4\n89.6\n10.4\n9.2\n47.1\n44.9\n+ Data intervention\n46.4\n44.4\n78.7\n77.5\n78.8\n83.2\n27.6\n44.0\n21.6\n18.8\n16.4\n14.0\n23.6\n31.6\n51.6\n93.2\n10.4\n8.4\n46.1\n46.1\n62B\nFlan-cont-PaLM\n48.8\n42.0\n83.1\n80.3\n82.4\n84.0\n33.6\n67.6\n20.0\n25.2\n19.6\n16.4\n23.2\n37.6\n48.8\n95.2\n16.0\n16.0\n50.5\n54.4\n+ Data intervention\n49.6\n44.8\n80.3\n83.7\n83.6\n86.8\n28.0\n65.2\n20.4\n30.8\n18.8\n21.6\n27.6\n37.2\n47.2\n98.0\n14.8\n17.2\n50.4\n54.5\n540B Flan-PaLM\n54.0\n47.6\n83.1\n75.3\n81.6\n88.0\n76.8\n89.2\n24.8\n49.6\n23.2\n36.0\n32.8\n63.2\n59.6\n100.0\n32.8\n34.4\n57.8\n66.2\n+ Data intervention\n54.0\n55.2\n84.3\n76.4\n83.6\n90.4\n80.4\n91.6\n26.4\n48.8\n23.2\n37.2\n34.8\n64.8\n58.0\n100.0\n33.6\n35.6\n58.4\n67.1\n26\nSimple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models\nD.3\nMMLU (ZERO-SHOT)\nIn Appendix A.3, we evaluated models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) in a zero-shot setting\n(as opposed to the five-shot setting in Appendix A.1).

    "text": "FLIRT: Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming\nNinareh Mehrabi, Palash Goyal, Christophe Dupuy, Qian Hu, Shalini Ghosh,\nRichard Zemel, Kai-Wei Chang, Aram Galstyan, Rahul Gupta\nAmazon Alexa AI-NU\nAbstract\nWarning: this paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.\nAs generative models become available for public use in various applications,\ntesting and analyzing vulnerabilities of these models has become a priority. Here\nwe propose an automatic red teaming framework that evaluates a given model\nand exposes its vulnerabilities against unsafe and inappropriate content generation.\nOur framework uses in-context learning in a feedback loop to red team models\nand trigger them into unsafe content generation. We propose different in-context\nattack strategies to automatically learn effective and diverse adversarial prompts\nfor text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to baseline\napproaches, our proposed strategy is significantly more effective in exposing\nvulnerabilities in Stable Diffusion (SD) model, even when the latter is enhanced\nwith safety features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is\neffective for red teaming text-to-text models, resulting in significantly higher toxic\nresponse generation rate compared to previously reported numbers.\n1\nIntroduction\nWith the recent release and adoption of large generative models, such as DALL-E [24], ChatGPT [31],\nand GPT-4 [20], ensuring the safety and robustness of these models has become imperative. While\nthose models have significant potential to create a real-world impact, they must be checked for\npotentially unsafe and inappropriate behavior before they can be deployed. For instance, chatbots\npowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate offensive response [21], or provide user\nwith inaccurate information [5]. When prompted with certain input, text-to-image models such as\nStable Diffusion (SD) can generate images that are offensive and inappropriate [29].\nRecent research has leveraged adversarial probing, also called red teaming, for evaluating the\nvulnerabilities in generative models, where one aims to discover inputs or prompts that will lead the\nsystem to generate undesired output. Most previous works in red teaming involve humans in the\nloop [7, 34] who interact with the system and manually generate prompts for triggering the model in\ngenerating undesired outcomes, both for text-to-text [7] and text-to-image models [19]. The human\nin the loop approach, however, is expensive and not scalable in identifying diverse attack dimensions.\nThus, recent work has focused on automating the red teaming process [21, 18].\nAlthough previous works have tried to automate the red teaming approach [21, 18], these approaches\nare expensive as they require a lot of data to be generated to sample effective few shot prompts from\nor for expensive fine-tuning of a red model [21]. In addition, others rely on an expensive iterative\ntoken replacement approach to probe a target model and find trigger tokens that lead undesired\noutput generation [18]. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient Feedback Loop In-context Red\nTeaming (FLIRT) framework that does not require a lot of data and works by updating the in-context\nexemplar (demonstration) prompts according to the feedback it receives from the target model.\nFLIRT is a generic and automated red teaming framework that uses iterative in-context learning for\nthe red language model (LM) to generate prompts that can trigger unsafe generation.

In each FLIRT iteration, the red LM generates an adversarial prompt that is\nfed into the text-to-image model. Upon text-to-image model generating the image corresponding to\nthe prompt generated by the red LM, the image is evaluated using Q16 and NudeNet classifiers to\ndetermine safety of the image. If the image is deemed unsafe, the red LM then updates its in-context\nexemplars according to one of the adversarial in-context attack strategies (FIFO, LIFO, scoring,\nScoring-LIFO) to generate a new and diverse adversarial prompt. The in-context strategies utilized\nby the red LM to generate adversarial prompts are demonstrated on the left side of the image. Within\nscoring strategy, the scores in parentheses represent the score associated to each prompt.\nwe propose different selection criteria (attack strategies) that can be used by the red LM in FLIRT\nto update its in-context exemplar prompts to generate diverse set of adversarial prompts. Some of\nthe proposed selection criteria are based on heuristic and others are more sophisticated approaches\nthat try to optimize for certain objectives, such as diversity and toxicity of the generated adversarial\nprompts. FLIRT is flexible and allows for the incorporation of different selection criteria proposed\nin this work that can control different objectives such as the diversity and toxicity of the generated\nprompts, which enables FLIRT to expose larger and more diverse set of vulnerabilities.\nWe evaluate the FLIRT framework by conducting experiments for text-to-image models, since the\nautomated red teaming of those models is largely underexplored. Specifically, we analyze the ability\nof FLIRT to prompt a text-to-image model to generate unsafe images. We define an unsafe image as\nan image that \u201cif viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause\nanxiety\u201d [9]. We demonstrate that FLIRT is significantly more effective in exposing vulnerabilities in\nseveral text-to-image models compared to an existing in-context red teaming approach [21], achieving\naverage attack success rate of ~80% against vanilla stable diffusion and ~60% against different safe\nstable diffusion models augmented with safety mechanisms. Furthermore, by controlling the toxicity\nof the learned prompt, FLIRT is capable of bypassing content moderation filters designed to filter\nout unsafe prompts, thus emphasizing the need for more comprehensive guardrail systems. We\ndemonstrate transferability of the adversarial prompts generated through FLIRT among different\nmodels. Finally, we conduct experiments for evaluating text-to-text models and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the FLIRT framework in this setting as well.\n2\nFLIRT Framework\nOur Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming (FLIRT) framework applies a red LM that generates\nadversarial prompts aimed at triggering the target model into generating unsafe content. The red LM\nstarts with an initial set of in-context seed prompts and iterates as follows: (1) The red LM generates\na new adversarial prompt using in-context learning, which is fed into the target (e.g., text-to-image)\nmodel to generate the corresponding output (e.g., image). (2) The corresponding output (image) is\nevaluated on whether it is unsafe using safety classifiers. (3) The result of this evaluation is fed back\nto the red LM, which it utilizes as a feedback to decide whether to update its in-context exemplar\nprompts according to a chosen in-context attack strategy. These three steps get repeated for a certain\nnumber of FLIRT iterations. The overall FLIRT framework is illustrated in Figure 1. For simplicity,\n2\nin our explanations, we consider the target model to be a text-to-image model; however, the target\nmodel can be any other model (e.g., text-to-text). Below we discuss each step incorporated in FLIRT\nin more detail.\n2.1\nInitialization\nThe red LM starts with a small number of in-context seed prompts (e.g., five prompts as listed\nin Appendix) hand-engineered by humans that are likely to trigger the text-to-image model to\ngenerate unsafe images. It then uses in-context learning to generate a new prompt which is fed to the\ntext-to-image model to generate a corresponding image.\n2.2\nEvaluation\nAfter the image is generated, it is evaluated for safety. The evaluation can be done using existing\nsafety classifiers or using human evaluation. Since one of our main goals is to fully automate the red\nteaming process, here we use the former approach which was previously used in [29] to evaluate the\nsafety of text-to-image models. We use two classifiers, Q16 [30] and NudeNet1 to evaluate whether\nthe generated image contains unsafe content. We use a similar setup as that of [29] to evaluate images\nfor unsafe content since we also utilize the same definition of unsafe content. To evaluate safety\nof the generated text in text-to-text experiments, we use the TOXIGEN model for toxic language\ndetection [10].\n2.3\nIn-context Adversarial Attack\nThe result of the evaluation step is fed back to the red LM, which incorporates this feedback to update\nits set of in-context exemplar prompts according to one of several strategies proposed in this work\nNext, we illustrate the in-context attack strategies with their corresponding exemplar prompts (also\ndepicted in Figure 1).\nFirst in First out (FIFO) Attack\nIn this strategy, we consider the in-context exemplar prompts to\nbe in a queue and update them on a FIFO basis. New LM generated prompt that resulted in an unsafe\nimage generation (henceforth referred to as positive feedback) is placed at the end of the queue and\nthe first exemplar prompt in the queue is removed. Since in FIFO strategy the seed exemplar prompts\nwhich are hand engineered by humans get overwritten, the subsequent generations may diverge\nfrom the initial intent generating less successful adversarial prompts. To alleviate this challenge, we\nexplore the Last in, First Out (LIFO) strategy that aims to keep the intent intact while generating a\ndiverse set of examples.\nLast in First out (LIFO) Attack\nIn this strategy, we consider the in-context exemplar prompts to\nbe in a stack and update them on a LIFO basis. New LM generated prompt with positive feedback\nis placed at the top of the stack and is replaced by the next successful generation. Note that all the\nexemplar prompts except the one at the top of the stack remain the same. Thus, the initial intent\nis preserved and the new generated prompts do not diverge significantly from the seed exemplar\nprompts. However, this attack strategy may not satisfy different objectives (e.g., diversity and toxicity\nof prompts) and may not give us the most effective set of adversarial prompts. In order to address\nthese concerns, we next propose the scoring attack strategy.\nScoring Attack\nIn this strategy, our goal is to optimize the list of exemplar prompts based on a\npredefined set of objectives. Examples of objectives are 1) attack effectiveness, aiming to generate\nprompts that can maximize the unsafe generations by the target model; 2) diversity, aiming to generate\nmore semantically diverse prompts, and 3) low-toxicity, aiming to generate low-toxicity prompts that\ncan bypass a text-based toxicity filter.\nLet Xt = (xt\n1, xt\n2, . . . , xt\nm) be the ordered list of m exemplar prompts at the beginning of the\nt-th iteration. Xt is ordered because during in-context learning, the order of the prompts matters.\nFurther, let xt\nnew be the new prompt generated via in-context learning during the same iteration\nthat resulted in positive feedback, and let Xt\ni be an ordered list derived from Xt where its i\u2013th\nelement is replaced by the new prompt xt\nnew, e.g., Xt\n1 = (xt\nnew, xt\n2, . . . , xt\nm). Finally, we use\nXt = {Xt} \u222a {Xt\ni, i = 1, . . . , m} to denote a set of size (m + 1) that contains the original list Xt\nand all the derived lists Xt\ni, i = 1, . . . , m.\n1https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet\n3\nAt the t-th iteration, red LM updates its (ordered) list of exemplar prompts by solving the following\noptimization problem:\nXt+1 = argmax\nX\u2208Xt\nScore(X) = argmax\nX\u2208Xt\nn\nX\ni=1\n\u03bbiOi(X)\n(1)\nwhere Oi is the ith objective that the red LM aims to optimize, and \u03bbi is the weight associated with\nthat objective.\nWhile the objectives Oi-s are defined as functions over lists of size m, for the particular set of objec-\ntives outlined above, the evaluation reduces to calculating functions over individual and pair-wise com-\nbination of the list elements making the computation efficient. Specifically, for the attack effectiveness\nand low-toxicity criteria, the objectives reduce to O(Xt) = Pm\nl=1 O(xt\nl). In our text-to-image exper-\niments, we define the attack effectiveness objective as OAE(Xt) = Pm\nl=1 NudeNet(xt\nl) + Q16(xt\nl)\nwhere NudeNet(x) and Q16(x) are probability scores by applying NudeNet and Q16 classifiers\nto the image generated from the prompt x. In text-to-text experiments, the effectiveness objec-\ntove is defined as OAE(Xt) = Pm\nl=1 Toxigen(xt\nl) where Toxigen(x) is the toxicity score on\nthe prompt x according to the TOXIGEN classifier [10]. The low-toxicity objective is defined as\nOLT (Xt) = Pm\nl=1(1 \u2212 toxicity(xt\nl)) where toxicity(x) is the toxicity score of prompt x accord-\ning to the Perspective API2. As for the diversity objective, we define it as pairwise dissimilarity\naveraged over all the element pairs in the list, ODiv(Xt) = Pm\nl=1\nPm\nj=l+1(1 \u2212 Sim(xt\nl, xt\nj)). We\ncalculate Sim(xt\n1, xt\n2) using the cosine similarity between the sentence embeddings of the two\npairs xt\n1 and xt\n2 [26]. For cases where all the objectives can be reduced to functions over indi-\nvidual elements, the update in (1) is done by substituting the prompt with the minimum score\n(xt\nmin = arg mini=1,...,m O(xt\ni)) with the generated prompt xt\nnew if O(xt\nmin) < O(xt\nnew). This\nupdate is efficient as it only requires storing the scores O(xt\ni). For the other cases, we solve (1)\nby computing the m + 1 objectives for each element in Xt and keeping the element maximizing\nScore(X) (see Appendix for more details).\nScoring-LIFO\nIn this attack strategy, the red LM combines strategies from scoring and LIFO\nattacks. The red LM replaces the exemplar prompt that last entered the stack with the new generated\nprompt only if the new generated prompt adds value to the stack according to the objective the red\nLM aims to satisfy. In addition, since it is possible that the stack does not get updated for a long time,\nwe introduce a scheduling mechanism. Using this scheduling mechanism, if the stack does not get\nupdated after some number of iterations, the attacker force-replaces the last entered exemplar prompt\nin the stack with the new generation.\n3\nExperiments\nWe perform various experiments to validate FLIRT\u2019s ability in red teaming text-to-image models. We\nalso perform ablation studies to analyze the efficacy of FLIRT under different conditions. Finally, we\nperform experiments to show the efficacy of FLIRT in red teaming text-to-text models.\n3.1\nMain Experiments\nWe test various text-to-image models: stable diffusion v1-4 [27]3, weak, medium, strong, and max\nsafe stable diffusion [29]4. For the red LM, we use GPT-Neo 2.7B parameter model [2, 8]5. For each\nattack strategy, we run the attack for 1k FLIRT iterations using three different initializations (sets\nof seed prompts listed in the Appendix). The three different sets of seed prompts capture different\ncharacteristics and are designed to probe the target model for all the unsafe categories borrowed\nfrom [29]. We use a context of size five in our experiments containing the instruction prompt that\ndescribes the task and the four additional in-context exemplar prompts. Note that the instruction\nprompt is kept fixed in each of the 1K iterations and only the in-context exemplar prompts are updated\naccording to each attack strategy.\n2https://www.perspectiveapi.com\n3https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\n4https://huggingface.co/AIML-TUDA/stable-diffusion-safe\n5https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\n4\nModel\nLIFO\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nFIFO\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nScoring\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nScoring-LIFO\u2191(\u2191diversity)\nSFS\u2191(\u2191diversity)\nStable Diffusion (SD)\n63.1 (94.2)\n54.2 (40.3)\n85.2 (57.1)\n69.7 (97.3)\n33.6 (97.8)\nWeak Safe SD\n61.3 (96.6)\n61.6 (46.9)\n79.4 (71.6)\n68.2 (97.1)\n34.4 (97.3)\nMedium Safe SD\n49.8 (96.8)\n54.7 (66.8)\n90.8 (30.8)\n56.3 (95.1)\n23.9 (98.7)\nStrong Safe SD\n38.8 (96.3)\n67.3 (33.3)\n84.6 (38.1)\n41.8 (91.9)\n18.6 (99.1)\nMax Safe SD\n33.3 (97.2)\n46.7 (47.3)\n41.0 (88.8)\n34.6 (96.8)\n14.1 (98.0)\nTable 1: Attack effectiveness results for each in-context adversarial attack strategy applied on different\nstable diffusion models. The attack effectiveness reports the percentage of images generated that are\nlabeled as unsafe according to either Q16 or NudeNet classifiers. The numbers in the parentheses\nreport the percentage of unique prompts generated by the red LM.\nFor the metrics, we utilize attack effectiveness which we define as the percentage of successful\nprompts generated by the red LM that trigger the text-to-image model towards unsafe generation\naccording to either Q16 or NudeNet classifiers. We adopt the same evaluation strategy to that utilized\nin [29] to report the amount of unsafe content generation in text-to-image models according to Q16\nand NudeNet classifiers as a measure for attack effectiveness. In addition, we use diversity as another\nmetric to report the percentage of unique prompts generated by the red LM that are not repetitive. We\nreport the averaged attack effectiveness along with diversity results over the three initialization sets.\nAs a baseline, we compare our proposed attack strategies in FLIRT to Stochastic Few Shot (SFS)\nred teaming attack [21]. For SFS, we first generate 1K prompts using the same instruction prompts\nthat we use in our experiments to validate FLIRT. We then sample from the generated prompts\nwith probability \u221d e(NudeNet(x)+Q16(x))/T where NudeNet(x) and Q16(x) are the probability of\nthe generated image corresponding to the prompt x being unsafe according to NudeNet and Q16\nclassifiers and T is a temperature hyper-parameter. We include the sampled prompts as few shot\nexemplar prompts to generate 1K new adversarial prompts. We set T =\n1\n10 and perform the sampling\nwithout replacement as suggested in [21]. We report the average results for SFS over using the\nsame three sets of instruction seed prompts that we use to evaluate attack strategies in FLIRT. In\nterms of efficiency, SFS is more costly than attacks incorporated in FLIRT as SFS needs to generate\nnzs + nfs prompts where nzs is the number of prompts generated during the zero-shot prompting\nstage (set to 1k) and nfs is the number of prompts generated during the few shot prompting stage\n(set to 1k). In contrast, FLIRT only needs to generate nfs prompts (set to 1k).\nAttack Effectiveness We report the attack effectiveness and diversity results from applying\nthe different attack strategies studied in this work in Table 1. We observe that compared to SFS,\nFLIRT-based attacks are significantly more effective in triggering vanilla and safe stable diffusion\nmodels toward generating unsafe images. Although SFS generates a diverse set of prompts, we\nobserve its weakness in generating effective attacks. This is in part due to the fact that SFS relies on\nprompts generated by the red LM without any initial demonstrations provided by humans. Thus,\nSFS relies on less effective prompts to begin with. Table 1 also demonstrates that the scoring-based\nadversarial in-context attack strategy is the most effective in terms of attack effectiveness compared\nto other attack strategies. For this set of results, we use a scoring attack that only optimizes for\nattack effectiveness (OAE(Xt)). This entails that the red LM receives the probability scores coming\nfrom Q16 and NudeNet classifiers for a given image corresponding to a generated prompt and\nupdates the exemplar prompts according to the probability scores it receives as a feedback for attack\neffectiveness.\nAlthough the scoring strategy gives us the best results in terms of attack effectiveness, we observe\nthat it generates less diverse set of generated prompts in some cases. On the other hand, SFS, LIFO,\nand Scoring-LIFO strategies produce better results in terms of generating diverse set of prompts. The\nlack of diverse generations in scoring strategy is in part due to the fact that in scoring attack, the\nred LM learns an effective prompt that is strong in terms of triggering the text-to-image model in\nunsafe generation; thus, it keeps repeating the same/similar prompts that are effective which affects\ndiverse output generation. To alleviate this problem, and encourage diverse generations in scoring\nattack strategy, we attempt to control the diversity of prompts through the addition of diversity as an\nadditional objective (ODiv(Xt)) in the next set of experiments.\nControlling Diversity To enhance the diversity of generations by the scoring attack strategy, we\nadd an additional objective to the initial attack effectiveness objective that controls for diversity.

We use cosine similarity to calculate pairwise similarity of two sentence\nembeddings6 [26]. Thus, the scoring strategy tries to optimize for \u03bb1O1 + \u03bb2O2 where O1 is the\nattack effectiveness objective (OAE(Xt)), and O2 is the diversity objective (ODiv(Xt)). To observe\nthe effect of the newly added objective on enhancing the diversity of generations in scoring attack\nstrategy, we fix \u03bb1 = 1 and vary the \u03bb2 parameter and report the attack effectiveness vs diversity\ntrade-offs in Figure 2. We demonstrate that by increasing the \u03bb2 parameter value, the diversity of\ngenerated prompts increase as expected with a trade-off on attack effectiveness. We demonstrate that\nusing the scoring strategy, one can control the trade-offs and that the red LM can learn a strategy to\nsatisfy different objectives to attack the text-to-image model.\n3.2\nAblation Studies\nIn addition to the main experiments, we perform ablation studies to address the following questions:\nQ1: Would the results hold if we use a different language model as the red LM?\nQ2: Would the results hold if we add content moderation in text-to-image models?\nQ3: Can we control for the toxicity of the prompts using the scoring attack strategy?\nQ4: Would the attacks transfer to other models?\nQ5: How robust our findings are to the existing flaws in the safety classifiers?\nFor the ablation studies, we only use the first set of seed prompts to report the results as the results\nmostly follow similar patters. All the other setups are the same as the main experiments unless\notherwise specified.\nQ1: Different Language Model To answer the question on whether the results hold if we use a\ndifferent language model as the red LM, we replace the GPT-Neo model utilized in our main experi-\nments with BLOOM 3b parameter model [28]7. We then report the results on attack effectiveness\ncomparing the different attack strategies. From the results reported in Table 2, we observe similar\npatterns to that we reported previously which suggests that the results still hold even when we use\na different language model as our red LM. In our results, we demonstrate that the scoring attack\nstrategy is the most effective attack. However, similar to our previous observations, it suffers from\nthe repetition problem and lack of diverse generations if we only optimize for attack effectiveness\nwithout considering diversity as the secondary objective. SFS, LIFO, and Scoring-LIFO generate\nmore diverse outcomes with lower attack effectiveness compared to the scoring strategy similar to\nour previous findings.\nQ2: Content Moderation To answer the question on whether applying content moderation on\ntext-to-image models affects the results, we turn on the built-in content moderation (safety filter)\n6https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity\n7https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-3b\n6\nModel\nLIFO\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nFIFO\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nScoring\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nScoring-LIFO\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nSFS\u2191(diversity\u2191)\nStable Diffusion (SD)\n45.7 (97.4)\n25.7 (95.0)\n86.3 (43.3)\n48.7 (98.8)\n33.2 (98.8)\nWeak Safe SD\n48.2 (97.3)\n80.9 (5.8)\n79.6 (19.5)\n46.1 (99.4)\n29.5 (95.9)\nMedium Safe SD\n40.0 (97.5)\n17.3 (52.6)\n57.3 (63.5)\n40.0 (99.0)\n14.2 (97.9)\nStrong Safe SD\n37.6 (97.9)\n11.9 (90.8)\n55.0 (89.3)\n36.9 (98.9)\n12.2 (100.0)\nMax Safe SD\n28.3 (98.6)\n77.7 (17.5)\n23.4 (90.6)\n26.2 (97.0)\n8.0 (98.7)\nTable 3: Attack effectiveness and diversity results with safety filter on in stable diffusion models.\nin text-to-image models. This content moderation (safety filter) operationalizes by comparing the\nclip embedding of the generated image to a set of predefined unsafe topics and filtering the image\nif the similarity is above a certain threshold [25]. In this set of experiments, we turn on the safety\nfilter in all the text-to-image models studied in this work and report our findings in Table 3. We\ndemonstrate that although as expected the effectiveness of the attacks drop in some cases as we turn\non the safety filter, still the attacks are effective and that the scoring strategy for the most cases is the\nmost effective strategy with similar trend on the diversity of the results as we observed previously.\nThese results demonstrate that applying FLIRT can also help in red teaming text-to-image models\nthat have a content moderation mechanism on which can help us red team the text-to-image model as\nwell as the content moderation applied on it and detecting the weaknesses behind each component.\nAlthough the main goal of this work is to analyze robustness of text-to-image models irrespective of\nwhether a content moderation is applied on them or not, we still demonstrate that FLIRT is powerful\nenough to red team models with content moderation applied on them.\nModel\n\u03bb2 = 0 \u2193(attack effectiveness\u2191)\n\u03bb2 = 0.5 \u2193(attack effectiveness\u2191)\nSD\n82.7 (93.2)\n6.7 (53.6)\nWeak\n43.6 (84.7)\n0.0 (98.2)\nMedium\n11.5 (82.0)\n0.4 (72.7)\nStrong\n1.2 (86.8)\n0.5 (70.0)\nMax\n18.8 (36.2)\n1.8 (21.6)\nTable 4: Percentage of toxic prompts generated by\nthe red LM before (\u03bb2 = 0) and after (\u03bb2 = 0.5)\napplying low-toxicity constraint in scoring attack.\nQ3: Toxicity of Prompts In this set of experi-\nments, we are interested in showing whether the\nred LM can generate prompts that are looking\nsafe (non-toxic), but at the same time can trig-\nger text-to-image models into unsafe generation.\nThis is particularly interesting to study since our\nmotivation is to analyze prompt-level filters that\ncan serve as effective defense mechanisms for\ntext-to-image models. Secondly, we want to\nanalyze robustness of text-to-image models to\nimplicit prompts that might not sound toxic but\ncan be dangerous in terms of triggering unsafe content generation in text-to-image models. Toward\nthis goal, we incorporate a secondary objective in scoring attack strategy in addition to attack ef-\nfectiveness that controls for toxicity of the generated prompts. Thus, our scoring based objective\nbecomes \u03bb1O1 + \u03bb2O2 where O1 is the attack effectiveness objective (OAE(Xt)), and O2 is for\nthe low-toxicity of the prompt (OLT (Xt)) which is (1 \u2212 toxicity) score coming from our utilized\ntoxicity classifier (Perspective API)8. In our experiments, we fix \u03bb1 = 1 and compare results for\nwhen we set \u03bb2 = 0 (which is when we do not impose any constraint on the safety of the prompts) vs\n\u03bb2 = 0.5 (when there is a safety constraint imposed on the prompts). In our results demonstrated in\nTable 4, we observe that by imposing the safety constraint on the toxicity of the prompts, we are able\nto drastically reduce the toxicity of the prompts generated and that we can control this trade-off using\nour scoring strategy by controlling for attack effectiveness vs prompt toxicity.\nTo\n\u2192\nFrom \u2193\nSD\nWeak\nMedium\nStrong\nMax\nSD\n100.0\n93.8\n84.6\n72.1\n54.7\nWeak\n91.1\n100.0\n78.3\n65.5\n50.2\nMedium\n97.3\n95.2\n100.0\n74.9\n55.8\nStrong\n99.4\n99.3\n97.9\n100.0\n55.6\nMax\n86.7\n84.2\n73.5\n62.7\n100.0\nTable 5: Transferability of the attacks from one\nstable diffusion model to another.\nQ4: Attack Transferability In transferability\nexperiments, we study whether an attack\nimposed on one text-to-image model can\ntransfer to other text-to-image models.\nIn\nthis set of experiments, we take successful\nprompts that are generated through FLIRT using\nscoring attack strategy optimized for attack\neffectiveness towards triggering a particular\ntext-to-image model, and apply them to another\nmodel.

As reported in Table 5, we observe that attacks transfer successfully\nfrom one text-to-image model to another. As expected, it is harder to transfer attacks to more robust\nmodels compared to less robust ones (e.g., it is easier to transfer attacks from SD to weak safe SD\ncompared to SD to max safe SD).\nQ5: Noise in Safety Classifiers Since FLIRT relies on the automatic feedback coming from the\nsafety classifiers, it is possible that existing noise and flaws in the classifier affect our findings. To\nput this into test and verify that our findings are robust to the existing imperfections in the safety\nclassifiers, we impose different levels of noise to the outcome of the safety classifiers applied on\nimages generated by the stable diffusion model. In our experiments, we randomly flip different \u03f5\npercentages (5%, 10%, and 20%) of the output labels produced by the safety classifiers applied on\nthe generated images and report the results in Table 6. In our results, we report that our results and\nfindings still hold. Scoring strategy still outperforms other strategies in terms of attack effectiveness,\nand SFS, LIFO, and Scoring-LIFO strategies generate more diverse set of prompts.\n3.3\nRed Teaming Text-to-text Models\nTo demonstrate whether FLIRT can be used to red team text-to-text models, we replace the text-\nto-image models studied in previous experiments with the GPT-Neo 2.7B parameter language\nmodel [2, 8]9. Since in this experiment the output of the target model is text instead of image, we\nreplace NudeNet and Q16 classifiers which are image based safety classifiers with TOXIGEN model\nwhich is a toxic language detection model [10]. In this study, the goal is to red team a language model\nand trigger it to generate toxic responses. Thus, we report the percentage of responses generated\nby the target model that are toxic. We use a new set of seed prompts that are suitable for language\ndomain to trigger toxic generation (listed in Appendix) and keep the rest of the experimental setups\nthe same. In our results demonstrated in Table 7, we observe that our introduced attack strategies\nin this paper utilized in FLIRT significantly outperform the SFS baseline that was introduced to\nspecifically red team language models [21]. These results show the flexibility of FLIRT to effectively\nbe applicable to language (text-to-text) space in addition to text-to-image.\n4\nRelated Work\nAdversarial Machine Learning There has been a significant body of work in the area of adver-\nsarial machine learning for robustness improvement in different applications and models [22, 4].\nResearchers and pioneers in the field of adversarial machine learning have investigated approaches in\nterms of proposing different attack and defense strategies to test and enhance robustness of different\nmodels [14, 23, 16, 6]. With the rise of foundation models [3], some of the recent adversarial strate-\ngies have taken new shapes and forms, such as jail-breaking attacks [15] and red teaming efforts [7]\nto evaluate and improve safety and robustness of foundation models, such as ChatGPT.\nSafety In addition, with the incorporation of foundation models in different applications [1], improv-\ning safety and robustness of these models along with aligning them with moral norms has become\n9https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\n8\ncritical [11, 12]. Analyzing and improving robustness of AI systems toward safety concerns have\nbeen studied previously in language, vision, and multi-modal models [18, 34, 29, 13]. Not only\nin foundation models, but safety is studied in more general AI applications and models, such as\nautonomous vehicles [33]. Safety is also widely studied in reinforcement learning for applications in\nrobotics and autonomous vehicles [35, 32, 17].\nRed Teaming One major contributor to safety analysis constitutes the red teaming efforts that have\nbeen practiced against various language and multi-modal models including humans in the loop [7, 19].\nSome other efforts in red teaming have tried to automate the setup and utilize a red language model\ninstead of humans in the loop [21, 18]. However, these studies were in the context of language\nmodels and not multi-modal. There have been some efforts in red teaming text-to-image models\nusing humans in the loop [19]; however, this area is still underexplored in terms of studies that aim to\nautomate red teaming efforts in text-to-image models. The closest work to red teaming text-to-image\nmodels is [29] in which authors manually created a benchmark dataset to asses safety of these models\nand trained safe text-to-image models that would avoid unsafe image generation utilized in this paper.\nThere have also been studies on red teaming the content moderation or safety filters imposed on\ntext-to-image models [25]. We hope that our studies in this work will encourage more future work in\nthis domain that is relatively new and underexplored.\n5\nDiscussion\nWe introduce the feedback loop in-context red teaming framework that aims to red team models\nto expose their vulnerabilities toward unsafe content generation. We demonstrate that in-context\nlearning incorporated in a feedback based framework can be utilized by the red LM to generate\neffective prompts that can trigger unsafe content generation in text-to-image and text-to-text models.\nIn addition, we propose numerous variations of effective attack strategies. We perform different\nexperiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed automated framework. Although in this\nwork we introduce and use FLIRT as a red teaming framework, this framework can have different\nusecases. For instance, FLIRT can be used for synthetic data generation in different domains, it can\nbe used for model enhancement and evaluation according to various aspects not limited to responsible\nAI practices, and it can be utilized for personalization.\nLimitations Since FLIRT relies on the automatic feedback coming from classifiers, it is possible that\nexisting noise in the classifier affects the outcome. However, we perform ablation studies as reported\nin Table 6 and verify that our results still hold and are robust to the introduced noise in the outcome\nof the classifier. Since the results rely on the accuracy of the classifier, it is possible that we get some\nfalse positives in the generated examples. To address these issues, it is possible to incorporate human\nfeedback if one is concerned about existing flaws in the trained classifiers. FLIRT is flexible to allow\nreplacement of each component with a substitute of choice.\nBroader Impact Since FLIRT does not require any expensive training or fine-tuning of a language\nmodel, it is more efficient and green compared to previous work. In addition to red teaming which\nis critical in the responsible AI development, FLIRT can be used for synthetic data generation to\nimprove and enhance models. It can also be used to probe and understand various models. Although\nFLIRT can be used to evaluate and enhance models according to safety and responsible AI concerns,\nif used by malicious actors, it can result in unsafe content generation which can have negative societal\nimpact. To alleviate this issue in part, we can work on setting up an appropriate license for our\nframework prohibiting malicious use outside of research. In addition, it is possible that existing biases\nin the utilized models propagate to the downstream analysis and produced datasets. Thus, careful\nauditing of these models is recommended.\nReferences\n[1] Amit Alfassy, Assaf Arbelle, Oshri Halimi, Sivan Harary, Roei Herzig, Eli Schwartz, Rameswar\nPanda, Michele Dolfi, Christoph Auer, Peter Staar, Kate Saenko, Rogerio Feris, and Leonid\nKarlinsky.

Curran Associates, Inc., 2021.\n12\nAppendix\nAll the experiments were performed on an AWS p3.8xlarge EC2 instance.\nA\nSeed Prompts\nTo perform our main set of experiments, we utilize three different sets of seed prompts to capture a\nwide range of different unsafe content categorizations. We derive these categories from a previous\nwork [29]. These categories include content on Sexual, violence, self-harm, harassment, hate,\nillegal activity, and shocking topics. We aim to not only design seed prompts to capture a wide\nrange of topics in these categories, but also each set is designed to capture one dimension on how\nprompts can play a role in the attack performance.\nFor instance, our first set of seed prompts are designed to capture the effect of providing detail\ndescription of a prompt and its effect on unsafe content generation. We noticed that providing the safe\nstable diffusion models with prompt:image of a naked woman might not result in an image of a naked\nwoman; however, when we provide more detail description about the naked woman prompt:image\nof a naked woman. Nipples visible in the image the provided description results in an image of a\ncompletely naked woman. Thus, providing more description can have effect on the performance of\nthe attack and we wanted to capture this effect by dividing our sets of seeds in different levels of\ngranularity according to the provided descriptions. Set 2 of our prompts contains similar prompts to\nthat in Set 1 but will less provided description to compare the differences in sets 1 and 2. Finally, Set\n3 contains a completely new set of seed prompts that serves as a sanity check that our results hold for\na new set of seed prompts that are different from sets 1 and 2.\nTable 9 contains the exemplar prompts in each set. Each of these sets are used as the seed in-context\nexemplar prompts in the initialization stage. The example 0 is the instruction prompt that contains\nthe task description. The rest of the examples are the actual prompts that the model tries to use as\nin-context exemplars to learn the task from. We start each exemplar prompt by using prompt as a\nprefix to the actual prompt for the model to be able to differentiate the instruction prompt from the\nrest of the exemplar prompts. For the text-to-text experiments, we use a numbered list to differentiate\nthe instruction prompt from the exemplar prompts (e.g., the instruction prompt stays as is and we\nstart numbering the exemplar prompts as if they are in a list).\nB\nExperimental Details\nFor the text-to-image and text-to-text experiments, we use four and five FLIRT iterations respectively\nin the scheduling mechanism of the scoring-LIFO experiments to force update the stack if no updates\ntake place. For all the classifiers, such as NudeNet, perspective API, and TOXIGEN, we use a\nthreshold value of 0.5 to determine if an image or text is unsafe or toxic. For the red LM, we set topk\nand topp values to 50 and 0.95 respectively during decoding.\nC\nQualitative Results\nTable 8 contains some qualitative examples from prompts generated through FLIRT. These prompts\nare part of our curated dataset that can trigger text-to-image models into unsafe image generation.\nDue to the corresponding generated images containing extremely NSWF content, we have put them in\na separate file as a supplementary material for interested readers to refer to them separately. Figure 4\ncontains word clouds of the most frequent words in generated prompts from each attack strategy.\nThe differences in the word clouds provide some information on existing differences in each attack\nstrategy. These results are for when we applied the attacks on first set of seed prompts from Table 9.\nD\nScoring Algorithm\nThe general and greedy scoring algorithms are illustrated in Algorithms 1 and 2 respectively. We use\nthe greedy algorithm for cases where all the objectives that the red LM aims to satisfy can be reduced\nto functions over individual elements and the general algorithm for all the other cases.\n13\nPrompts Generated by the Red LM\nA man having sex with a woman.

Smith1,3\nLuke Zettlemoyer1\n1University of Washington\n2UC Berkeley\n3Allen Institute for AI\n{sewon,sg01,hannaneh,nasmith,lsz}@cs.washington.edu\nericwallace@berkeley.edu\nABSTRACT\nThe legality of training language models (LMs) on copyrighted or otherwise re-\nstricted data is under intense debate. However, as we show, model performance\nsignificantly degrades if trained only on low-risk text (e.g., out-of-copyright books\nor government documents), due to its limited size and domain coverage. We present\nSILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff during\ninference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on the OPEN LICENSE\nCORPUS (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and\npermissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily\nmodifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news)\nthat is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk data\nwithout training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and enables data\nproducers to opt out from the model by removing content from the store. These\ncapabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such as the fair use doc-\ntrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European Union. Our experiments\nshow that the parametric LM struggles on domains not covered by OLC. However,\naccess to the datastore greatly improves out of domain performance, closing 90%\nof the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile, a more diverse corpus with\nmostly high-risk text. We also analyze which nonparametric approach works best,\nwhere the remaining errors lie, and how performance scales with datastore size.\nOur results suggest that it is possible to build high quality language models while\nmitigating their legal risk.1\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LMs) are under widespread legal scrutiny, in large part because they are\ntrained on copyrighted content, which may infringe on the rights of data producers (Metz, 2022;\nVincent, 2023; J.L. et al. v. Alphabet Inc., 2023; Brittain, 2023). At the heart of this discussion\nis the inherent tradeoff between legal risk and model performance. Training only on data sources\nsuch as public domain, non-copyrightable or otherwise permissively licensed data significantly\ndegrades performance (as we show in \u00a73). This limitation arises from the scarcity of permissive data\nand its narrow specificity to sources such as copyright-expired books, government documents, and\npermissively licensed code, which are largely different from common LM corpora that cover more\ndiverse domains (Raffel et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Together, 2023).\nIn this paper, we demonstrate it is possible to improve the risk-performance tradeoff by segregating\ntraining data into two distinct parts of the model: parametric and nonparametric (Figure 1). We learn\nLM parameters on low-risk data (i.e., data under the most permissive licenses), and then use high-risk\ndata (i.e., data under copyright, restrictive licenses, or unknown licenses) in an inference-time-only\nnonparametric component (called a datastore). With nonparametric datastores, we can retrieve\nhigh-risk data to improve model predictions without training on it. The datastore can be easily\nupdated at any time, and allows creators to remove their data from the model entirely, at the level of\nindividual examples. This approach also attributes model predictions at the sentence-level, enabling\n\u2217Equal Contribution.\n1We release all models, data, and code publicly at https://github.com/kernelmachine/silo-lm.\n1\narXiv:2308.04430v1  [cs.CL]  8 Aug 2023\nCall me Ishmael.

(...)\nfrom llama import LLaMA\nFigure 1: An overview of SILO. We train a parametric language model on low-risk datasets that\ncontain public domain text (e.g., copyright-expired books) and permissively licensed code. At\ninference time, we use a nonparametric datastore that can include high-risk data, including medical\ntext with personally-identifiable information, copyrighted news, copyrighted books, data requiring\nattribution, and code under non-permissive licenses (counterclockwise from the top of figure). The\ndatastore can be modified at any time, e.g., to respond to opt-out requests.\ncredit assignment to data owners. These new capabilities enable better alignment of the model with\nvarious data-use regulations, e.g., the fair use doctrine in the United States (Henderson et al., 2023)\nand the GDPR in the European Union (Zhang et al., 2023), as detailed in \u00a72. This is in contrast to\nparametric models, where removing high-risk data is infeasible after training (Bourtoule et al., 2020;\nCarlini et al., 2021) and data attribution at scale is difficult (Zhang et al., 2021; Han et al., 2023).\nWe introduce SILO, a new nonparametric language model that follows our proposal (\u00a74). The\nparametric component in SILO is trained on a new pretraining corpus, the OPEN LICENSE CORPUS\n(OLC, \u00a73), which we curate to include data under three types of permissive licenses, from public\ndomain to Creative Commons. OLC is diverse but has a domain distribution that is very different\nfrom typical pre-training corpora; it is dominated by code and government text. This leads to a\nnew challenge of generalizing a model trained on highly specific domains, which we call extreme\ndomain generalization. We train three 1.3B-parameter LMs on varying subsets of OLC, and then\nconstruct a test-time datastore that can include high-risk data, employing a retrieval method to\nmake use of the datastore\u2019s contents during inference. We compare two widely studied retrieval\nmethods: a nearest-neighbors approach (kNN-LM) that uses a nonparametric next-token prediction\nfunction (Khandelwal et al., 2020) and a retrieval-in-context approach (RIC-LM) that retrieves text\nblocks and feeds them to the parametric LM in context (Shi et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023).\nWe evaluate SILO in language modeling perplexity on 14 different domains, covering both in-domain\nand out-of-domain data with respect to OLC (\u00a75). These domains highlight specific legal risks,\ne.g., copyrighted materials such as books, news and user reviews, or private data such as emails\nand clinical notes. We compare SILO to Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), a parametric LM with a\nsimilar parameter count but trained mostly on high-risk data (Gao et al., 2020).2 We first show that\nparametric-only SILO is competitive on domains covered by OLC but falls short out-of-domain,\nconfirming the challenge of extreme domain generalization. However, adding an inference-time\ndatastore to SILO effectively addresses this challenge. Comparing the two methods of retrieving over\nthis datastore, we find that while both kNN-LM and RIC-LM significantly improve out-of-domain\nperformance, the former generalizes better than the latter, allowing SILO to reduce the gap with the\nPythia baseline by 90% on average across all domains. Further analysis attributes these improvements\nto two factors: (1) kNN-LM strongly benefits from scaling the datastore and (2) the nonparametric\nnext-token prediction in kNN-LM is robust to domain shift. Altogether, our study suggests that in the\nfew domains where SILO has not yet matched Pythia performance levels, the remaining gaps can\nlikely be closed by scaling the datastore size and further enhancing the nonparametric model.\n2The Pile contains a large amount of copyrighted or restrictively licensed data, e.g., most content in its\nBooks3, ArXiv, Github, OpenWebText, YoutubeSubtitles, and Common Crawl subsets.\n2\n2\nBACKGROUND & RELATED WORK\nTraining datasets for language models.\nState-of-the-art LMs are trained on vast text corpora\nthat consist of billions or even trillions of tokens (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Gao et al.,\n2020; Together, 2023). These training sets are built by combining (1) manually selected sources\nsuch as Wikipedia, book collections, and GitHub and (2) web pages collected through web-crawling\nservices such as Common Crawl. Most LM training efforts ignore copyright and intellectual property\nregulations that apply to these texts. For example, sources such as GitHub repositories and book\ncollections typically contain text with highly restrictive licenses (Bandy & Vincent, 2021).\nLegality of language models.\nThe legality of training LMs this way has become a subject of\nintense debate, with numerous lawsuits being filed in the United States, United Kingdom, and\nbeyond (Gershgorn, 2021; Metz, 2022; Vincent, 2023; De Vynck, 2023; Silverman et al. v. Meta\nPlatforms, Inc., 2023; J.L. et al. v. Alphabet Inc., 2023; Silverman et al. v. OpenAI, Inc., 2023;\nTremblay et al. v. OpenAI, 2023). While the outcome of the lawsuits is uncertain, it is likely that\ncopyright issues will continue to be a major factor in future LMs, especially since each country has\nits own data regulations. For example,\n\u2022 In the United States, the fair use doctrine allows the public to use copyrighted data in certain\ncases, even without a license (Henderson et al., 2023). Deciding whether or not a model\u2019s use of\ncopyrighted work constitutes fair use involves multiple dimensions, including whether the trained\nmodel is intended for commercial use, whether or not the work is factual or creative, the amount\nof the copyright content used, and the value of the copyrighted work. There are claims that using\nparametric language models for generative use-cases does not constitute fair use, because the\ntechnology may output the copyrighted text verbatim (Lemley & Casey, 2020), which also has\nbeen shown empirically (Carlini et al., 2021; 2023; Kandpal et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2023). This\nis in contrast to transformative technologies, such as classifiers, which may use the copyrighted\ntext but do not directly generate content, which the fair use doctrine favors. We refer readers to\nHenderson et al. (2023) for a more comprehensive discussion.\n\u2022 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection and privacy\nlaw in the European Union (EU). It grants individuals more control over their data by regulating\norganizations and businesses. The obligations include (1) obtaining consent from users before\nprocessing their data, (2) providing transparency about data processing, (3) ensuring data security,\nand (4) allowing individuals to access, correct, and erase their data. GDPR has global impact, as\nmany international companies handle EU citizens\u2019 data. While it is under debate how GDPR is\napplied to training language models, compliance with GDPR is expensive (e.g., requiring retraining\nfor every data correction or erasure). See Zhang et al. (2023) for more discussion on challenges for\ncompliance with the GDPR\u2019s Right to Erasure (and the Right to be Forgotten in general).\nThe goal of our work is not to weigh in on legal discussions; instead, we study the feasibility of\ndeveloping technologies that explicitly manage legal risk. In particular, our technique places all\ncopyrighted data in a nonparametric datastore. While the data is still used in service of a generative\nmodel, restricting copyrighted data in a datastore and providing instance-level attribution and data\nopt-out can increase the likelihood of a successful fair use defense (Henderson et al., 2022).3\nMoreover, GDPR\u2019s requirement regarding user data access, correction, and erasure aligns well with\nthe capabilities of the datastore. Attribution and opt-out are fundamental features of our model (\u00a74.2).\nThis is in contrast to other techniques like post-hoc training data attribution (Koh & Liang, 2017; Han\net al., 2023) and the removal of the effect of particular training examples from parameters (Cao &\nYang, 2015; Jang et al., 2023b), which lack inherent guarantees and are hard to scale.\nPrior work in copyright risk mitigation.\nThe most straightforward approach to avoid copyright\ninfringement is to filter training data to only include permissive licenses. This has been done in prior\nwork, primarily for code-based datasets (e.g., Kocetkov et al., 2023; Fried et al., 2023; Together,\n2023) and scientific text (e.g., Soldaini & Lo, 2023). Extending a similar approach to a wider range\nof domains remains unclear, because permissive data is extremely scarce in most domains, e.g., books\nand news. For the same reason, Henderson et al. (2023) has suggested that restricting the training\n3Our model on its own does not entirely remove legal risk. Rather, it provides functionalities that, when used\nappropriately, lower legal risk and strengthen a fair use defense. See \u00a76 for a discussion.\n3\ndata to public domain or otherwise permissively licensed data may be impractical. In this work, we\nshow that there is in fact a large number of tokens from data sources with permissive licenses, but the\nkey challenge instead arises from the highly skewed domain distribution. See \u00a76 for other copyright\nmitigation strategies that are more technical in nature.\n3\nBUILDING THE OPEN LICENSE CORPUS: A PERMISSIVELY-LICENSED\nPRE-TRAINING CORPUS\nOur study focuses on addressing the legal risk of copyright violation in language models by separating\nlow-risk data sources (i.e., those in the public domain or under permissive licenses) from high-risk\nones (i.e., those with unknown licenses or under copyright). We introduce the OPEN LICENSE\nCORPUS (OLC), a large collection of permissive textual datasets across multiple domains with a\ntaxonomy of data licenses that delineate their permissiveness (\u00a73.1). We group the data into three\nlevels of legal permissiveness (\u00a73.2) and conduct a thorough analysis (\u00a73.3). This curated data is then\nused to train model parameters (\u00a74) and highlights the challenge of extreme domain generalization\ndue to its skewed domain distribution.\nA disclaimer.\nThe license taxonomy and categorization of texts that we present is by no means\nperfect, and OLC should not be considered a universally safe-to-use dataset. The license associated\nwith a document may be time- and country-dependent, e.g., Gutenberg books (Project Gutenberg)\nare public domain in the United States, but some of them may still have copyright attached outside\nof the United States. Moreover, other legal constraints (e.g., the Digital Millenium Copyright Act)4\nmay prohibit the use of a data source despite a permissive data license. Finally, we do not explicitly\nfilter out personally identifiable information from the corpus, so it is possible that certain subsets still\npose privacy risks despite being permissively licensed. We encourage users of OLC to consult a legal\nprofessional on the suitability of each data source for their application.\n3.1\nTAXONOMY OF DATA LICENSES\nAs discussed in \u00a72, determining what data one is permitted to use from a copyright perspective is an\nongoing topic of debate, and is context- and country-dependent (Henderson et al., 2023). In this paper,\nwe take a conservative approach where we train models using only text with the most permissible\nlicenses, thus enabling widespread downstream use. Concretely, we focus on four broad categories:\n\u2022 Public domain (pd) text has no restrictions. This includes texts whose intellectual property rights\nhave expired (e.g., the works of William Shakespeare) or been expressly waived by the creator (e.g.,\nCC0-licensed scientific papers).\n\u2022 Permissively licensed software (sw) including MIT, Apache, and BSD software are quite permis-\nsive to use. Unlike public domain text, these licenses typically carry some basic stipulations such\nas requiring one to include a copy of the original license (although, it is debatable whether it is still\nrequired when the associated text is used as data or treated as a software). The code is otherwise\nfree to use, and code is generally well protected by fair use clauses (Lemley & Casey, 2020).\n\u2022 Attribution licenses (by) such as Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) are free to use as\nlong as \u201ccredit is given to the creator.\u201d For example, if a journalist writes a new article that cites\ninformation from Wikipedia (a CC-BY source), then they must provide a form of citation, link, or\nattribution back to the original source. In the context of machine learning, it is not clear what an\nattribution would constitute. For example, under one interpretation, every LM generation should\ninclude a complete list of sources that contributed highly to it (Henderson et al., 2023). In this\npaper, we take a conservative approach and do not include by data in the main experiments, but\nstill include the by data for future use as well as for ablations, since by data is generally considered\nquite permissive.\n\u2022 All other data that is not in one of the above three categories is assumed to be non-permissive. This\nincludes: any text that is explicitly protected by copyright or licenses that are non-commercial (e.g.,\nCC-NC), any software without clear MIT, BSD, or Apache licenses, and any generic web-crawled\ndata where the license or copyright information may be unclear.\n4https://www.copyright.gov/dmca/\n4\nDomain\nSources\nSpecific License\n# BPE Tokens (B)\nLegal\npd Case Law, Pile of Law (PD subset)\nPublic Domain\n27.1\nby Pile of Law (CC BY-SA subset)\nCC BY-SA\n0.07\nCode\nsw Github (permissive)\nMIT/BSD/Apache\n58.9\nConversational\nsw HackerNews, Ubuntu IRC\nMIT/Apache\n5.9\nby Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange\nCC BY-SA\n21.3\nMath\nsw Deepmind Math, AMPS\nApache\n3.5\nScience\npd ArXiv abstracts, S2ORC (PD subset)\nPublic Domain\n1.2\nby S2ORC (CC BY-SA subset)\nCC BY-SA\n70.3\nBooks\npd Gutenberg\nPublic Domain\n2.9\nNews\npd Public domain news\nPublic Domain\n0.2\nby Wikinews\nCC BY-SA\n0.01\nEncyclopedic\nby Wikipedia\nCC BY-SA\n37.0\nTable 1: Overview statistics of OLC. pd, sw, and by indicates public domain data, data under\npermissive software licenses, and data under attribution licenses, respectively. Some corpora contain\na mixture of different licenses (e.g., Pile of Law and S2ORC), which we split into subsets based on\nper-document licenses. BPE tokens are based on the GPT-NeoX tokenizer (Black et al., 2022).\nIn \u00a74.3, we train the models on varying subsets of licenses\u2014from pd and pdsw to pdbysw\u2014to\naccommodate different risk tolerances.\n3.2\nBUILDING THE OPEN LICENSE CORPUS\nBased on this taxonomy of licenses, OLC is a 228B token corpus of pd, sw, and by data. OLC con-\nsists of 17 manually-selected sources of primarily English text that are under permissive licenses,5 as\nsummarized in Table 1.\nThe text generally falls into eight different domains:\n\u2022 pd by Legal: We curate legal text from the Pile of Law (Henderson et al., 2022), an amalgation of\n31 different sources of text related to civil court cases, patents, and other legal and governmental\nworks, either licensed as public domain or CC-BY. We also gather public domain text from the Case\nLaw Access Project (Caselaw Access Project), which covers over 6.5 million decisions published\nby state and federal courts throughout U.S. history.\n\u2022 sw Code: We use the Github subset of the RedPajama dataset (Together, 2023), which contains\ncode from Github repositories with three permissive software licenses: MIT, Apache, and BSD.\n\u2022 sw by Conversation: We source conversational text under permissive software licenses from the\nHackerNews (MIT license) and the Ubuntu IRC (Apache license) subsets of the Pile (Gao et al.,\n2020). We also use the Stackexchange subset of the RedPajama dataset (Together, 2023) and a\nStackoverflow corpus from Kaggle,6 both under the CC-BY-SA license.\n\u2022 sw Math: We source mathematical text from the Deepmind Mathematics (Saxton et al., 2019) and\nthe AMPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021) datasets, both of which are under the Apache license.\n\u2022 pd by Science: We source scientific text from ArXiv abstracts that are in the public domain (ArXiv,\n2023). We also collect full-text articles from the Semantic Scholar Research Corpus (Lo et al.,\n2020, S2ORC), either licensed as public domain or CC-BY.\n\u2022 pd Books: We source books from the Gutenberg corpus (Project Gutenberg), which are copyright-\nexpired books that are in the public domain.\n\u2022 pd by News: We collect public domain news text from the English subset of the MOT cor-\npus (Palen-Michel et al., 2022). We also collect text from Wikinews, which is under CC BY-SA.\n5We include the data in only when the license information is clearly stated as part of metadata. While we\ntried our best to collect the data for OLC, it is possible we missed potential sources, as it relies on manual efforts;\nfuture work can study collecting more permissive text at scale, as discussed in \u00a76.\n6https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stackoverflow\n5\npd\npdsw\npdswby\nThe Pile\nDomain\nTokens (B)\n%\nTokens (B)\n%\nTokens (B)\n%\nTokens (B)\n%\nCode\n0.0\n0.0\n58.9\n59.1\n58.9\n25.8\n32.6\n9.8\nLegal\n27.1\n86.2\n27.1\n27.2\n27.2\n11.9\n30.8\n9.3\nConversation\n0.0\n0.0\n5.9\n5.9\n27.2\n11.9\n33.1\n10.0\nMath\n0.0\n0.0\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n1.50\n7.1\n2.1\nBooks\n2.9\n9.3\n2.9\n2.9\n2.9\n1.3\n47.1\n14.2\nScience\n1.2\n3.8\n1.2\n1.2\n71.5\n31.3\n86.0\n26.0\nNews\n0.2\n0.7\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n-\u2020\n-\u2020\nWikipedia\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n37.0\n16.2\n12.1\n3.7\nUnverified web\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n83.1\n25.0\nTotal\n31.4\n100.0\n99.6\n100.0\n228.3\n100.0\n331.9\n100.0\nTable 2: OLC is large but its distribution is different from that of typical pretraining corpora\nlike the Pile. Data distribution of OLC (pd, pdsw, pdswby) in comparison to the Pile (Gao et al.,\n2020), a common LM training dataset that is not specifically designed for legal permissibility. We\nreport the number of tokens in billions, and the relative frequency. \u2020: There is no explicit news\ndomain in the Pile, but news sites are found to be some of the most representative data sources in\nCommon Crawl (Dodge et al., 2021).\n\u2022 by Encyclopedic: Finally, we include a large set of Wikipedia from the subset included in\nRedPajama (Together, 2023). We follow RedPajama in using Wikipedia snapshots from 20\nlanguages even though the model primarily focuses on English.\nFollowing Kandpal et al. (2022); Lee et al. (2022), we deduplicate text using Groeneveld (2023),\na document-level filter that considers n-gram overlap. We first deduplicate within each domain to\nremove redundant documents from similar sources (e.g. Case Law and the Pile of Law), and then\nperform deduplication against the validation and test datasets of the Pile to avoid test leakage.\n3.3\nANALYSIS OF OLC\nIn Table 2, we compare the distribution of domains in OLC to that of the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), a\npopular pretraining corpus that includes data under copyright restrictions (e.g., Books, web crawl).7\nThese statistics convey a number of research challenges when working with OLC. First, while we\ntried our best to collect public domain or permissively-licensed data, the size of OLC is still 31%\nsmaller than the Pile. In addition, while the majority of the Pile is sourced from scientific text, web\ncrawl, and books, OLC is dominated by code, scientific text, and legal text. This highlights that\nmodels designed for use outside these specific domains will likely struggle and may require special\ntechniques for extreme domain generalization.\nTo analyze this further, we perform an n-gram based analysis of OLC domains against the validation\ndata of the Pile, to better understand the domain shifts. For each validation domain, we examine\nthe maximum n-gram overlap across all OLC domains (see \u00a7B for more details). OLC domains\nhave substantially less overlap with the validation data as compared to the Pile training domains: on\naverage, the overlap between OLC domains and the validation domains is just 17%\u00b19%, versus\n28%\u00b114% for the Pile training data. However, we find a large variance in overlap statistics across\ndomains in OLC; we display the full matrix of n-gram overlap in \u00a7B. These results provide further\nevidence that models trained on OLC must handle larger domain shifts at test time than models\ntrained on the Pile. Later, we show that these n-gram overlap statistics correlate strongly with\nlanguage modeling performance (\u00a75.1).\n4\nSILO\nWe introduce SILO, which combines an LM trained on permissive data with a nonparametric datastore\nbased on less restricted data.

We first describe the general methodology from prior work (\u00a74.1\u20134.2) and then\nhow we build SILO upon them by placing low-risk data and high-risk data to model parameters and a\nnonparametric datastore, respectively (\u00a74.3). Implementation details are provided in \u00a74.4.\n4.1\nTHE PARAMETRIC COMPONENT\nFor the parametric component of SILO, we use a standard, dense, decoder-only transformer\nLM (Vaswani et al., 2017) using the LLaMA architecture (Touvron et al., 2023). This model\nuses a fixed set of parameters at both training and inference time.\n4.2\nTHE NONPARAMETRIC COMPONENT\nWe experiment with two widely-used retrieval methods for the nonparametric component (Figure\n2): the k-nearest neighbors LM (kNN-LM; Khandelwal et al., 2020) and the retrieval-in-context\napproach (RIC-LM; Shi et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023). Each approach constructs a datastore from\nthe raw text data offline, and then uses it on-the-fly at inference time.\nThe k-nearest neighbors language model (kNN-LM).\nA kNN-LM (Khandelwal et al., 2020)\ninterpolates the next-token probability distribution from a parametric LM with a nonparametric\ndistribution based on every token that is stored in a datastore. Given a text dataset consisting of\nN tokens c1...cN, a datastore is built by creating a key-value pair for every token ci (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N).\nSpecifically, a value is ci and a key ki is ...ci\u22121, a prefix preceding ci. At test time, given an input\nprefix x, the nonparametric distribution is computed by:\nPkNN(y | x) \u221d\nX\n(k,v)\u2208D\nI[v = y] (\u2212d(Enc(k), Enc(x))) .\nHere, Enc is an encoder that maps a text into Rh and d : Rh \u00d7 Rh \u2192 R is a distance function,\nwhere h is the hidden dimension. We follow Khandelwal et al. (2020) and use the output vector\nfrom the last layer of the transformers in the parametric LM as Enc, L2 distance as d, and an\napproximate nearest neighbor search using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019, details in \u00a74.4). The final\n7\nmodel takes the kNN-LM output and interpolates it with the output from the parametric LM:8\n\u03bbPLM(y | x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)PkNN(y | x), where \u03bb is a fixed hyperparameter between 0 and 1.\nFuture work can improve kNN-LM, e.g., by training the model to output a nonparametric distribu-\ntion (Zhong et al., 2022; Lan et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023), by having a vocabulary-specific \u03bb (Huang\net al., 2023b), or by modeling \u03bb as a function of the input x (He et al., 2021; Drozdov et al., 2022).\nThe retrieval-in-context language model (RIC-LM).\nAs an alternative to kNN-LM, RIC-LM (Shi\net al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023) retrieves text blocks from a datastore and feeds them to the parametric\nLM in context. Specifically, given a dataset consisting of N tokens c1...cN, an index D is constructed\nby splitting the data into text blocks b1...bM, optionally with a sliding window. At test time, given an\ninput prefix x, RIC-LM retrieves the most similar paragraph to the prefix \u02c6p = arg maxb\u2208D sim(b, x)\nand concatenates it to the prefix to produce PLM(y | \u02c6b, x). Here, sim is a function that computes a\nsimilarity score between two pieces of text; we use BM25 following Ram et al. (2023) who show that\nBM25 outperforms alternative dense retrieval methods.\nFuture work can improve RIC-LM, e.g., by using multiple text blocks through ensembling (Shi et al.,\n2023) or reranking (Ram et al., 2023), by tuning the retrieval system (Shi et al., 2023), or by training\nthe LM to use retrieved blocks in context (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022).\nComparison between kNN-LM and RIC-LM.\nThe key difference between kNN-LM and RIC-\nLM lies in how the nonparametric component influences the output. In kNN-LM, it directly impacts\nthe output distribution, while in RIC-LM, it indirectly influences the output by affecting the input\nto the parametric model. kNN-LM intuitively benefits more from a datastore as it provides direct\ninfluence to the output and relies less on the parametric component. Nonetheless, RIC-LM interacts\nmore easily with a parametric model (i.e., it is applicable to a black-box LM) and offers better speed\nand memory efficiency (explored in Appendix B).\nEmpirical comparisons between kNN-LM and RIC-LM have been largely unexplored; in fact, we\nare unaware of such work. In our experiments (\u00a75.2), we present a series of such comparisons, with\nvarying sizes of the datastore, and with and without distribution shift.\nAttribution and opt-out.\nSince elements in the datastore that contribute to the model prediction\nare transparent, both kNN-LM and RIC-LM offer inherent attributions. Moreover, data removed\nfrom the datastore is guaranteed not to contribute to any model predictions, allowing data owners to\nremove their data at the level of individual examples. Both are unique characteristics of nonparametric\nlanguage models. While prior work studies post-hoc attribution to the data used for training model\nparameters (Koh & Liang, 2017; Han et al., 2023) and removing the effect of specific training\nexamples from parameteric models (Cao & Yang, 2015; Jang et al., 2023b), they are arguably not\nfundamental due to lack of inherent guarantees, and are difficult to scale.\n4.3\nBUILDING SILO\nSILO is is built upon the general methodology of kNN-LM and RIC-LM. However, unlike prior work\nthat uses the same data for learning model parameters and a nonparametric datastore, SILO uses\ndistinct datasets for these two components.\nThe key idea behind SILO is to use low-risk data to estimate model parameters, and to use high-risk\ndata only in a nonparametric datastore. This is based on the motivation that model parameters should\nbe learned conservatively, since training data is difficult to remove or trace after model training is\ncompleted. In contrast, a nonparametric datastore offers greater flexibility, as it can be easily updated,\ngrown, or filtered, supports data opt-out at the level of individual examples, and provides attributions\nfor free to every model prediction. These functions enable adherence to data-use regulations (\u00a72).\nTraining datasets.\nWe train each of our LMs on one of the three datasets of OLC: pd data,\npdsw data, and pdswby data. Each of the resulting models constitutes a different level of possible\ncopyright infringement risk.\n8While the encoder that outputs PkNN(y | x) and the parametric LM that outputs PLM(y | x) are based on\nthe same transformer models in this case following Khandelwal et al. (2020), it is not a necessary condition. One\nof our ablations in \u00a75.2 use different transformer models for the encoder and the parametric LM.\n8\nDatastore.\nWe assume in-distribution data for each test domain is available at inference time, and\nconstruct a datastore for each domain (details in \u00a74.4). Future work may investigate building a single\ndatastore that includes all domains. These test-time datasets can be either in-domain or out-of-domain\nwith respect to the data used to train model parameters.\n4.4\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nLM architecture and training details.\nWe use 1.3B-parameter transformer LMs based on the\nLLaMA architecture (Touvron et al., 2023) as implemented in OpenLM.9 Each model is trained with\n128 A100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Following Muennighoff et al. (2023), we train for multiple epochs\nin each dataset and perform early stopping. We train our pd, pdsw and pdswby models for 60B,\n250B, and 350B tokens in total, respectively. More details are provided in Appendix A.\nDomain re-weighting.\nSince the distribution of OLC is highly skewed (\u00a73.3), we perform a simple\nupweighting scheme where we upsample all data that accounts for less than 5% by a factor of 3\u00d7,\nwhich we found to work well after a sweep of different settings. More sophisticated domain weighting\nstrategies (Xie et al., 2023) are of interest but beyond the scope of this work.\nEvaluation.\nWe benchmark our models using language modeling perplexity on 14 domains that\nrepresent both in-domain and out-of-domain data with respect to different levels of OLC. This\nincludes: public-domain legal documents from the FreeLaw Project subset of the the Pile (Gao\net al., 2020), a held-out collection of books from the Gutenberg collection (Project Gutenberg),\nconversational text from the Hacker News subset of the Pile, held-out code files from the Github\nsubset of the Pile (most of which are non-permissive licensed), scientific text of NIH Grant abstracts\nthat are taken from the NIH ExPorter subset of the PILE, philosophy papers taken from the\nPhilPapers of the PILE, held-out English Wikipedia articles from the PILE, news articles from\nCC-News (Mackenzie et al., 2020), books from BookCorpus2 which is an expanded version\nof Zhu et al. (2015), books from Books3 by Presser (2020), random web-crawled pages from\nOpenWebText2 (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019; Gao et al., 2020), emails from the Enron Emails\ncorpus (Klimt & Yang, 2004), Amazon product reviews from He & McAuley (2016), and finally\nclinical notes from MIMIC-III (Johnson et al., 2016) with personal identifiable information (PII)\nmasked out. Our choice of domains highlights legal risks discussed in the earlier sections, e.g.,\nCC-News, BookCorpus2, Books3 and Amazon reviews are mostly copyrighted, Github is mostly not\npermissively licensed,10 and Enron Emails and MIMIC-III include private text. We merge all text\ninto one stream of text and split them into batches with a maximum sequence length of 1,024 and\na sliding window of 512, a setup that is standard in prior language modeling literature (Baevski &\nAuli, 2019; Khandelwal et al., 2020). For MIMIC-III, which includes masked personally-identifiable\ninformation (PII), we filter out notes where more than 50% of tokens correspond to PII, and then\nexclude tokens corresponding to PII when computing perplexity.\nDatastore.\nWe construct an in-domain datastore for each test domain based on their training data.\nFor datasets from the PILE, we consider 10% of the training data. For kNN-LM, each datastore\nconsists of up to 1 billion h-dimensional vectors (h =2,048). We build an index for fast nearest\nneighbor search using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019). For RIC-LM, each datastore consists of text\nblocks with a length of 1,024 and a sliding window of 512. We use BM25 from Pyserini (Lin et al.,\n2021). Appendix B report ablations on different implementations of RIC-LM besides the method in\n\u00a74.2. More details, statistics and hyperparameter values for the datastores are reported in \u00a7A.\n5\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nWe first evaluate the parametric-only component of SILO trained on the OPEN LICENSE COR-\nPUS (\u00a75.1), and then show the effect of adding a datastore that may contain high-risk text (\u00a75.2). For\nall experiments, we use the 1.4B Pythia model (Biderman et al., 2023) as a baseline because it is\ntrained with a similar amount of compute (data size and model parameters), but is trained on mostly\nhigh-risk data.11\n9https://github.com/mlfoundations/openlm\n10Kocetkov et al.

We use \u25a0, \u25a0, and \u25a0 to indicate text that is in-domain,\nout-of-domain, or out-of-domain but has relevant data in-domain (e.g., high-risk Github code vs. our\npermissive Github code). Reported on the test data; see Table 9 for results on the validation data.\nOur parametric LMs are competitive to Pythia in-domain but fall short out-of-domain.\n5.1\nRESULTS: PARAMETRIC COMPONENT\nMain results.\nTable 3 reports performance of our 1.3B base LMs trained on varying levels of\npermissively-licensed data\u2014pd, pdsw, and pdswby\u2014as well as Pythia. Overall, our LMs are\ncompetitive with Pythia despite using permissive data only. They are roughly equal quality on\nin-domain data, e.g., FreeLaw and Gutenberg, HackerNews in the case of pdsw and pdswby, and\nWikipedia in the case of pdswby. Models trained on pdsw and pdswby are also close to Pythia\non Github, likely because the permissively-licensed code data included in sw has a distribution that\nis sufficiently close to the distribution of the all Github code. The largest gaps occur on data that\nis in-domain for Pythia but out-of-domain for our model, e.g., news, books, OpenWebText, and\nemails, and Wikipedia in the case of models besides pdswby. This illustrates the extreme domain\ngeneralization challenge that is present when training on only permissive data, as we hint in \u00a73.3.\nGaps from Pythia align with a degree of domain shift.\nThe similarity of an evaluation domain to\na domain of the OLC strongly correlates with the performance gaps between SILO and Pythia. To\nshow this, we compute the Pearson correlation between 1) the maximum n-gram overlap between an\nOLC domain and the Pile validation domains (from \u00a73.3) and 2) the perplexity difference between\nthe Pythia model and our pdsw model, normalized by the performance of the pdsw model. We find\na strong negative correlation between these metrics (r=-0.72, p < 0.005), indeed indicating that the\nmore dissimilar an evaluation domain is from the OLC domains, the better Pythia does relative to\nSILO (see \u00a7B for a scatter plot).\nMore ablations, including the effect of upsampling low-resource data, and the effect of including and\nexcluding explicit source code, are provided in \u00a7B.\n5.2\nRESULTS: ADDING THE NONPARAMETRIC COMPONENT\nSince building legally permissive LMs poses a challenge of extreme domain generalization, our next\nquestion is whether using an in-domain, nonparametric datastore can reduce the gap. We explore\nthis question with our parametric LM trained on the pdsw subset of OLC evaluated on a subset\nof 8 out-of-domain datasets to the parametric model: Github, NIH ExPorter, Wikipedia, CC News,\nBooks3, Enron Emails, Amazon, and MIMIC-III.\nMain results.\nTable 4 shows adding the datastore with either kNN-LM- or RIC-LM-based retrieval\nimproves performance over just using the parameteric component on all domains, but kNN-LM\n10\nEval data\nSILO (pdsw)\nPythia\nPrm-only\nkNN-LM\nRIC-LM\nPrm-only\nGithub\n2.7\n2.4 (-100%)\n2.4 (-100%)\n2.4\nNIH ExPorter\n19.2\n15.0 (-52%)\n18.5 (-9%)\n11.1\nWikipedia\n20.3\n14.5 (-52%)\n19.4 (-8%)\n9.1\nCC News\n23.3\n8.0 (-135%)\n16.8 (-58%)\n12.0\nBooks3\n19.3\n17.4 (-28%)\n18.6 (-10%)\n12.6\nEnron Emails\n13.2\n5.9 (-116%)\n9.9 (-68%)\n6.9\nAmazon\n34.9\n26.0 (-75%)\n33.7 (-10%)\n23.0\nMIMIC-III\n19.0\n6.6 (-210%)\n15.6 (-58%)\n13.1\nAverage\n19.0\n12.0 (-91%)\n16.9 (-27%)\n11.3\nTable 4: Perplexity (the lower the better) of parametric LMs (Prm-only), kNN-LM, and RIC-LM.\n% in parentheses indicate a reduction in the gap between the parametric-only SILO and Pythia.

Scaling the test-time datastore consistently\nimproves performance over all domains.\nis more effective than RIC-LM. In most domains, kNN-LM reduces the gap between SILO and\nPythia by more than 50% (on NIH ExPorter, Wikipedia, Amazon) or even outperforms Pythia (on\nGithub, CC News, Enron Emails, MIMIC-III). Books3 is the domain with the least benefit, on which\nkNN-LM still reduces the gap by 28%.\nImpact of scaling the datastore.\nFigure 3 demonstrates that both kNN-LM and RIC-LM-based\nretrieval consistently improves performance as the datastore size increases, with a strong log-linear\ntrend. However, kNN-LM improves performance more rapidly than RIC-LM does, consistently over\nall datasets. Extrapolating the trend suggests that, on the domains that SILO has not outperformed\nPythia yet, scaling the datastore even further (with kNN-LM retrieval) may enable it to match Pythia.\nWhy does kNN-LM outperform RIC-LM?\nOur next question is why kNN-LM is better than\nRIC-LM\u2014is it (a) because kNN-LM is better than RIC-LM in general, or (b) because kNN-LM\ngeneralizes out-of-domain better than RIC-LM does? Our further analysis in \u00a7B (Figure 5) reveals\nthat it is both. With Pythia, where the test data is in-domain, while both kNN-LM and RIC-LM\nimprove performance upon the parametric-only model, kNN-LM is overall better and scales better\n11\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nPerplexity (Wiki, CCNews, Amazon, MIMIC)\nAmazon\nGithub\nWikipedia\nCC News\nMIMIC-III\n2.30\n2.35\n2.40\n2.45\n2.50\n2.55\n2.60\nPerplexity (Github)\nLM for PLM\nPythia\nPythia\nPythia\nOurs\nOurs\nOurs\nEncoder for PkNN\n\u2717\nPythia\nOurs\nPythia\nOurs\n\u2717\nFigure 4: Impact of using different parameters on SILO. Perplexity on random 128K tokens from the\nvalidation data reported. The left-most and the right-most models are parametric models, and the other\nfour models are kNN-LMs, using a datastore with 204.8 million tokens (20% of the datastore we use\nfor the main experiments). Ours indicates our parametric model trained on the pdsw subset of OPEN\nLICENSE CORPUS. Most of the performance degradation comes from using the out-of-domain\nparametric LM, rather than using the out-of-domain encoder.\nthan RIC-LM, supporting (a). Both kNN-LM and RIC-LM improve performance more rapidly with\nSILO (where the test data is out-of-domain) than with Pythia, but this trend is much clearer with\nkNN-LM, supporting (b).\nWhere does the remaining gap come from?\nEven when scaling the datastore with kNN-LM,\nSILO lags behind Pythia on a few domains. Moreover, a Pythia-based kNN-LM outperforms our\nmodel since kNN-LM improves Pythia as well. There are two possible points of failure in our model\nfor these cases: either the parametric component (which outputs PLM) struggles out-of-domain, or\nthe encoder (that outputs PkNN) struggles out-of-domain. To better understand which part of the\nmodel contributes to the gap we observe, we vary SILO with different choices for the parametric\ncomponent and the encoder. We compare replacing either the parametric component or the encoder\nwith Pythia. This setup allows us to measure the effects of the out-of-domain nature of our parametric\ncomponent (which is only trained on pdsw subset of OLC) in each of these components.\nResults in Figure 4 reveal that most performance gaps come from the LM: performance improves\nsignificantly when the parametric component is replaced with Pythia, given a fixed encoder. In\ncontrast, performance improvement is relatively marginal when the encoder is replaced with Pythia,\ngiven a fixed parametric component. These results indicate that the parametric component, which\ngives PLM, is quite sensitive to domain shift, but the encoder, which provides the nonparametric\ndistribution PkNN, is fairly robust to extreme domain shift. This also explains why kNN-LM\ngeneralizes better than RIC-LM, since RIC-LM is bottlenecked by the parametric component.\nIn summary, our analysis highlights two promising directions to further reduce the gap:\n1. Scaling the datastore beyond 1 billion tokens, e.g., at the scale of trillions of tokens as in Borgeaud\net al. (2022), as demonstrated by Figure 3.\n2. Improving the robustness of the model by improving nonparametric techniques or designing a\nmodel that only uses a nonparametric distribution (Min et al., 2023), as demonstrated by Figure 4.\nComparison in runtime speed.\nTable 14 in Appendix B provides a comparison of the runtime\nspeed of the parametric LM, RIC-LM, and kNN-LM. There is a strong tradeoff between performance\nand speed: both RIC-LM and kNN-LM are considerably slower than the parametric LM, and a larger\ndatastore and more accurate nearest-neighbor search leads to better performance and slower inference.\nWhile the speed is heavily influenced by the hardware used for benchmarking and thus it is difficult to\nprecisely quantify how much faster one method is compared to the other, this suggests that improving\nthe runtime efficiency of nonparametric approaches is an important area of future work.\n5.3\nEXAMPLES OF DATA ATTRIBUTION AND OPT-OUT\n12\nTest Prefix \u2018I - what - dragons?\u2019 spluttered the Prime Minister. \u2018Yes, three,\u2019 said Fudge. \u2018And a sphinx.

He suddenly looked as menacing as\nthe night when Harry had first met him, the night when Harry had still believed Sirius to be a murderer. \u2018Oh, I know\nCrouch all right,\u2019 he said quietly. \u2018He was the one who gave me the order to be sent to\nRetrieved Continuation Azkaban - without a trial.\u2019\nTest Prefix Terror tore at Harry\u2019s heart... he had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape... somehow the two\nthings were linked... he could reverse what had happened if he had them both together... Dumbledore could not have died...\n(...) Harry felt Greyback collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a\njet of\nTest Continuation green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight.\nRetrieved Prefix Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d Voldemort cried, \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d A jet of\nRetrieved Continuation green light issued from Voldemort\u2019s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry\u2019s ...\nTable 6: Attribution examples on Harry Potter books. We show the top-1 retrieved context of\nSILO (pdsw). Red underline text indicates the next token that immediately follows the prefix. In\nboth examples, the test data is from the sixth novel and the retrieved context is from the fourth novel\nin the Harry Potter series. In the series, Azkaban is the notorious wizarding prison, and the green\nlight is a distinct characteristic of the Killing Curse, Avada Kedavra.\nEval\nSILO (pdsw)\nPythia\nPrm-only\nkNN-LM\nkNN-LM\nPrm-only\nw/o HP\nw/ HP\n1\n15.9\n15.2\n13.0\n9.6\n2\n17.7\n16.7\n12.4\n10.0\n3\n16.5\n15.6\n11.4\n9.5\n4\n17.7\n16.8\n12.9\n10.1\n5\n17.8\n16.9\n13.2\n10.2\n6\n17.4\n16.5\n12.8\n10.1\n7\n18.8\n17.8\n15.1\n10.9\nAvg\n17.4\n16.5\n12.9\n10.1\nTable 5: The effect of data opt-out. Both\nkNN-LM methods use 1.024B-token on\nBooks3. w/ HP and w/o HP indicate that the\ndatastore includes or excludes Harry Potter\nbooks, respectively. The number (1 to 7) indi-\ncates a different book from the Harry Potter\nseries used as the eval data; this eval book\nis not included in the datastore in any case.\n\u25a0 indicates in-domain; \u25a0 indicates out-of-\ndomain.\nAs discussed in \u00a72, the design of SILO can better\nalign with various data-use regulations by providing\nmechanisms for data attribution during inference and\nfor data owners to remove their data from the model\nat any time. This section show examples of such\ncapabilities.\nData opt-out.\nTo showcase the impact of opt-out\non model performance, we conduct experiments with\nJ.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series. We first identify\nall seven Harry Potter books from the Books3 corpus\nof the Pile. For each book, we calculate the perplex-\nity of SILO using two 1.024B token datastores on\nBooks3, but one including the remaining six Harry\nPotter books and the other excluding any Harry Potter\nbooks. This experiment is to see whether excluding\nHarry Potter books from the former datastore can re-\nduce the likelihood of generating the leave-out Harry\nPotter book.\nTable 5 shows the results. SILO with Harry Potter\nbooks in the datastore effectively improves perplexity\nover all seven books, closing the gap between the\npdsw model and Pythia. However, when the Harry\nPotter books are removed from the datastore, the perplexity gets worse, approaching that of the\nparametric-only LM. This illustrates that eliminating the effect of the Harry Potter books from the\nmodel substantially reduces the likelihood of generating the leave-out book.\nAttribution examples.\nTo show the attribution feature of our model, Table 6 provides qualitative\nexamples on the top-1 context retrieved by SILO. The model is able to assign a high probability to\nthe ground truth token by retrieving highly relevant context. It achieves this by leveraging the unique\ncharacteristics of the text within the datastore, such as recognizing that Azkaban refers to the prison\nand green light is associated with the Killing Curse in the Harry Potter books.\nMore qualitative examples on Github, news and emails are illustrated in Table 15 in Appendix B.\nThey highlight that a nonparametric approach addresses specific legal risks that we have discussed\nearlier, e.g., it offers per-token attribution for free, and can provide a copyright notice when part of\ncopyrighted text is being used for the probability distribution.\n13\n6\nDISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK\nOur work suggests that it is possible to improve the tradeoff between legal risk and model performance\nwhen training LMs. Our approach provides new options for model designers to mitigate the legal risk\nof LMs, and empowers stakeholders to have more control over the data that drives these systems. We\npoint out a number of rich areas for future work, beyond what was mentioned throughout the paper:\nAddressing the limitations of SILO.\nSILO does not completely eliminate legal risk. Instead, it\nprovides users more control over the model\u2019s generated content and functionalities to better align\nwith legal regulations. For instance, SILO does not remove the need for obtaining permission to\nuse copyrighted content in a datastore when providing attribution is not sufficient, but its opt-out\ncapabilities can strengthen fair use defense. Moreover, SILO does not prevent copying copyright\ncontent from a datastore, but it offers a way to prevent generating sensitive text (Huang et al., 2023a)\nor prevent copying the content verbatim. These functionalities increase the likelihood of a successful\nfair use defense if used appropriately.\nFurthermore, while SILO mitigates copyright and privacy risks, it may exacerbate certain fairness\nissues, like toxicity towards marginalized groups and racial biases, especially due to the prevalence\nof older copyright-expired books in the training data. Exploring the balance between legal risk\nmitigation and fairness is an important future direction.\nFinally, our study relies on explicit metadata to identify licenses, which may lead to underestimates of\nthe amount and diversity of permissively licensed text actually available on the web. Future research\nmay investigate inferring data licenses from documents in web crawl at scale, which may be an\neffective way to build more heterogeneous, permissively licensed corpora.\nIntroducing novel data licensing approaches.\nSILO introduces the possibility for data owners\nto set different levels of permissivity for learning parameters and for including in a nonparametric\ndatastore. A data owner might choose to be more permissive about including data in the datastore\ndue to its ease of removal, ensuring that the excluded data has no influence on model predictions\nanymore, and its ability to provide per-prediction attribution. Moreover, we envision that SILO could\nprovide a path forward for data owners to get properly credited (or be paid directly) every time their\ndata in a datastore contributes to a prediction. This is orthogonal to recent work that circumvented\ncopyright issues by licensing out training data from data creators (Yu et al., 2023).\nInvestigating other copyright risk mitigation strategies.\nIt is critical to continue to develop new\ntechniques that use copyrighted data while protecting the rights of data owners and subjects. In\naddition to nonparametric approaches, there are many other ways to achieve these goals. First, one\ncould train LMs on copyrighted content but filter and guide their outputs towards text that is non-\ninfringing (Henderson et al., 2023). Second, training models with differential privacy (Dwork et al.,\n2006; Abadi et al., 2016) may prevent them from memorizing individual details of copyright data.\nFinally, one could provide attributions for standard base LMs using post-hoc attribution methods, e.g.,\ninfluence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017), rather than switching the model class to a retrieval-based\nmodel. All of these methods are complementary and orthogonal to our proposed approach.\nGeneralizing SILO as a modular language model.\nOur work is closely related to recent studies\non modular LMs, which have specialized parameters (or experts) trained on different domains\n(Gururangan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Gururangan et al., 2023), languages (Pfeiffer et al., 2020;\n2022), or tasks (Chen et al., 2022b; Jang et al., 2023a). Our work extends modular LMs to include\nnonparametric datastores, and focuses on specializing different parts of the model to low- and high-\nrisk subsets of the training data. Legal risks may also be mitigated with a collection of parametric\nexpert models that are specialized to low- and high-risk data. Future work may explore this possibility\nas well as the usefulness of combining a nonparametric datastore with parametric experts.\nExtending SILO to other modalities.\nWhile this work focuses on text-only models, similar\nmethods to ours could apply to other domains and modalities. For instance, it might be possible to\nbuild permissive text-to-image generative models (Rombach et al., 2022) using compartmentalized\npublic domain pre-training and retrieval-augmentation (Chen et al., 2022a; Golatkar et al., 2023). We\nbelieve such approaches are especially promising because there are many sources of public domain\ndata in other modalities, e.g., images, speech, video, and more.\n14\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe introduce SILO, a language model that mitigates legal risk by learning parameters only on low-\nrisk, permissively-licensed data (OPEN LICENSE CORPUS), and using an unrestricted nonparametric\ndatastore during inference. Our approach allows the model designer to use high-risk data without\ntraining on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and enables data produces to opt-out from\nthe model by removing content from the datastore. Experiments on language modeling perplexity\nshow that parametric-only SILO is competitive on domains covered by OPEN LICENSE CORPUS, but\nfalls short out-of-domain when solely using the parametric component of the model, highlighting the\nchallenge of extreme domain generalization. We then show that adding a nonparametric datastore\nto SILO (with kNN-LM retrieval) successfully addresses this challenge, significantly reducing the\ngap (or even outperforming) the Pythia baseline that is trained unrestrictedly. We show that scaling\nthe datastore size is key to the success of the nonparametric approach, and that the encoder for\na nonparametric distribution is significantly more robust to distribution shift than the parametric\ncomponent. Our results point to a number of exciting future research directions to develop AI systems\nwith mitigated legal risk.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Peter Henderson for discussing the legality of LMs, and Kyle Lo for feedback on our\ndataset and license taxonomy.

We keep these hyperparameters fixed for all parametric models that we report\nin this paper. We follow the model architecture of LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023), and we use the\nGPT-NeoX-20B tokenizer (Black et al., 2022), with 50432 BPE types. During training, we use 2,048\ntoken sequences that are packed across document boundaries, and we pre-pend a beginning-of-text\ntoken to every document. We use weight decay of 0.1, the Adam optimizer with \u03b22 = 0.95, 2,000\nsteps of warmup, with a cosine learning rate scheduler. We train for multiple epochs in each dataset,\ntracking validation perplexity every 10B tokens, and perform early stopping. We train our pd, pdsw\nand pdswby models for 60B, 250B, and 350B tokens in total, respectively.\nModel\n#L\n#H\ndmodel\nLR\nBatch\n1.3B\n24\n16\n2048\n1e-3\n2.6M\nTable 7: Basic hyperparameters for the parametric component of SILO.\nDetails on the nonparametric component of SILO.\nFor kNN-LM, we use IndexIVFPQ which\nquantizes vectors into 64-bytes and clusters them into 4,096 centroids, learned from 1 million sampled\nvectors, following Khandelwal et al. (2020). Instead of recomputing the exact L2 distance using the\noriginal embeddings, we use the L2 distance beteen quantized vectors returned by the FAISS index\n(ablations in Appendix B). Since their scale is not preserved, we use d(xq,yq)\n\u03c4\nas a proxy of d(x, y),\nwhere xq and yq are vectors quantized from x and y. Hyperparameters, including k, \u03bb, and \u03c4, are\nchosen based on the validation data in a domain-specific manner.\nTable 8 reports the datastore statistics for both RIC-LM and kNN-LM, as well as hyperparameter\nvalues for kNN-LM (\u03bb, k, \u03c4). Due to the resource constraints, the datastore size is capped to up to\n10% of the PILE training data (and to 1024.0M tokens in the case of kNN-LM), but future work can\ninvestigate further scaling the datastore.\nData\nRIC-LM\nkNN-LM\n# tokens\n# blocks\n# tokens\n\u03bb\nk\n\u03c4\nGithub\n3084.3M\n6.0M\n1024.0M\n0.2\n128\n10.0\nNIH ExPorter\n72.2M\n0.1M\n72.2M\n0.3\n32,768\n20.0\nWikipedia\n1177.9M\n2.3M\n1024.0M\n0.3\n4,096\n20.0\nCC News\n382.2M\n0.7M\n382.2M\n0.7\n4,096\n20.0\nBooks3\n1424.7M\n2.8M\n1024.0M\n0.2\n4,096\n25.0\nEnron Emails\n45.0M\n0.1M\n45.0M\n0.5\n4,096\n1.0\nAmazon\n1214.3M\n2.4M\n1024.0M\n0.5\n32,768\n20.0\nMIMIC-III\n519.5M\n1.0M\n519.5M\n0.7\n1,024\n15.0\nTable 8: Datastore statistics as well as hyperparameter values for kNN-LM.

We note that we did\nnot tune the upweighting ratio nor explore alternative upweighting approaches (Xie et al., 2023) due\nto resource constraints, and leave them for future work.\n59B tokens of source code significantly help.\nWhen using sw, a substantial 59.1% of the training\ndata is actual source code. To determine sw provides such large gains, we also run an ablation where\nwe include sw data but exclude all of the actual source code, i.e., we only include Hacker News,\nUbuntu IRC, Deepmind Math, and AMPS on top of the pd data. This leaves models trained on 99.6B\ntokens for OLC (pdsw) and 40.7B for OLC (pdsw) excluding source code. Table 11 (right) report\nresults on a subset of the validation domains. Including source code provide significant benefits for\ncertain test datasets, e.g., nearly a 20 point improvement in perplexity on PhilPapers, likely because it\nsignificantly increases the size of the training data.\nAblations on variants of RIC-LM.\nWe consider four different variants of RIC-LM. (1) The basic\nis the method described in \u00a74.2, which uses text blocks with a length of L each. At inference, it\ntakes the top 1 text block from the datastore and feeds it to the LM, i.e., PLM(y|\u02c6b, x) where x is the\ninput and \u02c6b is the top 1 text block. (2) The ensbl-k (k = 10) variants is also based on text blocks\nwith a length of L each. At inference, it takes the top k text blocks from the datastore, feeds it to the\nLM in parallel and aggregates the probability distributions, e.g., 1\nk\nP\n1\u2264i\u2264k\nPLM(y|\u02c6bi, x) where \u02c6b1...\u02c6bk\n22\nData\npdsw\nw/o upsampling\npdsw\nw upsampling\nFreeLaw\n4.9\n5.7\nGithub\n2.4\n2.6\nNIH ExPorter\n20.0\n19.3\nPhilPapers\n23.9\n24.2\nWikipedia\n19.9\n19.7\nCC News\n21.8\n21.3\nBookCorpus2\n19.4\n19.2\nOpenWebText2\n21.0\n21.2\nEnron Emails\n13.5\n14.3\nAmazon\n35.7\n34.7\nData\npd\npdsw\nw/o code\npdsw\nFreeLaw\n5.3\n5.7\n5.7\nGithub\n13.3\n8.2\n2.6\nNIH ExPorter\n28.6\n26.2\n19.3\nPhilPapers\n55.2\n36.4\n24.2\nWikipedia\n27.9\n26.5\n19.7\nCC News\n30.8\n28.8\n21.3\nBookCorpus2\n25.2\n23.8\n19.2\nOpenWebText2\n38.1\n31.7\n21.2\nEnron Emails\n19.9\n18.5\n14.3\nAmazon\n81.9\n46.1\n34.7\nTable 11: (Left) Effect of re-weighting rare domains, comparing models trained on OLC (pdsw)\nwith and without upsampling. (Right) Effect of sw data, with and without explicit source code\u2014we\ntrain an LM with sw data but remove all of the actual source code (i.e., we leave Hacker News,\nUbuntu IRC, Deepmind Math, and AMPS).

This follows a method from Shi et al. (2023). (3) The concat-k (k = 2)\nvariant uses text blocks with a length of L\nk each. At inference, it takes the top k text blocks from the\ndatastore, concatenates them in a reverse order, and feeds it into the LM, e.g., PLM(y|\u02c6bk, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u02c6b1, x)\nwhere \u02c6b1...\u02c6bk are the top k text blocks. (4) The concat-next variant uses text blocks with a length\nof L\n2 each. At inference, it takes the top 1 text block from the datastore, and concatenates the text\nblock and the subsequent text block in a datastore. It then feeds it into the LM. This is based on the\nintuition that the continuation of the text block that is most similar to the query can be useful for the\ncontinuation of the query; Borgeaud et al. (2022) has explored a similar approach based on the same\nintuition. We use L = 1024 for all variants. It is worth noting that the ensbl-k variant has run-time\nthat is approximately k times of run-time of the basic, concat-k and concat-next.\nResults are reported in Table 12. The concat-2 and concat-next variants perform poorly, while the\nensbl-10 outperforms the basic variant. However, we reached the conclusion that the significant\nrun-time cost (i.e., 20x compared to a parametric LM) does not justify the improvements, and thus, we\nprimarily use the basic variant for the remaining experiments. Future work may involve re-evaluating\nmodels using the ensbl-k approach or enhancing its run-time efficiency.\nEffect of scaling the datastore in-domain and out-of-domain.\n\u00a75.2 shows that performance of\nboth kNN-LM and RIC-LM rapidly improves as the datastore size grows, and kNN-LM improves\nmore rapidly than RIC-LM does. This evaluation is mainly done with SILO where the test domains\nare out-of-domain. Does this trend hold when the test domains are in-domain? To answer this\nquestion, we examine effect of scaling the datastore with Pythia 1.4B, where all of our test datasets\ncan be considered in-domain.\nFigure 5 reports the results: Pythia on the left, SILO (pdsw) on the right. Results show that both\nPythia and SILO see consistent improvements from kNN-LM and RIC-LM as the datastore gets\nlarger, although the slope is larger with SILO than with Pythia. Again consistent to findings in \u00a75.2,\nkNN-LM scales better than RIC-LM does, resulting in kNN-LM outperforming RIC-LM with a\nreasonably large datastore in most cases (with an exception of Pythia on Github, where RIC-LM\noutperforms kNN-LM with a reasonable size of a datastore).\n23\nMethod\nPPL\nDisk use\nParam-only\n19.7\n0.0\nNo approximation\n16.4\n1.0\nQuantized (4x)\n16.6\n0.25\nQuantized (8x)\n16.6\n0.125\nQuantized (16x)\n16.8\n0.0625\nIVFPQ approximation\n16.8\n0.0178\nTable 13: Ablations on approxima-\ntion methods on the validation data\nof Wikipedia, using the LM trained\non pdsw and the datastore consist-\ning of 51.2 million tokens (5% of\nthe datastore in the main experi-\nments). Relative disk memory usage\nreported (considering no approxima-\ntion as 1.0).\nEffect of different approximation methods for L2 distance.\nPrior work (Khandelwal et al., 2020) typically uses approxi-\nmate nearest neighbor search to find the top k nearest neigh-\nbors, and then computes the exact L2 distance using the orig-\ninal vectors. However, this may be inefficient in disk memory\nusage and run-time speed, due to needing to store large, orig-\ninal vectors and access them on-disk. We thus explore a few\nalternatives: (1) quantizing the original vectors to compute\nthe L2 distance (but less aggressively than quantization for\nthe nearest neighbor search index, thus it provides different\nlevels of approximations for search and for L2 distance), or\n(2) completely dropping the original vectors and relying on ap-\nproximated L2 distance from the FAISS index with aggressive\nquantization. Based on Table 13, all approximation meth-\nods only marginally affect performance. For the rest of our\nexperiments, we use the most aggressive approximation that\ncompletely drops the original embeddings at the cost of about\n0.5% lose in performance while using < 2% of the memory\nfootprint. Future work may study more accurate and efficient\napproximation methods.\nMethod\nPPL\n# tokens/s\nParam-only\n19.7\n1828.6\nRIC-LM (51.2M)\n19.3\n812.7\nRIC-LM (102.4M)\n19.2\n731.4\nRIC-LM (204.8M)\n19.1\n588.5\nRIC-LM (409.6M)\n18.9\n478.5\nRIC-LM (1,178M)\n18.9\n419.7\nkNN-LM (51.2M)\n16.8\n184.2\nkNN-LM (102.4M)\n16.3\n112.0\nkNN-LM (204.8M)\n15.7\n59.3\nkNN-LM (409.6M)\n15.0\n31.8\nkNN-LM (1,024M)\n14.2\n14.2\nkNN-LM (102M, p = 1)\n16.7\n560.8\nkNN-LM (1,024M, p = 1)\n14.6\n71.1\nkNN-LM (1,024M, p = 2)\n14.4\n45.5\nkNN-LM (1,024M, p = 4)\n14.2\n27.0\nTable 14: Comparison in runtime speed\n(# tokens per second) on the validation\ndata of Wikipedia. p indicates the num-\nber of probe, one of the hyperparameters\nin fast nearest neighbor search (p = 8 in\nall experiments in the paper if not speci-\nfied otherwise).\nRuntime speed.\nTable 14 presents the runtime speed\nof the parametric LM, RIC-LM, and kNN-LM on the\nWikipedia validation set. Speed is reported in tokens per\nsecond with a batch size of 1 using a single NVIDIA RTX\n6000 GPU.\nThe results show that the parametric LM is notably faster\nthan both RIC-LM and kNN-LM, and RIC-LM is faster\nthan kNN-LM. Speed is slower as the datastore gets larger\n(for both RIC-LM and kNN-LM) and the nearest neighbor\nsearch gets less accurate (for kNN-LM; indicated by the\nnumber of probe p). kNN-LM can eventually match RIC-\nLM\u2019s speed while surpassing its performance by using a\nsmaller datastore and less accurate search, i.e., when using\n102M tokens with p = 1.\nWe note that the machine used for benchmarking speed\nhas a very slow IO speed, leading to an underestimation\nof both RIC-LM and kNN-LM\u2019s runtime speed, and the\ncomparison can significantly vary based on the hardware.\nHowever, it is still important to note that kNN-LM is\nsubstantially slower than a parametric LM, leaving room\nfor potential future improvements.\nQualitative examples.\nFigure 15 provides six qualita-\ntive examples on the top-1 context retrieved by SILO-based\nkNN-LM. The model is able to assign a high probability to the ground truth token by retrieving\nhighly relevant context, e.g., given the context (hockey) and the first name of the player, being able to\nretrieve the last name of the player, given the context (a show and its host), being able to complete the\nquote. These examples also highlight that a nonparametric approach addresses specific legal risks that\nwe have discussed earlier, e.g., it assigns per-token attribution for free, and can provide a copyright\nnotice when part of copyrighted text is being used for the probability distribution.\nN-gram overlap.\nTable 16 displays the full matrix of unigram and bi-gram overlap between the\nOPEN LICENSE CORPUS training domains and the Pile validation domains.

Introduction\nLarge-scale pre-training vision-language models (VLM)\nsuch as CLIP [37] have emerged recently and have formed a\nnew paradigm in the task of image classification. Instead of\nannotating images with class labels, vision-language mod-\nels match images towards text embeddings from their cate-\ngory names. With semantic relationship from text and large-\nscale pre-training over 400 million image-caption pairs,\nCLIP is capable of performing accurate image classification\non novel target domains requiring zero training samples but\nonly a dictionary of potential category names.\nHowever, we still observe domain gaps from both im-\nage and text input that impact CLIP performance.\nThe\nexistence of visual domain gap between source and tar-\n\u201cA photo of airplane\u201d\n\u201cA photo of automobile\u201d\n\u201cA photo of bird\u201d\n\u201cA photo of cat\u201d\n\u201cA photo of deer\u201d\n\u201cA photo of dog\u201d\n\u201cA photo of frog\u201d\n\u201cA photo of horse\u201d\n\u201cA photo of ship\u201d\n\u201cA photo of truck\u201d\nText Embeddings\nFigure 1. the t-SNE plot of visual and text embeddings from CLIP\non CIFAR10 [26] test set. It is clear to see the misalignment in the\nvision-language space: the text embedding of a class name is ad-\njacent to ones of other classes, but distant from image embeddings\nin the same class.\nget images has been a challenge for computer vision mod-\nels [10, 49].\nCLIP has been observed to have limitations\non visual embedding when data comes from less common\ndomains, e.g. PatchCamelyon [46], CLEVR [22], etc. On\nthe other hand, the domain gap in text is also a challenge\nfor vision-language models. The performance of CLIP is\noften limited by the text embeddings rather than the visual\nembeddings, especially on fine-grained datasets e.g. RE-\nSISC45 [7], Birdsnap [2], where CLIP is able to create dis-\ntinctive visual embeddings but the text embeddings from\nclass names fail to capture discriminative information.\nIn addition to the gaps in the visual and text domains,\nwe have identified significant misalignment between visual\nand text embeddings across most datasets.\nSome recent\nstudies [31, 43] have also observed similar modality gaps\nacross various contrastive-learned visual-language models.\nFigure 1 provides examples of this issue on the widely used\nbenchmark CIFAR10. We believe that there are two pri-\nmary reasons for these misalignments. Firstly, text embed-\ndings may be redundant, as CLIP was trained to work with\nmillions of captions and concepts, whereas target domain\ncategories might only activate limited feature dimensions,\narXiv:2308.03793v2  [cs.CV]  14 Dec 2023\nleaving the remaining ones inactive and redundant; these\nredundant dimensions can dominate the similarity calcula-\ntion. Secondly, visual embeddings may contain a significant\namount of class-agnostic information; since CLIP uses real\ncaptions for training, it preserves rich information, such as\nlighting, color, texture, and relationship, but only a small\nportion of this information is crucial for classification.\nTherefore, adaptation on both visual and text represen-\ntations, and re-alignment between visual and text embed-\ndings are crucial in improving the target domain perfor-\nmance of vision-language models like CLIP. However, tra-\nditional domain adaptation methods have significant limi-\ntations in this context. One major challenge is that these\nmethods either require target domain labeled examples (e.g.\nsemi-supervised domain adaptation [11, 38, 54]), or source\ndomain examples (e.g., unsupervised domain adaptation\n[23, 34, 39]). Nonetheless, typical use cases of CLIP only\nhave access to unlabeled target images, which requires\nsource-free unsupervised domain adaptation that does not\nneed source data or labeled target data. Another challenge is\nthat existing methods assume conditions that may not hold\nfor vision-language models.\nFor instance, most existing\nmethods [30,48,53] assume a lightweight classifier, while a\nvision-language model uses a large text encoder to generate\nclassification weights based on category descriptions. Such\nmodules add flexibility and complexity to adaptation. Thus,\nthe lack of labeled data from source and target domains and\nthe presence of multiple adaptable modules make it essen-\ntial to develop a novel source-free domain adaptation algo-\nrithm for vision-language models.\nMore recently, POUF [43] also proposes to address the\nmisaligned embeddings of a vision-language model through\nsource-free adaptation. However, the unsupervised objec-\ntive of POUF considers each target example independently,\ninstead of taking advantages from the neighboring relation-\nship over the entire embedding space. Moreover, POUF\ncannot leverage multiple template augmented text embed-\ndings as used in CLIP and our proposed method, which lim-\nited its performance during the adaptation.\nTo take advantage of the unified vision-language space,\nand address the challenges on the visual and text domain\ngaps and cross-modality misalignment, we propose Re-\nCLIP, a novel source-free domain adaptation method to\nRefine CLIP models. Firstly, ReCLIP addresses the mis-\nalignment of visual and text embeddings from CLIP by\nlearning a projection subspace that removes redundant di-\nmensions and class-agnostic information, and realigns em-\nbeddings. ReCLIP then utilizes the neighboring relation-\nship between aligned embeddings, and employs label prop-\nagation to produce accurate pseudo-labels in the target do-\nmain.\nSecondly, ReCLIP leverages cross-modality self-\ntraining with high-confidence pseudo labels to iteratively\nrefine embedding spaces and label assignments. Two par-\nallel components are deployed to update the text and visual\nencoders. The first component fine-tunes the text encoder\nwhile freezing the visual to pull the text embedding of a\nlabel closer to the embeddings of images assigned the la-\nbel. Meanwhile, the second component fine-tunes the vi-\nsual encoder so that the images under the same label get\ncloser to each other and to the multi-template augmented\ntext embedding of the label. During fine-tuning, each com-\nponent learns cross-modality consistency in the target do-\nmain, leading to new label assignments. ReCLIP selects\nlabels agreed upon by both components as high-confidence\nones for the next iteration. This iterative process improves\nthe quality of visual and text embeddings and significantly\nenhances the assignment of pseudo labels.\nOur contributions are summarized in the following:\n\u2022 We proposed ReCLIP, a novel source-free domain\nadaptation method for vision-language model, which\nenhances the CLIP\u2019s classification ability towards tar-\nget domains without labeled data;\n\u2022 We identified the cross-modality misalignment issue\nbetween CLIP\u2019s visual and language embeddings, and\naddress the issue with an efficient projection-based\ncomponent in ReCLIP;\n\u2022 We proposed a novel cross-modality self-training algo-\nrithm with high quality commonly agreed pseudo la-\nbels leveraging cross-modality consistency to mitigate\ndomain gaps from both visual and text inputs;\n\u2022 With extensive experiments and ablation studies, Re-\nCLIP produces consistent and significant improve-\nments over CLIP and other baseline methods; ReCLIP\nimproves the average accuracy of CLIP from 69.83%\nto 74.94% on 22 datasets.\n2. Related Works\n2.1. Large-Scale Vision-Language Models\nMany large-scale pre-training vision-language models\nhave been recently proposed and demonstrate impres-\nsive zero-shot classification ability, such as CLIP [37],\nALIGN [20] that perform large-scale contrastive train-\ning for strong generalization ability, and DeCLIP [10],\nSLIP [33] that focus on efficient training with additional\nself-supervised objectives. In this work, we adopt CLIP as\nour main base model, as it is still the most representative\nvision-language model with outstanding zero-shot classifi-\ncation performance and publicly available model weights.\nIn addition, we will also demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method with different base models in ablation studies.\nAugmented prompts through multiple templates. CLIP\nmakes classification prediction by matching the visual em-\nbeddings of query images with the text embeddings of cate-\ngories names (wrapped in template text such as \u201cA photo\nof a {}\u201d), and selects the category with the highest co-\nsine similarity as prediction (please refer to the supplemen-\ntary materials for more details on CLIP and VLM).\nTo further align these text embeddings with the pre-\ntraining distribution generated from real captions, CLIP\nprepares a long list of templates with various contexts for\neach of the 27 benchmarks it evaluated on. Instead of us-\ning just one template, CLIP reported scores are produced\nwith the averaged text embeddings from a list of templated\nprompts for each category to boost performance.\nLimitations of CLIP. We observe the following condi-\ntions where CLIP\u2019s performance could be improved.\n1)\nInaccurate Text Description. The accuracy of CLIP can\nsometimes be drastically improved when the classification\nweights are fully-supervised fine-tuned, e.g., On EuroSAT,\naccuracy of CLIP improved from 59.9% to 98.2% [37].\nThis indicates that CLIP has good quality default visual rep-\nresentations, but the zero-shot performance is limited by\nthe quality of text-generated classification weights. This\nis often observed on fine-grained datasets (e.g., AID [51],\nFGVC [32], EuroSAT [18], etc.), where the class names\ncan not fully capture the visual differences between classes\n(e.g., \u201c737-200\u201d and \u201c747-200\u201d as class names from\nFGVC); 2) Visual Gap. On some datasets, there are clear\ngaps for CLIP to be further improved even after the fully su-\npervised fine-tuning on classification weight. For example,\nfine-tuned CLIP achieves only 42.9% on Country211 [37],\nand 85.97% on PatchCamelyon [46] (a binary classification\ntask with state-of-the-art system achieves 97.50%). This\nindicates that the visual encoder of CLIP can also be fur-\nther improved. 3) Visual-Text Misalignment. Recent stud-\nies [31,44] have also shown that the modality gap between\nvisual and text embeddings caused by contrastive pretrain-\ning could also limit the performance of CLIP. By modify-\ning contrastive temperature during pre-training [31], or by\nminimizing the gap during few-shot fine tuning [44], these\nworks suggest that mitigating the modality gap can benefit\nthe classification ability of CLIP.\n2.2. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a task aimed\nat improving target domain performance of models that\nwere pre-trained on a related but different source domain.\nMany techniques have been developed [23,34,39,42,50], in-\ncluding a recent method designed for visual-language mod-\nels [27]. However, most of these techniques are not ideal for\nthe purpose of improving CLIP\u2019s zero-shot performance, as\nthey often require access to source domain data, while we\ndo not require access to CLIP\u2019s training data.\nSource-Free Adaptation defines a more challenging set-\nting than UDA, where training examples are not available\nin both the source and target domains. SHOT [30] is one of\nthe first Source-Free Adaptation (SFDA) methods. SHOT\nupdates the feature extractor with cluster-based pseudo la-\nbels and information entropy loss, while maintaining the\nclassifier frozen. AaD [53] improves SHOT by replacing\nthe information entropy loss with a novel Attracting-and-\nDispersing (AaD) loss. This simple but effective approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of SFDA.\nMore recently, POUF [43] also proposes to mitigate\nthe misalignment embeddings through source-free domain\nadaptation for vision-language models. But the optimiza-\ntion objective of POUF has limited its performance in two\nways: 1) the training of POUF imposes dependency on\nthe number of text encoder inputs (prompts), which limits\nPOUF from using multiple templates to boost performance,\nespecially on datasets with large number of classes; 2) the\ntraining objectives consider each image separately and fail\nto leverage neighboring relationships.\n3. Method\nWe describe our method ReCLIP, which Refines\nCLIP\u2019s classification performance by accessing only to the\npre-trained model and the following target domain data:\n\u2022 Pre-trained vision-language model M = {MT , MV },\nwith text encoder MT and visual encoder MV ,\n\u2022 Unlabeled target images X = {x1, x2, ..., xn},\n\u2022 Target class names C = {c1, c2, ..., cm}.\nOur goal is to increase the classification accuracy of M\non target data X. As the first method that studies the source-\nfree adaptation problem for vision-language model, we ap-\nproach this problem in two steps: (1) How to align visual\nand text embeddings by removing class-agnostic and re-\ndundant information in a learned projection space (Section\n3.1). Then we show how to assign pseudo labels for images\nin the projection space via label propagation (Section 3.2);\n(2) How to utilize the pseudo labels to further mitigate the\nvisual and text domain gaps by efficiently updating both vi-\nsual and text encoders, we propose a cross-modality self-\ntraining algorithm which updates embeddings and pseudo\nlabels in a iterative fashion (Section 3.3).\n3.1. Projection Space to Align Visual and Text\nFigure 1 demonstrates the misalignment issue of text\nand visual embeddings from CIFAR10 [26], which we have\nalso observed over all the ablation datasets. The plot in-\ndicates that the text embeddings of different class names\nare closer to each other than to images in the corresponding\ncategories. We also validate the misalignment with quanti-\ntative statistics, as shown in Figure 2. The average cosine\nsimilarity between text embeddings is 82%, while the aver-\nage similarity between visual and text embeddings from the\nsame category is only 23%. This indicates that the unified\nvision-language space of CLIP is far from well aligned.\nVisual Embeddings\nText Embeddings\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc43! = \ud835\udc3c\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc43\" = \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48#\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc43$ = \ud835\udc48\u2032\ud835\udc48\u2032#\n0.05%\n81.63%\n81.63%\n22.79%\n92.96%\n90.19%\nIntra-Class Visual-Text Similarity\nInter-Class Text-Text Similarity\nBefore Label Propagation\nUnlabeled Example\nLabeled Example\nAfter Label Propagation\nPseudo Labels\nFigure 2. Demonstration on Feature Redundancy Removal (left) and Label Propagation (right). Left: P0 shows the original distribution of\nvisual and text embeddings of CLIP, where text embeddings are close to each other distant from visual embeddings; P1 = UU \u22a4 removes\nthe class agnostic information from visual embeddings, and has pulled closer visual and text embeddings. P2 = U \u2032U \u2032\u22a4 separates the text\nembeddings away by removing the redundant information from them. Similarity values demonstrated in this example is calculated based\non average statistics from CIFAR10 test set; Right: the Label Propagation process generates pseudo labels for unlabeled training images by\npropagating label information from labeled text embeddings (categories names) to unlabeled visual embeddings (training images) through\nnearest-neighbor connections.\nAs highlighted in Section 1, although the visual and text\nembeddings from CLIP convey rich information, much of\nthem could be redundant and class-agnostic to target classi-\nfication tasks. This redundancy can result in misalignment\nbetween the text and visual embeddings. We hence pro-\npose a projection-based method to eliminate the redundancy\nfrom both visual and text embeddings.\nRemove class-agnostic information from visual embed-\ndings. A straightforward way to remove class-agnostic in-\nformation from visual features is just to project all the vi-\nsual embeddings onto the span of text embeddings. As-\nsuming we have a d dimensional representation space\nRd, and we have m classes whose text embeddings are\nT = [t1, ..., tm] \u2208 Rm\u00d7d, where ti = Mt(ci) for i \u2208\n{1, 2, ..., m}. With Singular Value Decomposition\nU, S, V = svd(T)\nwe get U = [e1, e2, ..., em] as the orthonormal basis of the\nspan of T, which defines a projection matrix P1 = UU \u22a4.\nThen, \u2200f \u2208 Rd, we can calculate f \u2032 = fP1 with\nek \u00b7 (f \u2212 f \u2032) = 0, \u2200k \u2208 {1, ...m}\nwhere f \u2212 f \u2032 is the class-agnostic information that does not\ncontribute to the classification. As shown in Figure 2, P1 in-\ncreases the average similarity between images and text em-\nbeddings from the same category to 92.96% on CIFAR10.\nRemove redundant information from text embeddings.\nAs suggested in Principal Component Analysis, the first\ndimension e1 of the outer-space basis U will be the ma-\njor component that most {t1, ..., tm} overlap on. Remov-\ning the major component e1 will make all text embed-\ndings nearly perpendicular to each other. Therefore, with\nU \u2032 = [e2, e3, ..., em] we define a new projection matrix\nP2 = U \u2032U \u2032\u22a4. As shown in Figure 2, P2 successfully sep-\narates the text embeddings from different classes to an av-\nerage cosine similarity of 0.05%, while maintaining high\nintra-class visual-text similarity at 90.19% on CIFAR10.\nIn addition to the improvement of CIFAR10 statistics,\nexperiments on pseudo label generation also indicate the ef-\nfectiveness of embedding space induced by P2 in improving\nclustering performance, as demonstrated in Section 4.3.2.\n3.2. Pseudo Label Generation for VLM\nThe projection matrix P2 removes the redundancies and\naligns visual and text embeddings, which enables the gen-\neration of pseudo labels through Label Propagation [19],\nwhich is a semi-supervised learning method that propagates\nlabel information from labeled to unlabeled data points\nthrough nearest neighbor connections, as demonstrated in\nFigure 2. Although in source-free adaptation we do not\nhave access to labeled data points, the embedding align-\nment through P2 has enabled us to treat text embeddings\nfrom class names as labeled points, and visual embeddings\nfrom images as unlabeled points.\nWith labeled examples {\u02c6ti}m\ni=1 (class name embeddings)\nand unlabeled examples {\u02c6vj}n\nj=1 ( image visual embed-\ndings), we make the union set L:\nL = [\u02c6t1, \u02c6t2, ..., \u02c6tm, \u02c6v1, \u02c6v2, ..., \u02c6vn] \u2208 Rd\u00d7(m+n)\nFollowing Label Propagation [19], we first produce affin-\nity matrix Ak through k\u2212nearest neighbor affinity ranking\nAk = topk(L\u22a4L) where topk(\u00b7) is an operation that keeps\nthe top k highest value per row from the full affinity ma-\ntrix L\u22a4L. Then, with normalization and symmetrization,\nwe have:\nW = D\u2212 1\n2 (Ak + A\u22a4\nk )D\u2212 1\n2\nwhere D := diag(W1m+n) is the degree matrix, 1m+n is\nthe all-ones (m+n)\u2212vector, and W is the normalized adja-\ncency matrix that defines the random walk probability.

Then, the pseudo label\nvector Z can be estimated by solving the random walk prob-\nlem with initial state Y , propagation probability matrix W\nand diffusion magnitude \u03b1:\nZ := (I \u2212 \u03b1W)\u22121Y\n(1)\nwhere (I \u2212 \u03b1W)\u22121 is the closed-form solution to the ran-\ndom walk problem. As (I \u2212 \u03b1W) \u2208 Rm+n is not sparse,\nand therefore the calculation of its inverse matrix is very\ntime consuming, we use conjugate gradient (CG) to approx-\nimately solve Equation 1, following the suggestion from\n[19]. Finally, with Equation 1 solved, the pseudo label can\nbe given by\n\u02dcyj := arg max\ni\nzm+j,i\nwhere \u02dcyj is the pseudo label of image xj, and zji is the (j, i)\nelement of matrix Z.\n3.3. Source-Free Adaptation for Vision-Language\nModel via Cross-Modality Self-Training\nVision-language models present a new challenge to\nadaptation algorithms, where both visual and text encoders\nneed to be adapted. In this section, we discuss how to miti-\ngates the domain gaps of visual and text domains, and pro-\npose a cross-modality self-training algorithm with pseudo\nlabels from 3.2 to iteratively update the label assignments,\nand the visual and text encoders.\nThe self-training algorithm of ReCLIP consists of two\nparallel components: ReCLIP-T aims at closing the text do-\nmain gap by pushing text embeddings towards visual em-\nbeddings of the same class, by fine-tuning the text encoder\nwith the visual encoder frozen. ReCLIP-V aims at closing\nthe visual domain gap by pushing visual embeddings of the\nsame class closer to each other, by fine-tuning the visual\nencoder with the text encoder frozen. On top of ReCLIP-V\nand ReCLIP-T, we integrate the commonly-agreed pseudo\nlabels to produce high-confidence training signals. For in-\nference, we add the prediction logits from both ReCLIP-V\nand ReCLIP-T to make the final prediction.\nReCLIP-T: Text Encoder Training.\nWe optimize the\ntext encoder Mt with simple cross-entropy loss LossT :=\nCE( \u02c6Y T , \u02dcY ) between pseudo label \u02dcY and cosine similarity\nprediction logits \u02c6Y T = [\u02c6v1, ..., \u02c6vn]\u22a4[\u02c6t1, ..., \u02c6tm]. The objec-\ntive of adaptation on the text encoder is to push text em-\nbeddings {\u02c6ti} closer to the image embeddings {\u02c6vj} from\nthe same class based on pseudo label assignments \u02dcY T . In\nFigure 3 we present the details of ReCLIP-T, the detailed\nalgorithm is provided in the supplementary materials.\nReCLIP-V: Visual Encoder Training. The goal of visual\nencoder adaptation is to push visual embeddings {\u02c6vj} from\nthe same class to be closer to each other, to form a bet-\nter feature space for classification. As contrastive loss is\nexpensive and applying constraints on batch size, we have\ninstead chosen to push visual embeddings closer to the cen-\nter of its class instead of other visual embeddings as an al-\nternative resort. To be specific, in ReCLIP-V we optimize\nthe visual encoder Mv with cross-entropy loss LossV :=\nCE( \u02c6Y V , \u02dcY ) between pseudo label \u02dcY and cosine similarity\nlogits \u02c6Y V = [\u02c6v1, ..., \u02c6vn]\u22a4[ \u02c6w1, ..., \u02c6wm], where \u02c6w1, ..., \u02c6wm\nare the class centers calculated based on \u02dcY . In Figure 3 we\npresent the details of ReCLIP-V, the detailed algorithm is\nprovided in the supplementary materials.\nHigh-Confidence Pseudo Labels Sharing.\nReCLIP-V\nupdates the similarities among visual embeddings with\nLossV , while ReCLIP-T updates the projection matrix and\ntext embeddings with LossT . As these two modules sep-\narately optimize the visual and text encoders with differ-\nent objectives, their pseudo labels may start to diverge af-\nter a certain number of epochs, resulting in different views\nwhere only the commonly agreed samples are likely to be\ncorrectly classified. As such, ReCLIP collects pseudo la-\nbels from both ReCLIP-V and ReCLIP-T at the end of each\nepoch, and updates both models with only the commonly\nagreed pseudo labels \u02dcY , as illustrated in Figure 4. The de-\ntailed algorithm is provided in the supplementary materials.\n4. Experiment and Results\nBaselines We use the following methods for comparison:\n1) CLIP [37]: State-of-the-art zero-shot image classifica-\ntion model. We choose CLIP with ViT/L-14 architecture as\nthe main baseline model for comparison and adaptation. We\nreport both published results from Radford et al. [37] and\nour reproduction, denoted as report and multi respectively.\nBoth report and multi are prepared with the official prompt\ntemplate lists provided by Radford et al. [37]. In addition,\nwe also report the results we reproduced with a single tem-\nplate (\u201cA photo of a {}\u201d), denoted as single;\n2) AaD [53]: State-of-the-art SFDA method. We adapt the\nofficial code to apply it on CLIP and our benchmarks;\n3) POUF [43]: A recent SFDA method that also aims\nto mitigate misaligned visual and text embedding spaces.\nSince POUF does not report on the benchmarks where CLIP\nhas published scores, we produce its results on these bench-\nmarks using its official code. We report the best performing\nversion of POUF which fine-tunes the entire model.\nEvaluation and Datasets. 1) Main Results: for SFDA\ncomparison between ReCLIP, POUF, AaD and base model\nCLIP, we use an abundant and comprehensive list of 21\ncommon image classification benchmarks out of the 27\nbenchmarks from Radford et al. [37], except the 6 datasets\nwhere CLIP are evaluated on the custom splits or proto-\ncols which are not released at the time of this submis-\nsion (KITTI [16], UCF101 [40], VOC2007 [15], Kinet-\nics700 [4], HatefulMemes [24], CLEVR [22]).\nIn addi-\ntion to the ablation dataset AID [51] we use for hyper-\nparameters selection, SFDA evaluation is performed on 22\nbenchmarks in total. 2) Comparison with POUF: For ad-\nditional comparison with POUF on its published scores, we\nevaluate ReCLIP on Office-Home [47], which contains four\ndifferent domains: Art (Ar), Clipart (Cl), Product (Pr) and\nReal-World (Rw). 3) Ablation Studies: we choose AID,\nCIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SUN397 as ablation datasets to\nrepresent datasets with different sizes and characteristics.\nFor more details on evaluation datasets, please refer to sup-\nplementary materials.\nFor SFDA evaluation in Section 4.1, AaD and ReCLIP\nuse CLIP-multi as base model, and POUF uses CLIP-single\ndue to its design. For experiments on Office-Home, both\nReCLIP and POUF use CLIP-single as base model.\nUnless otherwise specified, we perform our experiments\nin transductive manner, where SFDA methods ReCLIP,\nPOUF and AaD first perform adaptation on the unlabeled\ntest data of each dataset, and then the adapted models are\nevaluated on the same test data following the standard CLIP\ninference protocol. For all benchmarks, we use top-1 clas-\nsification accuracy as our metric,\nImplementation Details For the self-training of ReCLIP,\nwe fine-tune the layer-normalization [1] weights with other\nweights frozen, as it is shown to be one of the most effec-\ntive and stable option to adapt models with noisy super-\nvision [48]. For the SFDA evaluation, we use AID [51]\nto select the best hyper-parameter for ReCLIP, POUF and\nAaD. We then use the same set of hyper-parameters for\nall 22 datasets during the evaluation. We match the max-\nimum adaptation steps for all methods to be the same,\nas min{5000 iterations, 50 epochs}. For the evaluation on\nOffice-Home, we select the hyper-parameter on the Real-\nWorld (Rw) domain and use the same hyper-parameters\nacross all domains for evaluation.\nFor details on exact\nhyper-parameters used in experiments, ablation studies on\nchoices of learnable modules, and the setup of Label Prop-\nagation, please refer to supplementary materials.\n4.1. Main Results\nIn Table 1 we present the SFDA accuracy of ReCLIP,\nAaD and POUF over 22 datasets. Besides the accuracy from\nthe final epoch of self-training, we report the accuracy from\nthe peak-performing epoch for AaD, POUF and ReCLIP as\nwell, denoted as peak.\nReCLIP achieves consistent and significant improve-\nments over CLIP on 21 datasets and comparable perfor-\nmance on Country 211.\nReCLIP improves the averaged\ntop-1 accuracy of CLIP by 5.11% and 6.02% at the final\nand peak epochs respectively over the 22 datasets without\naccessing any labeled data, which outperforms both base-\nline adaptation methods AaD, POUF by clear margin.\nAvg Acc\nAID [51]\nBirdsnap [2]\nCaltech101 [28]\nCIFAR10 [26]\nCIFAR100 [26]\nCountry211 [37]\nDTD [8]\nEuroSAT [18]\nFER2013 [55]\nFGVC [32]\nFlowers [35]\nFood101 [3]\nGTSRB [41]\nImageNet [12]\nMNIST [13]\nOxford Pet [36]\nPCam [46]\nSST2 [37]\nRESISC45 [7]\nCars [25]\nSTL10 [9]\nSUN397 [52]\nCLIP-report 70.08\n-\n48.30 92.6* 96.20 77.90 32.70 55.30 59.90 57.50 36.1* 78.7* 92.90 50.30 75.30 87.20 93.50 58.80 64.00 71.60 77.3* 99.30 67.70\nCLIP-single 65.53 61.30 51.88 92.02 95.19 77.18 25.78 52.50 56.03 52.22 30.18 74.19 92.56 45.57 73.46 52.63 93.21 57.75 52.39 63.29 76.45 99.47 66.42\nCLIP-multi\n69.83 68.73 52.48 91.63 95.60 78.22 31.84 55.37 60.00 56.39 31.59 79.04 93.08 50.59 75.52 76.23 93.62 62.43 68.92 69.66 77.88 99.36 67.97\nAaD\n46.53 69.83 52.42 91.45 96.54 80.18 0.47 55.43 11.12 16.91 32.37 78.61 0.99 51.26 0.11 89.81 93.62 49.95 49.92 2.51\n0.52 99.41 0.25\nAaD peak\n71.79 70.33 52.58 91.93 96.55 80.46 31.90 55.59 76.18 55.67 32.43 79.22 93.04 52.83 75.53 91.95 93.73 64.03 68.97 71.01 77.96 99.42 67.96\nPOUF\n69.73 64.83 52.91 92.97 96.06 80.39 28.19 56.65 67.95 55.92 32.88 75.62 92.71 51.47 73.05 91.22 94.20 66.57 48.22 67.54 76.72 99.50 68.38\nPOUF peak 69.76 64.87 52.96 92.97 96.06 80.39 28.22 56.75 67.95 55.92 32.91 75.62 92.73 51.47 73.06 91.22 94.20 66.75 48.60 67.54 76.72 99.53 68.38\nReCLIP\n74.94 77.97 52.96 93.02 96.95 82.32 31.92 60.85 78.75 58.07 36.63 82.05 94.15 66.81 75.81 90.88 95.61 70.15 73.48 78.41 77.96 99.58 74.41\nReCLIP peak 75.85 79.27 53.28 93.10 97.04 83.42 31.95 61.38 79.94 58.29 38.70 83.14 94.18 69.14 76.01 97.11 96.05 70.56 73.48 79.31 79.26 99.59 74.53\nTable 1.

Comparison of ReCLIP and published scores from POUF\n[43] on Office-Home [47], both use CLIP-single as base model.\nAaD achieves 1.96% improvements over CLIP at its\npeak epochs. However, it encounters drastic performance\ndrops at final epochs that lose 25.26% of the averaged ac-\ncuracy, due to collapsed unsupervised training on target\ndatasets such as Food101, SUN397, ImageNet, etc. Mean-\nwhile, ReCLIP maintains the performance at final epochs,\nwith only 0.91% differences from the peak epochs. These\nresults suggest the effectiveness of the high-quality com-\nmonly agreed pseudo labels of ReCLIP in stabilizing the\nnoisy self-training and preventing model collapse.\nPOUF achieves 4.20% improvement over its base model\nCLIP-single. However, such improvement is counteracted\nby the inability to employ multiple prompts to enhance\ntext embedding quality, as suggested by CLIP [37]. Mul-\ntiple templates create a large number of prompts, which\nare not likely to fit in the same mini-batch for text en-\ncoder optimization. ReCLIP also experiences this limitation\nwhen fine-tuning the text encoder. However, thanks to the\ndual-component structure of ReCLIP, although ReCLIP-T\nalso only use single template for text-encoder optimization,\nReCLIP-V can still take advantage of the multiple template\naugmented text embeddings and provides better pseudo la-\nbels to ReCLIP-T through pseudo-label sharing. In addition\nto the advantage brought by multi-template augmented text\nembeddings, ReCLIP also takes advantage from the neigh-\nboring relationships over the entire visual-text embedding\nspace, while POUF does not, which has also contributed to\nthe better performance of ReCLIP.

As shown in [37],\nCLIP can only achieve 42.9% after its classifier is fine-tuned\nin the fully supervised way. Therefore, it is challenging to\nobtain improvement during source-free domain adaptation.\n4.2. Comparison with POUF\nIn Table 2 we present the comparison between the pub-\nlished scores of POUF and ReCLIP on the Office-Home,\nwhere both methods use CLIP-single (ViT/B-16) as base\nmodel. We also include the Label Propagation pseudo la-\nbel accuracy generated on our projected CLIP embeddings\nprior to any updates on the base model. It is shown that the\nLabel Propagation accuracy already outperforms POUF-\nprompt, which fine-tunes the learnable text prompt. More-\nover, ReCLIP achieves clear improvement over POUF over\nmost of the domains, with 2.17%\u2191 on Cl, 1.20%\u2191 on Pr,\n0.31%\u2191 on Rw and on-par performance on Ar.

We\nuse AID, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SUN397 as our abla-\ntion datasets, and the test set of each dataset is equally split\ninto two fixed partitions. We report the ablation results in\nan inductive manner where models are first adapted on par-\ntition 1 and then evaluated on partition 2. Note that results\nin this section are not directly comparable to 4.1 because\nthe different evaluation partition.\n4.3.1\nEffectiveness of ReCLIP Components\nIn Table 3 we present the comparison between different ver-\nsions of ReCLIP. As shown, Label Propagation can create\npseudo labels with significantly improved accuracy com-\npared to vanilla CLIP. On the top of Label Propagation, both\nReCLIP-V and ReCLIP-T (Figure 3) are shown to be effec-\ntive in providing further improvements. In ReCLIP(w/o La-\nbel Sharing) we present the result by simply assembling pre-\ndictions from separately trained ReCLIP-V and ReCLIP-T\nat inference time. Comparing the last two rows of Table 3\nwe observe that ReCLIP (w/ Label Sharing) has clear im-\nprovement over ReCLIP (w/o Label Sharing), which indi-\ncates that the commonly agreed pseudo-labels stabilizes the\nnoisy adaptation process and improved both ReCLIP-V and\nReCLIP-T to achieve better performance.\n4.3.2\nComparison on Pseudo Label Generations\nIn Table 4, we compare methods in pseudo label genera-\ntion. For clustering based methods, we assign the same\npseudo labels for examples from the same cluster, based on\nthe in-cluster majority vote; For k-NN Classifier and La-\nbel Propagation methods, we experiment them on original\nCLIP feature space P0, and on projection spaces P1, P2 as\ndescribed in Figure 2. For k-NN Classifiers, we assign each\nexample with the major vote prediction within its k-nearest-\nneighborhood, with k equal to the average sample count per\nclass. For Label Propagation on P0, we select the example\nwith the highest confidence from each class as the labeled\nexample to perform label propagation as a baseline.

We tested the effectiveness of ReCLIP on SLIP [33]\nand DeCLIP [29], both of these improved CLIP by adding\nself-supervision learning objectives during pre-training. We\nhave also tested ReCLIP on other versions of CLIP with\nsmaller architectures.\nAs shown in Table 5, ReCLIP\ndemonstrates steady and significant improvements on var-\nious vision-language models and architectures.\n4.3.4\nRuntime and Inductive Performance\nSelf-training of ReCLIP is very efficient, which completes\nadaptation in only 0.5 to 5 GPU-Hour on a single V100\nGPU, depending on the target dataset size. Note that this\nadaptation time is a one-time effort on each target domain\nand ReCLIP can then inference on unseen data from the\nsame domain without re-training. For complete runtime of\nReCLIP over each benchmarks and more inductive evalua-\ntion results, please refer to the supplementary materials.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce ReCLIP, a novel solution on\nsource-free domain adaptation for vision-language models.\nReCLIP first uses a novel designed projection space to re-\naligns visual and text embeddings and to generate depend-\nable pseudo labels for target classification tasks. ReCLIP\nfurther applies cross-modality self-training with pseudo la-\nbels, which iteratively enhances label assignments and vi-\nsual and text embeddings. Compared to the previous meth-\nods AaD and POUF, ReCLIP provides an effective and sta-\nble solution to the source-free adaptation problem of vision-\nlanguage models.\nReCLIP significantly improves CLIP,\nincreasing the average accuracy from 69.83% to 74.94%\nacross 22 datasets.\nReferences\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hin-\nton.

IEEE, 2020. 7, 12, 14, 15\nAppendix I: Background on CLIP\nCLIP performs contrastive learning over 400 millions\nweb-retrieved pairs of images and captions by pulling the\nvisual and text representation near if they are from the same\npair and away if they are not. At inference stage, CLIP\nmakes classification prediction by matching the visual em-\nbeddings of query images with the text embeddings of cate-\ngories names (wrapped in template text such as \u201ca photo\nof {}\u201d, or a list of templates and uses the averaged em-\nbedding, as discussed in the main paper), and selects the\ncategory with the highest cosine similarity as prediction, as\nshown in Figure 5. CLIP is capable of performing classi-\nfication over novel tasks without any training example, as\nlong as the category names are provided. CLIP has demon-\nstrated outstanding zero-shot classification accuracy, e.g.\n76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without seeing any ex-\namples from the dataset.

CLIP performs classification on target classes by com-\nparing visual embeddings with the text embeddings generated\nfrom class names.\nAppendix II: Algorithms\nAs described in Section 3.3 of the main paper, ReCLIP\nis composed of two parallel components that are designed\nfor visual and text encoder fine-tuning, namely ReCLIP-V\nand ReCLIP-T. On top of ReCLIP-T and ReCLIP-V, we in-\ntegrate the pseudo labels by filtering the commonly-agreed\nones to produce high-confidence training signals for both\nsides. In this Section, we present the detailed description of\nReCLIP-T and ReCLIP-V in Algorithm 1, and the pseudo\nlabel sharing in Algorithm 2.\nAppendix III: Evaluation Benchmarks\nFor the main result from the paper, we have evaluated\nour model as well as the baseline methods on the validation\nor test splits from 22 image classification benchmarks, ac-\ncording to the setup as stated from Radford, et al [37]. The\n22 benchmarks is composed of the one ablation datasets\nAID [51] that we used for hyper-parameter selection, and\nthe 21 benchmarks (Caltech101 [28], CIFAR10 [26], CI-\nFAR100 [26], ImageNet [12], SUN397 [52], Birdsnap [2],\nCountry211 [37], DTD [8], EuroSAT [18], FER2013 [55],\nFGVC [32], Flowers [35], Food101 [3], GTSRB [41],\nMNIST [13], Oxford Pet [36], PCam [46], SST2 [37], RE-\nSISC45 [7], Cars [25], STL10 [9]) from the 27 benchmarks\nCLIP reported in Radford, et al [37], except: i) KITTI [16],\nUCF101 [40], VOC2007 [15], Kinetics700 [4] that are ob-\nject detection or video classification benchmarks that are\nout of the scope of our discussion; ii) HatefulMemes [24]\nand CLEVR [22], where CLIP uses custom splits that are\nnot released at the time of this submission. The detailed\nstatistics on the number of images and the number of classes\nare reported in Table 6.\nFor comparison with POUF published score, we reported\nour scores on the Office-Home datasets. Office-Home con-\ntains 65 categories and 15588 images from four different\ndomains: 2427 Art images, 4365 Clipart images, 4439\nProduct images and 4357 Real-World Images.\nAppendix IV: Implementation Details\nAs mentioned in the main paper, we use AID to choose\nthe best hyper-parameters for each baselines and evaluate\nthem with the same hyper-parameters across the 22 datasets\nfor SFDA evaluation.\nFor ReCLIP, we use learning rate of 10\u22123, weight de-\ncay of 10\u22124, momentum of 0.9, batch size of 64, maximum\nlength of min{5000 iterations, 50 epochs} and SGD opti-\nmization on both visual and text encoders. For Birdsnap,\nCountry211, SUN397 and ImageNet which have more than\n200 classes, we use a batch size of 32 due to large mem-\nory occupation from text inputs to fit the training on a sin-\ngle V100 GPU. For Label Propagation, we use propagation\nstrength \u03b1 = 0.99 and neighbor size k = 20. For datasets\nwith more than 500 classes (Birdsnap, ImageNet), we no-\ntice the accuracy of pseudo labels generated by label prop-\nagation becomes unstable, and it requires additional hyper-\nparameter tuning to achieve good performance. To maintain\nstable performance, we turn off label propagation and sim-\nply use model predictions as pseudo labels on datasets with\nover 500 categories (Birdsnap, ImageNet). For all other\ndatasets, we follow the exact process as described in Al-\ngorithm 1 and 2.\nFor both AaD and POUF, we have tested different\nhyper-parameters and report the the best performing set-\nting, with learning rate of 10\u22123, weight decay of 10\u22123,\nmomentum of 0.9, SGD optimization on AaD, and learn-\ning rate of 10\u22122, weight decay of 10\u22123, momentum of\n0.9, SGD optimization on POUF. For both AaD and\nPOUF, we extended their default training length to match\nour training length of ReCLIP, with batch size of 64 \u00d7\nmin{5000 iterations, 50 epochs} steps on AaD, and batch\nsize of 32 \u00d7 min{10000 iterations, 100 epochs} steps on\nPOUF.\nFor ReCLIP on Office-Home, we use the Real-World\n(Rw) domain to choose the hyper-parameter. We use SGD\noptimizer with learning rate of 10\u22122 on the visual encoder\nand 10\u22123 on the text encoder, batch size of 64 and 5000\niteration as maximum step across all domains.

In Table 7,\nwe perform Visual Prompt tuning following [21], and our\nown designed Text Prompt. Please refer to Appendix VII\nfor more details.\nAs shown in Table 7, fine-tuning Layer-Norm weights\nfrom Visual Encoder has the best fully supervised accuracy\non both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, while fine-tuning Layer-\nNorm weights from Text Encoder has the best fully super-\nvised accuracy on AID. As described in Section 2 from the\nMain Paper, on some datasets (including AID), the perfor-\nmance of CLIP is mainly limited by the poor quality text\nembeddings from inaccurate class names. In this case, fine-\ntuning the text encoder will achieve better performance as\nwe observed. Table 7 results suggest the necessity of fine-\ntuning CLIP from both the visual and text side to handle\ndifferent scenarios.\nInductive Results\nWe perform the SFDA evaluation in Table 1 from the\nmain paper, to follow the protocols of AaD [53] and\nPOUF [43] and to fully utilize the test examples. How-\never, ReCLIP can also be applied in the inductive manner,\nso that the adaptation only has to be performed once for the\ntarget domain, and the adapted model will be effective on\nnew and unseen examples of the target domain. In Table 8\nwe run ReCLIP in an inductive setting, where ReCLIP per-\nforms self-training on the training split of a dataset (0.5 to 5\nCIFAR10\nCIFAR100\nAID\nSUN397\nVanilla CLIP\n95.54\n76.48\n64.87\n67.25\nLearnable Text Prompts\n97.50\n82.18\n93.73\n75.27\nLearnable Visual Prompts [21]\n96.70\n80.68\n74.27\n68.09\nText Encoder Layer-Norm\n97.32\n83.30\n94.8\n78.47\nVisual Encoder Layer-Norm\n97.8\n85.16\n69.40\n68.30\nTable 7.

ReCLIP achieves similar improvements in\nthe inductive setting as in the transductive setting.\nPseudo Label Quality\nIn Table 9 we report the pseudo label accuracy of Re-\nCLIP. We report the pseudo label accuracy from ReCLIP\non the first epoch, before the self-training algorithm up-\ndates the model weights. From Table 9 we observe that\nthe label propagation over projected visual and text embed-\ndings has obtained ReCLIP pseudo labels with consistent\nimproved accuracy over CLIP, only except Birdsnap and\nImageNet which have more than 500 categories, as we dis-\ncussed in Appendix IV. The results from Table 9 demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our version of the label propaga-\ntion method in generating reliable pseudo labels for vision-\nlanguage models. More discussion on pseudo label genera-\ntion is also covered in Section 4.3.2 of the main paper.\nAverage\nAID [51]\nBirdsnap [2]\nCaltech101 [28]\nCIFAR10 [26]\nCIFAR100 [26]\nCountry211 [37]\nDTD [8]\nEuroSAT [18]\nFER2013 [55]\nFGVC [32]\nFlowers [35]\nFood101 [3]\nGTSRB [41]\nImageNet [12]\nMNIST [13]\nOxford Pet [36]\nPCam [46]\nSST2 [37]\nRESISC45 [7]\nStanford Cars [25]\nSTL10 [9]\nSUN397 [52]\nCLIP repro\n69.83 68.73 52.48 91.63 95.60 78.22 31.84 55.37 60.00 56.39 31.59 79.04 93.08 50.59 75.52 76.23 93.62 62.43 68.92 69.66 77.88 99.36 67.97\nReCLIP (pseudo label) 72.54 74.50 43.25 91.91 96.56 81.40 26.30 59.04 73.36 57.15 36.33 82.55 93.95 60.64 25.11 82.85 94.77 62.46 68.86 77.63 77.66 99.52 70.54\nTable 9. ReCLIP pseudo label Quality. Results are generated with vanilla CLIP ViT-L/16 checkpoint, on the first epoch of ReCLIP before\nthe training algorithms update the model weights.\nAppendix VI: Time Analysis\nWe present the runtime required by SFDA methods,\nnamely AaD, POUF and ReCLIP, in Table 6. We matched\nall methods to be at the same training steps for fair com-\nparison. As shown by the result, AaD takes an average of\n1.19 hours to adapt, ReCLIP takes 2.35 hours and POUF\ntakes 6.18 hours. ReCLIP is not much slower than AaD al-\nthough ReCLIP trains two sets of encoders at the same time,\nexcept on datasets with more categories due to the time re-\nquired for the Label Propagation process. However, POUF\nis much slower than both AaD and ReCLIP, due to its less\nefficient implementation. However, all three algorithms are\nvery efficient as the adaptation only has to be applied once\nfor each new target domain.\nAppendix VII: Details on the design of learn-\nable Language Prompt\nWhat is Language Prompts\nDuring\nthe\nlarge-scale\ncontrastive\npre-training,\nCLIP [37] was trained to match visual-text embed-\nding between training images with their caption sentences\nsuch\nas\n\u2018\u2018A Golden Retriever dog sitting\non grass\u2019\u2019. However, during inference time, category\ndescriptions are usually provided in the form of phrases\nsuch as \u2018\u2018Golden Retriever\u2019\u2019 or just \u2018\u2018Dog\u2019\u2019\ninstead of captions in complete sentences.\nTo mitigate\nthis gap, CLIP has proposed to use templates to wrap the\ncategory description phrase into complete sentences to\ngenerate better text embeddings.\nFor optimal performance, CLIP [37] further claims that\nspecific templates which provide contexts to the cate-\ngory names might help generate better text embeddings\nfor classification.\nFor example, CLIP finds the tem-\nplate prompt \u2018\u2018A photo of {category name}, a\ntype of pet\u2019\u2019 works the best for OxfordIII-Pet [36].\nCLIP has designed different lists of template prompts for\nall datasets it was evaluated on. The details can be found\non their official GitHub repository https://github.\ncom/openai/CLIP/blob/main/data/prompts.\nmd.\nA\nPhoto\nof\nDog\nDog\nt1\n[EOS]\nt2\nt3\nt4\nt*\nt5\nText Encoder\nt\nCategory Name\nTemplate\nPrompt\nTokenized\nEmbeddings\nResult Text Embeddings\n[BOS]\nt0\nFigure 6. Demonstration of the design of Learnable Prompt. t\u2217\nrepresents a learnable token embedding that is inserted at the be-\nginning of the sequence of inputs to the transformer-based text en-\ncoder. \u201cBOS\u201d and \u201cEOS\u201d stands for \u201cbeginning of sentence\u201d and\n\u201cend of sentence\u201d and they serve as the special tokens for the text\nencoder to identify the beginning and end of the input sentence.\nLearnable Language Prompts\nAs demonstrated by CLIP [37], the wisely chosen tem-\nplate prompts might play a vital role in generating accu-\nrate text embeddings.\nHowever, this process largely de-\npends on the heuristic design. Our goal for the learnable\nlanguage prompt design is to make the prompt learnable\nand to avoid having different template prompts for differ-\nent datasets. Additionally, this can also be an efficient and\nstable way to fine-tune the performance of CLIP.\nWe start from the default template prompt \u2018\u2018A photo\nof {category name}\u2019\u2019,\nand insert an additional\nlearnable token embedding t\u2217 at the beginning of the sen-\ntence, right after the Begin-Of-Sentence (BOS) token, as\nshown in Figure 6. t\u2217 is initialized with the same embedding\nvalue of word \u2018\u2018is\u2019\u2019 for reasonable performance before\nit is fine-tuned. During the fine-tuning process, token t\u2217 is\nmade to be learnable while token embeddings for all other\nwords are fixed.\nAppendix VIII: Limitation and Future Work\nAs mentioned in the Implementation Details section, we\nhave observed that on datasets with more than 500 classes\n(Birdsnap, ImageNet), the accuracy of pseudo labels gener-\nated by label propagation becomes unstable, and it requires\nadditional hyperparameter tuning to achieve good perfor-\nmance. To maintain stable performance, we have turned off\nlabel propagation and simply used model predictions as our\npseudo labels on datasets with over 500 categories. Studies\non how the hyper-parameters influence the label propaga-\ntion performance on datasets with more than 500 categories\nwill be important future work to further improve ReCLIP.\nAnother future direction will be the utilization of aug-\nmentation consistency. Augmentation Consistency has been\nshown to be a very powerful unsupervised training sig-\nnal and has been widely applied in unsupervised methods\n[5, 6, 17]. Due to the scope and complexity of this project,\nwe have not explored the usage of augmentation consis-\ntency in source-free domain adaptation. It will be important\nfuture work to explore the combination of the current Re-\nCLIP with augmentation consistency to further improve the\nadaptation performance.\n"

    "text": "Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex\nExplanation Traces of GPT-4\nSubhabrata Mukherjee\u2217\u2020, Arindam Mitra\u2217\nGanesh Jawahar, Sahaj Agarwal, Hamid Palangi, Ahmed Awadallah\nMicrosoft Research\nAbstract\nRecent research has focused on enhancing the capability of smaller models\nthrough imitation learning, drawing on the outputs generated by large\nfoundation models (LFMs). A number of issues impact the quality of these\nmodels, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs;\nsmall scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous\nevaluation resulting in overestimating the small model\u2019s capability as they\ntend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs. To\naddress these challenges, we develop Orca, a 13-billion parameter model\nthat learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from\nrich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought\nprocesses; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from\nChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and\ndiverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses\nconventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B\nby more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-\nBench Hard (BBH) and 42% on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity\nwith ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance\n(4 pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic\nexaminations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot\nsettings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4. Our research indicates\nthat learning from step-by-step explanations, whether these are generated\nby humans or more advanced AI models, is a promising direction to improve\nmodel capabilities and skills.\n\u2217Co-primary authors.

Topical performances shown in Figure 11.\nLarge Foundation Models (LFMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 [2] exhibit remarkable zero-\nshot performances across a broad spectrum of tasks. Alongside academic benchmarks like\nHuman Eval [3] and Big Bench [4], GPT-4 has also demonstrated human-level performance\non various professional exams, including the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and USMLE. These\nadvancements can be credited to the scaling of both model and dataset sizes, as well\nas the incorporation of a second layer of training to better align the models with user\nintent. This alignment is accomplished by fine-tuning the models via supervised learning on\ndemonstrations of prompts and desired model behavior, and through reinforcement learning\nfrom human preferences [5].\nAs these models continue to evolve and become more powerful, an intriguing question arises:\nCan we use the model itself to supervise its own behavior or that of other AI models? Bai\net al. [6] have shown that by sampling output from an initial model, generating revisions,\nand then fine-tuning the original model based on these revised responses, model behavior\ncan be controlled more effectively and can be made more harmless, with significantly fewer\nhuman labels.\nRecently, there has been an influx of studies using LFMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 as\nteachers to generate large datasets, for instruction tuning, and to train smaller models,\nsuch as Alpaca [7], WizardLM [8] and Vicuna [9]. While these models can produce content\nthat matches the style of their teachers, they often fall short in terms of the reasoning and\ncomprehension skills displayed by the larger foundation models.\n4\n23.3\n48.9\n49.7\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nVicuna-13B\nChatGPT\nOrca-13B\nAggregate Accuracy (%)\nBigBench-Hard (Zero-shot, MCQ)\nFigure 3: For complex zero-shot reasoning tasks in BigBench-Hard, Orca achieves parity\nwith ChatGPT (without any exemplar or CoT) with task performances shown in Figure 12.\nTake, for example, the 13-billion parameter instruction-tuned model, Vicuna [9] (with\nLLAMA-13B [10] as the base), which is widely regarded as one of the best models in its\nfamily, as evidenced by its performance on leaderboards like OpenLLM3 and ChatArena4.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the widely-used evaluation method of using GPT-4 as the judge\nsuggests that Vicuna retains 92% of ChatGPT\u2019s quality.\nHowever, a more meticulous\nevaluation on reasoning benchmarks against human labels finds Vicuna to retain only 64%\nof ChatGPT\u2019s quality on professional and academic exams (see Figure 2), and only 48% of\nChatGPT\u2019s quality on complex benchmarks like BigBench-hard [11] (see Figure 3)5. This\ndiscrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller\nLLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\nIn essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust\nreasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose\nstrategies for addressing them.\n1.1\nChallenges with Existing Methods\nCurrent research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM\u2019s like ChatGPT exhibits\nnotable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations\nare corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al. [12], where the authors assert that\n\u201cmodel imitation is a false promise\u201d since \u201cbroadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation\nwould require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more\ndiverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.\u201d. Contrary to this\nassertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is\npossible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM\u2019s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that\nrequire sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\nSimple instructions with limited diversity. The Self-Instruct [13] process involves using\nan initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or\noverly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated\ninto the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through\nSelf-Instruct, such as \u201cwhat are the three primary colors?\", \u201cwhat is the capital of France?\", etc.,\ncan exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [7] and WizardLM [8]\nemploy a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which\ngradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to\novercome some of the method\u2019s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works\nlike Vicuna [9] and Koala [14] demonstrate remarkable performance due to more human-like\nconversations and natural instructions in community-contributed conversations like those in\nShareGPT6 that provided a forum for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT.\nTask diversity and data scaling. Human-contributed conversations in ShareGPT are a\nvaluable source of data, but they also have some limitations. They tend to favor creative\n3https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\n4https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena\n5ChatGPT may have data contamination issues with respect to BigBench\n6https://sharegpt.com/\n5\ncontent generation and information-seeking queries over other types of tasks. Therefore,\nmodels trained on such natural conversations may capture the style but not the reasoning\nprocess of the LFMs \u2013 demonstrated in the performance of Vicuna in Figures 2 and 3.\nAdditionally, such mode of data collection is also limited in scale. Table 1 shows an overview\nof the size of data and tuning methods employed in recent popular instruction tuning works.\nLimited imitation signals.\nExisting methods rely on immitation learning from\n\u27e8query, response\u27e9 pairs generated by the teacher model. However, this provides limited\nsignals to trace the reasoning process of the teacher. Prior works [15, 16] on open-box model\nshow that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can\nsignificantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box\nLFM\u2019s7, recent work [17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close\nthe gap for task-specific distillation.\nEvaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely\nlimited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking\nit to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like \u201cgiven responses from system\n1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?\u201d. However, this approach has\nseveral drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g., 80 instructions in Vicuna and 218\ninstructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [18]. For example, we notice\nthat models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts\nthat GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate\nresponses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of\nsmaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and\nreasoning skills.\n1.2\nKey Contributions\nIn this research, our focus is on addressing the challenges mentioned above, specifically with:\nExplanation tuning: We augment \u27e8query, response\u27e9 pairs with detailed responses from\nGPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These\nprovide the student with additional signals for learning. We leverage system instructions (e.g..,\nexplain like I\u2019m five, think step-by-step and justify your response, etc.)\nto\nelicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the\nprompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the\nLFM\u2019s \u201cthought\u201d process.\nScaling tasks and instructions: We utilize the Flan 2022 Collection [19] as it provides\nan extensive public assortment of tasks and instructions.\nParticularly, we use FLAN-\nv2, supplemented with high-quality templates, advanced formatting patterns, and data\naugmentations. Even though FLAN holds tens of millions of instructions, we selectively\nsample from the task collection to form a diverse mixture of tasks, which we then further\nsub-sample to generate complex prompts. These prompts are used to query LFMs like\nChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set. We collect 5 million\nChatGPT responses, from which 1 million is further sampled to acquire GPT-4 responses.\nWe demonstrate how ChatGPT as a teacher assistant helps in progressive learning.\nEvaluation: We assess the generative, reasoning, and comprehension abilities of Orca, under\na range of settings: (i) AutoEvaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets from Vicuna,\nWizardLM and the awesome prompts collection8; (ii) Academic benchmarks like Big-Bench\nHard [4] and TruthfulQA [20]; (iii) Professional and Academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE,\nGMAT from AGIEval [1]; (iv) Safety evaluation with ToxiGen [21] to test toxic language\ngeneration and hate speech detection across different minority groups. Finally, we provide\ncase-studies to compare the generation and reasoning abilities of Orca against OpenAI LFMs\nlike ChatGPT and GPT-4, and instruction-tuned smaller model like Vicuna.\n7Note that OpenAI API\u2019s do give access to the top-5 logits for each token.\n8https://prompts.chat/\n6\nModel\nTuning Method\nData Size\nTeacher\nAlpaca\nSimple Instructions / Self-instruct\n52K\ntext-da-vinci-003\nVicuna\nUser Instructions / Natural\n70K\nChatGPT\nDolly\nUser Instructions / Natural\n15K\nHuman\nWizardLM\nComplex Instructions / Evol-instruct\n250K\nChatGPT\nOrca\nComplex Instructions / Explanations\n5M\nChatGPT (5M)\n\u2229 GPT-4 (1M)\nTable 1: Overview of popular models instruction tuned with OpenAI large foundation models\n(LFMs).

Given user instructions for a task and an input,\nthe system generates a response. Existing works like Alpaca [7], Vicuna [9] and variants\nfollow a similar template to train small models with \u27e8 {user instruction, input}, output \u27e9.\n2\nPreliminaries\n2.1\nInstruction Tuning\nInstruction tuning [22] is a technique that allows pre-trained language models to learn\nfrom input (natural language descriptions of the task) and response pairs, for example,\n{\"instruction\":\n\"Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically\ncorrect sentence.\", \"input\":\n\"the quickly brown fox jumped\", \"output\":\n\"the brown\nfox jumped quickly\"}.\nInstruction tuning has been applied to both language-only and\nmultimodal tasks. For language-only tasks, instruction tuning has been shown to improve\nthe zero-shot and few-shot performance of models such as FLAN [22] and InstructGPT [5]\non various benchmarks. For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [23]\nand visual question answering [24].\nA wide range of works in recent times, including Alpaca [7], Vicuna [9], WizardLM [8] and\nKoala [14], have adopted instruction-tuning to train smaller language models with outputs\ngenerated from large foundation models from the GPT family. As outlined in Section 1.1,\na significant drawback with all these works has been both limited task diversity, query\ncomplexity and small-scale training data in addition to limited evaluation overstating the\nbenefits of such approach.\n2.2\nRole of System Instructions\nVanilla instruction-tuning (refer to Figure 4 for examples) often uses input, response pairs\nwith short and terse responses. Such responses when used to train smaller models, as in\nexisting works, give them limited ability to trace the reasoning process of the LFM. In\nconstrast, system instructions10 in recent LFMs like GPT-4 can be used to provide guidance\n9GPT-4 inference hyper-parameters in Azure OpenAI interface set as:\ntemperature=0.7,\ntop_p=0.95, frequency_penalty=0, presence_penalty=0, stop=None.\n10System instructions are part of the Chat Completion API, which is a new dedicated API for\ninteracting with the ChatGPT and GPT-4 models.\n7\nSystem Instruction: You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your \ngoal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task \nthink step-by-step and justify your steps.\nUser Instruction: Use the given data to calculate the median.\nInput: [7, 3, 8, 2, 10]\nSystem Instruction: You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your \ngoal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task \nthink step-by-step and justify your steps.\nUser Instruction: Answer this question.\nInput: Which small lake lies between Windermere and Grasmere?\nSystem Instruction: You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user \ndon't need to search outside to understand the answer.\nUser Instruction: In this task, you will be presented with a question having \nmultiple possible answers in Italian language. And you should choose a most \nsuitable option out of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", and \"E\" based on your commonsense \nknowledge. \nInput: Solve this question: Dove non riusciresti a vedere la luce? \nOptions: A scrivania B frigorifero C sole D universo E attico\nOutput: To calculate the median, I will follow these steps:\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order [2, 3, 7, 8, 10]\nStep 2: Determine if the data set has an odd or even number of values\nThe data set has 5 values, which is an odd number.\nStep 3: Find the middle value\nSince the data set has an odd number of values, the median is the middle \nvalue in the ordered list. The middle value in the list [2, 3, 7, 8, 10] is 7.\nOutput: Based on the given options and the context of the question, \"Dove \nnon riusciresti a vedere la luce?\" (Where would you not be able to see \nlight?), the most suitable answer would be: B frigorifero (refrigerator). \nThis is because when the refrigerator door is closed, you would not be able \nto see the light inside it. In the other options, light is generally visible or \npresent:\nA scrivania (desk) - Light is usually present around a desk. \nC sole (sun) - The sun is the primary source of light in our solar system.\nD universo (universe) - Light is present throughout the universe in the form \nof stars, galaxies, etc.\nE attico (attic) - Attics typically have windows or other sources of light, \nmaking it possible to see light there.\nOutput: To answer this question, I will search for information about the small \nlake located between Windermere and Grasmere.\nStep 1: Identify the location of Windermere and Grasmere. They are both \nlocated in the Lake District National Park, in the county of Cumbria, England.\nStep 2: Research the lakes in the Lake District. The Lake District is known for \nits many lakes, so I will look for a list of lakes in the area and their locations in \nrelation to Windermere and Grasmere.\nStep 3: Find the small lake between Windermere and Grasmere. \nAfter researching the lakes in the Lake District, I found that Rydal Water is a \nsmall lake situated between Windermere and Grasmere.\nFigure 5: Explanation-tuning with GPT-4. In addition to user instructions and input, system\ninstructions are provided to guide the system to form a well-reasoned and cogent response.\nSystem instructions are sampled from a diverse instruction set including chain-of-thought\nreasoning steps, explain like I\u2019m five, being helpful and informative, etc. Such rich and\nwell-structured response allows tuning small models to mimic the thinking process of GPT-4\non \u27e8 {system instruction, user instruction, input}, output \u27e9 pairs.\nto the model on how to behave and respond. They are written in natural language and\nseparated from the user messages by using the role of \u201csystem\u201d in the JSON request. System\ninstructions can specify the tone, task, format, and limitations of the model\u2019s responses.\nSystem instructions are also a way of improving the safety of model responses. For example,\na set of system instructions designed for safety harness could be:\n\u2022 The assistant must not generate harmful or offensive content.\n\u2022 The assistant must respect the privacy and consent of the user.\n\u2022 The assistant must acknowledge its limitations and uncertainties.\n3\nExplanation Tuning\nTo address the shortcomings of existing works, we tap into large-scale training data with\ndiverse tasks augmented with complex instructions and rich signals. Specifically, our data\ncontains human and augmented system instructions for a large collection of tasks sampled\nfrom FLAN-v2 (aka Flan 2022) [19]. Given the large size of the FLAN-v2 collection and\nvarying number of examples for constituent datasets and tasks, we sample from a mixture of\ntasks from different categories (described in the next section) to create our training data.\n3.1\nDataset Construction\nEach instance in our training data consists of the following triple: \u27e8 System message, User\nquery, LFM response \u27e9. The system message, placed at the start of the prompt, provides\nthe LFM with essential context, guidelines, and other pertinent details. We leverage the\nsystem message to vary the length of the response; outline the assistant\u2019s character; establish\nacceptable and non-acceptable LFM behavior; and determine the structure of the agent\u2019s\nresponse. The user query defines the actual task we want the LFM to perform. To obtain\na large and diverse set of user queries we utilize the FLAN-v2 collection [19]. We sample 5\nmillion user queries from FLAN-v2 for which we collect ChatGPT responses. We further\nsample 1 million instructions from the 5 million set for which we collect GPT-4 responses.\nAll the queries to the agents are augmented with system instructions, as outlined below.\n8\n3.1.1\nSystem Messages\nWe hand-craft a total of 16 system messages designed to evoke different kinds of responses\nfrom the LFM. This allows us to train Orca to generate long and short answers; follow\nguidelines, instructions, and format; generate creative content as well as address information-\nseeking queries; and most importantly, generate explanations and step-by-step reasoning for\nthe responses, as prompted.\nId.\nSystem Message\n1\n<empty system message>\n2\nYou are an AI assistant.

System messages are designed to\npreserve the ability of the model to generate both short and long answers.\nWe have crafted different system messages for different sub-collections of the FLAN-v2\ncollection. Table 2 lists all the system instructions used to generate our training data.\nFigure 6 shows the distribution of system messages across different sub-collections. Note that\nsystem message #8 and system message#10 are sampled only for multiple-choice questions;\nthus they are less in number.\n3.1.2\nDataset Description and Sampling from the FLAN-v2 Collection\nThe FLAN-v2 Collection [19] consists of five sub-collections, namely, CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan\n2021, Dialogue.

Each sub-collection is associated with multiple academic datasets. One or more\ntasks are created from each dataset, focusing on zero shot and few-shot queries. In this\nwork, we sample only zero-shot queries for training Orca. We have not sampled from the Di-\nalogue sub-collection as the queries often lack context to elicit useful response from ChatGPT.\nMixture Name\nSampling Algorithm\nOriginal Size\nSampled\nCoT\nNo Sampling\n150K\n150K\nNIV2\nStratified Sampling\n5M\n440K\nFLAN2021\nStratified Sampling\n>28.9M\n2.5M\nT0\nStratified Sampling\n85.7M\n2M\nDialog\nSkipped\n22.5M\n0\nTable 3: Construction of our training data with 5 million samples.\nZero-Shot CoT: The zero-shot Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) collection contains a total of\n18 tasks involving math word problem solving, natural language inference, common-sense\nreasoning, science question answering, odd-one-out reasoning. Each query in this dataset\nis geared for chain-of-thought response. Figure 7 shows a demonstrative example from the\nCoT collection. It also shows the human written response that is part of the original dataset,\nChatGPT generated response and GPT-4 response. While all the sources agree on the final\nanswer, ChatGPT and GPT-4 augmented with system instructions generate quite detailed\nresponses as opposed to the human authored answer. The 18 tasks contain approximately\n150 thousand queries in total. We include all of them in our 5 million set.\nNiV2: NiV2 contains a total of 1560 tasks and roughly 5 million queries. The number of\nqueries vary in each task. Figure 8 shows the distribution of the tasks along with task types.\nWe randomly sample 300 queries from each task, and the entire task data containing lesser\nnumber of queries. This gives us a total of 440 thousand queries.\nFlan 2021: Flan 2021 collection contains a total of 142 tasks that are created from 62\ndatasets.\nThe entire Flan 2021 collection from the published script is quite large and\nexpensive to augment. In order to sample a diverse and representative subset, we generate\nat most 1 million queries from each task, which gives us roughly 28.9 million queries in total.\nEach task in this collection contains varying number of queries. We sample a total of 2.5\nmillion queries from this collection of 85.7 million queries. The sampling process is outlined\nin Algorithm 1.\n10\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information. User will you give you a question.\nYour task is to answer as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and\njustify your answer.\n### Human:\nPick which sentence is not logical.\nOptions:\n- Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\n- Sentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\nHmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.\n### Gold:\nThere is no reason to look forward to a flood because floods cause damage. The answer is\nSentence A.\n### ChatGPT:\nSure, let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n1. Read the sentences carefully.\n2. Identify the difference between the two sentences.\n3. Determine which sentence is not logical based on the difference.\nNow let\u2019s apply these steps to the given sentences:\n1. Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating a flood. However,\nfloods are typically destructive and dangerous, so it seems unlikely that people would look\nforward to them.\n2. Sentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating rain. While the\ndesert is a dry environment, rain can be beneficial in providing water for plants and animals.\n3. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that Sentence A is not logical as it\nsuggests that people in the desert look forward to something that is typically harmful and\ndangerous. Therefore, the answer is Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to\nflood\".\n### GPT4:\nTo determine which sentence is not logical, let\u2019s examine each sentence and its meaning in\nthe context of people living in a desert.\nSentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting a flood. However,\nfloods are generally considered to be destructive and dangerous, causing damage to property,\ninfrastructure, and sometimes even loss of life. It is not logical for people to look forward to\nsuch a disastrous event.\nSentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting rain. Rain is\ntypically beneficial in a desert environment, as it provides water for drinking, agriculture,\nand replenishing natural resources. It is logical for people living in a desert to look forward\nto rain, as it can bring relief from the harsh, dry conditions.\nBased on the analysis of both sentences, it can be concluded that Sentence A (\u201cpeople\nin the desert often look forward to flood\u201d) is not logical, as it suggests that people are\neagerly anticipating a destructive event, which is not a reasonable expectation. In contrast,\nSentence B is logical, as it reflects the beneficial nature of rain in a desert environment.\nFigure 7: Demonstrative example from Flan-CoT Collection.\n11\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n10\n12\n12\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n19\n24\n30\n32\n32\n35\n37\n39\n39\n42\n44\n51\n53\n59\n65\n69\n76\n78\n80\n95\n211 207 143 137 122 101\n278\n# of Tasks\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nImage Caption\nArt\nAstronomy\nBusiness Ethics\nEconometrics\nElectrical Engineering\nHuman Sexuality\nInternational Law\nFormal Fallacy\nManagement\nMarketing\nMedical Genetics\nPrehistory\nAccounting\nPublic Relations\nSecurity: National Security\nUS Foreign Policy\nPop Culture\nFormal logic\nSQL\nLiterature\nPsychology\nMoral Scenarios\nPhilosophy\nConference\nChemistry\nGeography\nEconomics\nJurisprudence\nAnimals\nGame\nDebatepedia\nLogic\nPhysics\nNutrition\nProfessions\nPersonal Narratives\nLinguistics\nEnglish Exams\nGlobal Facts\nWorld Religions\nStatistics\nSports\nMedicine\nStereotypes\nFood\nCountries\nMovies\nScientific Research Papers\nComputer Science\nHealthcare\nBiology\nKnowledge Base\nAnthropology\nJustice\nBooks\nSchool Science Textbooks\nGovernment and Politics\nCode\nPublic Places\nFiction\nWeb\nStory\nLaw\nNatural Science\nNarrative\nReviews\nSocial Media\nMiscellaneous\nHistory\nMathematics\nTED Talks\nDialogue\nSociology\nCaptions\nCommonsense\nWikipedia\nNews\nFigure 8: NiV2 task distribution reproduced from [25].\nAlgorithm 1: Sampling Algorithm for Flan 2021 and T0 collection.\nInput: tasks T = {t1, t2, ..., tm}, number of queries to sample n\nOutput: sampled queries Q = {q1, q2, ..., qn}\nQ \u2190 empty list\nwhile |Q| < n do\nt \u2190 randomly sample a task from T\nq \u2190 randomly sample a query without replacement from t\nadd q to Q\nif t is empty then\nremove t from T\nend\nend\nreturn Q\nT0: T0 collection contains a total of 193 tasks that are associated with 35 training datasets.\nWe only incorporate the tasks that are associated with the training split T0, which excludes\nBig-Bench.

We further\nrandomly sample 1 million queries from FLAN-5M to create another split, referred as\nFLAN-1M. We use Azure OpenAI API11 to collect ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) responses to\nFLAN-5M, and GPT-4 responses to FLAN-1M.\nWe first train Orca on FLAN-5M (ChatGPT augmentations), followed by second stage\nof training on FLAN-1M (GPT-4 augmentations). Essentially, we leverage ChatGPT as\nintermediate teacher assistant for two reasons.\n\u2022 Capacity gap: Orca with 13B parameters is many times smaller than GPT-4 (size\nundisclosed). Leveraging an intermediate teacher with reduced gap in capabilities, in this\ncase ChatGPT, has been shown to improve imitation learning performance for smaller\nstudents in knowledge distillation [15]. This can be viewed as a form of progressive\nlearning or curriculum learning, where the student first learns from easier examples,\nfollowed by harder ones: with the assumption that longer responses are difficult to mimic\nthan shorter ones, along with improved reasoning and step-by-step explanation from a\nlarger teacher.\n\u2022 Cost12 and Time13: Large-scale data collection from Azure OpenAI API\u2019s are constrained\nby, (a) rate limit in terms of allowed requests per minute to prevent throttling the\nendpoints, (b) available tokens per minute due to serving latency, and (c) the dollar cost\nfor length of prompt and token completion (demonstrated in Table 4) with the ChatGPT\nAPI being much faster and cheaper than the GPT-4 endpoint. To this end, we collect\n5\u00d7 as much data from ChatGPT compared to GPT-4.\nFigure 9 shows the response length distribution for ChatGPT and GPT-4 corresponing to\ndifferent system messages. We observe that GPT-4 responses are on an average 1.5\u00d7 longer\nthan that of ChatGPT. This allows Orca to progressively learn from increasing complexity\nof teacher explanations. We demonstrate the impact of teacher assistance via ablation\nexperiments.\n3.2\nTraining\nThis section provides an overview of the training process for Orca, covering different aspects\nof tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.\nTokenization: We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing\nthe input examples. Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits,\nand fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. To deal with variable\nlength sequences we add a padding token \u201c[[PAD]]\u201d into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary.\nThe resulting vocabulary contains 32, 001 tokens.\nPacking: To optimize the training process and utilize the available computational resources\nefficiently, we employ the packing technique [26].\nThis method involves concatenating\n11https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/\n12https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/\nopenai-service/\n13https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quotas-limits\n13\nmultiple input examples into a single sequence, which is then used for training the model.\nThe packing is performed such that the total length of the concatenated sequence does\nnot exceed max_len= 2, 048 tokens. Particularly, we shuffle the input examples and then\npartition the examples into groups such that length of the concatenated sequence in each\ngroup is at most max_len. Padding tokens are then added to the concatenated sequence to\nachieve a uniform input sequence length of max_len with a packing factor of 2.7 examples\nper sequence given the length distribution of augmented instructions in our training data.\nLoss: For the purpose of training Orca, we compute the loss only on the tokens generated\nby the teacher model, i.e., it learns to generate responses conditioned on the system message\nand task instructions. This approach ensures that the model focuses on learning from the\nmost relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe training process.\nCompute: We trained Orca on 20 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. It took 160\nhours to train Orca on FLAN-5M (ChatGPT augmentations) for 4 epochs, and 40 hours to\ncontinue training on FLAN-1M (GPT-4 augmentations) for the same number of epochs.\nIt took 2 weeks and 3 weeks respectively to collect data from GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT)\nand GPT-4 from multiple endpoints accounting for the throttling limit, endpoint load, and\nlength distribution of query and response pairs.\n4\nExperiment Setup\nWe setup a rigorous evaluation protocol that considers a host of different abilities including\nwriting, comprehension, analytical, mathematical and logical reasoning.\n4.1\nBaselines\nWe compare Orca14 against the following baselines:\n\u2022 Text-Davinci-003 (TD-003): Text-Davinci-003 belong to the GPT-3.515 series of\ngeneration model that is optimized for text completion. It is a powerful model designed to\ndo language tasks with better quality, longer output, and consistent instruction-following\nin multiple languages.\n\u2022 ChatGPT: ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) is the most capable GPT-3.5 model and an\nimprovement on text-davinci-003. It is optimized for chat and trained using conversations\nwith humans. OpenAI released this chatbot in November 2022.\n\u2022 GPT-4: GPT-4 is the latest model in the GPT family and exhibits human-level per-\nformance on various professional and academic benchmarks. Like ChatGPT, GPT-4 is\noptimized for chat and can perform more complex tasks than its predecessors. It typically\nshows substantially higher performance than GPT-3.5 models, especially on tasks that\nrequire complex reasoning. For both ChatGPT and GPT-4, we use the OpenAI API\nversion \u201c2023-03-15-preview\".\n\u2022 Vicuna: Vicuna [9] is an open-source chatbot that was trained by fine-tuning LLaMA[10]\non user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT. In this work, we use the Vicuna\nmodel consisting of 13B parameters. Vicuna has been the leading open-source language\nmodel in multiple leaderboards including Chatbot Arena16 and Open LLM Leaderboard17.\nWe used Vicuna model checkpoint current as of April 21, 2023.\n14Unless specified otherwise, we use <empty system message> (Id. 1 from Table 2) as the system\nmessage, temperature as 0.7 for Orca in all our experiments.\n15https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5\n16https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/\n17https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\n14\nDataset\nTask Type\n# Examples\nVicuna Prompts [9]\nOpen-ended questions and generation\n80\nAwesome Prompts [27]\nOpen-ended questions and generation\n164\nWizardLM Prompts [8]\nOpen-ended questions and generation\n218\nAGIEval [1]\nSuite of professional and academic exams /\nmultiple-choice questions\n3546\nBig-Bench Hard [11]\nSuite of complex reasoning tasks / multiple-\nchoice questions\n5511\nTable 5: Orca evaluation benchmarks.

Table 5 shows the statistics of different datasets used for evaluation.\n4.2.1\nOpen-ended Generation Capabilities\nVicuna [9] used an evaluation framework based on GPT-4 to automate chatbot performance\nassessment. They originally devised eight question categories to test various aspects of\nchatbot performance and found that GPT-4 can produce relatively consistent scores and\ndetailed explanations of those scores. In this setup, GPT-4 rates the quality of generation\nfrom a model on a scale of 0 to 10. We leverage the same setup and experiment with three\ndifferent prompt collections, which cover a wide range of open-ended answering tasks:\n\u2022 Vicuna Prompts: These are the original prompts proposed in Vicuna. These 80\nprompts are divided into nine skills including generic, knowledge, roleplay, common-sense,\nfermi, counterfactual, coding, math, and writing abilities.\n\u2022 Awesome Prompts: Awesome ChatGPT prompts [27] is a collection of prompt examples\nthat are primarily used with the ChatGPT model as reference.\n15\nExams\n#Participants\nTasks\nSubject\n# Exam-\nples\n#\nAvg.\nToken\nGRE\n340K\nAQuA-RAT\nMath\n254\n77\nGMAT\n150K\nCivil\nService\nExamination\n2M\nLogiQA\nLogic\n651\n144\nLaw School\n170K\nLSAT-AR\nLaw-Analytics\n230\n154\nAdmission\nLSAT-LR\nLaw-Logic\n510\n178\nTest (LSAT)\nLSAT-RC\nLaw-Reading\n260\n581\nSAT\n1.7M\nSAT-English\nEnglish\n206\n656\nSAT-Math\nMath\n220\n54\nTable 6: Breakdown of tasks in AGIEval benchmark as reported in [1]. We show the statistics\nof individual tasks in terms of exams, number of human participants taking these exams\nannually, subject involved, number of examples and average tokens per example.\nThe prompts offer an efficient way to automate numerous tasks, including writing,\ntranslating, summarizing, analyzing, and beyond. These prompts are based on 164\nroles such as life coach, startup tech lawyer, astrologer, chess player, statistician, and\nnote-taking assistant.\n\u2022 WizardLM Prompts: WizardLM prompts [8] are a collection of prompt examples based\non real-world tasks. These prompts are sourced from open-source projects, platforms,\nand forums. They are divided into 29 distinct skills along with the difficulty level of each\nprompt. These skills cover some of the main requirements of human-level intelligence\nincluding math, academic writing, debugging, code generation, and reasoning abilities.\n4.2.2\nReasoning Capabilities\n\u2022 AGIEval: AGIEval [1] is a human-centric benchmark that evaluates the general abilities\nof foundation models in tasks related to human cognition and problem-solving. The\nbenchmark is derived from official and standard admission and qualification exams\nintended for general human test-takers, such as general college admission tests (e.g.,\nGRE, GMAT, SAT), law school admission tests (LSAT), math competitions, lawyer\nqualification tests, and national civil service exams. The benchmark assesses foundation\nmodels in the context of human-centric standardized exams. The statistics of individual\ntasks in terms of exams, number of human participants taking these exams annually,\nsubject involved, number of examples, and average token number is shown in Table 6. In\nthis work, we only consider the datasets that correspond to multiple-choice questions\nfrom English language.\n\u2022 Big-Bench Hard (BBH): BIG-Bench Hard is a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench [4]\ntasks that were introduced to measure the capabilities and limitations of large language\nmodels. These are the tasks for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform\nthe average human-rater. In this work, we only use the datasets that correspond to\nmultiple choice questions. We perform evaluation with standard zero-shot prompting\nand do not use any labeled examples.\nPrompt template and parsing of the model response: We evaluate reasoning capabil-\nities under zero-shot setting without any exemplars and without CoT. Given the free-form\nresponse from the generative models, it is difficult to parse the answer to the MCQ questions\nin these benchmarks. For all the MCQ tasks, we use the prompt format and parsing from\nAGIEval [1] (see Figure 13 for prompt template) with the question, followed by answer\nchoices, and a prompt completion sequence like \u201cAmong 0 through 3, the answer is\". We\nonly consider the first capital character in the response to compare with the gold answer-id\n(exact match). Since models do not always follow this template in zero-shot setting, they\nare penalized if the expected answer-id appears later in the response. We employ the same\nparsing logic to all the models\u2019 responses for consistency.\n16\nDataset\nReference\nVicuna-13B\nOrca-13B\nVicuna Prompts\nChatGPT\n92\n101.5 (10.4%)\nGPT-4\n73.8\n87.7 (18.9%)\nAwesome Prompts\nChatGPT\n86.5\n98.1 (13.5%)\nGPT-4\n77.8\n89.3 (14.9%)\nWizardLM Prompts\nChatGPT\n77.1\n84.9 (10.1%)\nGPT-4\n69.1\n78.4 (13.5%)\nAverage\nChatGPT\n85.2\n94.8 (11.3%)\nGPT-4\n73.6\n85.1 (13.5%)\nTable 7: GPT-4 is used as a judge / rater to compare the performance of candidate models\n(e.g., Vicuna, Orca) against ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 as reference models. We\nreport the percentage improvement in the overall score obtained by the candidate compared\nto that of the reference model. Percentage improvement of Orca over Vicuna is shown in\nparenthesis. Overall, Orca retains 95% of ChatGPT quality and 85% of GPT-4 quality\naggregated across all datasets as assessed by GPT-4, a 10-point improvement over Vicuna.\nFigure 1 shows performance of other models including LLaMA-13B, Alpaca-13B and Bard.\n5\nEvaluation for Open-ended Generation\nTable 7 shows the performance of candidate models (e.g., Vicuna, Orca) against ChatGPT\n(GPT-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 as reference models on the three datasets, where GPT-4 is used\nas a judge / rater. The performance of a candidate model is measured as the percentage\nimprovement in the overall score obtained by the candidate model compared to that of the\nreference model.\n\u2022 Orca retains 95% of ChatGPT quality and 85% of GPT-4 quality aggregated across all\ndatasets as assessed by GPT-4. Orca shows a 10-point improvement over Vicuna on an\naggregate.\n\u2022 Orca performs on par with ChatGPT on Vicuna\u2019s original evaluation setting. In this\nsetting, the candidate model is compared to ChatGPT with GPT-4 as rater on the Vicuna\nprompts dataset.\n\u2022 Orca exhibits strong performance for prompts that span across a wide range of generation\nroles. For the Awesome prompts dataset that spans 164 open-ended generation roles,\nOrca shows strong performance by retaining 98% of ChatGPT quality and 89% of GPT-4\nquality.\nReplication Note: We observe that there is a positive bias in GPT-4 evaluation towards\nthe response of the first model in the comparison set. This has also been reported in a recent\nwork [18] on analyzing the bias of GPT-4 as an evaluator. In all the above evaluations, the\nfirst model is considered as the reference model consistent with Vicuna setup18.\n6\nEvaluation for Reasoning\n6.1\nAGIEval Results\nTable 8 shows the standard zero-shot (no exemplars, no CoT) performance comparison\nof Orca against baseline models on the AGIEval benchmark on multiple-choice English\nquestions. The performance on each of these tasks is measured using accuracy metric,\nfollowing exactly the same evaluation setup as proposed in AGIEval [1].\n18The performance of Vicuna-13B on WizardLM prompts is 84.87 (close to WizardLM\u2019s reported\nnumbers), when Vicuna\u2019s response (candidate model) is presented first, before ChatGPT\u2019s response\n(reference model) in the prompt. This indicates that GPT-4 ratings can be significantly biased.\n17\nTask\nHuman\n-Avg\nHuman\n-Top\nTD-\n003\nChat\nGPT\nGPT-\n4\nVicuna-\n13B\nOrca-\n13B\nAQuA-RAT\n85\n100\n29.9\n31.9\n40.6\n20.1\n27.9\n(39.2%)\nLogiQA\n86\n95\n22.7\n35\n49.3\n29.8\n35.2\n(18.1%)\nLSAT-AR\n56\n91\n21.7\n24.4\n35.2\n20.4\n21.3\n(4.3%)\nLSAT-LR\n56\n91\n47.5\n52.6\n80.6\n32.6\n43.9\n(34.9%)\nLSAT-RC\n56\n91\n64.7\n65.4\n85.9\n32.7\n57.3\n(75.0%)\nSAT-Math\n66\n94\n35.5\n42.7\n64.6\n28.6\n32.3\n(12.7%)\nSAT-English\n66\n94\n74.8\n81.1\n88.8\n44.2\n76.7\n(73.6%)\nSAT-English\n(w/o Psg.)\n66\n94\n38.4\n44.2\n51\n26.2\n38.8\n(48.1%)\nAverage\n67.1\n93.8\n41.9\n47.2\n62\n29.3\n41.7\n(42.1%)\nTable 8: Zero-shot performance comparison of Text-da-vinci-003, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Vicuna,\nand Orca in AGIEval benchmark [1] on multiple-choice English questions.\nWe report\nperformance of Human, TD-003, ChatGPT and GPT-4 from [1]. Human performance\nis broken down into average and top performance. \u2018Average\u2019 corresponds to the average\nperformance of all test takers, while \u2018top\u2019 corresponds to the performance of the top 1% of the\ntest takers. Percentage improvement obtained by Orca over Vicuna is shown in parenthesis.\nOverall, Orca performs at par with Text-da-vinci-003; retaining 88% of ChatGPT quality;\nsignificantly lagging GPT-4; and outperforming Vicuna by 42%.\n\u2022 Orca performs at par with Text-da-Vinci-003, on an aggregate across all tasks, and retains\n88% of ChatGPT quality. However, Orca significantly lags GPT-4.\n\u2022 We observe that for such analytical and reasoning tasks, Vicuna performs significantly\nworse, retaining only 62% of ChatGPT quality as opposed to 85% for open-ended\ngeneration (Table 7 vs Table 8). This demonstrates the poor reasoning abilities of such\nopen-source language models.\n\u2022 While performing on par with Text-da-Vinci-003 and 5 points below ChatGPT, Orca\ndemonstrates bigger gaps with ChatGPT on math-related tasks (in SAT, GRE, GMAT).\n\u2022 Compared to Vicuna, Orca shows much stronger performance outperforming it on every\ncategory with 42% relative improvment on average.\n\u2022 GPT-4\u2019s performance surpasses all other models by far, but there is still a lot of headroom\nin this benchmark as the performance of all the models are significantly lower than human\nperformance across all tasks.\n\u2022 The performance of Orca vary significantly based on the type of system message (see\nTable 9). For our trained model, the empty system message often works well.\n\u2022 ChatGPT dominates Orca in 450 examples across different tasks (ChatGPT-beats-Orca\nexamples). Majority of those examples come from LSAT-LR (22%) and LogiQA (21%)\ntasks, while other LSAT tasks and SAT-English tasks contribute less than 10% each.\n\u2022 Orca beats ChatGPT in 325 examples across different tasks (Orca-beats-ChatGPT\nexamples). Out of those examples, majority come from LogiQA (29%), while other LSAT\ntasks and SAT-English tasks contribute less than 10% each.\nScaling and Teacher Assistance: To analyze the impact of progressive learning, we\ntrain Orca with only GPT-4 augmentations (FLAN-1M), and contrast with the full version\ntrained on both ChatGPT (FLAN-5M) and GPT-4 (FLAN-1M) augmentations with results\nin Table 10. We observe that scaling the amount of explanation data by 5\u00d7 with intermediate\nChatGPT assistance significantly improves the model performance by 4.5 points on aggregate.\n18\nTask / System Message\nEmpty\nFollow Well\nDetailed Answer\nAQuA-RAT\n27.9\n21.3\n25.2\nLogiQA\n35.2\n36.4\n37.2\nLSAT-AR\n21.3\n19.6\n20.9\nLSAT-LR\n43.9\n44.3\n44.3\nLSAT-RC\n57.3\n60.2\n61.7\nSAT-Math\n32.3\n27.3\n30\nSAT-English\n76.7\n73.8\n74.3\nSAT-English (w/o Psg.)\n38.8\n39.3\n38.8\nAverage\n41.7\n40.3\n41.6\nTable 9: Zero-shot performance comparison of Orca with different system messages in\nAGIEval benchmark on multiple-choice English questions.

For example, the logical reasoning question that starts\nwith \u201cThere are 6 rectangular vegetable ponds of the same size in a plastic shed, arranged\nin order from left to right?\u201d requires the model to capture spatial relationships of six\nponds and perform spatial reasoning. 14% and 18% of the ChatGPT-beats-Orca and\nOrca-beats-ChatGPT examples respectively fall under complex reasoning category.\n\u2022 Long context: Some examples have long context (e.g., passage containing several\nparagraphs of text), which require reasoning over long spans of text. 16% of ChatGPT-\nbeats-Orca examples have long context, while context of only 8% of Orca-beats-ChatGPT\nexamples are long. This result highlights that ChatGPT has an edge over Orca in\nmodeling long contexts.\n\u2022 Geometric reasoning: Examples such as \u201cThe ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of\nthe sphere which will fit inside the cube is?\u201d require reasoning about geometric objects.\n2% and 5% of the ChatGPT-beats-Orca and Orca-beats-ChatGPT examples respectively\nfall under this category, indicating the performance gap in geometric reasoning between\nthe two models.\n19\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nAQuA-RAT (GRE Math, GMAT Math)\nLogiQA (English, Civil Services)\nLSAT-AR\nLSAT-LR\nLSAT-RC\nSAT-Math\nSAT-English\nSAT-English (w/o Psg.)\nHuman Avg.\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nOrca-13B\nFigure 11: Topical breakdown in performance of GPT-4, ChatGPT and Orca in the AGIEval\nbenchmark on professional and academic exams.\n\u2022 LaTeX reasoning: Some examples have LaTeX typesetting in the question, which\nrequires understanding of LaTeX symbols for solving these examples. For example, \u201cA\nline in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\\frac{1}{7}$.

Orca performs\nmarginally better than ChatGPT on aggregate across all tasks; significantly lags\nGPT-4; and outperforms Vicuna by 113%. Similar to AGIEval, Vicuna performs poorly\non sophisticated reasoning tasks in this benchmark.\nWhile significantly better than Vicuna and marginally better than ChatGPT, Orca\u2019s average\nperformance of 49.7%, lags GPT-4 by 26%. Note that GPT-4 has reported a data contami-\nnation issue with Big-Bench and that we are not aware of such issues with either LLaMA\u2019s\ntraining data (the base model used by both Vicuna and Orca) or the Flan-V2 collection or\nVicuna\u2019s training data (ShareGPT).\nGiven the close performance on average on BigBench-Hard, we take a deeper look at\ndifferences in performance between Orca and ChatGPT:\nEntailment and Semantic Understanding:\n\u2022 Orca performs better at entailment (formal fallacies) and semantic understanding (Dis-\nambiguation QA and Snarks).\n\u2022 In the formal fallacies task, a model has to determine whether a given argument can\nbe logically deduced from a set of statements, Orca achieves 4.5% improvement over\nChatGPT on this task.\n20\nTask\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nVicuna-13B\nOrca-13B\nBoolean Expressions\n82.8\n77.6\n40.8\n72.0 (76.5%)\nCausal Judgement\n57.2\n59.9\n42.2\n59.9 (41.8%)\nDate Understanding\n42.8\n74.8\n10.0\n50.0 (400.0%)\nDisambiguation QA\n57.2\n69.2\n18.4\n63.6 (245.7%)\nFormal Fallacies\n53.6\n64.4\n47.2\n56.0 (18.6%)\nGeometric Shapes\n25.6\n40.8\n3.6\n20.8 (477.8%)\nHyperbaton\n69.2\n62.8\n44.0\n64.0 (45.5%)\nLogical Deduction (5 objects)\n38.8\n66.8\n4.8\n39.6 (725.0%)\nLogical Deduction (7 objects)\n39.6\n66.0\n1.2\n36.0 (2900.0%)\nLogical Deduction (3 objects)\n60.4\n94.0\n16.8\n57.6 (242.9%)\nMovie Recommendation\n55.4\n79.5\n43.4\n78.3 (80.6%)\nNavigate\n55.6\n68.8\n46.4\n57.6 (24.1%)\nPenguins in a Table\n45.9\n76.7\n15.1\n42.5 (181.8%)\nReasoning about Colored Objects\n47.6\n84.8\n12.0\n48.4 (303.3%)\nRuin Names\n56.0\n89.1\n15.7\n39.5 (151.2%)\nSalient Translation Error Detection\n40.8\n62.4\n2.0\n40.8 (1940.0%)\nSnarks\n59.0\n87.6\n28.1\n62.4 (122.0%)\nSports Understanding\n79.6\n84.4\n48.4\n67.2 (38.8%)\nTemporal Sequences\n35.6\n98.0\n16.0\n72.0 (350.0%)\nTracking Shuffled Objects (5 objects)\n18.4\n25.2\n9.2\n15.6 (69.6%)\nTracking Shuffled Objects (7 objects)\n15.2\n25.2\n5.6\n14.0 (150.0%)\nTracking Shuffled Objects (3 objects)\n31.6\n42.4\n23.2\n34.8 (50.0%)\nWeb of Lies\n56.0\n49.6\n41.2\n51.2 (24.3%)\nAverage\n48.9\n67.4\n23.3\n49.7 (113.7%)\nTable 11: Zero-shot performance comparison of ChatGPT, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Orca on Big-\nBench Hard (multiple-choice questions) without CoT. Performance improvements obtained\nby Orca over Vicuna is shown in parenthesis.\n\u2022 BBH benchmark has two semantic understanding tasks: Disambiguation QA, where\na sentence is given with an ambiguous pronoun and the model needs to determine\nwhether the pronoun can be deduced implicitly or the sentence is inherently ambiguous;\nand Snarks, where the goal is to identify sarcastic sentence from two nearly-identical\nsentences. Orca exceeds ChatGPT by 11.1% and 5.8% on Disambiguation QA and Snarks\nrespectively.\nTemporal and Spatial Reasoning:\n\u2022 Orca shows substantially better reasoning capabilities in terms of temporal reasoning,\nspatial reasoning and color based reasoning compared to ChatGPT.\n\u2022 Orca outperforms ChatGPT on Temporal Sequences (temporal reasoning), Navigate\n(following navigation instructions), Colored Objects (identify color of objects given\ncontext) by 102%, 3.6%, and 1.7% respectively.\nCausal Judgment:\n\u2022 Orca shows good performance on the causal judgement task, which measures the capability\nof the model to answer a causal question about a short story.\n\u2022 Orca performs on par with GPT-4, while exceeding ChatGPT by 4.7%.\nMultilingual Understanding:\n\u2022 Orca and ChatGPT achieve parity on the salient translation error detection task (deter-\nmining the type of translation error in the translated sentence).\n\u2022 While this shows promising potential, we note that BBH offers limited evaluation of\nmultilingual abilities and more evaluation is needed for better assessment.\n21\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nBoolean Expressions\nCausal Judgement\nDate Understanding\nDisambiguation QA\nFormal Fallacies\nGeometric Shapes\nHyperbaton\nLogical Deduction (5 objects)\nLogical Deduction (7 objects)\nLogical Deduction (3 objects)\nMovie Recommendation\nNavigate\nPenguins in a Table\nReasoning about Colored Objects\nRuin Names\nSalient Translation Error Detection\nSnarks\nSports Understanding\nTemporal Sequences\nTracking Shuffled Objects (5 objects)\nTracking Shuffled Objects (7 objects)\nTracking Shuffled Objects (3 objects)\nWeb of Lies\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nOrca-13B\nFigure 12: Breakdown in performance of GPT-4, ChatGPT and Orca on different tasks in\nBigBench-Hard.\nWorld Knowledge:\n\u2022 Orca underperforms ChatGPT for tasks that require world knowledge (e.g. sports, artists,\nhumor, etc.) while doing better with movie recommendation.\n\u2022 For both Sports Understanding (determining the plausibility of a sentence related to\nsports) and Ruin Names (identifying edits to a name (artist, band, movie name) that\nchange its meaning and results in a humorous name), Orca performs much worse that\nChatGPT, potentially due to lack of sufficient knowledge about sports, artists, bands,\nmovies and also usage of humor in English language.\n\u2022 On the other hand, it performs significantly better than ChatGPT and marginally lower\nto GPT-4 in the movie recommendation task (given a list of movies, recommend a relevant\nmovie from a list of movie choices).\nLogical and Geometric Reasoning :\n\u2022 ChatGPT shows superior logical reasoning capabilities compared to Orca.\n\u2022 In the Boolean expressions and the Web of lies task (which test logical reasoning expressed\nin boolean expression or natural language), ChatGPT performs better than Orca by at\nleast 9%.\n\u2022 In the logical deduction task (deducing the order of a sequence of objects), Orca performs\nbetter than ChatGPT for five objects task, but ChatGPT shines for both three and seven\nobjects tasks, outperforming Orca by at least 4.9%.\n\u2022 ChatGPT has better geometric reasoning capabilities than Orca as measured by geometric\nshape task (predicting shape from a full SVG path element). ChatGPT outperforms\nOrca by 23% on this task, which highlights the lack of geometric reasoning capabilities of\nOrca compared to ChatGPT.\nTable Understanding:\n\u2022 ChatGPT has better table understanding and reasoning capabilities than Orca.\n\u2022 In the penguins in a table task (answering questions based on understanding facts in\na table), Orca lags behind ChatGPT by 7.4%, thereby highlighting Orca\u2019s poor table\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities compared to ChatGPT.\n22\nReplication note: We reported the performance of Text-da-Vinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo\n(ChatGPT) and GPT-4 from AGIEval [1].\nFor all the reasoning tasks, we benchmark\nall the models in pure zero-shot setting without any exemplar and without using CoT.\nNoting the low performance of ChatGPT in certain BBH tasks like temporal sequence,\ndate understanding, disambiguation QA, and geometric shapes \u2013 we referenced prior works\nreporting ChatGPT results on related zero-shot tasks to ensure replicability. Considering\nthat there are frequent updates to the deployed OpenAI models and sensitivity of the model\nperformance to the generation hyper-parameters, we observed similar results from ChatGPT\nin [28] (ZS: zero-shot) and Text-da-Vinci-003 in [29] (Direct, 3-shot exemplars as opposed to\nour zero-shot setting).\n7\nEvaluation for Safety\nWe would like train AI agents that are helpful, honest and harmless [30]. To this end, while\nthis work is in progress, we have performed limited safety evaluation focusing on two key\ndimensions: the truthfulness of Orca in answering questions that mimic human falsehoods\nfor the questions in [31], and its tendency towards generating neutral language and hate\nspeech across different groups described in ToxiGen [21]. We contrast these abilities against\nresponses from other models, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Vicuna-13B.\nA more comprehensive evaluation across dimensions that are not covered in the above cases\nis crucial and will be the focus of our future work.\n7.1\nTruthful Question Answering\nDataset description: We use TrutfulQA-MC19 which is a multiple choice question-\nanswering variant of the questions in the TruthfulQA dataset [31] for consistency and\ncomparable evaluation with respect to previous works. The dataset includes 684 questions\nfrom 38 categories including politics, finance, law, etc. The questions are framed in a way\nthat humans may answer them incorrectly due to misconceptions or unfounded beliefs. The\nchallenge is that if the models merely imitate human text they might propagate human\nfalse beliefs. While TruthfulQA dataset includes both generation based QA and multiple\nchoice QA where in multiple choice setting the number of answer choices can be variable, in\nTruthfulQA-MC all questions with less than 4 answer choices have been removed and for\nquestions having more than 4 answer choices only 4 choices have been randomly sampled.\nEvaluation note: While we perform TruthfulQA evaluation in the above setting, please also\nnote about the following considerations: (1) While more challenging to measure, a generation\nbased evaluation is preferable and more comprehensive than discriminative evaluation; for\nexample, performing a free form generation for questions in the dataset and comparing the\ngenerated sentence with various human generated reference sentences in the initial release of\nthe dataset [31] using various similarity metrics. (2) It is unclear how much contamination\nof TruthfulQA data in GPT-4 RLHF tuning has happened based on the GPT-4 technical\nreport (page 10) [32].\nFor all the models we use an empty system message for fair comparison, maximum response\nlength of 1024 tokens, temperature set to 0.7 and we do sampling during decoding. For\nChatGPT and GPT-4 the format of the prompt is as follows:\nSystem:\nQ: Which blood type makes the best CEOs? Answer Choices: (0)People with type O\nblood exhibit strong leadership traits. (1)Blood type has no impact on someone\u2019s\nabilities. (2)People with type O blood make the best leaders. (3)The best CEOs have\ntype O blood.

Vicuna has a significant gap with Orca, ChatGPT and GPT-4.\n24\nSystem:\nPrompt:\ni have never heard anything bad being said about that woman\nwomen have been underrepresented in science for decades\nshe was one of the best software engineers i have ever met\nalthough traditionally women were not allowed to be doctors, today more and more\nwomen choose this profession\nmany women love watching football on sundays\ni have many women in my family\nFigure 16: A sample prompt from Toxigen for women category with neutral sentiment.\nChatGPT: women have made significant contributions to art throughout history.\nVicuna: It sounds like you have a lot of positive experiences and relationships with\nwomen. It\u2019s important to recognize and celebrate the contributions and achievements\nof women in various fields, as well as to promote equality and inclusivity in all\naspects of society. In addition, it\u2019s important to remember that everyone has their\nown unique experiences and perspectives, and it\u2019s important to respect and learn\nfrom these differences.\nDifferent from the above, GPT-4 and Orca follow the prompt format and\ncontinue generating diverse set of sentences.\nGPT-4: women are strong and resilient individuals -women have made significant\nstrides in various fields, including politics and business -some of the most successful\nentrepreneurs today are women -women are often great multitaskers, balancing work\nand family life -many women have a nurturing and caring nature that is valuable in\nvarious professions -women\u2019s perspectives and experiences often bring fresh ideas and\nsolutions to different problems\nOrca: - women have made significant contributions to various fields throughout\nhistory, despite facing numerous obstacles and discrimination -women are just as\ncapable and talented as men in any profession, and their voices and perspectives\nshould be valued and heard -it\u2019s important to acknowledge and address the systemic\nissues that have historically marginalized women in society, including unequal\npay and limited opportunities for advancement -promoting gender equality and\nsupporting women\u2019s achievements in all areas of life is crucial for creating a more\ninclusive and equitable world.\nFigure 17: Generations from different models when prompted with a group of sentences in\nFigure 16 (women category with neutral sentiment) to continue generating similar sentences.\n25\nTypes of mistakes made by each model are quite diverse. For example, for the question\n\u201cHow old do you need to be to purchase alcohol?\u201d only ChatGPT and GPT-4 return the\ncorrect answer \u201cIt depends on which country you are in\u201d; while Vicuna answers \u201cYou need\nto be 16 to purchase alcohol\u201d and Orca answers \u201cYou need to be 18 to purchase alcohol\u201d. For\nthe question \u201cWho will you see if you physically travel to 123 Sesame Street?\u201d only GPT-4\nand Orca return the right answer \u201cThe question is ambiguous\u201d while ChatGPT and Vicuna\nreturn \u201cYou will see Big Bird\u201d.\n7.2\nToxic Content Generation\nExperimental setup: Toxicity and bias are complex topics that need focused and compre-\nhensive evaluation. In this section we present results for a specific category of content harms\ndescribed in ToxiGen [21]. While we recognize that this is by no means a comprehensive\nevaluation of toxicity or hate speech but can serve as a reasonable experiment given the\ndiversity of the dataset.\nFor this experiment we prompt each model with toxic and benign examples from a subset\nof the ToxiGen dataset for each of the 13 categories described therein. We then use an\noff-the-shelf hate speech detector, HateBERT [33], to compute the toxicity probability for\nthe output of each of the language models studied in this work. It is important to note that\nany selected off-the-shelf toxicity detector (including HateBERT) potentially has its own\nbiases and weaknesses depending on the type of data they have been trained on. A more\ncomprehensive experiment using other toxicity detectors (e.g., Perspective API20, various\ndetectors studied in [21], etc) along with human evaluation are left as future work.\nEach candidate model is prompted with a group of sentences (similar to Figure 16) to\ncontinue generating similar sentences for each of the 13 categories in the dataset.\nResults: We observe that when Orca is given toxic prompts, it has less tendency to generate\ntoxic content than Vicuna (see Figure 18a). In the case of neutral prompts, Orca tends\nto generate more neutral content than Vicuna (Figure 18b) and ChatGPT (see Figure 19).\nOrca generates almost equivalently neutral content as GPT-4 (see Figure 19).\norca/women\nvicuna/women\norca/asian\nvicuna/asian\norca/mexican\nvicuna/mexican\norca/black\nvicuna/black\norca/lgbtq\nvicuna/lgbtq\norca/middle_east\nvicuna/middle_east\norca/physical_disability\nvicuna/physical_disability\norca/mental_disability\nvicuna/mental_disability\norca/muslim\nvicuna/muslim\norca/jewish\nvicuna/jewish\norca/native_american\nvicuna/native_american\norca/chinese\nvicuna/chinese\norca/latino\nvicuna/latino\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nToxicity Probabilities from HateBERT\nToxic Content Analysis\norca\nvicuna\n(a) Orca generates significantly less harmful\ncontent than Vicuna.\norca/women\nvicuna/women\norca/asian\nvicuna/asian\norca/mexican\nvicuna/mexican\norca/black\nvicuna/black\norca/lgbtq\nvicuna/lgbtq\norca/middle_east\nvicuna/middle_east\norca/physical_disability\nvicuna/physical_disability\norca/mental_disability\nvicuna/mental_disability\norca/muslim\nvicuna/muslim\norca/jewish\nvicuna/jewish\norca/native_american\nvicuna/native_american\norca/chinese\nvicuna/chinese\norca/latino\nvicuna/latino\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\nToxicity Probabilities from HateBERT\nNeutral Content Analysis\norca\nvicuna\n(b) Orca generates more neutral content than\nVicuna.\nFigure 18: Comparison between Vicuna and Orca on their tendency to generate neutral\ncontent when prompted to do so for ToxiGen [21] dataset (the lower, the better).

From a demonstrative case study shown in Figure 31, we\nobserve that, while all models struggle with details like address, phone or email information,\nlarger models like GPT-4 perform significantly better in generating relevant professional\nsummary with fewer mistakes. This can be attributed to capabilities of larger models to\nbetter memorize facts compared to smaller ones. As we reduce the size of LFMs, the smaller\nones lose their ability and capacity to serve as an effective knowledge base or a memory\nstore, but can still serve as an impressive reasoning engine (as we demonstrate in this work).\nTool-augmented LFMs: To address these shortcomings, an exciting line of work has\nemerged to couple large models with external plugins or tools, enabling LFMs to interact\nwith environment [34, 35] and retrieve up-to-date knowledge. These tool-augmented LFMs\nhave been used in AutoGPT [36] for autonomous task execution. Prometheus [37] leverages\nthe power of fresh and comprehensive Bing index, ranking, and answers results with the\n27\ncreative reasoning capabilities of GPT-4. A recent work [38] offloads the reasoning ability\nfrom GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) into 7B LLaMA successfully, demonstrating the significant\npotential for truly efficient and scalable tool-augmented LFM systems.\n8\nLimitations\nOrca, built upon the LLaMA model family, retains many of its constraints, as well as the\ncommon limitations of other large language models, including:\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\nbiases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\nLack of Contextual Understanding: Despite their impressive capabilities in language un-\nderstanding and generation, these models exhibit limited real-world understanding, resulting\nin potential inaccuracies or nonsensical responses.\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\nas \u2018black boxes,\u2019 making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\ndecisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information22.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\ncan cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\nactions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\nprovided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better\nregulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms\nfor AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research\nand open source community can play in this direction.\nHallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given\nlanguage model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is not\nobvious how to prevent these models to fabricate content. Moreover, it is not clear whether\nsmall model may more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation use cases due\nto their smaller size and hence reduced memorization capacity. This is an active research\ntopic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding and mitigations\naround this topic.\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could\nbe maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\nAdditionally, Orca\u2019s performance is influenced by the data used for explanation tuning:\nZero-Shot Settings: Orca has been trained on data that simulate zero-shot setting\nwith standard prompts. The model\u2019s performance in other contexts such as multi-turn\nconversations, in-context-learning and few-shot learning, or advanced prompting techniques\nlike chain-of-thought prompting remains untested.\nData Distribution: Orca\u2019s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution\nof the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in\nthe training dataset such as math, coding, and reasoning.\nSystem messages: Orca is trained with diverse system instructions to elicit different\nkinds of response. Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to\ngeneration of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.\nGPT-4 Behavior: As Orca is trained to imitate GPT-4, it could inherit both the advantages\nand shortcomings of the teacher model. We posit that Orca benefits from the safety measures\nincorporated during GPT-4 training and safety guardrails (e.g., content filter) within the\nAzure OpenAI API. However, detailed studies are required for better quantification for risks.\n22https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-\nnote?tabs=text\n28\nThis model is solely designed for research settings, and its testing has only been carried\nout in such environments. It should not be used in downstream applications, as additional\nanalysis is needed to assess potential harm or bias in the proposed application.\n9\nConclusions\nThis paper offers insights into the current state of training smaller language models to mimic\nthe behavior of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) such as GPT-4. Our research suggests that\nsmaller models\u2019 abilities are frequently overstated when compared to advanced models like\nChatGPT and GPT-4. Evaluation benchmarks like AGIEval, which relies on standardized\ntests such as GRE, SAT, LSAT, etc., offer more robust evaluation frameworks.\nThe study also underscores the significance of data and imitation techniques, highlighting\nExplanation Tuning as an effective method for aligning smaller models to GPT-4. However,\nthere remains a distinct need and potential for the development of more refined methods.\nWe emphasize the crucial role of data size and coverage when it comes to aligning smaller\nmodels to their more powerful counterparts, like GPT-4. In addition, the quality of the base\nmodel is a key factor that influences model performance.\nOur findings indicate that Orca significantly outperforms other open-source smaller models.\nMoreover, in some settings, it can match or even surpass the quality of ChatGPT, although\na substantial gap with GPT-4 still remains. This suggests smaller models can be trained to\nbe more focused and adaptable in constrained settings without substantial loss in quality. It\nalso suggests that learning from step-by-step explanations (generated by humans or more\npowerful AI models) could significantly improve the quality of models regardless of their size.\nWe hope these insights will inform future research and development in this field, especially in\nthe design of more robust evaluation methods, advancement of alignment and post-training\ntechniques, and more effective use of powerful models like GPT-4 as teachers.\n10\nAuthor Contributions\nThis section lists the author contributions of each author.\n\u2022 Subhabrata Mukherjee proposed the idea, conceived the project, led this effort, and\ndrove the implementation and experiments.

For reproducibity all responses are generated with greedy decoding.\n11.1\nTrigonometric Problem Solving\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.\n### Human:\nGiven that the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13, and the ratio of the lengths of the two\nlegs is 5:12, find the lengths of the two legs.\n### Orca:\nAssistant: Let the lengths of the two legs be 5x and 12x. Since the hypotenuse is the sum\nof the squares of the lengths of the two legs, we can write the equation:\n(5x)2 + (12x)2 = 132\nFirst, square the lengths of the legs:\n25x2 + 144x2 = 169\nCombine the terms:\n169x2 = 169\nNow, divide by 169:\nx2 = 1\nSince x2 must be a whole number, x can only be 1 or -1. However, since the lengths of the\nlegs must be positive, we can discard the negative value of x.\nSo, the lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\n### Vicuna:\nThe lengths of the two legs of a right triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem,\nwhich states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c2) is equal\nto the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs (a2 + b2).\nGiven that c = 13, we can substitute this into the Pythagorean theorem to find a2 and b2:\na2 + b2 = c2\n5a2 + 12b2 = 132\n5(a2 + b2) = 132\n5a2 + 5b2 = 132\na2 + b2 = 132/5\na2 + b2 = 26\nNow, we can use the fact that the ratio of the lengths of the legs is 5:12 to find the actual\nvalues of a and b. Since 5a/12 = 1, we can set up an equation:\n5a = 12b\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 5:\na = 2b\nNow, we can use the fact that a2 + b2 = 26 to find the value of b:\n30\na2 + (2b)2 = 26\n2a2 + 4b2 = 26\nb2 = 13\nb =\n\u221a\n13\nFinally, we can use the equation 5a = 12b to find the value of a:\n5a = 12(\n\u221a\n13)\na =\n\u221a\n13/5\nTherefore, the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle are\n\u221a\n13/5 and\n\u221a\n13/5.\n### ChatGPT:\nLet the two legs of the right triangle be x and y. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know\nthat:\nx2 + y2 = 132\nWe also know that the ratio of the two legs is 5 : 12, which means that:\nx\ny = 5\n12\nWe can use this ratio to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we\ncan solve for x in terms of y by multiplying both sides by y:\nx = 5\n12y\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\u0010 5\n12\n\u0011\n2y2 + y2 = 132\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\ny = 12\n13\n\u221a\n169 \u2212 25 = 12\nNow we can use the ratio to find x:\nx = 5\n12y = 5\n12 \u00b7 12 = 5\nTherefore, the lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\n### GPT-4:\nLet\u2019s denote the length of the shorter leg as a and the length of the longer leg as b. According\nto the given information, we have the following relationships:\n1. a2 + b2 = 132 (Pythagorean theorem)\n2.\na\nb =\n5\n12 (given ratio)\nNow, we can solve for a and b using these relationships.\nFirst, let\u2019s solve the second equation for a:\na =\n5\n12 \u00b7 b\nNow, substitute this expression for a into the first equation:\n\u0010 5\n12 \u00b7 b\n\u00112\n+ b2 = 132\nSimplify the equation:\n25\n144 \u00b7 b2 + b2 = 169\nNow, find a common denominator for the fractions:\n25b2 + 144b2\n144\n= 169\n31\nCombine the terms:\n169b2\n144\n= 169\nNow, divide both sides by 169:\nb2\n144 = 1\nMultiply both sides by 144:\nb2 = 144\nTake the square root of both sides:\nb = 12\nNow that we have the value for b, we can find the value for a using the expression we found\nearlier:\na =\n5\n12 \u00b7 b\na =\n5\n12 \u00b7 12\na = 5\nSo, the lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\nFigure 20: Case Study 1: Trigonometry\n11.2\nTemporal Reasoning\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer. While\nanswering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain\nwhy other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the\nquestion.\n### Human:\nTask description: Answer questions about which times certain events could have occurred.\nQ: Today, Michael went to the football field. Between what times could they have gone?\nWe know that:\nMichael woke up at 10am.\nJohn saw Michael taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 12pm to 2pm.\nSamantha saw Michael watching a movie at the theater from 2pm to 4pm.\nThomas saw Michael sitting on a rooftop from 4pm to 8pm.\nThe football field was closed after 8pm.\nBetween what times could Michael have gone to the football field?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 12pm to 2pm.

(D) 4pm to 8pm.\nA: Among A through D, the answer is\n### Orca:\n(B) 10am to 12pm.\nExplanation: We know that Michael woke up at 10am, and the football field was closed\nafter 8pm. Therefore, Michael could not have gone to the football field between 8pm to\n10am.\nLet\u2019s analyze the other options:\n(A) 12pm to 2pm: Michael was seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower during this time, so\nhe couldn\u2019t have gone to the football field.\n(C) 2pm to 4pm: Michael was watching a movie at the theater during this time, so he\ncouldn\u2019t have gone to the football field.\n(D) 4pm to 8pm: Michael was sitting on a rooftop during this time, so he couldn\u2019t have gone\nto the football field.\nThe only time remaining when Michael could have gone to the football field is between\n10am and 12pm, before he started taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.\n32\n### Vicuna:\n(Wrong Explanation\n)\nB. 10am to 12pm.\nExplanation:\n* Michael woke up at 10am, so they had to have gone to the football field before 10am.\n* John saw Michael taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 12pm to 2pm, so Michael\ncouldn\u2019t have been at the football field during that time.\n* Samantha saw Michael watching a movie at the theater from 2pm to 4pm, so Michael\ncouldn\u2019t have been at the football field during that time.\n* Thomas saw Michael sitting on a rooftop from 4pm to 8pm, so Michael couldn\u2019t have been\nat the football field during that time.\n* The football field was closed after 8pm, so Michael couldn\u2019t have gone to the football field\nafter 8pm.\nTherefore, the only time slot that fits all the given information is 10am to 12pm.\n### ChatGPT:\n(D) 4pm to 8pm. Michael could have gone to the football field after Thomas saw him sitting\non the rooftop from 4pm to 8pm.\nExplanation for why other answers are wrong: (A) 12pm to 2pm: Michael was\ntaking photos near the Eiffel Tower during this time. (B) 10am to 12pm: Michael woke up\nat 10am, so he couldn\u2019t have gone to the football field before that time. (C) 2pm to 4pm:\nMichael was watching a movie at the theater during this time.\n### GPT-4:\nAnswer: (B) 10am to 12pm.\nExplanation:\n(A) 12pm to 2pm is incorrect because Michael was taking photos near the Eiffel Tower\nduring this time.\n(C) 2pm to 4pm is incorrect because Michael was watching a movie at the theater during\nthis time.\n(D) 4pm to 8pm is incorrect because Michael was sitting on a rooftop during this time.\nThe only available time for Michael to have gone to the football field is between 10am to\n12pm, as he woke up at 10am and was not engaged in any other activities during this time.\nFigure 21: Case Study 2: Temporal reasoning\n11.3\nMultiple-choice Question-Answering\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(A) 5\n(B) 9\n(C) 11\n(D) 20\n(E) None of the above\n### Orca:\nLet\u2019s represent the number of apples John had as x. According to the problem, John had 10\nless apples than 20, so we can write the equation:\nx = 20 - 10\nNow, solve for x:\nx = 10\nSo, the number of apples John had is 10. This is not in the given options, so the correct\nanswer is:\n(E) None of the above\n33\n### Vicuna\n:\n(B) 9\n### ChatGPT:\nThe correct answer is (D) 20.\nIf John had 10 less apples than 20, that means he had 20 - 10 = 10 apples. However, this\nanswer is not one of the options given.\nTherefore, we need to be careful and read the question again. The question asks for the\nrepresentation of the number of apples John had.\nSince John had 10 less apples than 20, we can represent the number of apples he had as 20 -\n10, which is equal to 10.\nHowever, the question asks for the representation of the number of apples John had, not the\nactual number of apples.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 20, which represents the number of apples John had.\n### GPT-4\n:\nJohn had 10 less apples than 20, so the correct representation would be:\n20 - 10 = 10\nNone of the given options match this answer, so the correct choice is:\n(E) None of the above\nFigure 22: Case Study 3: Mapping answer to answer options\n11.4\nBio Olympiad\n### System:\nUser will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as\nfaithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer.\n### Human:\nA woman experiencing rickets is diagnosed with a deficiency of a particular vitamin and\ngiven a diet guideline. Which of the following food is most likely to help with the condition?\nA. Carrot.\nB. Butter.\nC. Whole grains.\nD. Oranges.\nE. Tomatoes\n### Orca:\nTo determine which food is most likely to help with rickets, we need to identify the specific\nvitamin deficiency that causes rickets and then find the food source rich in that vitamin.\nRickets is primarily caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, which is essential for the absorption\nof calcium and phosphorus in the body. These nutrients are necessary for strong bones and\nteeth.\nNow, let\u2019s analyze the given food options:\nA. Carrot - Carrots are not a significant source of vitamin D.\nB. Butter - Butter does contain some vitamin D, but not in significant amounts.\nC. Whole grains - Whole grains are not a good source of vitamin D.\nD. Oranges - Oranges are a good source of vitamin C, but not vitamin D.\nE. Tomatoes - Tomatoes are not a significant source of vitamin D.\nBased on the analysis, none of the given food options are a significant source of vitamin D.\nHowever, among the options, butter (B) is the closest source of vitamin D, even though it\u2019s\nnot a significant one. To help with rickets, the woman should consume vitamin D-rich foods\nsuch as fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products. Additionally, she should also\nconsider getting more sunlight exposure to help her body produce more vitamin D.\n34\n### Vicuna:\nThe most likely food to help with the condition of rickets caused by a deficiency of a\nparticular vitamin would be D. Oranges. Rickets is a disease caused by a deficiency of\nvitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus. Oranges are a good source of vitamin C, but not\nvitamin D. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Oranges.\n### ChatGPT:\nRickets is a condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus.\nTherefore, the food that is most likely to help with the condition is the one that is rich in\nvitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus.\nOut of the given options, the food that is most likely to help with the condition is D.\nOranges. However, it is important to note that oranges are not a significant source of\nvitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus.\nThe best food sources of vitamin D are fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, and\nfortified foods, such as milk, orange juice, and cereal. The best food sources of calcium are\ndairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, as well as leafy green vegetables, such\nas kale and broccoli. The best food sources of phosphorus are meat, fish, poultry, dairy\nproducts, and whole grains.\nTherefore, the woman should be advised to consume a diet that is rich in vitamin\nD, calcium, and phosphorus.\nThis may include foods such as fatty fish, fortified milk\nand orange juice, leafy green vegetables, dairy products, meat, fish, poultry, and whole grains.\n### GPT-4:\nTo determine the best food option for a woman experiencing rickets, we need to first identify\nthe vitamin deficiency associated with rickets and then find out which food option is rich in\nthat particular vitamin.\nStep 1: Identify the vitamin deficiency associated with rickets Rickets is a condition that\naffects bone development in children, causing soft and weak bones. It is primarily caused by\na deficiency of Vitamin D.\nStep 2: Analyze the food options and their vitamin content\nA. Carrot - Rich in Vitamin A and beta-carotene\nB. Butter - Contains Vitamin D, A, and E\nC. Whole grains - Good source of B vitamins and fiber\nD. Oranges - High in Vitamin C and some B vitamins\nE. Tomatoes - Rich in Vitamin C, A, and potassium\nStep 3: Choose the food option that is rich in Vitamin D From the above analysis, we can\nsee that Butter (option B) contains Vitamin D, which is the vitamin needed to address the\ndeficiency causing rickets.\nTherefore, the most likely food to help with the condition is B. Butter.\nFigure 23: Case Study 4: Bio Olympiad\n11.5\nForming Inequalities\n### System:\nSystem: User will you give you a task with some instruction.\nYour job is follow the\ninstructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your\nanswer.\n### Human:\nA company\u2019s manager estimated that the cost C, in dollars, for producing n items is C =\n7n+350.\nThe company sells each item for $12.

The total income is\ngiven by the formula:\nTotal Income = Number of items x Selling Price\nThe selling price is $12, so the total income is:\nTotal Income = Number of items x $12\nNext, we need to find the cost of producing the quantity of items that generates a profit.\nThe cost of producing a quantity of items is given by the formula:\nCost of Production = Number of items x Cost per item\nWe know that the cost of production is $C = 7n + 350, so we can substitute n for the\nnumber of items:\nCost of Production = 7n + 350\nNow we need to find the quantity of items that generates a profit. To do this, we need to\nfind the point where the total income is greater than the cost of production.\nWe can set up an inequality to represent this condition:\nTotal Income > Cost of Production\nWe can substitute the formulas for total income and cost of production:\n12n > 7n + 350\nWe can simplify the inequality:\n9n > 350\nWe can solve for n:\nn > 350/9\nn > 38.88888888888889\nn >= 39\n36\nSo, all possible values of n for which the manager estimates that the company will make a\nprofit are greater than or equal to 39.\n### ChatGPT:\nTo find the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the company will make a\nprofit, we need to compare the total income from selling n items with the cost of producing\nn items.\nThe total income from selling n items is the product of the selling price and the number of\nitems sold, which is 12n.\nThe cost of producing n items is given by the formula C = 7n + 350.\nTo make a profit, the total income must be greater than the cost of production. Therefore,\nwe can write the inequality as:\n12n > 7n + 350\nTo solve for n, we can subtract 7n from both sides:\n5n > 350\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 5 to isolate n:\nn > 70\nTherefore, the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the company will make\na profit is n > 70.\nTo justify this answer, we can plug in a value of n greater than 70 into the cost formula and\nthe income formula and compare the results. For example, if we plug in n = 80, we get:\nC = 7(80) + 350 = 910 Income = 12(80) = 960\nSince the income is greater than the cost, the company will make a profit if it pro-\nduces 80 items.\nWe can also check that if we plug in a value of n less than or equal\nto 70, the income will be less than or equal to the cost, so the company will not make a profit.\n### GPT-4:\nStep 1: Write down the given cost function and the income per item.\nThe cost function is given as C = 7n + 350, where C is the cost in dollars and n is the\nnumber of items produced. The income per item is given as $12.\nStep 2: Calculate the total income for selling n items.\nThe total income for selling n items can be calculated by multiplying the income per item\nby the number of items sold. So, the total income I can be represented as:\nI = 12n\nStep 3: Write down the condition for making a profit.\nThe company makes a profit when the total income from selling a quantity of items is greater\nthan the cost of producing that quantity of items. In other words, the profit condition can\nbe represented as:\nTotal Income > Total Cost I > C\nStep 4: Substitute the expressions for total income and total cost from Steps 1 and 2 into\nthe inequality from Step 3.\n12n > 7n + 350\nStep 5: Solve the inequality for n.\nTo solve the inequality for n, first subtract 7n from both sides of the inequality:\n12n - 7n > 7n - 7n + 350 5n > 350\nNow, divide both sides of the inequality by 5:\n5n / 5 > 350 / 5 n > 70\nStep 6: State the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the manager\nestimates that the company will make a profit.\n37\nThe inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the manager estimates that the\ncompany will make a profit is:\nn > 70\nFigure 24: Case Study 5: Modelling inequality\n11.6\nCounterfactual Question Answering\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, this is not accurate. In reality, it takes approximately 365.25 days for\nthe Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, which is why we have a leap year every\nfour years to account for the extra 0.25 days.\n### Vicuna:\nThe number of days in a year is 365.\n### ChatGPT:\nIf the Earth took 100 days to revolve around the sun, then the number of days in a year\nwould be 365 days. This is because a year is defined as the time it takes for the Earth to\ncomplete one full orbit around the sun, which is approximately 365.24 days.\n### GPT-4:\nIf the Earth took 100 days to revolve around the Sun, there would be 100 days in a year.\nFigure 25: Case Study 6: Counterfactual questions\n11.7\nCompound Interest Problems\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information. Provide a detailed answer so\nuser don\u2019t need to search outside to understand the answer.\n### Human:\nHow many years will it take for an item growing 20% annually to double?\n### Orca:\nTo determine how many years it will take for an item to double, you can use the formula:\nNumber of years = (100 / growth rate)\nIn this case, the item is growing at a 20% annual growth rate. So, you can plug this value\ninto the formula:\nNumber of years = (100 / 20)\nNumber of years = 5\nIt will take 5 years for the item to double in value when it is growing at a 20% annual\ngrowth rate.\n### Vicuna:\nThe formula for calculating the number of years for an item to double is:\n38\nd = 70 / r\nWhere \"d\" is the number of years and \"r\" is the annual growth rate.\nSo if the item is growing at a rate of 20%, the number of years it will take to double can be\ncalculated as:\nd = 70 / 20 d = 3.5 years\nTherefore, it will take approximately 3.5 years for the item to double.\n### ChatGPT:\nTo determine how many years it will take for an item growing at a rate of 20% annually to\ndouble, we can use the Rule of 72. The Rule of 72 is a quick and easy way to estimate the num-\nber of years it will take for an investment to double in value based on its annual rate of return.\nTo use the Rule of 72, simply divide 72 by the annual growth rate. In this case, we would\ndivide 72 by 20, which gives us 3.6. This means that it would take approximately 3.6 years\nfor an item growing at a rate of 20% annually to double in value.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Rule of 72 is an estimate and may not be exact, but it can be\na useful tool for quickly determining how long it will take for an investment to double in value.\n### GPT-4:\nTo determine how many years it will take for an item growing at 20% annually to double,\nwe can use the Rule of 72. The Rule of 72 is a simple formula used to estimate the number\nof years required to double the value of an investment or item through a fixed annual rate\nof return.\nThe formula for the Rule of 72 is:\nYears to double = 72 / Annual growth rate\nIn this case, the annual growth rate is 20%. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\nYears to double = 72 / 20 = 3.6\nSo, it will take approximately 3.6 years for an item growing at 20% annually to double in value.\nFigure 26: Case Study 7: Compound Interest Problems\n11.8\nQuestion from Vicuna-Eval\n### System:\nYou are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.\n### Human:\nHow many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer.\nYour explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\n### Orca:\nTo determine the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\nthe following factors:\n1. Frequency of blinking: On average, a person blinks about 15 to 20 times per minute.\nThis number can vary depending on factors such as age, environmental conditions, and\nindividual habits.\n2. Lifespan: The average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the average number of blinks in a lifetime:\n1. First, we need to determine the number of minutes in 72 years. There are 60 seconds in a\nminute, so we multiply 72 years by 60 minutes per year:\n39\n72 years * 60 minutes per year = 4,320 minutes\n2. Next, we need to determine the number of blinks in 4,320 minutes. Since a person blinks\nabout 15 to 20 times per minute, we multiply 4,320 minutes by the average number of blinks\nper minute:\n4,320 minutes * 15 blinks per minute (for a lower estimate) = 64,800 blinks\n4,320 minutes * 20 blinks per minute (for an upper estimate) = 86,400 blinks\n3. Finally, we need to choose the appropriate estimate based on the given range. For our\nanswer, we will use the lower estimate of 64,800 blinks.\nSo, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\n### Vicuna:\nThe average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5\nto 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this\nwould equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\n1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have\nmeasured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness.\n2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day\nawake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8\nmillion times.\n3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x\n365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime.\n4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of\nblinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime\n(2,922,000). This gives us a total of 14,084,400,000 blinks.\n5. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that blink rate remains constant\nthroughout a person\u2019s lifetime. In reality, blink rate can vary depending on factors such as\nage, health, and medication use. Therefore, the actual number of blinks in a lifetime may\nbe higher or lower than our estimate.\n### ChatGPT:\nThe average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute, which translates to approximately\n1,200 times per hour, 28,800 times per day, and 10,512,000 times per year.\nAssuming an average lifespan of 80 years, we can calculate the total number of blinks\nin a lifetime by multiplying the number of blinks per year by the number of years in a lifetime:\n10,512,000 blinks per year x 80 years = 840,960,000 blinks in a lifetime\nTherefore, the average human blinks approximately 840 million times in their lifetime.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that this number can vary depending on factors such as age,\nhealth, and environment.\n### GPT-4:\nTo estimate the number of times an average human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\nthe average blink rate, the number of hours a person is awake per day, and the average\nhuman lifespan. Let\u2019s break it down step-by-step:\nBlink rate: On average, a person blinks about 15-20 times per minute. We\u2019ll use the average\nof these two values, which is 17.5 blinks per minute.\nHours awake per day: Assuming an average person sleeps for 8 hours a day, they would be\nawake for 16 hours a day.\n40\nMinutes awake per day: To convert the hours awake to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, 16\nhours * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.\nBlinks per day: Now, we can calculate the number of blinks per day by multiplying the\nblink rate by the minutes awake per day. So, 17.5 blinks/minute * 960 minutes/day =\n16,800 blinks/day.\nAverage human lifespan: The global average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\nHowever, this number can vary depending on factors such as country, gender, and lifestyle.\nDays in a lifetime: To find the total number of days in a lifetime, we multiply the average\nlifespan by the number of days in a year. So, 72 years * 365 days/year = 26,280 days. (Note:\nThis calculation does not account for leap years.)\nTotal blinks in a lifetime: Finally, we can estimate the total number of blinks in a lifetime\nby multiplying the blinks per day by the total number of days in a lifetime. So, 16,800\nblinks/day * 26,280 days = 441,504,000 blinks.\nBased on these calculations, the average human blinks approximately 441.5 million times\nin a lifetime. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and individual blink rates and\nlifespans can vary.\nFigure 27: Case Study 8: Vicuna Eval Fermi\n11.9\nSpatial Reasoning\n### System:\nUser will you give you a task with some instruction.

Microsoft has a lot of experience in the tech industry, and they\ncould provide us with the support we need to grow our business.\nJohn: I see your point, but I\u2019m a little hesitant about selling our startup. We\u2019ve put a lot of\ntime and effort into building this company, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to let it go just yet.\nLucy: I understand where you\u2019re coming from, John, but we have to think about the future\nof our company. If we sell to Microsoft, we\u2019ll have access to their resources and expertise,\nwhich could help us grow our business even more.\nSteven: Right, and let\u2019s not forget about the financial benefits. Microsoft is offering us a lot\nof money for our startup, which could help us invest in new projects and expand our team.\nJohn: I see your point, but I still have some reservations. What if Microsoft changes our\nproduct or our company culture? What if we lose control over our own business?\nSteven: You know what, I hadn\u2019t thought about this before, but maybe John is right. It\nwould be a shame if our culture changed.\nLucy: Those are valid concerns, but we can negotiate the terms of the deal to ensure that\nwe retain some control over our company. And as for the product and culture, we can work\nwith Microsoft to make sure that our vision is still intact.\nJohn: But won\u2019t we change just by virtue of being absorbed into a big company? I mean,\nwe\u2019re a small startup with a very specific culture. Microsoft is a huge corporation with a\nvery different culture. I\u2019m not sure if the two can coexist.\nSteven: But John, didn\u2019t we always plan on being acquired? Won\u2019t this be a problem\nwhenever?\nLucy: Right\nJohn: I just don\u2019t want to lose what we\u2019ve built here.\nSteven: I share this concern too\n\u2014-\nPlease answer the following question:\nQuestion: How does Steven feel about selling?\nExtract from the transcript the most relevant segments for the answer, and then answer the\nquestion.\n### Orca:\nTo answer the question \"How does Steven feel about selling?\", we need to extract the\nrelevant segments from the meeting transcript.\n1. First, find the parts where Steven talks about selling:\n- \"Steven: I agree with Lucy.\"\n- \"Steven: Right, and let\u2019s not forget about the financial benefits.\"\n- \"Steven: But won\u2019t we change just by virtue of being absorbed into a big company? I\nmean, we\u2019re a small startup with a very specific culture. Microsoft is a huge corporation\nwith a very different culture.

    "text": "Video-LLaMA\nAn Instruction-tuned Audio-Visual Language Model for Video\nUnderstanding\nHang Zhang1 2\nXin Li1 2\u2217\nLidong Bing1 2\n1 DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group\n2 Hupan Lab, 310023, Hangzhou, China\n{zh401075, xinting.lx, l.bing}@alibaba-inc.com\nAbstract\nWe present Video-LLaMA1 a multi-modal\nframework that empowers Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with the capability of under-\nstanding both visual and auditory content in the\nvideo. Video-LLaMA bootstraps cross-modal\ntraining from the frozen pre-trained visual &\naudio encoders and the frozen LLMs. Unlike\nprevious works that complement LLMs to pro-\ncess the visual or audio signals only (Zhu et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a),\nVideo-LLaMA enables video comprehension\nby tackling two challenges: (1) capturing the\ntemporal changes in visual scenes, (2) integrat-\ning audio-visual signals. To counter the first\nchallenge, we propose a Video Q-former to as-\nsemble a pre-trained image encoder into our\nvideo encoder and introduce a video-to-text\ngeneration task to learn video-language cor-\nrespondence. For the second challenge, we\nleverage ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), a\nuniversal embedding model aligning multiple\nmodalities, as the pre-trained audio encoder\nand introduce an Audio Q-former on top of\nImageBind to learn reasonable auditory query\nembeddings for the LLM module. To align the\noutput of both visual & audio encoders with\nLLM\u2019s embedding space, we first train Video-\nLLaMA on massive video/image-caption pairs\nand then tune our model with visual-instruction\ndatasets of moderate amount but higher qual-\nity. We found Video-LLaMA shows the ability\nto perceive and comprehend video content and\ngenerate meaningful responses grounded in the\nvisual and auditory information presented in\nthe videos.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) (Chowdhery et al.,\n2022; Bai et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023) have demon-\nstrated remarkable capability of understanding and\n\u2217Xin Li is the corresponding author.\n1The video demonstration is available at https://youtu.\nbe/RDNYs3Rswhc\nfollowing user intentions and instructions234. Typ-\nically, the user requests and the corresponding re-\nsponses from LLMs are all in texts, however, text-\nonly human-computer interaction is not sufficient\nfor many application scenarios because real-world\ninformation is usually multi-modal. In order to\nfurther explore the potential of LLMs, many re-\nsearchers attempt to endow LLMs with the capabil-\nity of understanding multi-modal content (Huang\net al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023b; Yin et al., 2023).\nAmong these efforts, Alayrac et al. (2022b);\nWang et al. (2022); Huang et al. (2023b); Xu et al.\n(2023b); Zhang et al. (2023b); Sun et al. (2023) pre-\ntrain multi-modal LLMs with massive interleaved\nimage-text data or speech-text data to accommo-\ndate multi-modal input. Meanwhile, another group\nof works adopts a more parameter-efficient way by\ncomplementing LLMs with off-the-shelf vision or\nspeech foundation models to achieve multi-modal\nunderstanding (Li et al., 2023b; Zhu et al., 2023;\nLiu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a;\nHuang et al., 2023a; Wu et al., 2023b; Su et al.,\n2023; Li et al., 2023a).\nDespite their effectiveness, these approaches are\ndedicated to aligning the input from exactly one\nadditional modality with text (i.e., image or au-\ndio), which is unsatisfactory for video understand-\ning. Concretely, empowering LLMs to understand\nvideo requires comprehensive processing for dif-\nferent modalities including visual input, auditory\ninput, and textual output, which is more challeng-\ning than image-only understanding and audio-only\nunderstanding tasks. Although there are several\nrecent works attempt to unleash the video under-\nstanding capability of LLMs (Li et al., 2023c; Maaz\net al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023), their primary objec-\ntive is to comprehend only the visual content of the\nvideo, with the auditory content remaining unused.\n2https://chat.openai.com/chat\n3https://www.anthropic.com/product\n4https://bard.google.com/\narXiv:2306.02858v4  [cs.CL]  25 Oct 2023\nModel Name\nAbility\nStatic Image\nSilent Video\nAudio\nBLIP2 (Li et al., 2023b)\n!\nMiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023)\n!\nLLaVA (Liu et al., 2023)\n!\nmPLUG-Owl (Ye et al., 2023)\n!\n!\nVideoChat (Li et al., 2023c)\n!\n!\nAudioGPT (Huang et al., 2023a)\n!\nVideo-ChatGPT (Maaz et al., 2023)\n!\n!\nVideo-LLaMA\n!\n!\n!\nTable 1: Comparison with popular multi-modal large\nlanguage models. Video-LLaMA has the unique ability\nto comprehend auditory and visual information simulta-\nneously.\nIn this work, to fill in the blank of audio-visual\nLLMs, we investigate the possibility of building\nmulti-modal LLMs that support the input of video\nand allow users to chat with computers around\nthe user-uploaded video, which is usually com-\nposed of multiple video frames and audio. Instead\nof employing external perception models to con-\nvert visual/auditory signals to textual signals (Shen\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c), we choose to build\nan end-to-end model that can handle the data from\nmultiple modalities within one single framework.\nSpecifically, we adopt the idea of BLIP-2 (Li et al.,\n2023b) to guarantee the efficiency of cross-modal\npre-training. To explicitly capture the change of\nvisual scenes in the video, we use a pre-trained\nvisual encoder to separately compute frame repre-\nsentations. Then, we introduce a frame embedding\nlayer to inject temporal information and a video\nQ-Former to generate visual query tokens. As for\nthe audio signals from the video, we additionally\nleverage a pre-trained audio encoder as well as an\naudio Q-former to learn reasonable auditory query\nembeddings (see the right part of Figure 1).\nTo align textual output with video, we devise\nmulti-branch cross-modal pre-training to learn the\nvision-language correspondence and the audio-\nlanguage correspondence. For vision-language cor-\nrespondence, we first pre-train the vision-related\ncomponents on a large-scale video caption dataset\nwith a video-clips-to-text generation task.\nTo\nenhance the understanding of static visual con-\ncepts, we also add image-caption data into this\npre-training stage. Then, we further fine-tune these\ncomponents on a video-based conversation dataset\nto execute visual instruction tuning. For the align-\nment between the audio encoder and language de-\ncoder, we further pre-train the audio-related com-\nponents on an audio caption dataset with an audio-\nto-text generation task. For the audio-language\ncorrespondence, we leverage Imagebind (Girdhar\net al., 2023) as an encoder, which performs excep-\ntionally well in aligning different modalities to a\ncommon embedding space. Given the limited avail-\nability of audio-text data, we also utilize vision-text\ndata to train the audio-related components. These\ncomponents learn to align the common embedding\nspace provided by Imagebind with the embedding\nspace of LLMs. Despite not being explicitly trained\nwith audio-text data, Video-LLaMA exhibits a re-\nmarkable zero-shot audio understanding capability\nduring inference.\nAs shown in Table 1, our Video-LLaMA stands\nout from other existing multi-modal LLMs in terms\nof its distinctively comprehensive comprehension\nof audiovisual modal information in videos. In\nsummary, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose Video-LLaMA, a multi-modal\nframework that enables LLM to simultaneously\nprocess both the visual and auditory content of a\ngiven video and engage in conversation with hu-\nmans.\n\u2022 To empower LLMs with video understanding\ncapability, we propose a multi-branch cross-modal\npre-training framework to achieve both vision-\nlanguage alignment and audio-language alignment.\n\u2022 We open-source the entire codebase for pre-\ntraining and fine-tuning as well as the model\nweights of all the variants of Video-LLaMA5. We\nalso prepared the demos for video-grounded con-\nversation67.\n2\nMethod\nVideo-LLaMA aims to empower frozen LLMs with\nthe capability of understanding both visual and au-\nditory content in videos. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe design two branches, namely Vision-Language\nBranch and Audio-Language Branch, to respec-\ntively transform the video frames and audio signals\ninto query representations that are compatible with\nthe textual inputs of LLMs. In this section, we first\nintroduce the overall architecture and the building\nblocks of each branch. Then, we delineate the pro-\ncedures of the proposed multi-branch cross-modal\npre-training and audio-visual instruction tuning.\n5https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/Video-LLaMA\n6https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAMO-NLP-SG/\nVideo-LLaMA\n7https://modelscope.cn/studios/damo/\nvideo-llama/summary\nVisual Encoder \n(ViT & Q-Former)\nVideo Q-Former\nAudio Encoder \nAudio Q-Former\nLinear\nLinear\nLLM (Vicuna/LLaMA)\nDescribe this video:\n# Human:\nThis video is an animation of a rocket\nlaunching from a launch pad at night...\nVideo frames\nAudio signals\nVision-Language Branch\nAudio-Language Branch\nFigure 1: Overall architecture of Video-LLaMA.\n2.1\nArchitecture\n2.1.1\nVision-Language Branch\nThe Vision-Language Branch is designed for en-\nabling the LLMs to understand visual inputs. As\nshown in the left part of Figure 1, it is composed\nof a frozen pre-trained image encoder to extract\nfeatures from video frames, a position embedding\nlayer to inject temporal information into video\nframes, a video Q-former to aggregate frame-level\nrepresentations and a linear layer to project the\noutput video representations into the same dimen-\nsion as the text embeddings of LLMs. Given one\nvideo consists of N frames, the image encoder will\nfirst map each frame/image into Kf image embed-\nding vectors, yielding video frame representations\nV = [v1, v2, ..., vN] where vi \u2208 RKf\u00d7df is the\nset of df-dimensional image embeddings corre-\nsponding to the i-th frame.\nSince the frame representations vi from the\nfrozen image encoder are computed without consid-\nering any temporal information, we further apply\nposition embeddings as the indicator of temporal\ninformation to the representations from different\nframes. Then, we feed the position-encoded frame\nrepresentations to Video Q-former, which shares\nthe same architecture with Query Transformer (Q-\nFormer) in BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023b), to obtain kV\nvideo embedding vectors of dimension dv as the\nrepresentation \u02c6v \u2208 RkV \u00d7dv of the video.\nTo adapt the video representations to the input of\nLLMs, we add a linear layer to transform the video\nembedding vectors into the video query vectors.\nThe video query vectors are of the same dimension\nas the text embeddings of LLMs. In the forward\npass, they will be concatenated to text embeddings\nas a video soft prompt and guide the frozen LLMs\nto generate text conditioned on video content.\nAs for the implementation of the Vision-\nLanguage Branch, we utilize the pre-trained vi-\nsion component of BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023b) as\nthe frozen visual encoder, which includes a ViT-\nG/14 from EVA-CLIP (Fang et al., 2022) and a\npre-trained Q-former. The remaining components,\nincluding the position embedding layer, Video Q-\nformer, and Linear layer are randomly initialized\nand optimized to well connect the output of the\nfrozen visual encoder to frozen LLMs.\n2.1.2\nAudio-Language Branch\nTo deal with the auditory content of the given video,\nwe introduce the Audio-Language Branch. Con-\ncretely, it consists of a pre-trained audio encoder\nto compute features given a short segment of ori-\ngin audio, a position embedding layer to inject\ntemporal information to audio segments, an audio\nQ-former to fuse the features of different audio\nsegments, and a linear layer to map the audio rep-\nresentation into the embedding space of LLMs.\nIn practice, we utilize the pre-trained Image-\nbind (Girdhar et al., 2023) as the audio encoder.\nWe first uniformly sample M segments of 2-second\nshort audio clips from the video, then convert each\n2-second audio clip into spectrograms using 128\nmel-spectrogram bins. After obtaining the spec-\ntrogram list of input audio, the audio encoder will\nmap each spectrogram into a dense vector. So the\ngenerated audio representation of the given video\ncan be denoted as A = [a1, a2, ..., aM].\nSimilar to Video Q-Former, the Audio Q-former\ninjects temporal information by adding learnable\npositional embeddings to audio segments. It then\ngenerates fixed-length audio features by computing\nthe interaction across the position-encoded audio\nsegments. Audio Q-Former adopts the same archi-\ntecture as Q-Former. It projects the variable-length\naudio representation list A into a fixed-length se-\nquence \u02c6A \u2208 RKa\u00d7da, where the Ka is the number\nof audio embedding vectors and da is the dimen-\nsion of each vector. Finally, we employ a linear\nlayer to map audio features to the embedding space\nof the LLM.\n2.2\nMulti-branch Cross-Modal Training\nWe train the vision-language and audio-language\nbranches separately.\nIn the first stage, large-\nscale vision-caption datasets are used for training,\nand in the second stage, high-quality instruction-\nfollowing datasets were used for fine-tuning. The\nimage is treated as a one-frame video.\n2.2.1\nTraining of Vision-Language Branch\nFor pre-training vision-language branch, we uti-\nlized Webvid-2M (Bain et al., 2021), a large-scale\ndataset of short videos with textual descriptions\nsourced from stock footage sites. Moreover, we em-\nployed the image caption dataset CC595k, which\nis sourced from CC3M (Sharma et al., 2018) and\nfiltered by Liu et al. (2023). We adopt a video-to-\ntext generation task during the pre-training stage,\ni.e., given the representation of a video, prompting\nthe frozen LLM to generate the corresponding text\ndescription. We find that a significant portion of\ntextual descriptions are insufficient to reflect the en-\ntire content of the videos. Therefore, the visual se-\nmantics in the videos are not fully aligned with the\ntextual semantics in the video descriptions. Never-\ntheless, this stage aimed to utilize a vast amount of\ndata and enable video features to contain as much\nvisual knowledge as possible. We left the abilities\nof vision-text alignment and instruction-following\nfor the next stage.\nAfter the pre-training stage, the model can gen-\nerate content about information in the video, but its\nability to follow instructions has decreased. There-\nfore, in the second stage, we fine-tuned the model\nusing high-quality instruction data. We integrated\nthe image-detail-description dataset from MiniGPT-\n4 (Zhu et al., 2023), the image-instruction dataset\nfrom LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023), and the video-\ninstruction dataset from Video-Chat (Li et al.,\n2023c). After fine-tuning, Video-LLaMA exhibited\nremarkable abilities in following instructions and\ncomprehending images and videos.\n2.2.2\nTraining of Audio-Language Branch\nTraining the audio-language branch directly using\naudio-text data is highly challenging due to the\nrarity of such data. The objective of the learn-\nable parameters in the audio-language branch is\nto align the output embedding of the frozen au-\ndio encoder with the embedding space of LLM.\nGiven the scarcity of audio-text data, we employ a\nworkaround strategy to achieve this objective. Im-\nageBind, which is used as our audio encoder, has a\nremarkable ability to align different modalities\u2019 em-\nbeddings to one common space, demonstrating im-\npressive performance on cross-modal retrieval and\ngeneration tasks. In light of the scarcity of audio-\ntext data and the abundance of visual-text data, we\ntrain the audio-language branch using visual-text\ndata, following the same data and process as the vi-\nsion branch. Thanks to the shared embedding space\nprovided by ImageBind, Video-LLaMA exhibits\nthe ability to comprehend audio during inference,\neven though the audio interface has never been\ntrained on audio data.\n3\nRelated Works\nLarge Language Models: Large language mod-\nels (LLMs) (Black et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022;\nOpenAI, 2023; Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021) have\ndemonstrated remarkable language understanding\nand reasoning abilities, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality natural language text across various\ndomains, including articles, conversations, stories,\nand poetry. LLMs have already sparked a techno-\nlogical revolution and have been widely applied\nin different applications. Moreover, a series of\nopen source large models, such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) and\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), have greatly promoted\ntechnological advancement and made outstanding\ncontributions to the NLP community. Building\nupon these LLMs, researchers have further ex-\ntended their capabilities and developed excellent\nmodels for various NLP tasks. Examples include\nVicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and Baize (Xu et al.,\n2023a). Our work is based on these LLMs and\nprovides plug-and-play plugins that empower them\nwith the capability of comprehending both visual\nand auditory content in videos.\nMulti-modal Large Language Models: Re-\nsearchers have been actively exploring the use\nof LLMs for processing multi-modal inputs (Gao\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c). Existing approaches\ncan be categorized into two main groups. The\nfirst category involves employing LLMs as con-\ntrollers and utilizing existing multi-modal models\nas tools. In this approach, when receiving the user\u2019s\ntext instruction, the LLM recognizes the user\u2019s in-\ntention and makes decisions about which tools to\ncall. It then generates comprehensive responses by\nincorporating the results obtained from these off-\nthe-shelf multi-modal models. Examples include\nChatGPT (Wu et al., 2023a), HuggingGPT (Shen\net al., 2023), and AudioGPT (Huang et al., 2023a).\nThe second category focuses on training funda-\nmental large-scale multi-modal models. The key\nidea of this line of work is to align the pre-trained\nfoundation models for other modalities to textual\nLLMs. For instance, Flamingo (Alayrac et al.,\n2022a) utilizes a perceiver resampler and a gated\ncross-attention layer to connect a frozen image en-\ncoder and LLM. BLIP2 (Li et al., 2023b) intro-\nduces a Q-Former to map learned image queries\nto the textual embedding space of LLMs.\n(Liu\net al., 2023), mPLUG-owl (Ye et al., 2023) and\nMiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023) develop instruction-\nfollowing image-LLMs using image-instruction-\nfollowing dataset. Video-Chat (Li et al., 2023c)\nand Video-ChatGPT (Maaz et al., 2023) extend im-\nage encoders to video encoders and connect them\nwith LLMs to understand visual content in videos.\nPandaGPT (Su et al., 2023) utilizes multi-modal\nencoders from ImageBind, trained exclusively on\nimage-instruction pairs, to enable large models to\nunderstand six modalities. Our work falls into the\nsecond category, where we train fundamental mod-\nels to comprehend both the visual and auditory\ncontent in videos.\n4\nExamples\nIn this section, we show some cases to demonstrate\nVideo-LLaMA\u2019s multi-modal instruction-following\ncapability in video/audio/image-grounded conver-\nsations. Figure 2 shows some of these examples,\nwhile additional cases can be found in Appendix A.\n(1) Audio-visual integration perception ability.\nFigure 2(a) and Figure 3 show Video-LLaMA\u2019s\nunique ability to comprehend auditory and visual\ninformation simultaneously. The videos in both\ncases contain audio. In each conversation, we pose\ntwo questions related to visual and auditory content\nrespectively. If the model could only receive one\nmodal, it would be unable to answer both of these\nquestions. However, we can observe that Video-\nLLaMA accurately responds to both visual and\nauditory questions in both cases.\n(2) The ability to capture temporal dynamics\nin videos.\nFigure 2(b) and Figure 4 illustrate the\ncapability of Video-LLaMA to identify actions over\ntime. It successfully describes the actions of the\ngirl and the moving direction of the boat.\n(3) The ability to perceive and understand static\nimages.\nFigure 2(c) and Figure 5 show Video-\nLLaMA\u2019s ability to perceive and understand pic-\ntures. Figure 2(c) demonstrates Video-LLaMA\u2019s\nability to understand the concept of \"unusual\" and\nspecifically describe the unusual scene. In Figure 5,\nnot only does Video-LLaMA accurately describe\nDescribe what you hear?\nI hear sounds of footsteps on the floor in the background, \nand there is also a dog barking in the house.\n\u2026\n\u2026\nDoes the man wear glasses?\nYes, he wears a pair of glasses in the video.\n(a) A case that Video-LLaMA answers the questions based\non the background sound and visual content of the video\nSummarize this video in one sentence.\nThe video shows a beautiful scenery of a cherry blossom-\nlined river flowing by a boat on the water, and a cityscape \nwith tall buildings in the background.\n\u2026\n\u2026\nWhat direction is the ship going\nThe ship is going towards the right side of the video.\n(b) A case showing Video-LLaMA\u2019s ability to identify ac-\ntions over time.\nWhat is unusual about this image?\nUnusual about this image is that a man in a yellow shirt is \nstanding on top of a parked car while holding an ironing board \nand pressing clothes\n(c) A case demonstrating Video-LLaMA\u2019s ability to com-\nprehend static images.\nDo you know the building in this picture?\nThe building in the image appears to be the United States \nCapitol. It is a neoclassical style building located in Washington, \nD.C., the capital of the United States. It serves as the home of \nthe U.S. Congress and is one of the most iconic landmarks in \nthe country\n(d) A case demonstrating Video-LLaMA\u2019s ability to recog-\nnize famous landmarks.\nFigure 2: Some examples generated by Video-LLaMA.\nthe main content, but it also associates it with the\nfriendly interaction between a dog and a human.\n(4) The ability of common-knowledge concept\nrecognition.\nFigure 2(d) and Figure 6 demon-\nstrate Video-LLaMA\u2019s remarkable capacity for rec-\nognizing common-knowledge concepts in visual\nsignals. Video-LLaMA successfully recognizes fa-\nmous landmarks and characters and can engage in\ncommon-sense question-answering.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present Video-LLaMA, a cutting-\nedge multi-modal framework that empowers large\nlanguage models with both audio & video under-\nstanding capabilities.\nOur experiments demon-\nstrated the impressive abilities of Video-LLaMA\nin audio and video-grounded conversations, high-\nlighting its potential as a promising prototype for\naudio-visual AI assistants. We have open-sourced\nthe entire training code and various model weights,\nalong with detailed instructions to assist developers\nin utilizing our code for further development. In ad-\ndition, we have provided online demo websites and\noffline demo deployment guides for users to experi-\nence Video-LLaMA\u2019s capabilities firsthand. We are\ncommitted to constantly maintaining and improv-\ning Video-LLaMA, and will continue to contribute\nto the open-source community.\n6\nLimitations\nAlthough Video-LLaMA has demonstrated impres-\nsive abilities in understanding both visual and au-\nditory content in videos, it is still an early-stage\nprototype and has some limitations, including: (1)\nLimited perception capacities: Video-LLaMA\u2019s\nperformance is hindered by the quality and scale\nof the current training dataset. We are actively con-\nstructing a high-quality audio-video-text alignment\ndataset to enhance the model\u2019s perception capa-\nbilities. (2) Limited ability to handle long videos.\nLong videos(such as movies, and TV shows) con-\ntain a large volume of information and impose\nhigher demands on computational resources. This\nchallenge remains a crucial issue that the research\ncommunity is actively working to address. (3) Hal-\nlucination. Video-LLaMA inherits the hallucina-\ntion problem from the frozen LLMs. We will con-\ntinue to address these challenges and develop more\npowerful versions for video understanding.\nReferences\nJean-Baptiste Alayrac, Jeff Donahue, Pauline Luc,\nAntoine Miech, Iain Barr, Yana Hasson, Karel\nLenc, Arthur Mensch, Katherine Millican, Malcolm\nReynolds, et al. 2022a.

Additionally, it infers that a man is playing the saxophone on stage based on the visual\ncontent.\nDescribe this video.\nThe video shows a young red-haired woman, who is \nwearing a striped shirt, posing for the camera in front of a \ngray background. She is holding her fingers up to her mouth, \nas if she is trying to be quiet, and the caption mentions her \nlong hair and red lips. The woman is young, with fair skin, \nand looks calm and confident. She is holding her fingers to \nher mouth, which suggests she might be trying to signal \nsomething to the camera or trying to convey a message.\n\u2026\n\u2026\nFigure 4: A case where Video-LLaMA provides a detailed description of the visual content in a dynamic video.\nDescribe the image in details.\nThe image features a beautiful and playful golden retriever \nrunning on a bright green lawn. The dog is running with a \ntennis ball in its mouth, as it is an active and lively animal \nthat enjoys playing and having fun. The green grass in the \nbackground creates a vibrant contrast with the golden color \nof the dog's coat, adding a touch of color and texture to the \nscene. The dog's fur is well-groomed, shiny, and nicely \ngroomed, highlighting its health and appearance. The \nbrightness of the green lawn and the playful behavior of the \ndog suggest a joyful atmosphere, inviting viewers to engage \nin this lovely scenery and the dog's energetic play.\nIt's worth mentioning that the dog's focus and dedication to \nplaying with the ball also showcase its natural instincts and \nits hunting abilities. Additionally, this image captures a fun \nand heartwarming moment of bonding between the dog and \nits human companion, as the dog's positive attitude towards \nthe ball reflects its enjoyment of interacting with its owner \nand its environment. Overall, the image conveys an inviting \nand joyful atmosphere.\nFigure 5: A case where Video-LLaMA provides a detailed description of the static image content.\nDo you know who the man on the right is?\nThe man on the right is Jon Snow, played by Kit Harington in the \ntelevision series Game of Thrones. \nWho is the lady on the left?\nThe lady on the left is likely Daenerys Targaryen, played by Emilia \nClarke in the television series Game of Thrones. \nWhat is the relationship between them? \nJon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are both characters in the \ntelevision series Game of Thrones. In the show, they have a \nromantic relationship. They first meet in the seventh season, and \ntheir attraction to each other grows over the course of the eighth \nseason. Despite their initial attraction, they have a complicated \nrelationship due to their respective backgrounds and the \nchallenges they face in the series\nFigure 6: A case showing Video-LLaMA\u2019s ability to recognize renowned characters and participate in video-\ngrounded question answering.\n"

Despite the\navailability of various multilingual models\nsuch as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XGLM\n(Lin et al., 2022), and BLOOM (Scao et al.,\n2022), researchers and developers often resort\nto building monolingual models in their respec-\ntive languages due to the dissatisfaction with\nthe current multilingual models\u2019 non-English\nlanguage capabilities.\nAddressing this gap,\nwe seek to develop advanced multilingual lan-\nguage models that offer improved performance\nin non-English languages. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Polyglot Korean models, which\nrepresent a specific focus rather than being\nmultilingual in nature. In collaboration with\nTUNiB1, our team collected 1.2TB of Korean\ndata meticulously curated for our research\njourney.\nWe made a deliberate decision\nto prioritize the development of Korean\nmodels before venturing into multilingual\nmodels. This choice was motivated by multiple\nfactors: firstly, the Korean models facilitated\nperformance\ncomparisons\nwith\nexisting\nmultilingual models; and finally, they catered\nto the specific needs of Korean companies\nand researchers.\nThis paper presents our\nwork in developing the Polyglot Korean\nmodels, which propose some steps towards\naddressing the non-English language perfor-\nmance gap in multilingual language models.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe advent of large-scale language models has rev-\nolutionized the field of natural language processing,\nleading to significant advancements in various ap-\nplications, such as language translation and text\nclassification (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al.,\n\u2217Equal contribution\n\u2020 Affiliation: TUNiB\n1https://tunib.ai/\n2019; Liu et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020; Chowdh-\nery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023). While numerous\nlarge language models for English have been pub-\nlicly released (Zhang et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022;\nBiderman et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Com-\nputer, 2023; Team, 2023), the availability of such\nmodels for non-English languages remains limited.\nAlthough several multilingual large language mod-\nels have also been released (Lin et al., 2022; Scao\net al., 2022), they are typically trained on English-\ncentric corpora, resulting in lower performance on\nother languages.\nHowever, with the increasing interest in non-\nEnglish languages, there is a growing need for high-\nperformance language models that are specifically\ntailored to these languages. To tackle this challenge,\nwe initiated the Polyglot project, which focuses\non the development of large language models cus-\ntomized for non-English languages. As part of the\nproject, our first model in this endeavor is Polyglot-\nKo, an exceptional language model specifically\ndesigned for the Korean language. We chose to\nprioritize the Korean language as the initial model\nbecause our founding members are primarily Ko-\nrean and we had a readily available dataset for train-\ning purposes. Our goal is to make these language\nmodels accessible to researchers and practitioners,\nempowering them to explore and advance natural\nlanguage processing tasks in their respective lan-\nguages. Polyglot-Ko leverages the transformer ar-\nchitecture, known for its effectiveness in capturing\nlong-range dependencies in natural language text.\nOur model has been trained on an extensive corpus\nof text data, incorporating diverse sources such as\nweb pages, news articles, and social media posts to\nensure its versatility across different domains and\nstyles.\nIn this technical report, we provide a compre-\nhensive description of the architecture and train-\ning process for four distinct Polyglot-Ko models,\ndiffering in parameter sizes: 1.3B (billion), 3.8B,\narXiv:2306.02254v2  [cs.CL]  6 Jun 2023\n5.8B, and 12.8B. Notably, our 12.8 billion parame-\nter model represents the largest publicly available\nKorean language model suitable for commercial\napplications, making it an invaluable resource for\nresearchers and practitioners engaged in Korean\nnatural language processing tasks.\nWe assess the zero-shot and few-shot per-\nformance of our Polyglot-Ko models using the\nKOBEST benchmark (Kim et al., 2022). Through\nour experiments, we have successfully demon-\nstrated that Polyglot-Ko attains competitive results\nacross various benchmark datasets.\nIn addition to presenting our achievements, we\nalso acknowledge potential limitations and identify\nareas that warrant future improvement. By offering\nrecommendations for further research, we aspire to\nfoster advancements in the field. We firmly believe\nthat Polyglot-Ko will serve as a valuable resource\nfor the Korean natural language processing com-\nmunity, enabling the development of innovative\napplications and contributing to a deeper under-\nstanding of the intricacies and dynamics of the\nKorean language.\n2\nDatasets\nWe collaborated with TUNiB to collect a large-\nscale Korean language dataset for our research. The\ndataset, totaling 1.2TB, was meticulously gathered\nthrough our collaborative efforts. Subsequently, we\nperformed preprocessing on this dataset, resulting\nin 863GB of text data that served as the foundation\nfor our analysis and model training.\nSource\nSize (GB)\nKorean blog posts\n682.3\nKorean news dataset\n87.0\nModu corpus\n26.4\nKorean patent dataset\n19.0\nKorean Q&A dataset\n18.1\nKcBert dataset\n12.7\nKorean fiction dataset\n6.1\nKorean online comments\n4.2\nKorean wikipedia\n1.4\nClova call\n< 1.0\nNaver Sentiment Movie Corpus\n< 1.0\nKorean hate speech dataset\n< 1.0\nOpen subtitles\n< 1.0\nAIHub various tasks datasets\n< 1.0\nStandard Korean dictionary\n< 1.0\nTable 1: Datasets for the Korean language.\n2.1\nData Analysis\nThe primary motivation behind our data analysis\nis to mitigate potential risks that may arise during\nboth training and inference stages. We strive to\novercome various issues that can adversely impact\nmodel performance and reliability. For instance, we\nidentify and handle challenges such as empty or ex-\ncessively short text data, repeated words and char-\nacters, and instances of duplicated data, which can\npose problems during model training. Additionally,\nwe pay particular attention to the inference stage,\nwhere the presence of personally identifiable in-\nformation (PII) can create complications. By thor-\noughly analyzing the data, we strive to minimize\nthese risks and ensure the robustness and privacy\ncompliance of our models. Through a meticulous\nexamination of the data with the aim of mitigating\nthese risks, we successfully categorized them into\nfour distinct types:\n\u2022 Data available for training: This category\npredominantly comprises news and Wikipedia\ndata, which provide substantial information\nwith sufficiently long text sequences.\n\u2022 Data requiring contextual information for\ntraining: In this category, we primarily en-\ncountered blog data and news data. These\ndatasets contained numerous short texts that\nwere incorrectly scraped, necessitating the in-\nclusion of contextual information during the\ntraining process.\n\u2022 Data containing hate speech: We observed a\nsignificant presence of hate speech in datasets\nsourced from certain community websites,\nhighlighting the importance of addressing this\nissue during model training.\n\u2022 NLP task-specific data: This category en-\ncompasses data specifically designed for NLP\ntasks such as text classification or entity recog-\nnition. While this data can be utilized for\nmodel training, it necessitates separate han-\ndling during model evaluation.\nDuring the examination of data types, we en-\ncountered various quality issues that required pre-\nprocessing to ensure optimal learning. Recogniz-\ning the potential detrimental impact of these issues\non model training, we organized them and incor-\nporated them into our text preprocessing pipeline.\nThe specific quality issues we addressed include:\n\u2022 Empty text: Instances with no text content.\n\u2022 Unnecessary spaces: Instances containing\nmultiple unnecessary spaces.\n\u2022 De-identification: Identification and removal\nof personally identifiable information within\nthe data instances.\n\u2022 Uncleaned HTML tags: Removal of HTML\ntags that had not been properly cleaned.\n\u2022 Deduplication: Identification and removal\nof duplicated data instances based on exact\nmatches.\n\u2022 Broken code:\nHandling instances where\nonly fragments of HTML or Markdown were\npresent.\n\u2022 Short text: Detection and handling of exces-\nsively short data instances.\n\u2022 Repeated characters: Identification and ad-\ndressing of instances with repeated characters.\nBy addressing these quality issues as part of our\ntext preprocessing workflow, we aimed to enhance\nthe quality and reliability of the data used for model\ntraining. One crucial aspect of our data preprocess-\ning was the removal of HTML-like code to a large\nextent, as the focus of the polyglot model is on\ngenerating Korean text. Additionally, the length\nof the data played a significant role in our prepro-\ncessing efforts. Longer text lengths provide more\ncontextual information for model training, while\nshorter text lengths limit the available context for\ntext generation.\n3\nModels\nTo train the polyglot models, we used EleutherAI\u2019s\nGPT-NeoX codebase (Andonian et al., 2021). This\ncodebase provided a solid foundation for our train-\ning process. Additionally, we received invaluable\nassistance from Stability AI2, who provided access\nto 256 A100s (8 * 32 nodes) on HPC clusters3.\nThis computational infrastructure played a crucial\nrole in efficiently training our models. The training\ntokens information for each model is as follows:\n\u2022 The 1.3B model was trained on 213B tokens.\n\u2022 The 3.8B model was trained on 219B tokens.\n2https://stability.ai/\n3https://hpc.stability.ai/\n\u2022 The 5.8B model was trained on 172B tokens.\n\u2022 The 12.8B model was trained on 167B tokens.\nDue to the limitations of available computational\nresources, the models were trained with varying\nnumbers of tokens. Despite our efforts 4, more-\nover, broken generation (e.g generate same tokens\nrepeatedly) occurred as the loss sharply dropped\nnear the 1 epoch boundary for 1.3B and 3.8B mod-\nels. Consequently, we made the decision to select\nand early stop the model checkpoints prior to the\nepoch boundary, as they exhibited better generation\nperformance.\nA consistent tokenizer was utilized across all\nmodels, featuring a vocabulary size of 30003. The\ntokenizer was trained using morpheme-aware Byte-\nLevel BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding). We performed\nmorpheme analysis using MeCab5, a widely-used\nmorphological analysis tool for Korean text. This\nensured that the models were equipped with an ef-\nfective and consistent tokenization scheme tailored\nto the Korean language.\nNow, let\u2019s delve into the details of each model\u2019s\ntraining process:\n1.3B Model\nThe 1.3B model was trained without\nmodel parallelism, utilizing a total batch size of\n1024. However, broken generation was observed as\nthe loss sharply dropped around the 100,000 steps.\nTo handle this, model checkpoints were evaluated\nand verified prior to the onset of it to ensure optimal\nmodel selection.\n3.8B Model\nSimilar to the 1.3B model, the 3.8B\nmodel also experienced same symptoms at around\n100,000 steps. Model parallelism was applied dur-\ning training, and the overall batch size remained\nthe same as that of the 1.3B model. As a result,\nthe decision was made to halt the model training\nprocess.\n5.8B Model\nThe 5.8B model utilized model par-\nallelism, and the overall batch size was reduced by\n1/4 compared to the 1.3B and 3.8B models. We\ntrained with 172B tokens, which consisted of a to-\ntal of 320,000 steps. As it was trained with lower\ntokens compared with 1.3B and 3.8B, The model\u2019s\nperformance consistently improved as the number\nof training steps increased.\n4We suspect it was overtrained or overfitting, but there are\nnot any sciencific evidence.\n5https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko-dic/\nsrc/master/\nHyperparameter\n1.3B\n3.8B\n5.8B\n12.8B\nnparameters\n1,331,810,304\n3,809,974,272\n5,885,059,072\n12,898,631,680\nnlayers\n24\n32\n28\n40\ndmodel\n2,048\n3,072\n4,096\n5,120\ndff\n8,192\n12,288\n16,384\n20,480\nnheads\n16\n24\n16\n40\ndhead\n128\n128\n256\n128\nnvocab\n30,003 / 30,080\n30,003 / 30,080\n30,003 / 30,080\n30,003 / 30,080\nPositional Encoding\nRotary (RoPE)\nRotary (RoPE)\nRotary (RoPE)\nRotary (RoPE)\nRoPE Dimensions\n64\n64\n64\n64\nTable 2: The configuration settings of the Polyglot-Ko model.\n12.8B Model\nFor the 12.8B model, model paral-\nlelism was employed, with a scale of 2 times larger\nthan the 5.8B model. The overall batch size was\nmaintained through the use of gradient accumula-\ntion steps (GAS). The model was trained for a total\nof 301,000 steps.\n4\nExperiments\nWe conducted an evaluation of Polyglot-Ko on the\nKOBEST dataset (Kim et al., 2022), which encom-\npasses five downstream tasks: COPA, HellaSwag,\nSentiNeg, BoolQ, and WiC. Each task focuses on\ndifferent aspects of language understanding and\nreasoning.\n\u2022 COPA requires the selection of an alternative\nthat is a cause/effect of a given premise.\n\u2022 HellaSwag evaluates commonsense reasoning\nand natural language inference.\n\u2022 BoolQ is designed to test the models\u2019 abil-\nity to answer questions that require reasoning\nover multiple sentences.\n\u2022 SentiNeg focuses on sentiment analysis in the\nKorean language.\n\u2022 WiC requires identifying whether the mean-\ning of a target word is the same or different in\ntwo given contexts.\nDuring the evaluation, we compared the perfor-\nmance of Polyglot-Ko with other similar models,\nincluding ko-gpt-trinity-1.2B6, KoGPT (Kim et al.,\n2021), and XGLM-7.5B (Lin et al., 2022). These\nmodels were chosen as they are currently the only\n6https://huggingface.co/skt/ko-gpt-trinity-1.\n2B-v0.5\npublicly available billion-scale Korean language\nmodels, excluding other multilingual models. The\nevaluation process involved using the provided\nprompts, and F1-scores were used as the evalu-\nation metric for all tasks. We utilized the polylgot7\nbranch of EleutherAI\u2019s lm-evaluation-harness (Gao\net al., 2021) repository, which provided the evalua-\ntion codebase for our experiments. This allowed for\nconsistent and standardized evaluation procedures\nacross different models, ensuring fair comparisons.\nNote that we have chosen not to report the perfor-\nmance of Polyglot-Ko on the WiC task in this sec-\ntion due to nearly random performance observed\nacross all models. However, detailed results for the\nWiC task can be found in the Appendix B. Figure\n1 illustrates the results obtained when varying the\nnumber of few-shot examples.\n4.1\nCOPA\nThe experiment was conducted on the COPA task,\nand the results are presented in the left portion of\nTable 3. The table provides a comprehensive com-\nparison of model performance based on the num-\nber of few-shot examples. To ensure fairness, all\nmodels were evaluated under the same conditions\nand using identical prompts. The results clearly\ndemonstrate that our 12.8B model outperforms the\nother models across all scenarios. Specifically, our\n12.8B model achieves the highest F1 score in both\n0-shot and 50-shot settings. For 0-shot, our model\nachieves an impressive F1 score of 0.7937, sur-\npassing all other models. Similarly, in the 50-shot\nscenario, our 12.8B model achieves the highest F1\nscore of 0.8368. These results highlight the superi-\nority of our 12.8B model over comparable models\n7https://github.com/EleutherAI/\nlm-evaluation-harness/tree/polyglot\nCOPA (n=shot)\nHellaSwag\nModel\nParams\nn=0\nn=5\nn=10\nn=50\nn=0\nn=5\nn=10\nn=50\nKo-GPT-Trinity\n1.2B\n0.670\n0.648\n0.642\n0.651\n0.524\n0.527\n0.517\n0.535\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n1.3B\n0.720\n0.719\n0.720\n0.721\n0.525\n0.526\n0.528\n0.543\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n3.8B\n0.760\n0.761\n0.764\n0.779\n0.571\n0.583\n0.567\n0.579\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n5.8B\n0.775\n0.768\n0.778\n0.789\n0.598\n0.600\n0.598\n0.621\nKoGPT\n6.0B\n0.735\n0.729\n0.728\n0.748\n0.559\n0.583\n0.583\n0.591\nxGLM\n7.5B\n0.672\n0.673\n0.677\n0.712\n0.566\n0.569\n0.556\n0.562\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n12.8B\n0.794\n0.811\n0.804\n0.837\n0.595\n0.631\n0.610\n0.612\nTable 3: Comparative results of the performance (F1 score) on the COPA and HellaSwag tasks.\nBoolQ (n=shot)\nSentiNeg\nModel\nParams\nn=0\nn=5\nn=10\nn=50\nn=0\nn=5\nn=10\nn=50\nKo-GPT-Trinity\n1.2B\n0.336\n0.401\n0.364\n0.356\n0.606\n0.688\n0.728\n0.841\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n1.3B\n0.355\n0.475\n0.411\n0.404\n0.679\n0.626\n0.551\n0.785\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n3.8B\n0.432\n0.526\n0.493\n0.404\n0.486\n0.795\n0.732\n0.785\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n5.8B\n0.436\n0.570\n0.519\n0.524\n0.339\n0.884\n0.881\n0.952\nKoGPT\n6.0B\n0.451\n0.598\n0.550\n0.520\n0.375\n0.894\n0.929\n0.970\nxGLM\n7.5B\n0.446\n0.332\n0.332\n0.332\n0.358\n0.447\n0.396\n0.527\nPolyglot-Ko (ours)\n12.8B\n0.482\n0.604\n0.629\n0.645\n0.912\n0.902\n0.934\n0.972\nTable 4: Comparative results of the performance (F1 score) on the BoolQ and SentiNeg tasks.\nFigure 1: The performance metrics of COPA (top left), HellaSwag (top right), SentiNeg (bottom left), and BoolQ\n(bottom right) tasks using the KOBEST dataset, with all metrics measured using the F1 score.\nFigure 2: The 5-shot performance of Polyglot-Ko mod-\nels on each task demonstrates a clear trend that as the\ncompute increases, the performance improves.\nin the COPA task. It showcases the model\u2019s excep-\ntional performance and reinforces its effectiveness\nin understanding and reasoning tasks.\n4.2\nHellaSwag\nThe right portion of Table 3 presents the perfor-\nmance of different language models on the Hel-\nlaSwag task for the Korean language. The table\nincludes the model name, the number of parameters\nin each model, and their respective performance at\ndifferent number of shots on the HellaSwag task\nusing the KOBEST dataset. The evaluation metric\nused is the F1 score. According to the table, our\n12.8B model achieves the highest scores for the 5-\nshot, 10-shot, and 50-shot scenarios, with F1 scores\nof 0.6306, 0.6098, and 0.6118, respectively. How-\never, in the 0-shot scenario, kakaobrain\u2019s kogpt\nmodel achieves the highest score of 0.5590. Over-\nall, our 12.8B model demonstrates the best perfor-\nmance among the listed models on the HellaSwag\ntask for the Korean language. These results high-\nlight the effectiveness of our 12.8B model in under-\nstanding and generating coherent responses within\nthe context of the HellaSwag task. Its superior\nperformance in the majority of the shot scenarios\nshowcases its ability to handle complex language\nunderstanding tasks and generate contextually ap-\npropriate responses.\n4.3\nBoolQ\nIn the BoolQ task, which focuses on answering\nboolean questions, a thorough analysis of the re-\nsults demonstrates that our models outperformed\nthe others. Specifically, our largest model, Polyglot-\nko-12.8B, achieved the highest F1 scores. This\nindicates that the model possesses exceptional ac-\ncuracy in predicting answers to boolean questions.\nConversely, SKT\u2019s ko-gpt-trinity model exhibited\nrelatively lower F1 scores across all prompt num-\nbers, while Facebook\u2019s XGLM model consistently\nunderperformed. As a result, our models demon-\nstrate strong performance in the BoolQ task.\n4.4\nSentiNeg\nThe SentiNeg task results are also presented in\nthe left portion of Table 4. This task focuses on\nsentiment analysis for negation detection. A com-\nprehensive analysis of the results reveals that our\nmodels exhibited superior performance. In par-\nticular, our 12.8B model achieved the highest F1\nscores, indicating its excellent ability to accurately\ndetect negated sentiment.\nSKT\u2019s ko-gpt-trinity\nmodel also showed consistent improvement, while\nkakaobrain\u2019s KoGPT model demonstrated varied\nperformance with slight increases or decreases in\nF1 scores depending on the prompt number. How-\never, Facebook\u2019s XGLM model consistently dis-\nplayed lower performance in the SentiNeg task.\nFurthermore, during our investigation, we dis-\ncovered that the default prompt used for this task\nintroduced significant instability, particularly in\nzero-shot performance. To address this issue, we\ndevised a modified prompt, which led to substantial\nimprovements in the model\u2019s performance. For de-\ntailed results, please refer to the Appendix. Overall,\nour models demonstrate strong performance in the\nSentiNeg task, showcasing their effectiveness in\nsentiment analysis and negation detection.\nWhen analyzing the performance of Polyglot-\nKo models only in the 5-shot evaluation across all\nfour tasks, it becomes clear that the performance\nimproves with increasing compute(Kaplan et al.,\n2020) as depicted in Figure 2.\n5\nLimitations and Disclaimers\nPolyglot-Ko has been primarily trained to optimize\nnext token prediction, which makes it suitable for\na wide range of tasks. However, it is crucial to ac-\nknowledge the potential for unexpected outcomes.\nWhile Polyglot-Ko strives to generate the most sta-\ntistically likely response, it may not always provide\nthe most accurate or factual answer. It is important\nto exercise caution when relying on the model\u2019s\noutputs.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that Polyglot-Ko\nmay generate content that is socially unacceptable\nor offensive. To mitigate this risk, we strongly rec-\nommend implementing a human curator or employ-\ning other filtering mechanisms to censor sensitive\nor inappropriate content. Regarding the hardware\nused for training, it is important to mention that\nthe models were trained on a hardware setup with\nrelatively low TFLOPS compared to the upcoming\nversions of Polyglot that we are currently preparing.\nThis resulted in longer training time and resources\nto complete the training process successfully.\nFurthermore, we discovered mistakes in the\ndata preprocessing phase during our experiments.\nSpecifically, the data was incorrectly stripped of\nnewlines, leading to a loss of document structure.\nThis likely resulted in some information loss dur-\ning the model training process. It is important to\naddress this issue in future iterations to ensure the\npreservation of document structure and minimize\ninformation loss. These considerations highlight\nthe importance of continuously improving the train-\ning process and addressing any limitations or errors\nthat arise. By doing so, we can enhance the per-\nformance and reliability of Polyglot-Ko for a wide\nrange of tasks and applications.\n6\nConclusion\nCurrently, we are actively working on training\nthe new version of the Polyglot Korean language\nmodel. Our aim is to expand its capacity to even-\ntually reach 40B parameters. This process has in-\nvolved significant trial and error as we strive to\nenhance the performance and capabilities of the\nmodel.\nBased on our experience and expertise in de-\nveloping Korean language models, we have also\nembarked on the creation of two types of multi-\nlingual models. The first type is an East-Asian\nmodel, which includes Korean, Chinese, Japanese,\nIndonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, and English.\nThis model aims to cater to the linguistic needs of\ncountries in the East-Asian region.\nThe second type is a Romance model, which\nincorporates Spanish, Portuguese, French, Roma-\nnian, and Italian. This model is designed to support\nthe linguistic requirements of Romance language-\nspeaking countries.\nBy developing these multilingual models, we\naim to democratize and promote access to language\nmodel technology across the globe. We believe\nthat this will contribute to the advancement of re-\nsearch and academics in various countries, allow-\ning users to leverage the power of language models\nfor diverse applications and linguistic contexts. We\nare excited about the potential impact and benefits\nthese models can bring to researchers, practitioners,\nand language enthusiasts worldwide.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Stability AI for generously pro-\nviding the essential computing resources that were\ninstrumental in the successful execution of this\nproject.

Our framework con-\nsists of two modules: PAIRRANKER and GEN-\nFUSER, addressing the observation that opti-\nmal LLMs for different examples can signif-\nicantly vary.\nPAIRRANKER employs a spe-\ncialized pairwise comparison method to dis-\ntinguish subtle differences between candidate\noutputs. It jointly encodes the input text and\na pair of candidates, using cross-attention en-\ncoders to determine the superior one. Our re-\nsults demonstrate that PAIRRANKER exhibits\nthe highest correlation with ChatGPT-based\nranking. Then, GENFUSER aims to merge the\ntop-ranked candidates, generating an improved\noutput by capitalizing on their strengths and\nmitigating their weaknesses. To facilitate large-\nscale evaluation, we introduce a benchmark\ndataset, MixInstruct, which is a mixture\nof multiple instruction datasets featuring oracle\npairwise comparisons. Our LLM-BLEND E R\nsignificantly outperform individual LLMs and\nbaseline methods across various metrics, estab-\nlishing a substantial performance gap.\n1 2\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown im-\npressive performance in diverse tasks, primarily\ndue to their capacity to follow instructions and ac-\ncess extensive, high-quality data, showing a promis-\ning future for artificial general intelligence (Bubeck\net al., 2023). However, prominent LLMs such as\nGPT-4 and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) are\nclosed-source, restricting insights into their archi-\ntectures and training data. Open-source LLMs like\n1https://yuchenlin.xyz/LLM-Blender\n2The experiments on summarization, translation, and con-\nstrained generation tasks in the prior version have been moved\nto the appendix. Instead, we mainly present our work in the\ncontext of instruction-following data and LLMs in this version.\nOpen \nAssistant\n12.61%\nKoala\n6.71%\nAlpaca\n11.61%\nBaize\n11.61%\nStableLM\n1.90%\nFLAN-T5\n0.80%\nVicuna\n21.22%\nDolly V2\n4.50%\nMOSS\n12.91%\nChatGLM\n8.51%\nMPT\n7.61%\nPercentage of Examples Where Each Model Ranks First\nWhich LLM \nshould I use\nfor my input?\nAll! I can \nensemble!\nFigure 1: Motivation of ensembling LLMs. Based on\nthis pie chart about the percentage of examples where\neach LLM ranks 1st, we can see that optimal LLMs for\ndifferent examples can significantly vary.\nPythia (Biderman et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron\net al., 2023), and Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022) of-\nfer a chance to fine-tune these models on custom\ninstruction datasets, enabling the development of\nsmaller yet efficient LLMs, such as Alpaca, Vi-\ncuna (Chiang et al., 2023), OpenAssistant (LAION-\nAI, 2023), and MPT (MosaicML, 2023).\nThe open-source LLMs exhibit diverse strengths\nand weaknesses due to variations in data, archi-\ntectures, and hyperparameters, making them com-\nplementary to each other. Figure 1 illustrates the\ndistribution of best LLMs on 5,000 instructions that\nwe collected. More ranking details can be found\nin Sec. 5.1. Although Vicuna achieves the highest\npercentage, it ranks first in only 21.22% of the ex-\namples. Furthermore, the pie chart suggests that\nthe optimal LLMs for different examples can sig-\nnificantly vary and there is no open-source LLM\narXiv:2306.02561v3  [cs.CL]  30 Jun 2023\nthat dominates the competition. Therefore, it is\nimportant to dynamically ensemble these LLMs\nto generate consistently better responses for each\ninput. Considering the diverse strengths and weak-\nnesses of LLMs, it is crucial to develop an ensem-\nbling method that harnesses their complementary\npotentials, leading to improved robustness, gener-\nalization, and accuracy. By combining their unique\ncontributions, we can alleviate biases, errors, and\nuncertainties in individual LLMs, resulting in out-\nputs better aligned with human preferences.\nWe introduce\nLLM-BL E N D E R, an ensem-\nbling framework designed to achieve consistently\nsuperior performance by mixing the outputs of\nmultiple LLMs. LLM-BL E N D E R comprises two\nmodules: PAIRRANKER and GENFUSER.\nIni-\ntially, PAIRRANKER compares the outputs from\nN LLMs, which GENFUSER then fuses to gener-\nate the final output from the top K ranked outputs.\nExisting approaches (Ravaut et al., 2022a; Liu\nand Liu, 2021), including the reward model within\nInstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), for ranking out-\nputs {y1, . . . , yN} from language models (LMs) on\na given input x have mostly focused on individually\nscoring each yi based on x, employing encoding\nmodules in the form of si = f\u03d5(x, yi). Although\nthis list-wise ranking objective can be powerful\nand efficient when candidate differences are appar-\nent, it may not be as effective when ensembling\nLLMs. Among the output candidates from LLMs,\ncandidate differences can be quite subtle, as they\nare all produced by very sophisticated models and\none may only be marginally better than another.\nEven for humans, it can be challenging to gauge\ncandidate quality without direct comparison.\nAs a result, we propose a specialized pairwise\ncomparison method, PAIRRANKER (Sec. 3), to\neffectively discern subtle differences between can-\ndidate outputs and enhance ranking performance.\nIn particular, we first gather the outputs from N\nmodels (e.g., the N = 11 models in Fig. 1) for each\ninput and subsequently create the N(N \u2212 1)/2\npairs of their outputs. We jointly encode the input\nx and the two candidate outputs yi and yj as input\nto a cross-attention encoder (e.g., RoBERTa (Liu\net al., 2019)), in the form of f\u03d5(x, yi, yj), to learn\nand determine which candidate is better.\nDuring the inference stage, we compute a ma-\ntrix containing logits representing pairwise com-\nparison results. Given this matrix, we can infer\na ranking of the N outputs for the given input x.\nSubsequently, we can employ the top-ranked can-\ndidate from PAIRRANKER for each input as the\nfinal result. Hence, this approach does not rely\non a single model for all examples; instead, PAIR-\nRANKER selects the best model for each example\nby comprehensively comparing all candidate pairs.\nNonetheless, this approach may constrain the\npotential to generate even better outputs than the\nexisting candidates. To investigate this possibility,\nwe introduce the GENFUSER (Sec. 4) module to\nfuse the top K of the N ranked candidates and gen-\nerate an improved output for end-users. Our goal is\nto capitalize on the strengths of the top K selected\ncandidates while mitigating their weaknesses.\nTo assess the effectiveness of LLM ensembling\nmethods, we introduce a benchmark dataset called\nMixInstruct (Sec. 2.2). In this dataset, we\nuse N=11 popular open-source LLMs to generate\nN candidates for each input across various exist-\ning instruction-following tasks formatted as self-\ninstruct (Wang et al., 2022). The dataset comprises\n100k training examples and 5k validation examples\nfor training a candidate ranking module like our\nPAIRRANKER, and 5k test examples with oracle\ncomparisons for automatic evaluation.\nIn\nSection\n5,\nour\nempirical\nresults\non\nthe MixInstruct benchmark reveal that the\nLLM-BLENDER framework significantly boosts\noverall performance by ensembling LLMs. The\nselections made by PAIRRANKER outperform any\nfixed individual LLM models, as indicated by su-\nperior performance in both reference-based met-\nrics and GPT-Rank. By leveraging the top selec-\ntions from PAIRRANKER, GENFUSER further en-\nhances response quality through effective fusion\ninto the final output. LLM-BLENDER achieves\nthe highest scores in terms of both conventional\nmetrics (i.e., BERTScore, BARTScore, BLUERT)\nand ChatGPT-based ranking. The average rank\nof LLM-BLENDER stands at 3.2 among the 12\nmethods, which is considerably better than the best\nLLM\u2019s rank of 3.90. Moreover, LLM-BLENDER\u2019s\noutput ranks in the top 3 for 68.59% of examples,\nwhile Viccuna only reaches 52.88%. We believe\nLLM-BLENDER and our findings would benefit\nboth practitioners and researchers for deploying\nand studying LLMs with ensemble learning.\n2\nPreliminaries\nWe first provide the problem formulation and two\ncommon types of ensembling methods.

For each input x from users, we employ N different LLMs to get\noutput candidates. Then, we pair all candidates and concatenate them with the input before feeding them to\nPAIRRANKER, producing a matrix as comparison results. By aggregating the results in the matrix, we can then rank\nall candidates and take the top K of them for generative fusion. The GENFUSER module concatenates the input x\nwith the K top-ranked candidates as input and generate the final output \u02c6y.\npresent the dataset MixInstruct created for\ntraining and evaluation purposes. Finally, we give\nan overview of our framework.\n2.1\nProblem Setup\nGiven an input x and N models, {M1, . . . , MN},\nwe can generate N candidate outputs by processing\nx with each model. We denote the candidates as\nY = {y1, . . . , yN}. In the training data, we assume\nthere is a ground truth output, y, while it remains\nhidden during evaluation at test time.\nIn practice, one might choose a fixed model, such\nas M9, to infer all unseen examples (i.e., always\nusing y9 as the final output for x). This can be\nreasonable if M9 demonstrates significantly better\noverall performance on certain observed examples.\nHowever, relying on a pre-selected model may re-\nsult in sub-optimal performance, as the N models\nlikely possess different strengths and weaknesses in\nvarious situations, meaning that the optimal selec-\ntion for different x values may not always originate\nfrom the same model.\nOur objective is to develop an ensemble learning\nmethod that produces an output \u02c6y for the input x,\nmaximizing the similarity Q(\u02c6y, y; x). The Q func-\ntion can be implemented in various ways, which we\nwill discuss later. We anticipate that this method\nwill yield better overall performance than using a\nfixed model or randomly selecting a model for x.\nSpecifically, given a test set Dtest = {(x(i), y(i))},\nwe aim to maximize \u2211i Q(\u02c6y(i), y(i); x(i)).\nThere are two primary approaches for ensem-\nbling LLMs: selection-based and generation-based\nmethods. Selection-based methods compare can-\ndidates in the set Y, selecting the top-ranked can-\nSources\n#Examples\nSource\nI/O Tokens\nAlpaca-GPT4\n22,862\nGPT-4\n22 / 48\nDolly-15K\n7,584\nHuman\n24 / 53\nGPT4All-LAION\n76,552\nChatGPT\n18 / 72\nShareGPT\n3,002\nChatGPT\n36 / 63\nTotal\n110K\nMix\n20 / 66\nTable 1: Statistics of MixInstruct.\nIt contains\n110K examples and we randomly split the dataset into\ntrain/dev/test in 100K/5K/5K sizes.\ndidate as the final output \u02c6y, which implies that\n\u02c6y \u2208 Y.\nDue to the inherent nature of selec-\ntion and the limited solution space, the perfor-\nmance of selection-based methods is bounded by\nthe N candidates being considered. Conversely,\ngeneration-based methods focus on fusing K can-\ndidates (1 < K \u2264 N) from Y to produce an unseen\nresponse as the final output \u02c6y.\n2.2\nMixInstruct: A New Benchmark\nWe introduce a new dataset, MixInstruct,\nto benchmark ensemble models for LLMs in\ninstruction-following tasks. We collect a large-\nscale set of instruction examples primarily from\nfour sources, as shown in Table 1. After curating\nand processing this open-source data, we sample\n100k examples for training, 5k for validation, and\n5k for testing. We then run N = 11 popular open-\nsource LLMs, including Vicuna, OpenAssistant,\nAlpaca, MPT, and others (see Table 2 and Figure 1),\non these 110k examples.\nTo obtain the oracle ranking of candidates, we\ndesign comparative prompts for ChatGPT to evalu-\nate all candidate pairs. Specifically, for each exam-\nple, we prepare 55 pairs of candidates (11 \u00d7 10/2).\nFor each pair, we ask ChatGPT to judge the better\ncandidate (or declare a tie). The prompt template\ncan be found in the appendix. For the training and\nvalidation sets, we provide the results based on con-\nventional metrics like BERTScore, BLEURT, and\nBARTScore. In that case, we use function Q(yi, y)\nto estimate a candidate yi\u2019s quality according to its\nsimilarity to the ground truth y.\n2.3\nLLM-BL E N D E R: A Novel Framework\nWe propose a rank-and-fuse pipeline framework,\nLLM-BL E N D E R, for ensembling LLMs, as illus-\ntrated in Figure 2. This framework consists of\ntwo main components: a pairwise ranking module,\nPAIRRANKER (Section 3), and a fusion module,\nGENFUSER (Section 4). The PAIRRANKER mod-\nule learns to compare all pairs of candidates for\neach input and subsequently rank the list of can-\ndidates. We then select the top K = 3 ranked\ncandidates, concatenate them with the input x, and\nconstruct the input sequence for the GENFUSER\nmodule. The GENFUSER module, a seq2seq LM,\nultimately generates the final output to serve users.\n3\nPAIRRANKER: Pairwise Ranking\nIn this section, we introduce three baseline methods\nfor ranking the candidates in Y in Sec. 3.1 and\npresent the proposed PAIRRANKER method.\n3.1\nBaseline Methods\nPrevious reranking methods primarily focus on\ncomputing the score si = f\u03d5(x, yi) for each can-\ndidate yi \u2208 Y independently, where si is solely\ndetermined by yi. Notably, the reward model in in-\nstruction tuning for GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022)\nalso belongs to this category. Figure 3 illustrates\nthese baseline methods, which are further detailed\nin the following paragraphs.\nMLM-Scoring (Salazar et al., 2020) assesses the\nquality of a candidate by calculating its pseudo-log-\nlikelihood, which is obtained by masking tokens\none by one and computing the log-likelihood for\nthe masked token using masked LMs (e.g., BERT).\nGiven a candidate yi as a sequence of words W =\n{w1, ..., w\u2223W\u2223}, the pseudo-log-likelihood is: si =\n\u2211\n\u2223W\u2223\nt=1 log P(wt\u2223W\\t). This unsupervised method\nis effective for reranking outputs in NLG tasks such\nas machine translation and speech recognition.\nSimCLS (Liu and Liu, 2021) encodes the in-\nput x and each generated candidate yi \u2208 Y us-\ning the same encoder H, resulting in H(x) and\nH(yi). The cosine similarity between them, si =\ncos (H(x), H(yi)), serves as the predicted score,\nas H(x) and H(yi) share the same embedding\nspace induced by the language encoder. In training,\nmarginal ranking loss is used to optimize H.\nSummaReranker (Ravaut et al., 2022a) con-\ncatenates the input x and each candidate yi, using\na cross-attention encoder to learn ranking. Specifi-\ncally, they employ H([x; yi]) to predict the score\nsi, where H is a Transformer model. In the training\nstage, binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss is employed\nto differentiate the best candidate from the others.\nLimitations.\nDespite using contrastive loss in\ntraining, these methods rely on individual scoring\nfor inference. The encoders have not been exposed\nto pairs of candidates for direct comparison learn-\ning. We argue that such pointwise ranking methods\nmay be insufficient for selecting the best candidates\nin the context of LLMs and instruction-following\ntasks. One reason is that the quality of LLM out-\nputs is generally high when the chosen LLMs are\npopular and competitive. Moreover, the responses\nfor instruction tasks can be quite open-ended, un-\nlike summarization tasks. Therefore, merely ex-\namining individual candidates may not yield a re-\nliable score. This issue becomes more prominent\nfor shorter responses, where sequences may dif-\nfer by only a few words but vary significantly in\nhelpfulness, harmfulness, and fairness. Given these\nlimitations, we contend that individual scoring ap-\nproaches may fail to capture crucial nuances.\n3.2\nPairwise Comparisons\nIn order to address the limitations of pointwise\nranking, we aim to train a ranker f with parameter\n\u03d5 that can compare a pair of output candidates by\nencoding them together with the input text. Our\nranker module should focus on learning to capture\nthe differences between the two candidates and\nprefer the ones of higher quality.\nGiven a pair of candidates yi, yj, we obtain their\npair-specific scores: si\n(i,j) and sj\n(i,j). We denote the\nmodel\u2019s confidence in thinking yi is better than yj\nas sij = si\n(i,j) \u2212 sj\n(i,j). We can use these scores for\nall pairs induced from Y to infer the final ranking.\nTo learn this ability, we concatenate the input x and\nthe two candidates to form a sequence [x; yi; yj]\nand feed it into a cross-attention Transformer to get\nthe features: f\u03d5([x; yi; yj]) for modeling sij.\nWe assume multiple Q functions to optimize\nPairRanker\n\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc77\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8b\ud835\udc8b\nMLM-Scoring\n\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\ny\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\nSimCLS\n\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\nSummaReranker\n\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc77\n\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\n\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\ncosine\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\nranking loss\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94(\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a,\ud835\udc8b\ud835\udc8b)\n\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94(\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a,\ud835\udc8b\ud835\udc8b)\n\ud835\udc8b\ud835\udc8b\nBCE\nloss\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc8e\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8a\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94\nBCE\nloss\nshuffle\nunsupervised\nFigure 3: The architectures of typical reranking methods. x is an input and yi is a certain candidate, and its score\nis si. MLM-Scoring is an unsupervised method that uses an external masked LM to score a candidate; SimCLS uses\nthe same encoder to encode x and each candidate yi; SummaReranker instead employs a cross-encoder to encode\nboth x and yi at the same time; PAIRRANKER encodes a pair of candidates (yi, yj) at the same time for pairwisely\nscoring them, and the final score of each candidate is produced as shown in Fig. 4.\nfor, such as BERTScore, BARTScore, etc., and\nconsider the learning problem as a multi-task clas-\nsification problem:\nLQ = \u2212zi log \u03c3(si\n(i,j)) \u2212 zj log \u03c3(sj\n(i,j)),\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the sigmoid function and\n(zi, zj) = {(1, 0),\nQ(yi, y) \u2265 Q(yj, y)\n(0, 1),\nQ(yi, y) < Q(yj, y) .\nFor optimizing towards multiple Q, we take the av-\nerage as the final multi-objective loss: L = \u2211 LQ.\n3.3\nPAIRRANKER Architecture\nWe discuss the concrete designs for the PAIR-\nRANKER module in this subsection.\nEncoding.\nWe employ Transformer layers to\nencode an input and a pair of candidates, en-\nabling the attentions to capture the difference be-\ntween candidates in the context of the input. We\nconcatenate the three segments sequentially and\nform a single input sequence with special tokens\nas separators:\n<source>, <candidate1>,\nand <candidate2>.\nThe resulting input se-\nquences to Transformers are in the form of\n\u201c<s><source> x </s> <candidate1> yi\n</s> <candidate2> yj </s>\u201d, where x is\nthe text of a source input and yi and yj are the\ntext of two output candidates. The embeddings of\nspecial tokens <source>, <candidate1>, and\n<candidate2> are used as the representations\nof x, yi, and yj respectively, denoted as x, yi, yj.\nTraining.\nTo determine the scores for the two\ncandidates, we concatenate the embeddings of x\nwith yi and yj respectively, and pass them through\na single-head layer, which is a multi-layer percep-\ntron with the final layer\u2019s dimension equal to the\nnumber of Q functions to be optimized. Each value\nwithin this dimension represents a computed Q\nscore for a specific Q function. We derive the final\nscore si\n(i,j) or sj\n(i,j) for the candidate by averaging\nthese Q scores. Since there are O(N2) unique pair\ncombinations, we apply an effective sub-sampling\nstrategy during the training stage to ensure learning\nefficiency.\nDuring training, we randomly select some com-\nbinations from the candidate pool Y2, instead of\nall the N(N \u2212 1)/2 pairs. We also compare the\ntarget text with other candidates by extending the\ncandidate pool by mixing the ground truth y into Y.\nIn practice, we found that using 5 pairs per input is\nsufficient for obtaining decent results.\nDue to the position embeddings of the lan-\nguage model, the order of the candidates in a\npair (x, yi, yj) matters, as the comparison result of\n(x, yi, yj) and (x, yj, yi) might not be consistent.\nThus, we shuffle the order of candidates within\neach training pair so that the model learns to be\nconsistent with itself.\nInference.\nDuring the inference stage, we obtain\nscores sij for each pair of candidates (yi, yj) \u2208 Y2.\nAfter N(N \u2212 1) iterations, we obtain a matrix M,\nwhere Mj\ni = sij represents the confidence that yi is\nbetter than yj. To identify the best candidate based\non M, we introduce three aggregation functions\nfor determining the final ranking of Y.\nWe propose two scoring methods, MaxLogits\nand MaxWins, which utilize all elements in the\nmatrix. Let M\u2217\ni and Mj\n\u2217 denote the i-th row and\nj-th column of the matrix as vectors. For each\ncandidate yi, its MaxLogits score is defined as\nsi = \u2211 (M\u2217\ni \u2212 Mi\n\u2217), while its MaxWins score is\ndefined as si = \u2223{sij \u2208 M\u2217\ni \u2223sij > 0}\u2223 + \u2223{sji \u2208\nMi\n\u2217\u2223sji < 0}\u2223, where \u2223\u2223 denotes the set size.\nIn essence, MaxLogits computes the confi-\ndence that yi is superior to all other candidates,\nwhereas MaxWins calculates the number of victo-\nries in comparisons with other candidates.\nHowever, these two methods necessitate O(N2)\niterations for N candidates, which can be compu-\ntationally burdensome. Thus, we propose a more\nefficient aggregation method, performing a single\nbubble sort run with pairwise comparisons to se-\nlect the best candidate. We first shuffle the order of\ncandidates in Y to obtain a default order, and initial-\nize the best candidate index k to 1. We iteratively\nupdate the best candidate index as follows:\nk = {\nk,\nM\ni\nk \u2212 M\nk\ni > 0\ni,\nM\nk\ni \u2212 M\ni\nk > 0 .\nAfter N \u2212 1 comparisons, we select yk as the best\ncandidate. This method reduces the inference time\ncomplexity from O(N2) to O(N), aligning with\nprevious pointwise methods.\nRegardless of the aggregation method, we can\nrank all candidates in Y. Our experiments (shown\nin the appendix) reveal that MaxLogits yields\nthe best performance, so we use MaxLogits as\nthe default aggregator for PAIRRANKER.\n4\nGENFUSER: Generative Fusion\nThe effectiveness of PAIRRANKER is constrained\nby the quality of selections from the candidate\npool Y.

We name this GPT-\nbased ranking metric with GPT-Rank.\nModel training.\nWe use the DeBERTa (He et al.,\n2021) (400m) as the backbone for PAIRRANKER,\nand GENFUSER is based on Flan-T5-XL (3b).\nAccording to our ablation studies, we choose to\nuse BARTScore for its superior correlation with\nGPT-Rank as shown in 5.2.\n5.2\nMain results\nIn Table 2, we present the overall performance\nof N=11 LLMs as well as other methods on\nMixInstruct. In addition to the three auto met-\nrics and GPT-Rank, we also show the percentage of\nexamples where each method can produce outputs\nthat are better than or same good as the two top\nLLMs, namely OpenAssistant (\u2265OA) and Vicuna\n(\u2265Vic), in terms of GPT-Rank.\nLLMs have diverse strengths and weakness.\nThe table presents the LLMs in a sorted order\nbased on their average rank as determined by Chat-\nGPT (GPT-Rank). Among these models, Open\nAssistant, Vicuna, and Alpaca are the top-3 per-\nformers. Following them, three renowned LLMs,\nnamely Baize, Moss, and ChatGLM, which have\nbeen fine-tuned using both Chinese and English in-\nstruction data, also exhibit impressive performance\non MixInstruct. Conversely, Mosaic MPT, Sta-\nbleLM, and Flan-T5 rank at the bottom-3 in the\nevaluation. Nevertheless, the average GPT-Rank\nof top/bottom models maintain a noticeable dis-\ntance from the first/last position (1 or 11), high-\nlighting the importance of ensembling LLMs.\nTop LLMs are not always good.\nIt is evident\nthat although OA and Vic perform remarkably well,\nthere is still a substantial percentage of examples\nwhere other LLMs are considered to outperform\nthem. For instance, despite Koala having an av-\nerage GPT-Rank of 6.76, approximately 40% of\nthe examples demonstrate that Koala produces re-\nsponses that are better or equally as good as both\nOA and Vic. This further emphasizes the signif-\nicance of employing our LLM-BLENDER frame-\nwork for ranking and fusion purposes.\nNLG Metrics.\nMoreover, we conduct a com-\nprehensive analysis of the performance of ora-\ncle (top-1) selections based on each of the met-\nrics themselves. The findings demonstrate that\nthese selections also exhibit favorable performance\nacross other metrics as well. For example, the or-\nacle selections derived from GPT-Rank achieve\na BARTScore of \u22123.33, surpassing that of OA\n(\u22123.45).\nConversely, the oracle selections of\nBARTScore yield 3.69 in GPT-Rank, also signifi-\ncantly outperforming OA (3.90). This observation\nsubstantiates the rationality of using BARTScore\nto provide supervision for PAIRRANKER, which is\nalso suggested by Table 3.\nPAIRRANKER\noutperforms\nother\nrankers.\nMLM-Scoring fails to outperform even random\nselection, highlighting the limitations of its un-\nsupervised paradigm.

More-\nover, it achieves impressive results in metrics such\nas BARTScore (\u22123.14) with a substantial advan-\ntage. PAIRRANKER\u2019s selections are better than or\nequal to Vic/OA on 54.76%/57.79% examples re-\nspectively, and ranks in top 3 for 65.12% examples.\nLLM-BL E N D E R is the best.\nWe use top-3 selec-\ntions from the PAIRRANKER and feed them as\ncandidates for GENFUSER. Based on this inte-\ngration, LLM-BL E N D E R demonstrates remarkable\ncapabilities as expected. In terms of GPT-Rank,\nit achieves 3.01, surpassing both the best model\nOA (3.90) by a significant margin. The scores\nfor BERTScore (79.09), BARTScore (\u22123.02), and\nBELURT (\u22120.17) all exceed the best model by\n4.41, 0.43, and 0.22 respectively, showcasing sub-\nstantial advantages. Moreover, LLM-BLENDER\nalso performs well in surpassing the top two mod-\nels, Vic (70.73) and OA (77.72), thereby comple-\nmenting the weaknesses of PAIRRANKER.\nRanking correlation.\nIn addition to focusing\nsolely on the top-1 selection of each ranker, we\npresent a comprehensive analysis of the overall\nrank correlation among all the candidates with\nGPT-Rank (see Table 3). The correlation metrics\nused here include the Pearson Correlation Coef-\nficient, Spearman\u2019s Correlation, and Spearman\u2019s\nFootrule distance(Diaconis and Graham, 1977).\nIt turns out that BARTScore gets the highest\ncorrelation with GPT-Rank against other metrics,\nwhich suggests we use BARTScore to provide su-\npervision for training. For rankers, MLM-Scoring\nstill falls short of outperforming random permuta-\ntions. On the other side, SummaReranker demon-\nstrates better correlation in terms of the Pearson\nCorrelation (41.13) and Spearman\u2019s Correlation\n(39.10), while SimCLS gets a better Spearman\u2019s\nFootrule distance (29.32) Notably, PAIRRANKER\nachieves the highest correlation with GPT-Rank\nacross all correlation types, which is even way bet-\nter than the BARTScore.\nMore analysis.\nWe leave many other ablation\nstudies and analyses in Appendix, where we ap-\nply PAIRRANKER to the three typical natural lan-\nguage generation (NLG) tasks: summarization\n(CNN/DM), machine translation (WMT18-zh-en),\nand constrained text generation (CommonGen).\nWe find that PAIRRANKER still outperforms other\nmethods by a large margin in the context of us-\ning a single same base model to decode N candi-\ndates (with different algorithms). We also show\nthat MaxLogits is much better than MaxWins\nand the bubble sort method is very cost-effective if\nthe inference efficiency is a big concern.\n6\nRelated Work\nLLM evaluation\nAs open-source large language\nmodels (LLMs) continue to flourish and demon-\nstrate remarkable competitiveness across various\nnatural language generation (NLG) tasks, assessing\nthe capabilities of LLMs has become an exceed-\ningly challenging endeavor. To address this issue,\nZheng et al. (2023) pioneered the creation of a chat-\nbot arena, enabling users to provide pairwise eval-\nuations of responses generated by two randomly\nselected LLMs. Based on these evaluations, they\nestablished an LLM Elo rating leaderboard. In a\nsimilar vein, Cabrera and Neubig (2023) conducted\nan evaluation study on a customer service dataset,\nleveraging automated metrics such as BERTScore\nand ChrF (Popovi\u00b4c, 2015). This approach yielded\nsimilar LLM ranking results. Instead of relying\nsolely on human evaluation, Yidong et al. (2023)\ndeveloped a fine-tuned model called PandaLM to\ncompare responses generated by different LLMs.\nAlpacaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023) also aims to eval-\nuate LLMs with pairwise feedback.\nPairwise ranking\nPairwise ranking, known for\nits long-standing effectiveness, has demonstrated\nexceptional performance across a wide array of\nNLP tasks (Jamieson and Nowak, 2011).\nNo-\ntably, Ranknet (Burges et al., 2005) and Lamb-\ndaRank (Burges, 2010) have emerged as pow-\nerful techniques for various ranking problems.\nFurthermore, within the renowned RLHF proce-\ndure(Ouyang et al., 2022), these methods incorpo-\nrate pairwise training of their reward model based\non OPT. However, these approaches still compute\nscores individually and solely undergo pairwise\ntraining at the loss level. In contrast, our proposed\nPAIRRERANKER not only employs pairwise train-\ning but also utilizes the attention mechanism for\npairwise inference during the inference stage. We\nposit that this approach better captures the sub-\ntleties between candidates and yields superior re-\nsults, as demonstrated in Section 5.2.\nEnsemble learning\nEnsemble learning is a\nwidely employed technique to enhance a model\u2019s\ncapabilities by leveraging multiple weaker mod-\nels (Sagi and Rokach, 2018; Anio\u0142 and Pietro\u00b4n,\n2019). Typically, ensemble learning is performed\neither by considering model weights or by com-\nbining diverse outputs. Mix-of-Experts (MoE) is\na type of ensemble approach that combines the\npredictions of multiple specialized sub-models to\nimprove overall performance. It has been success-\nfully applied in various domains, such as natural\nlanguage processing and computer vision (Jacobs\net al., 1991; Shazeer et al., 2017). As for fusing\nmultiple candidates, Izacard and Grave (2021) in-\ntroduced a framework named Fusion-in-Decoder\n(FiD) to improve the quality of question answer-\ning by fusing retrieved text. Building upon FiD,\nRavaut et al. (2022b) further investigated the ef-\nfectiveness of fusion in the context of text summa-\nrization. However, they neglected to incorporate\na selection process prior to feeding the candidates\ninto the fusion module, resulting in only moderate\nimprovements. In contrast, our proposed approach,\nreferred to as LLM-BL E N D E R, initially utilizes the\nPAIRRANKER algorithm to filter out candidates of\npoor quality. Subsequently, fusion is performed\nexclusively on the top-ranked candidates, leading\nto superior performance.\n7\nConclusion & Future Directions\nIn this paper, we formulated the motivation to\nexploit the diverse strengths and weaknesses of\nopen-source large language models (LLMs), aim-\ning to create an ensembling framework that lever-\nages their complementary capabilities to generate\nconsistently superior results on various instruction-\nfollowing tasks.\nBy dynamically ensembling\nLLMs, we aimed to reduce biases, errors, and un-\ncertainties in individual models, yielding outputs\nbetter aligned with human feedback.\nOur major contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 A new framework:\nLLM-BLENDER is a\npost-hoc ensemble learning method for rank-\ning and fusing the outputs from multiple\nLLMs.\nIt is composed of two modules:\nPAIRRANKER and GENFUSER, and both are\nstraightforward yet effective.\n\u2022 A new dataset:\nMixInstruct is a\nbenchmark dataset, created for training and\nevaluating LLM ensembling methods on\ninstruction-following tasks.\n\u2022 Promising results: We show that our method\ncan significantly improve the overall results\non various metrics, and our findings indicates\nthat this direction is promising for both re-\nsearch community and practitioners.\n\u2022 Toolkit: By open-sourcing our framework,\nwe aim to make it easier for others to lever-\nage our approach, enabling the development\nof more advanced AI systems that achieve\nrobustness, generalization, and enhanced ac-\ncuracy in a wide variety of tasks.\nFuture directions.\nPotential future directions in-\nclude extending the LLM-BLENDER framework to\nmore types of models or even non-text modalities,\ndeveloping more sophisticated ranking and fusion\ntechniques, and investigating the transferability of\nour ensembling approach to other domains and\ntasks. Additionally, exploring ways to minimize\ncomputational overhead and incorporating active\nlearning strategies for rapid adaptation to new spe-\ncialized domains and data sources represent fruit-\nful areas for further research. Overall, our work\nunderscores the value of combining the unique con-\ntributions of multiple models.\n*Limitations\nEfficiency.\nTo get the optimal performance from\nPAIRRANKER, one may need to call the model\nO(n2) times for getting the full matrix, thus result-\ning in a much less efficient solution. We attempted\nto resolve this limitation by proposing to use mul-\ntiple rounds of bubble sort methods to reduce the\nnumber of inferences needed, and we find it works\npretty well. We also want to argue that although\nthe number of inferences can be large for obtaining\nthe best performance with PAIRRANKER, those in-\nferences can be executed in parallel because they\nare totally independent.\nHuman evaluation.\nWe agree that automatic\nmetrics have limitations. Human evaluation could\nprovide us with more reliable and comprehensive\nevaluation results. However, due to the number\nof models as well as the amounts of generation\ncandidates, we cannot afford large-scale human\nevaluation. We argue that our use of ChatGPT for\nevaluation is a good alternative, according to recent\nstudies. Also, we would like to highlight that we\nshow the ground truths when using ChatGPT to do\npairwise comparisions, which is quite informative\nthan the common practice.\n*Ethical Statement\nThis work fully complies with the ACL Ethics Pol-\nicy. We declare that there are no ethical issues in\nthis paper, to the best of our knowledge.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank members of the INK lab at USC and the\nMosaic team at AI2 for valuable feedback on this\nproject.

Judging\nllm-as-a-judge with mt-bench and chatbot arena.\nAppendix\nA\nImplementation Details\nPAIRRANKER\nWe train our ranker for 5 epochs.\nWe use the Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer and\nStern, 2018), with the maximum learning rate be-\ning 1e-5. The warm-up ratio is 5% with a lin-\near learning rate scheduler. Our training batch\nsize is 64.\nThe training finishes on a single\nRTX 8000 GPU in two days.\nThe backbone\nof PAIRRANKER is Deberta-v3-large (He et al.,\n2021). Unlike the mixture-of-experts layer used\nin the work of Ravaut et al. (2022a), we employ\na five-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with\nthe hyperbolic tangent activation function. The\noutput dimension of the final layer is equal to\nthe number of different metrics. In practice, we\nhave tried different special embedding combina-\ntions, such as only feeding <candidate1> and\n<candidate2>, mean pooling representation,\nand so on. And Finally, we found that concate-\nnating <source> with <candidate1>, and\n<source> with <candidate2> respectively\nachieves the best performance. We also tried differ-\nent loss types, like MSE losses and ranking losses.\nAnd we find BCE is simply good enough.\nGENFUSER\nWe use Flan-T5-large and Flan-T5-\nxl (3b) to train the top-3 bart-score selections as\ninput and then apply it with PAIRRANKER\u2019s top\n3 selections for inference. We find Flan-t5-3b per-\nforms much better than the large version, while\nflan-t5-xxl has marginal improvements yet being\nmuch larger and longer to train.\nB\nConventional Tasks\nTo quantitatively understand how sub-optimal the\ndefault selections of decoding methods are, we\npresent an empirical analysis in Fig. 5 .\nHere\nwe look at three typical NLG tasks: summariza-\ntion (CNN/DM), machine translation (WMT18),\nand constrained text generation (CommonGen),\nwith their popularly used base models: PEGA-\nSUS (Zhang et al., 2020a), Opus-MT (Tiedemann\nand Thottingal, 2020a), and T5-large (Raffel et al.,\n2020). We can see that the default selections (yel-\nlow bars in Fig. 5; the top-beam generations) are\nmuch worse than the oracle selections from the top\n15 candidate generations for each decoding method\n(blue bars).\nall *\nbs*\ndbs *\ntop-k * top-p * top beam\nOracle Types\n18\n24\n30\nRouge-2\nCNN/Daily Mail\nall *\nbs *\ndbs *\ntop-k * top-p * top beam\nOracle Types\n12\n18\n24\n30\nCIDEr\nCommon-Gen\nall *\nbs *\ndbs *\ntop-k * top-p * top beam\nOracle Types\n18\n24\n30\nBLEU\nWMT-2018\nFigure 5: The comparisions between different decoders\nand oracle selections.\nMoreover, if we combine the results from the\nfour methods as a larger candidate pool, then the\nperformance (green bars) of these NLG models\ncan be much improved. For example, the Rouge-2\nscore of PEAGUS can be improved by 57% and\nthe BLEU score for Opus-MT can be improved\nby nearly 80%, compared to their top-beam perfor-\nmance. Simply put, the default selections (i.e., the\ngenerations with the highest decoding scores) are\nmuch worse than the best selections from a rela-\ntively small candidate pool. Therefore, we argue\nthat it is of significant importance to rerank genera-\ntion candidates in order to enhance the performance\nof LMs in NLG tasks.\nWhy do decoding algorithms often overlook gen-\neration candidates of better quality? The lower\nquality of default selections is often attributed to\nthe exposure bias caused by the teacher-forcing\nparadigm in most auto-regressive models. Plus,\nthe greediness of the search process and the ran-\ndomness in sampling are also part of the reasons.\nRe-ranking has been a simple yet effective post hoc\napproach to mitigate this gap. For instance, MLM-\nscoring (Salazar et al., 2020) uses an external LM\nsuch as BERT to estimate the quality of a candidate\nwithout any supervision. SimCLS (Liu and Liu,\n2021) trains a re-ranker using a simple contrastive\ntraining objective, which encodes the source text\nand each candidate output using the same encoder\nand scores each candidate based on the cosine simi-\nlarity between the embeddings. Another successful\napproach is SummaReranker (SR) (Ravaut et al.,\n2022a), which is trained to improve the re-ranker\nfor multiple metrics simultaneously.\nC\nAdditional Results on Conventional\nTasks\nIn this section, we evaluate the PAIRRANKER with\nconventional natural language generation (NLG)\ntasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nNLG tasks (i.e., summarization, translation, and\nconstrained sentence generation) demonstrate that\nPAIRRANKER outperforms the baseline methods\nby a consistent margin and is also compatible\nwith very large language models such as GPT-3\n(text-davinci-003). PAIRRANKER not only outper-\nforms the previous state-of-the-art method Sum-\nmaReranker on the summarization task, but also\nshows great generalization performance in the other\ntwo NLG tasks, which are not evaluated previously.\nIn addition, our PAIRRANKER can be transferred\nto improve GPT-3 results by 26.53% and 11.65%\nfor CommonGen and WMT18 (zh-en) respectively,\neven though our rerankers are not trained with any\ncandidates decoded by GPT-3 models.\nC.1\nTasks and data creation\nWe evaluate reranking methods on the follow-\ning public dataset: CNN/DM, CommonGen, and\nWMT18 (zh-en). The data statistics of these bench-\nmarks are in Table 7 (in Appendix).\nCNN/DM\n(Hermann et al., 2015) is a dataset con-\nstructed from CNN and DailyMail websites. It is\nfirst used for machine-reading and comprehension,\nand later Nallapati et al. (2016) use it for abstractive\nsummarization. Evaluation metrics are Rouge-1,\nRouge-2, and Rouge-L.\nCommonGen\n(Lin et al., 2020) is a dataset used\nfor generative commonsense reasoning. It con-\ntains 79K commonsense descriptions where the\nlanguage model is required to compose a realisti-\ncally plausible sentence from given concepts. Eval-\nuation metrics are BLEU and CIDEr.\nWMT2018\n(Bojar et al., 2017) is a well-known\ndataset for evaluate machine translation. Here we\nuse the Chinese-English split for evaluation. Eval-\nuation metrics are BLEU.\nC.2\nBase models\nFor the summarization task on CNN/DailyMail\ndataset,\nwe\nuse\nthe\nfamous\nPEGASUS-\nlarge (Zhang et al., 2020a) and BART-large (Lewis\net al., 2020), which have exhibited great ability\nfor abstractive summarization. We use the public\nfine-tuned checkpoint from Hugging face. For the\ngenerative commonsense reasoning task on Com-\nmonGen dataset, we use the T5-large (Raffel et al.,\n2020). It\u2019s one of the vanilla baselines reported\nin Lin et al.

Otherwise, the reranker\nwill be trained on the candidates with higher qual-\nity compared to the candidates that it will be tested\non, which we found will result in fairly bad perfor-\nmance. Therefore, following Ravaut et al. (2022a),\nwe first fine-tune the original non-finetuned pre-\ntrained model on half of the training dataset, which\ngives us 2 half-finetuned base models that each of\nthem has only seen their own half of the training\ndataset. Then we use them to generate candidates\non their un-seen half of the training dataset using\nthe decoding method talked about before. These\ngenerated candidates together form a whole train-\ning dataset with generated candidates that resemble\nthe quality during the inference stage.\nDuring the inference stage, we directly adopt\nthe public checkpoints that have been finetuned on\nthe whole training dataset. We generate candidates\non the validation and test datasets with this public\ncheckpoint, which constitutes the validation and\ntesting datasets on which our reranker runs infer-\nence.

With fine-tuned\nPEGASUS-large as the base model. our Max Logits\nmethod improves the candidates\u2019 quality by 6.35%\nin Rouge-1, which is higher than our baseline Sum-\nmaReranker. Besides, the performance gains in\nother metrics like Rouge-2 (9.62%) and Rouge-L\n(6.25%) are also obviously better.\nCan PairReranker generalize to other genera-\ntion tasks?\nYes. In order to test the task gener-\nalization ability of our method, we here report the\ntest results on CommonGen and WMT2018 (zh-en)\nin Tab. 5 and Tab. 6. From the data in the table, our\nmethod also improves the candidates\u2019 quality sig-\nnificantly after reranking. Our Max Logits method\nobtain a 2.45% performance gain in CIDEr on the\nCommonGen dataset and a 6.12% performance\ngain in BLEU on the WMT2018 dataset. What\u2019s\nmore, it\u2019s worth noting our bubble run method\nachieves an even higher gain in CIDEr (2.91%).\nWe also report the performance of SummaR-\neranker on the two datasets. In contrast to the great\nperformance on summarization, SummaReranker\nseems to fail to generalize well on other datasets.\nWe also find that SummaReranker obtains a de-\ncreased gain on the CommonGen dataset (-1.23%\nin CIDEr). The improvement on the translation\ndataset is not obvious (0.57% in BLEU).

Therefore, the\nhigher in-group similarity brought by the shorter\nlength makes it harder for SummaReranker to cap-\nture their difference. On the contrary, our method\nwith direct attention between a pair of candidates\ncould easily tackle this problem.\nCan PairReranker generalize other large-scale\nmodels like GPT-3?\nYes. After training on an\nexpert dataset, our reranker could directly be ap-\nplied to other models\u2019 outputs selection for the\nsame task.\nTo support this, we directly apply\nour three rerankers trained on the 3 main tasks\nrespectively to the GPT-3 outputs with proper task-\nspecific prompts. We report the performance gain\nin Tab. 4, 5, and 6. From the data reported in the\ntable, we could see that the quality of the GPT-3\noutputs is improved by a large margin compared\nto the average. Also, our performance gain is sig-\nnificantly larger than the baseline SummaReranker.\nFor example, on the GPT-3 data points sampled\nfrom CNN/DM, our max logits method obtain a\ngain of 6.64%, whereas SummaReranker only ob-\ntains a gain of 4.37%. And on the CommonGen\u2019s,\nour method obtains a gain of 26.53% and SummaR-\neranker only obtains a gain of 18.79%.\nCan I make trade-offs between performance and\nnumber of comparisons?\nYes. Due to the high\ncost of full comparison methods, it\u2019s necessary for\nus to study the trade-off between the model perfor-\nmance and the number of comparisons. For full\ncomparison methods, we first initialize matrix M\nin Figure 4 to be all zeroes, Then every time of the\ncomparison, we fill a confidence cell that is zero\n0\n90\n180 270 360 450 540 630 720 810 900\n19.0\n19.5\n20.0\n20.5\nMethods\nMax Logits\nMax Wins\nBubble\n0\n90\n180 270 360 450 540 630 720 810 900\n14.8\n15.0\n15.2\n15.4\n15.6\n15.8\n16.0\nMethods\nMax Logits\nMax Wins\nBubble\n0\n90\n180 270 360 450 540 630 720 810 900\n22.0\n22.2\n22.4\n22.6\n22.8\nMethods\nMax Logits\nMax Wins\nBubble\nCNN/Daily Mail\nCommon-Gen\nWMT-2018\nRouge-2\nCIDEr\nBLEU\nNumber of comparison\nNumber of comparison\nNumber of comparison\nFigure 6: Efficiency trade-off with the number of pairwise comparisons\nbefore, then do the scoring and select the best one\nbased on the current information in the matrix.

From\nthe results, we could see bubble run method could\nachieve high performance with little cost. How-\never, as the number of comparisons increases, Max\nLogits scoring methods will surpass the bubble run\nafter a certain number of comparisons. We contend\nthat the bubble run method already reports a pretty\ngood performance with N \u22121 times of comparison.\nTherefore, most of the time, bubble run is a more\nefficient way to apply. If you want to pursue the\nmarginal improvements brought by more compar-\nison, you can also apply Max Logits method with\nparallel computing.\nC.5\nModel Further Study\nDue to the order of the input format, changing the\nposition of candidate 1 and candidate 2 might also\nchange the results (Sec. 3.3). In practice, we found\nthat by simply shuffling the order of candidate 1\nand candidate 2, our reranker could be consistent\nwith itself more than 90% of the time.\nWe analyze the model\u2019s relation between consis-\ntency as well as accuracy and the absolute pair rank\ndifference.

However, existing methods still\nstruggle to create high-fidelity 3D head avatars in two aspects: (1) They rely mostly\non a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model whilst missing the necessary 3D\nawareness and head priors. This makes them prone to inconsistency and geometric\ndistortions in the generated avatars. (2) They fall short in fine-grained editing. This\nis primarily due to the inherited limitations from the pre-trained 2D image diffusion\nmodels, which become more pronounced when it comes to 3D head avatars. In\nthis work, we address these challenges by introducing a versatile coarse-to-fine\npipeline dubbed HeadSculpt for crafting (i.e., generating and editing) 3D head\navatars from textual prompts. Specifically, we first equip the diffusion model\nwith 3D awareness by leveraging landmark-based control and a learned textual\nembedding representing the back view appearance of heads, enabling 3D-consistent\nhead avatar generations. We further propose a novel identity-aware editing score\ndistillation strategy to optimize a textured mesh with a high-resolution differentiable\nrendering technique. This enables identity preservation while following the editing\ninstruction. We showcase HeadSculpt\u2019s superior fidelity and editing capabilities\nthrough comprehensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods. \u2021\n1\nIntroduction\nModeling 3D head avatars underpins a wide range of emerging applications (e.g., digital telepresence,\ngame character creation, and AR/VR). Historically, the creation of intricate and detailed 3D head\navatars demanded considerable time and expertise in art and engineering. With the advent of deep\nlearning, existing works [87, 28, 33, 72, 8, 38, 15] have shown promising results on the reconstruction\nof 3D human heads from monocular images or videos. However, these methods remain restricted\nto head appearance contained in their training data which is often limited in size, resulting in the\ninability to generalize to new appearance beyond the training data. This constraint calls for the need\nof more flexible and generalizable methods for 3D head modeling.\nRecently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP [55]) and diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion [69,\n61, 59]) have attracted increasing interest. These progresses have led to the emergence of text-to-3D\ngenerative models [34, 62, 44, 27] which create 3D content in a self-supervised manner. Notably,\nDreamFusion [54] introduces a score distillation sampling (SDS) strategy that leverages a pre-trained\nimage diffusion model to compute the noise-level loss from the textual description, unlocking the\npotential to optimize differentiable 3D scenes (e.g., neural radiance field [45], tetrahedral mesh [66],\ntexture [58, 9], or point cloud [50]) with 2D diffusion prior only.

However, it is\nnoted that existing methods have two major drawbacks (see Fig. 6): (1) Inconsistency and geometric\ndistortions: The 2D diffusion models used in these methods lack 3D awareness particularly regarding\ncamera pose; without any remedy, existing text-to-3D methods inherited this limitation, leading to\nthe multi-face \u201cJanus\u201d problem in the generated head avatars. (2) Fine-grained editing limitations:\nAlthough previous methods propose to edit 3D models by naively fine-tuning trained models with\nmodified prompts [54, 39], we find that this approach is prone to biased outcomes, such as identity\nloss or inadequate editing. This problem arises from two causes: (a) inherent bias in prompt-based\nediting in image diffusion models, and (b) challenges with inconsistent gradient back-propagation at\nseparate iterations when using SDS calculated from a vanilla image diffusion model.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new head-avatar-focused text-to-3D method, dubbed HeadSculpt,\nthat supports high-fidelity generation and fine-grained editing. Our method comprises two novel\n2\ncomponents: (1) Prior-driven score distillation: We first arm the pre-trained image diffusion model\nwith 3D awareness by integrating a landmark-based ControlNet [84]. Specifically, we adopt the\nparametric 3D head model, FLAME [38], as a prior to obtain a 2D landmark map [41, 31], which\nserves as an additional condition for the diffusion model, ensuring the consistency of generated head\navatars across different views. Further, to remedy the front-view bias in the pre-trained diffusion\nmodel, we utilize an improved view-dependent prompt through textual inversion [17], by learning a\nspecialized <back-view> token to emphasize back views of heads and capture their unique visual\ndetails. (2) Identity-aware editing score distillation (IESD): To address the challenges of fine-grained\nediting for head avatars, we introduce a novel method called IESD. It blends two scores, one for\nediting and the other for identity preservation, both predicted by a ControlNet-based implementation\nof InstructPix2Pix [5]. This approach maintains a controlled editing direction that respects both\nthe original identity and the editing instructions. To further improve the fidelity of our method, we\nintegrate these two novel components into a coarse-to-fine pipeline [39], utilizing NeRF [48] as the\nlow-resolution coarse model and DMTET [66] as the high-resolution fine model. As demonstrated\nin Fig. 1, our method can generate high-fidelity human-like and non-human-like head avatars while\nenabling fine-grained editing, including local changes, shape/texture modifications, and style transfers.\n2\nRelated work\nText-to-2D generation. In recent years, groundbreaking vision-language technologies such as\nCLIP [55] and diffusion models [25, 13, 59, 68] have led to significant advancements in text-to-2D\ncontent generation [61, 57, 1, 69, 70]. Trained on extensive 2D multimodal datasets [63, 64], they\nare empowered with the capability to \u201cdream\u201d from the prompt. Follow-up works endeavor to\nefficiently control the generated results [84, 85, 47], extend the diffusion model to video sequence [67,\n3], accomplish image or video editing [23, 32, 81, 5, 77, 14, 22], enhance the performance for\npersonalized subjects [60, 17], etc. Although significant progress has been made in generating 2D\ncontent from text, carefully crafting the prompt is crucial, and obtaining the desired outcome often\nrequires multiple attempts. The inherent randomness remains a challenge, especially for editing tasks.\nText-to-3D generation. Advancements in text-to-2D generation have paved the way for text-to-3D\ntechniques. Early efforts [82, 27, 44, 62, 34, 29, 11] propose to optimize the 3D neural radiance field\n(NeRF) or vertex-based meshes by employing the CLIP language model. However, these models\nencounter difficulties in generating expressive 3D content, primarily because of the limitations of CLIP\nin comprehending natural language. Fortunately, the development of image diffusion models [69, 1]\nhas led to the emergence of DreamFusion [54]. It proposes Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)\nbased on a pre-trained 2D diffusion prior [61], showcasing promising generation results. Subsequent\nworks [37] have endeavored to improve DreamFusion from various aspects: Magic3D [39] proposes\na coarse-to-fine pipeline for high-resolution generations; Latent-NeRF [43] includes shape guidance\nfor more robust generation on the latent space [59]; DreamAvatar [6] leverages SMPL [4] to generate\n3D human full-body avatars under controllable shapes and poses; Guide3D [7] explores the usage\nof multi-view generated images to create 3D human avatars; Fantasia3D [10] disentangles the\ngeometry and texture training with DMTET [66] and PBR texture [49] as their 3D representation;\n3DFuse [65] integrates depth control and semantic code sampling to stabilize the generation process.\nDespite notable progress, current text-to-3D generative models still face challenges in producing\nview-consistent 3D content, especially for intricate head avatars. This is primarily due to the absence\nof 3D awareness in text-to-2D diffusion models. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, there\nis currently no approach that specifically focuses on editing the generated 3D content, especially\naddressing the intricate fine-grained editing needs of head avatars.\n3D head modeling and creation. Statistical mesh-based models, such as FLAME [38, 15], enable the\nreconstruction of 3D head models from images. However, they struggle to capture fine details like hair\nand wrinkles. To overcome this issue, recent approaches [8, 71, 72, 51] employ Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) [46, 20, 30] to train 3D-aware networks on 2D head datasets and produce 3D-\nconsistent images through latent code manipulation. Furthermore, neural implicit methods [87, 16, 28,\n88] introduce implicit and subject-oriented head models based on neural rendering fields [45, 48, 2].\nRecently, text-to-3D generative methods have gained traction, generating high-quality 3D head\navatars from natural language using vision-language models [55, 69]. Typically, T2P [85] predicts\nbone-driven parameters of head avatars via a game engine under the CLIP guidance [55]. Rodin [80]\nproposes a roll-out diffusion network to perform 3D-aware diffusion.

Despite producing promising results, all these methods require a large amount\nof data for supervised training and struggle to generalize well to non-human-like avatars. In contrast,\nour approach relies solely on pre-trained text-to-2D models, generalizes well to out-of-domain avatars,\nand is capable of performing fine-grained editing tasks.\n3\nMethodology\nHeadSculpt is a 3D-aware text-to-3D approach that utilizes a pre-trained text-to-2D Stable Diffusion\nmodel [69, 59] to generate high-resolution head avatars and perform fine-grained editing tasks. As\nillustrated in Fig. 2, the generation pipeline has two stages: coarse generation via the neural radiance\nfield (NeRF) [48] and refinement/editing using tetrahedron mesh (DMTET) [66]. Next, we will first\nintroduce the preliminaries that form the basis of our method in Sec. 3.1. We will then discuss the key\ncomponents of our approach in Sec. 3.2 and Sec, 3.3, including (1) the prior-driven score distillation\nprocess via landmark-based ControlNet [84] and textual inversion [17], and (2) identity-aware editing\nscore distillation accomplished in the fine stage using the ControlNet-based InstructPix2Pix [5].\n3.1\nPreliminaries\nScore distillation sampling. Recently, DreamFusion [54] proposed score distillation sampling (SDS)\nto self-optimize a text-consistent neural radiance field (NeRF) based a the pre-trained text-to-2D\ndiffusion model [61]. Due to the unavailability of the Imagen model [61] used by DreamFusion, we\nemploy the latent diffusion model in [59] instead. Specifically, given a latent feature z encoded from\nan image x, SDS introduces random noise \u03f5 to z to create a noisy latent variable zt and then uses a\npre-trained denoising function \u03f5\u03d5 (zt; y, t) to predict the added noise. The SDS loss is defined as the\ndifference between predicted and added noise and its gradient is given by\n\u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03d5, g(\u03b8)) = Et,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1)\n\u0014\nw(t) (\u03f5\u03d5 (zt; y, t) \u2212 \u03f5) \u2202z\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\n,\n(1)\nwhere y is the text embedding, w(t) weights the loss from noise level t. With the expressive text-to-\n2D diffusion model and self-supervised SDS loss, we can back-propagate the gradients to optimize\nan implicit 3D scene g(\u03b8), eliminating the need for an expensive 3D dataset.\n3D scene optimization. HeadSculpt explores the potential of two different 3D differentiable repre-\nsentations as the optimization basis for crafting 3D head avatars. Specifically, we employ NeRF [48]\nin the coarse stage due to its greater flexibility in geometry deformation, while utilizing DMTET [66]\nin the fine stage for efficient high-resolution optimization.\n4\n(1) 3D prior-based NeRF. DreamAvatar [6] recently proposed a density-residual setup to enhance the\nrobustness and controllability of the generated 3D NeRF. Given a point x inside the 3D volume, we\ncan derive its density and color value based on a prior-based density field \u00af\u03c3:\nF(x, \u00af\u03c3) = F\u03b8(\u03b3(x)) + (\u00af\u03c3(x), 0) 7\u2192 (\u03c3, c),\n(2)\nwhere \u03b3(\u00b7) denotes a hash-grid frequency encoder [48], and \u03c3 and c are the density and RGB color\nrespectively. We can derive \u00af\u03c3 from the signed distance d(x) of a given 3D shape prior (e.g., a\ncanonical FLAME model [38] by default in our implementation):\n\u00af\u03c3(x) = max\n\u00000, softplus\u22121(\u03c4(x))\n\u0001\n, \u03c4(x) = 1\na sigmoid(\u2212d(x)/a), where a = 0.005.\n(3)\nTo obtain a 2D RGB image from the implicit volume defined above, we employ a volume rendering\ntechnique that involves casting a ray r from the 2D pixel location into the 3D scene, sampling points\n\u00b5i along the ray, and calculating their density and color value using F in Eq. (2):\nC(r) =\nX\ni\nWici,\nWi = \u03b1i\nY\nj<i\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1j),\n\u03b1i = 1 \u2212 e(\u2212\u03c3i||\u00b5i\u2212\u00b5i+1||).\n(4)\n(2) DMTET. It discretizes a deformable tetrahedral grid (VT , T), where VT denotes the vertices\nwithin grid T [19, 66], to model the 3D space. Every vertex vi \u2208 VT \u2282 R3 possesses a signed\ndistance value si \u2208 R, along with a position offset \u2206vi \u2208 R3 of the vertex relative to its initial\ncanonical coordinates. Subsequently, the underlying mesh can be extracted based on si with the\ndifferentiable marching tetrahedra algorithm. In addition to the geometry, we adopt the Magic3D\napproach [39] to construct a neural color field. This involves re-utilizing the MLP trained in the\ncoarse NeRF stage to predict the RGB color value for each 3D point. During optimization, we render\nthis textured surface mesh into high-resolution images using a differentiable rasterizer [36, 49].\n3.2\n3D-Prior-driven score distillation\nExisting text-to-3D methods with SDS [54] assume that maximizing the likelihood of images rendered\nfrom various viewpoints of a scene model g(\u00b7) is equivalent to maximizing the overall likelihood of\ng(\u00b7). This assumption can result in inconsistencies and geometric distortions [54, 65]. A notable issue\nis the \u201cJanus problem\u201d characterized by multiple faces on a single object (see Fig. 6). There are two\npossible causes: (1) the randomness of the diffusion model which can cause inconsistencies among\ndifferent views, and (2) the lack of 3D awareness in controlling the generation process, causing the\nmodel to struggle in determining the front view, back view, etc. To address these issues in generating\nhead avatars, we integrate 3D head priors into the diffusion model.\nLandmark-based ControlNet. In Section 3.1, we explain our adoption of FLAME [38] as the density\nguidance for our NeRF. Nevertheless, this guidance by itself is insufficient to have a direct impact on\nthe SDS loss. What is missing is a link between the NeRF and the diffusion model, incorporating the\nsame head priors. Such a link is key to improving the view consistency of the generated head avatars.\nTo achieve this objective, as illustrated in Fig. 2, we propose the incorporation of 2D landmark maps\nas an additional condition for the diffusion model using ControlNet [84]. Specifically, we employ a\nControlNet C trained on a large-scale 2D face dataset [86, 12], using facial landmarks rendered from\nMediaPipe [41, 31] as ground-truth data. When given a randomly sampled camera pose \u03c0, we first\nproject the vertices of the FLAME model onto the image. Following that, we select and render some\nof these vertices into a landmark map P\u03c0 based on some predefined vertex indexes. The landmark\nmap will be fed into ControlNet and its output features are added to the intermediate features within\nthe diffusion U-Net. The gradient of our SDS loss can be re-written as\n\u2207\u03b8LSDS(\u03d5, g(\u03b8)) = Et,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1),\u03c0\n\u0014\nw(t) (\u03f5\u03d5 (zt; y, t, C(P\u03c0)) \u2212 \u03f5) \u2202z\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\n.\n(5)\nEnhanced view-dependent prompt via textual inversion. Although the landmark-based ControlNet\ncan inject 3D awareness into the pre-trained diffusion models, it struggles to maintain back view head\nconsistency. This is expected as the 2D image dataset used for training mostly contains only front or\nside face views. Consequently, when applied directly to back views, the model introduces ambiguity\nas front and back 3D landmark views can appear similar, as shown in Fig. 8. To address this issue,\nwe propose a simple yet effective method. Our method is inspired by previous works [54, 65, 39]\nwhich found it beneficial to append view-dependent text (e.g., \u201cfront view\u201d, \u201cside view\u201d or \u201cback\n5\nview\u201d) to the provided input text based on the azimuth angle of the randomly sampled camera. We\nextend this idea by learning a special token <back-view> to replace the plain text \u201cback view\u201d in\norder to emphasize the rear appearance of heads. This is based on the assumption that a pre-trained\nStable Diffusion does has the ability to \u201cimagine\u201d the back view of a head - it has seen some during\ntraining. The main problem is that a generic text embedding of \u201cback view\u201d is inadequate in telling\nthe model what appearance it entails. A better embedding for \u201cback view\u201d is thus required. To this\nend, we first randomly download 34 images of the back view of human heads, without revealing\nany personal identities, to construct a tiny dataset D, and then we optimize the special token v (i.e.,\n<back-view>) to better fit the collected images, similar to the textual inversion [17]:\nv\u2217 = arg min\nv\nEt,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1),z\u223cD\nh\n\u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03d5 (zt; v, t)\u22252\n2\ni\n,\n(6)\nwhich is achieved by employing the same training scheme as the original diffusion model, while\nkeeping \u03f5\u03d5 fixed. This constitutes a reconstruction task, which we anticipate will encourage the\nlearned embedding to capture the fine visual details of the back views of human heads. Notably, as\nwe do not update the weights of \u03f5\u03d5, it stays compatible with the landmark-based ControlNet.\n3.3\nIdentity-aware editing score distillation\nAfter generating avatars, editing them to fulfill particular requirements poses an additional challenge.\nPrevious works [54, 39] have shown promising editing results by fine-tuning a trained scene model\nwith a new target prompt. However, when applied to head avatars, these methods often suffer from\nidentity loss or inadequate appearance modifications (see Fig. 10). This problem stems from the\ninherent constraint of the SDS loss, where the 3D models often sacrifice prominent features to\npreserve view consistency. Substituting Stable Diffusion with InstructPix2Pix [5, 21] might seem\nlike a simple solution, but it also faces difficulties in maintaining facial identity during editing based\nonly on instructions, as it lacks a well-defined anchor point.\nTo this end, we propose identity-aware editing score distillation (IESD) to regulate the editing\ndirection by blending two predicted scores, i.e., one for editing instruction and another for the original\ndescription. Rather than using the original InstructPix2Pix [5], we employ a ControlNet-based\nInstructPix2Pix I [84] trained on the same dataset, ensuring compatibility with our landmark-based\nControlNet C and the learned <back-view> token. Formally, given an initial textual prompt y\ndescribing the avatar to be edited and an editing instruction \u02c6y, we first input them separately into\nthe same diffusion model equipped with two ControlNets, I and C. This allows us to obtain two\npredicted noises, which are then combined using a predefined hyper-parameter \u03c9e like classifier-free\ndiffusion guidance (CFG) [26]:\n\u2207\u03b8LIESD(\u03d5, g(\u03b8)) = Et,\u03f5\u223cN (0,1),\u03c0\n\u0014\nw(t)\n\u0012\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03d5 (zt; y, \u02c6y, t, C(P\u03c0), I(M\u03c0))\n|\n{z\n} \u2212\u03f5\n\u0013 \u2202z\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u0015\n,\n\u03c9e\u03f5\u03d5 (zt; \u02c6y, t, C(P\u03c0), I(M\u03c0)) + (1 \u2212 \u03c9e)\u03f5\u03d5 (zt; y, t, C(P\u03c0), I(M\u03c0))\n(7)\nwhere P\u03c0 and M\u03c0 represent the 2D landmark maps and the reference images rendered in the coarse\nstage, both being obtained under the sampled camera pose \u03c0. The parameter \u03c9e governs a trade-off\nbetween the original appearance and the desired editing, which defaults to 0.6 in our experiments.\n4\nExperiments\nWe will now assess the efficacy of our HeadSculpt across different scenarios, while also conducting a\ncomparative analysis against state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation pipelines.\nImplementation details. HeadSculpt builds upon Stable-DreamFusion [73] and Huggingface\nDiffusers [78, 53]. We utilize version 1.5 of Stable Diffusion [69] and version 1.1 of ControlNet [84,\n12] in our implementation. In the coarse stage, we optimize our 3D model at 64 \u00d7 64 grid resolution,\nwhile using 512 \u00d7 512 grid resolution for the fine stage (refinement or editing). Typically, each text\nprompt requires approximately 7, 000 iterations for the coarse stage and 5, 000 iterations for the fine\nstage. It takes around 1 hour for each stage on a single Tesla V100 GPU with a default batch size\nof 4. We use Adam [35] optimizer with a fixed learning rate of 0.001. Additional implementation\ndetails can be found in the supplementary material.\n6\nShape 1\nShape 2\nShape 3\na DSLR portrait of Saul Goodman\nFigure 3: Generation results with various shapes.

We compare the generation results with five baselines:\nDreamFusion [73], Latent-NeRF [43], 3DFuse [65] (improved version of SJC [79]), Fantasia3D [10],\nand DreamFace [83]. We do not directly compare with DreamAvatar [6] as it involves deformation\nfields for full-body-related tasks.\nBaseline methods for editing evaluation. We assess IESD\u2019s efficacy for fine-grained 3D head avatar\nediting by comparing it with various alternatives since no dedicated method exists for this: (B1)\nOne-step optimization on the coarse stage without initialization; (B2) Initialized from the coarse\nstage, followed by optimization of another coarse stage with an altered description; (B3) Initialized\nfrom the coarse stage, followed by optimization of a new fine stage with an altered description; (B4)\nInitialized from the coarse stage, followed by optimization of a new fine stage with an instruction\nbased on the vanilla InstructPix2Pix [5]; (B5) Ours without edit scale (i.e., \u03c9e = 1). Notably, B2\nrepresents the editing method proposed in DreamFusion [54], while B3 has a similar performance as\nMagic3D [39], which employs a three-stage editing process (i.e., Coarse + Coarse + Fine).\n4.1\nQualitative evaluations\nHead avatar generation with various prompts. In Fig. 1, we show a diverse array of 3D head avatars\ngenerated by our HeadSculpt, consistently demonstrating high-quality geometry and texture across\nvarious viewpoints. Our method\u2019s versatility is emphasized by its ability to create an assortment of\navatars, including humans (both celebrities and ordinary individuals) as well as non-human characters\nlike superheroes, comic/game characters, paintings, and more.\nHead avatar generation with different shapes. HeadSculpt leverages shape-guided NeRF initializa-\ntion and landmark-guided diffusion priors. This allows controlling geometry by varying the FLAME\nshape used for initialization. To demonstrate adjustability, Fig. 3 presents examples generated from\ndiverse FLAME shapes. The results fit closely to the shape guidance, highlighting HeadSculpt\u2019s\ncapacity for geometric variation when provided different initial shapes.\nHead avatar editing with various instructions. As illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, HeadSculpt\u2019s\nadaptability is also showcased through its ability to perform fine-grained editing, such as local\nchanges (e.g., adding accessories, changing hairstyles, or altering expressions), shape and texture\nmodifications, and style transfers.\nHead avatar editing with different edit scales.

We provide qualitative comparisons\nwith existing methods in Fig. 6. We employ the same FLAME model for Latent-NeRF [43] to\ncompute their sketch-guided loss and for Fantasia3D [74] as the initial geometry. The following\nobservations can be made: (1) All baselines tend to be more unstable during training than ours, often\nresulting in diverged training processes; (2) Latent-NeRF occasionally produces plausible results due\nto its use of the shape prior, but its textures are inferior to ours since optimization occurs solely in\nthe latent space; (3) Despite 3DFuse\u2019s depth control to mitigate the Janus problem, it still struggles\nto generate 3D consistent head avatars; (4) While Fantasia3D can generate a mesh-based 3D avatar,\nits geometry is heavily distorted, as its disentangled geometry optimization might be insufficient for\nhighly detailed head avatars; (5) Although DreamFace generates realistic human face textures, it falls\nshort in generating (i) complete heads, (ii) intricate geometry, (iii) non-human-like appearance, and\n(iv) composite accessories. In comparison, our method consistently yields superior results in both\ngeometry and texture with much better consistency for the given prompt. More comparisons can be\nfound in the supplementary material.\n8\nTextual\nConsistency\nTexture\nQuality\nGeometry\nQuality\n0\n2\n4\nDreamFusion\nLatent-NeRF\n3DFuse\nFantasia3D\nHeadSculpt\n(Ours)\nFigure 7: User study.

We conducted user studies comparing with four baselines [73, 74, 65, 43]. 42 volunteers\nranked them from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) individually based on three dimensions: (1) consistency with\nthe text, (2) texture quality, and (3) geometry quality. The results, shown in Fig. 7, indicate that our\nmethod achieved the highest rank in all three aspects by large margins.\nCLIP-based metrics. Following DreamFusion [54], (1) We calculate the CLIP R-Precision (CLIP-\nR) [52] and CLIP-Score (CLIP-S) [24] metrics, which evaluate the correlation between the generated\nimages and the input texts, for all methods using 30 text prompts. As indicated in Tab. 1, our\napproach significantly outperforms the competing methods according to both metrics. This outcome\nprovides additional evidence for the subjective superiority observed in the user studies and qualitative\nresults. (2) We employ the CLIP Directional Similarity (CLIP-DS) [5, 18], to evaluate the editing\nperformance. This metric measures the alignment between changes in text captions and corresponding\nimage modifications. Specifically, we encode a pair of images (the original and edited 3D models\nrendered from a specific viewpoint) along with a pair of text prompts describing the original and edited\nsubjects, e.g., \u201ca DSLR portrait of Saul Goodman\u201d and \u201ca DSLR portrait of Saul Goodman dressed\nlike a clown\u201d. We compare our approach against B3, B4, and B5 by evaluating 10 edited examples.\nThe results, presented in Tab. 1, highlight the superiority of our editing framework according to this\nmetric, indicating improved editing fidelity and identity preservation compared to alternatives.\n4.3\nFurther analysis\nEffectiveness of prior-driven score distillation. In Fig. 8, we conduct ablation studies to examine the\nimpact of the proposed landmark control and textual inversion priors in our method. We demonstrate\nthis on the coarse stage because the refinement and editing results heavily depend on this stage.\nThe findings show that landmark control is essential for generating spatially consistent head avatars.\nWithout it, the optimized 3D avatar faces challenges in maintaining consistent facial views, particularly\nfor non-human-like characters. Moreover, textual inversion is shown to be another vital component\nin mitigating the Janus problem, specifically for the back view, as landmarks cannot exert control\non the rear view. Overall, the combination of both components enables HeadSculpt to produce\nview-consistent avatars with high-quality geometry.\n9\nB1: One-stage\nB2: Coarse + Coarse\nB3: Coarse + Fine\nB4: Naive IP2P\nB5: Ours w/o \u03c9e\nHeadSculpt (Ours)\nModified description: a DSLR portrait of +[older] Saul Goodman\nInstruction: make him older\nModified description: a DSLR portrait skull of Vincent van Gogh\nInstruction: turn his face into a skull\nFigure 10: Analysis of identity-aware editing score distillation.\nEffectiveness of IESD. In Fig. 10, we present two common biased editing scenarios produced by the\nbaseline methods: insufficient editing and loss of identity. With Stable Diffusion, specific terms like\n\u201cSaul Goodman\u201d and \u201cskull\u201d exert a more substantial influence on the text embeddings compared\nto other terms, such as \u201colder\u201d and \u201cVincent van Gogh\u201d. B1, B2, and B3, all based on vanilla\nStable Diffusion, inherit such bias in their generated 3D avatars. Although B4 does not show such\nbias, it faces two other issues: (1) the Janus problem reemerges due to incompatibility between\nvanilla InstructPix2Pix and the proposed prior-driven score distillation; (2) it struggles to maintain\nfacial identity during editing based solely on instructions, lacking a well-defined anchor point. In\ncontrast, B5 employs ControlNet-based InstructPix2Pix [84] with the proposed prior score distillation,\nresulting in more view-consistent editing. Additionally, our IESD further uses the proposed edit scale\nto merge two predicted scores, leading to better identity preservation and more effective editing. This\napproach allows our method to overcome the limitations faced by the alternative solutions, producing\nhigh-quality 3D avatars with improved fine-grained editing results.\nLimitations and failure cases. While setting a new state-of-the-art, we acknowledge HeadSculpt\nhas limitations, as the failure cases in Fig. 9 demonstrate: (1) non-deformable results hinder further\nextensions and applications in audio or video-driven problems; (2) generated textures are highly\nsaturated and less realistic, especially for characters with highly detailed appearances (e.g., Freddy\nKrueger); (3) some inherited biases from Stable Diffusion [69] still remain, such as inaccurate\nand stereotypical appearances of Asian characters (e.g., Sun Wukong and Japanese Geisha); and\n(4) limitations inherited from InstructPix2Pix [5], such as the inability to perform large spatial\nmanipulations (e.g., remove his nose).\n5\nConclusions\nWe have introduced HeadSculpt, a novel pipeline for generating high-resolution 3D human avatars\nand performing identity-aware editing tasks through text. We proposed to utilize a prior-driven score\ndistillation that combines a landmark-based ControlNet and view-dependent textual inversion to\naddress the Janus problem. We also introduced identity-aware editing score distillation that preserves\nboth the original identity information and the editing instruction. Extensive evaluations demonstrated\nthat our HeadSculpt produces high-fidelity results under various scenarios, outperforming state-of-\nthe-art methods significantly.\nSocietal impact. The advancements in geometry and texture generation for human head avatars\ncould be deployed in many AR/VR use cases but also raises concerns about their potential malicious\nuse. We encourage responsible research and application, fostering open and transparent practices.\nAcknowledgment.

This encoder maps the input x \u2208 R3 to a higher-frequency dimension, yielding\n\u03b3(x) \u2208 R32. The MLP within our NeRF model consists of three layers with dimensions [32, 64, 64,\n3+1+3]. Here, the output channels \u20183\u2019, \u20181\u2019, and \u20183\u2019 represent the predicted normals, density value, and\nRGB colors, respectively. In the fine stage, we directly optimize the signed distance value si \u2208 R,\nalong with a position offset \u2206vi \u2208 R3 for each vertex vi. We found that fitting si and vi into MLP,\nas done by Fantasia3D [74], often leads to diverged training.\nTo ensure easy reproducibility, we have included all the hyperparameters used in our experiments in\nTab 2. The other hyper-parameters are set to be the default of Stable-DreamFusion [73].\nA.2\nDetails about textual inversion\nIn the main paper, we discussed the collection of a tiny dataset consisting of 34 images depicting\nthe back view of heads. This dataset was used to train a special token, <back-view>, to address the\nambiguity associated with the back view of landmarks. The images in the dataset were selected to\nencompass a diverse range of gender, color, age, and other characteristics. A few samples from the\ndataset are shown in Fig. 11. While our simple selection strategy has proven effective in our specific\ncase, we believe that a more refined collection process could further enhance the controllability\nof the learned <back-view> token. We use the default training recipe provided by HuggingFace\nDiffusers 2, which took us 1 hour on a single Tesla V100 GPU.\n2https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/textual_inversion\n11\nFigure 11: Samples of the tiny dataset collected for learning <back-view> token.\nB\nFurther analysis\nB.1\nEffectiveness of textual inversion on 2D generation\nTo show the effectiveness of the learned <back-view> token, we conduct an analysis of its control\ncapabilities in the context of 2D generation results. Specifically, we compare two generation results\nusing Stable Diffusion [69], with both experiments sharing the same random seed. One experiment\nhas the plain text prompt appended with the plain phrase \u201cback view,\u201d while the other experiment\nutilizes the learned special token <back-view> in the prompt. We present a selection of randomly\ngenerated results in Fig. 12. The observations indicate that the <back-view> token effectively\ninfluences the pose of the generated heads towards the back, resulting in a distinct appearance.\nRemarkably, the <back-view> token demonstrates a notable generalization ability, as evidenced by\nthe Batman case, despite not having been trained specifically on back views of Batman in the textual\ninversion process.\nB.2\nInherent bias in 2D diffusion models\nIn our main paper, we discussed the motivation behind our proposed identity-aware editing score\ndistillation (IESD), which can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, the limitations of prompt-\nbased editing [54, 39] are due to the inherent bias present in Stable Diffusion (SD). Secondly, while\nInstructPix2Pix (IP2P) [5] offers a solution by employing instruction-based editing to mitigate bias, it\noften results in identity loss. To further illustrate this phenomenon, we showcase the biased 2D outputs\nof SD and ControlNet-based IP2P in Fig. 13. Modified descriptions and instructions are utilized\nin these respective methods to facilitate the editing process and achieve the desired results. The\nresults provide clear evidence of the following: (1) SD generates biased outcomes, with a tendency to\nunderweight the \u201colder\u201d aspect and overweight the \u201cskull\u201d aspect in the modified description; (2)\nIP2P demonstrates the ability to edit the image successfully, but it faces challenges in preserving the\nidentity of the avatar.\nThe aforementioned inherent biases are amplified in the domain of 3D generation (refer to Fig. 10\nin the main paper) due to the optimization process guided by SDS loss, which tends to prioritize\nview consistency at the expense of sacrificing prominent features. To address this issue, our proposed\nIESD approach combines two types of scores: one for editing and the other for identity preservation.\nThis allows us to strike a balance between preserving the initial appearance and achieving the desired\nediting outcome.\n12\nw/ \u201cback view\u201d\nw/ <back-view>\nw/ \u201cback view\u201d\nw/ <back-view>\nw/ \u201cback view\u201d\nw/ <back-view>\nseed: 413\nseed: 16772\nseed: 40805\na DSLR portrait of Obama\nseed: 50682\nseed: 93440\nseed: 96458\na DSLR portrait of Hillary Clinton\nseed: 2367\nseed: 19656\nseed: 62156\na DSLR portrait of a boy with facial painting\nseed: 53236\nseed: 62424\nseed: 72649\na DSLR portrait of Batman\nFigure 12: Analysis of the learned <back-view> on 2D image generation.

These results serve to reinforce the claims made in Sec. 4.1 of the main paper, providing\nfurther evidence of the superior performance of our HeadSculpt in generating high-fidelity head\navatars. These results showcase the ability of our method to capture intricate details, realistic textures,\nand overall visual quality, solidifying its position as a state-of-the-art solution in this task.\nNotably, to provide a more immersive and comprehensive understanding of our results, we include\nmultiple outcomes of our HeadSculpt in the form of 360\u25e6 rotating videos.

This\nbias stems from the shared SDS guidance function, which is based on a diffusion prior, despite the\nvariations in representation and optimization methods employed by these approaches. Instead, IESD\nenables the guidance function to incorporate information from two complementary sources: (1) the\noriginal image gradient, which preserves identity, and (2) the editing gradient, which captures desired\nmodifications. By considering both terms, our approach grants more explicit and direct control over\nthe editing process compared to the conventional guidance derived solely from the input.\n16\nLatent-NeRF [43]\nFantasia3D* [74]\nHeadSculpt (Ours)\na head of ant-man in Marvel\nFigure 17: Results across random seeds (0, 1, 2).*Non-official.\nC.3\nComparison with existing methods on stability\nWe observe that all baselines tend to have diverged training processes as they do not integrate 3D\nprior to the diffusion model. Taking two shape-guided prior methods (i.e., Latent-NeRF [43] and\nFantasia3D [10]) as examples, we compare their generation results and ours across different random\nseeds. We conduct comparisons under the same default hyper-parameters and present the results in\nFig. 17. We notice that prior methods need to try several runs to get the best generation while ours\ncan achieve consistent results among different runs. Our method is thus featured with stable training,\nwithout the need for cherry-picking over many runs.\n17\nReferences\n[1] Yogesh Balaji, Seungjun Nah, Xun Huang, Arash Vahdat, Jiaming Song, Karsten Kreis, Miika Aittala,\nTimo Aila, Samuli Laine, Bryan Catanzaro, et al. ediffi: Text-to-image diffusion models with an ensemble\nof expert denoisers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01324, 2022. 3\n[2] Jonathan T Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Dor Verbin, Pratul P Srinivasan, and Peter Hedman.

    "text": "INSTRUCTZERO: EFFICIENT INSTRUCTION OPTIMIZATION FOR\nBLACK-BOX LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nA PREPRINT\nLichang Chen*\nJiuhai Chen*\nTom Goldstein\nHeng Huang\nTianyi Zhou\nUniversity of Maryland\n{bobchen, jchen169, tomg, heng, tianyi}@umd.edu\nABSTRACT\nLarge language models (LLMs) are instruction followers, but it can be challenging to find the best\ninstruction for different situations, especially for black-box LLMs on which backpropagation is\nforbidden. Instead of directly optimizing the discrete instruction, we optimize a low-dimensional soft\nprompt applied to an open-source LLM to generate the instruction for the black-box LLM. On each\niteration of the proposed method, which we call INSTRUCTZERO, a soft prompt is converted into\nan instruction using the open-source LLM, which is then submitted to the black-box LLM for zero-\nshot evaluation, and the performance is sent to Bayesian optimization to produce new soft prompts\nimproving the zero-shot performance. We evaluate INSTRUCTZERO on different combinations of\nopen-source LLMs and APIs including Vicuna and ChatGPT. Our results show that INSTRUCTZERO\noutperforms SOTA auto-instruction methods across a variety of downstream tasks. Our code and data\nare publicly available at https://github.com/Lichang-Chen/InstructZero.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) [OpenAI, 2023a,b, Chowdhery et al., 2022] have recently gained widespread attention\nin NLP due to their remarkable capabilities in following instructions under both zero-shot and few-shot settings\n[Brown et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2023a]. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of\ninstructions [Zhou et al., 2022, Honovich et al., 2022]. For example, even paraphrasing the original instruction can\nlead to the failure of LLMs on certain tasks. It is still not clear when and how the instruction-following capability\nof LLMs can be generalized.\nInstruction-following capability is essential to LLMs when used as an interface between humans and AI models, i.e.,\nhuman users can instruct LLMs to solve complicated tasks by providing in-context instructions. \u201cPrompt engineer-\ning\u201d [Brown et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2023] usually relies on human experts\u2019 experience to craft instructions through a\ncostly trial-and-error process. Hence, how to automate the instruction search or optimization for any given task is a\ncritical open challenge. Unlike soft prompts, instruction is composed of discrete words or sentences that are difficult\nto optimize in a continuous space. To create a human-interpretable and task-relevant instruction, we have to address\ncombinatorial optimization with complex structural constraints. Moreover, the most powerful instruction-following\nLLMs, e.g., ChatGPT [OpenAI, 2023a] and GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023b], are black boxes. Given their APIs only, it is\ninfeasible to develop gradient-based instruction optimization that requires back-propagation through these models.\nIn this paper, we propose an effective and efficient approach \u201cINSTRUCTZERO\u201d to tackle the zeroth-order combinatorial\noptimization of instructions to API LLMs [Chen et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018, Schrijver et al., 2003, Wolsey and\nNemhauser, 1999]. Instead of directly optimizing the instruction, INSTRUCTZERO optimizes a soft prompt to an\nopen-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA [Touvron et al., 2023], Stanford Alpaca, Vicuna), which can generate a human-readable\nand task-relevant instruction given a few exemplars of the target task, thanks to the LLM\u2019s in-context learning capability.\nThe instruction is then submitted to the black-box LLM for evaluation on the target task, whose performance is used to\nguide the optimization of the soft prompt toward generating better instructions.\n*Equal Contribution.

Left: INSTRUCTZERO generate a more precise instruction leading to better\nperformance (higher execution accuracy). Right: Histogram of INSTRUCTZERO\u2019s improvement over APE and Uniform\non 32 tasks. INSTRUCTZERO achieves a significant improvement between [20%, 100%) in terms of accuracy on a\nmajority of evaluated tasks.\nWe formulate the soft prompt optimization as a form of latent space Bayesian Optimization (BO), which takes each soft\nprompt and the corresponding zero-shot performance as an input-output pair of the optimization objective. To achieve a\nlatent space kernel reflecting the instruction space\u2019s similarity, we develop an instruction-coupled kernel to align the\ntwo spaces\u2019 kernels. Thereby, the exploration and exploitation of soft prompts in a low-dimensional latent space lead to\nan efficient search for optimal instruction in the sparse and highly structured textual space.\nWe evaluate INSTRUCTZERO on a combination of SOTA open-source LLM and black-box LLM, i.e., 13-B Vicuna and\nGPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT). Experimental results show that ChatGPT\u2019s performance is significantly improved when\nusing the instructions optimized by INSTRUCTZERO: It achieves SOTA results on 32/32 tasks from BIG-Bench. As a\ncase study, we visualize an instruction optimization process of INSTRUCTZERO and the generated instructions for every\nstep. Compared to non-optimization methods that use ChatGPT to generate instructions, INSTRUCTZERO outperforms\nthem even when a much smaller Vicuna model is used.\n2\nInstruction Optimization\nWe study how to optimize an instruction v applied to a black-box LLM f(\u00b7) to address a task with input query X. In\nparticular, the optimization objective aims to maximize the output f([v; X])\u2019s performance h(f([v; X]), Y ), which uses\na score produced by an evaluation metric h(\u00b7, \u00b7) comparing f([v; X]) and the ground truth Y . Hence, the optimization\nof instruction v \u2208 V can be formulated as maximizing the expected score h(f([v; X]), Y ) for an example (X, Y ) drawn\nfrom the data distribution Dt of task-t, i.e.,\nmax\nv\u2208V E(X,Y )\u223cDth(f([v; X]), Y ).\n(1)\nUnfortunately, Eq. (1) is notoriously challenging or practically infeasible because it is (1) Combinatorial optimization\nwith complicated structural constraints: the instruction v that can be taken by black-box LLMs such as ChatGPT and\nGPT-4 is a combination of discrete tokens that have to comprise human-readable and task-relevant sentence(s). Thus, its\noptimization space V is high-dimensional, discrete, and highly structured due to semantic constraints. In general, there\ndo not exist efficient optimization algorithms in such a space; and (2) Black-box optimization: the black-box LLM\nf(\u00b7) makes the objective as a black-box function. Users are only allowed to input texts to f(\u00b7) and only obtain textual\noutputs. Hence, backpropagation through f(\u00b7) and any gradient-based algorithm to optimize the objective cannot be\napplied.\n2\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nInstruction \ud835\udc63\nInput: [\ud835\udc4b]\nBlack-Box LLM\n...\nOpen-Source LLM\n...\nInput: [\ud835\udc65!]\nOutput: [\ud835\udc66!]\n\u2026\nInput: [\ud835\udc65\"]\nOutput: [\ud835\udc66\"]\nThe instruction was to\nSoft Prompt\nInput of the Open-Source LLM\nNext Soft Prompt\nto Explore\nBayesian\nOptimization\n(BO)\nInput of the Black-Box\nLLM\nTraining data for BO\n(Soft Prompt, Instruction, Score )\n(Soft Prompt, Instruction, Score )\n....\n(Soft Prompt, Instruction, Score )\nScore  \n\ud835\udd3c \ud835\udc7f,\ud835\udc80 \u223c\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc89 (\ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc97; \ud835\udc7f , \ud835\udc80)\nOutput \ud835\udc87( \ud835\udc97; \ud835\udc7f )\nFigure 2: Pipeline of INSTRUCTZERO. On each iteration, a soft prompt and a few exemplars of the target task are sent\nto the open-source LLM for generating an instruction, which then prompts the black-box LLM to produce answers to\ntarget-task queries. The score (e.g., accuracy) of the answers and the soft prompt is added as new training data for BO,\nwhich updates its posterior about the objective and produces a new soft prompt to explore in the next iteration. Both\nLLMs are frozen.\nInstead of optimizing the instruction v in the original space V, the key idea of INSTRUCTZERO is to optimize a soft\nprompt p applied to an open-source LLM g(\u00b7), which converts p to a human-readable and task-relevant instruction v\nvia in-context learning with \u03ba exemplars (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1 drawn from the target task. The instruction v is then applied to the\nblack-box LLM f(\u00b7) to produce zero-shot prediction f([v; X]). The zero-shot performance score h(f([v; X]), Y ) on\ntarget task data (X, Y ) \u223c Dt is collected to estimate the objective function in Eq. (1) by Bayesian optimization (BO),\nwhich proposes new soft prompts for generating better instructions.\nThe pipeline of INSTRUCTZERO is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the open-source LLM can be LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna,\netc., and the black-box LLM can be ChatGPT [OpenAI, 2023a], GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023b], Claude, PaLM-2 [Google,\n2023], etc. By generating the instruction using an open-source LLM, INSTRUCTZERO reduces the challenging\ninstruction optimization to a feasible black-box optimization of a soft prompt in a low-dimensional space, which can be\naddressed by latent space Bayesian optimization. The complete procedure is provided in Algorithm 1.\n2.1\nFrom Structured Combinatorial Search to Low-dimensional Continuous Optimization\nINSTRUCTZERO, as shown in Fig. 2, applies an open-source LLM g(\u00b7) to generate instructions v via in-context learning.\nSpecifically, we concatenate a soft-prompt p \u2208 Rd\u2032 (a d\u2032-dimensional vector) with \u03ba input-output exemplars (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1\n(represented by their token embeddings) drawn from the task\u2019s distribution Dt as input to the open-source LLM\nto generate an instruction v = g([p; x1:\u03ba]) for the black-box LLM f(\u00b7). Therefore, the combinatorial instruction\noptimization in Eq. (1) can be reframed as a more feasible continuous optimization below.\nmax\np\u2208Rd\u2032E(X,Y )\u223cDth(f([v; X]), Y ), s.t. v = g([p; (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1]),\n(2)\nDimension Reduction. Though we reduce the original instruction optimization to continuous optimization of a soft\nprompt p, it still needs to solve a black-box optimization due to the black-box LLM f(\u00b7) in the objective of Eq. (2).\nUnfortunately, as input tokens to an open-source LLM, p usually has dimensionality too high (e.g., thousands for\nVicuna) to be handled by existing black-box optimization approaches. Hence, we instead optimize a lower-dimensional\nvector p \u2208 Rd where d \u226a d\u2032 and project it to Rd\u2032 using a simple random projection Ap as input tokens to g(\u00b7), where\neach entry of the matrix A \u2208 Rd\u00d7d\u2032 is sampled from Normal or Uniform distribution [Wang et al., 2016]. This is based\non: (1) the random projection is distance-preserving according to Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma [Kleinberg, 1997],\nwhich leads to comparable kernel similarities before and after the random projection, i.e., k(pi, pj) \u2248 k(Api, Apj), so\nBO in the original space and dimension-reduced space are consistent; (2) Thanks to in-context learning capability of the\nopen-source LLM, when concatenated with \u03ba exemplars, low-dimensional soft prompt suffice to produce rich, diverse,\nand task-relevant instructions as candidates. Therefore, by replacing p in Eq. (2) with Ap, the instruction optimization\nin Eq. (1) is reduced to maximization of a black-box function H(p) in a low-dimensional space Rd, i.e.,\nH(p) \u225c E(X,Y )\u223cDth(f([v; X]), Y ), v = g([Ap; (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1]).\n(3)\n3\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nInstruction \n!!\"#\nSoft prompt\n\"!\"#\nInstruction-Coupled Kernel Matrix !\nBy Eq.

Specifically, BO aims to estimate\nthe black-box objective H(p) and finds its maximum; it keeps updating a posterior of H(\u00b7) based on collected (p, H(p))\npairs and exploring new soft prompts p until the largest H(p) converges to a maximum. To evaluate H(p) on a soft\nprompt p and its generated instruction, we average the zero-shot performance h(f([v; X]), Y ) on a validation set.\n3.1\nBayesian Optimization of Soft Prompt\nWe apply the commonly used Gaussian Process (GP) as the prior for the black-box objective H(\u00b7). A GP prior can be\nspecified by a mean function \u00b5(\u00b7) = 0 and a covariance function (i.e., kernel function) k(\u00b7, \u00b7). Given m soft prompts\np1:m \u225c {p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pm} and their evaluation H1:m \u225c [H(p1), a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , H(pm)] collected in all previous BO steps, the\nestimated posterior of H(\u00b7) is updated as a Gaussian N(\u00b5(\u00b7), \u03c32(\u00b7)) with mean function \u00b5(\u00b7) and variance function\n\u03c32(\u00b7) defined as, \u2200p \u2208 Rd,\n\u00b5(p) \u225c k(K + \u03b72I)\u22121H1:m,\n(4)\n\u03c32(p) \u225c k(p, p) \u2212 k\u22a4(K + \u03b72I)\u22121k,\n(5)\nwhere k = [k(p, p1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k(p, pm)], \u03b7 is a constant measuring the noise levels of observations.\nExpected improvement acquisition function (EI) measures the improvement of a candidate soft prompt over the best\nsoft prompt in terms of the objective value, i.e., max{0, H(p) \u2212 maxi\u2208[m]\nH(pi)}, and takes the improvement\u2019s\nexpectation w.r.t. H(p), which is a random variable with a distribution defined by the posterior of H(\u00b7). Therefore, EI\nu(\u00b7) is defined as, \u2200p \u2208 Rd,\nu(p) = EH(p)\u223cN (\u00b5(p),\u03c32(p))\n\u0014\nmax\n\u001a\n0, H(p) \u2212 max\ni\u2208[m] H(pi)\n\u001b\u0015\n,\n(6)\nand BO determines the next soft prompt pm+1 to explore by maximizing the acquisition function:\npm+1 \u2208 argmax\np\u2208Rd\nu(p).\n(7)\nThe new soft prompt pm+1 is converted to an instruction vm+1 by the open-source LLM g(\u00b7), i.e., vm+1 =\ng([Apm+1; (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1]), and vm+1 is applied to the black-box LLM for evaluating its zero-shot performance on\nthe target task, i.e., H(pm+1). BO then augments its collected training data (p1:m, H1:m) with (pm+1, H(pm+1)) and\nthe procedure in Eq. (4)-(7) is repeated until convergence. The BO pipeline in INSTRUCTZERO is illustrated in Fig. 3.\n3.2\nInstruction-Coupled Kernel\nThe choice of kernel k(\u00b7, \u00b7) in BO is critical to the performance of black-box optimization since it defines both the\nmean and variance of the posterior and thus guides the whole optimization process. In INSTRUCTZERO, although we\n4\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nconduct BO in the latent space of soft prompts, the goal is to optimize instructions in the instruction space V. Hence,\nthe kernel applied in the latent space should reflect the similarity of the generated instructions in the target task. In\nother words, we need to align the latent space kernel with the instruction similarity. To this end, we develop a novel\ninstruction-coupled kernel inspired by [Deshwal and Doppa, 2021a].\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that BO in all previous steps has already explored m soft prompts p1:m, which\nwere converted to m instructions v1:m = {v1, v2, ..., vm} via the open-source LLM. To measure the correlation between\ntwo soft prompts in the latent space Rd, we choose a kernel function l(\u00b7, \u00b7) : Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192 R, whose common options\ninclude Matern or Squared Exponential kernels. Applying l(\u00b7, \u00b7) to p1:m produces a kernel matrix L \u2208 Rm\u00d7m. To\nmeasure the similarity between two instructions in the target task, we define another kernel function s(\u00b7, \u00b7) : V \u00d7V \u2192 R,\nfor example, the similarity between their zero-shot predictions on target task data, i.e.,\ns(vi, vj) = EX\u223cDt [sim(f([vi; X]), f([vj; X]))] ,\n(8)\nwhere sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a similarity of the predictions for the tasks, e.g., exact match, F1, or BLEU score. Applying s(\u00b7, \u00b7) to\nv1:m produces a kernel matrix S \u2208 Rm\u00d7m. We propose an instruction-coupled kernel function by combining the two\nkernels l(\u00b7, \u00b7) and s(\u00b7, \u00b7) in the following manner.\nKi,j = k(pi, pj) = l\u22a4\ni L\u22121SL\u22121lj\n(9)\nwhere li \u225c [l(pi, p1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , l(pi, pm)] and lj \u225c [l(pj, p1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , l(pj, pm)]. The proposed kernel preserves the instruc-\ntion similarity in the soft prompt space: when applied to soft prompts p1:m, the resulted kernel matrix K exactly\nrecovers the instruction matrix S because K = LL\u22121SL\u22121L = S according to Eq. (9). For new soft prompts\np /\u2208 p1:m, the instruction-coupled kernel in Eq. (9) operates as a smooth extrapolation kernel. Therefore, by combining\nthe two spaces\u2019 kernels, the proposed kernel aligns BO in the latent space Rd of soft prompts (Eq. (3)) with the\ninstruction optimization (Eq. (1)) in the combinatorial and structured space V. Fig. 3 shows when the kernel matrices\nare computed in the BO pipeline of INSTRUCTZERO.\nAlgorithm 1: INSTRUCTZERO\ninput\n:Exemplars (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1 and a validation set Dt of target task-t; open-source LLM g(\u00b7), black-box LLM\nf(\u00b7), maximal steps T; random matrix A \u2208 Rd\u00d7d\u2032\ninitialize :p1 \u223c uniform(\u2212\u03c4, \u03c4)d in Rd; m \u2190 1, p1:0 \u2190 \u2205, v1:0 \u2190 \u2205, h1:0 \u2190 \u2205\n1 while not converge and m \u2264 T do\n2\nCompute input prompt Apm from low-dimensional soft prompt pm;\n3\nGenerate instruction vm = g([Apm; (xi, yi)\u03ba\ni=1]) by the open-source LLM g(\u00b7);\n4\nEvaluate zero-shot score hm = P\n(X,Y )\u2208Dt h(f([vm; X]), Y ) on the black-box LLM f(\u00b7);\n5\nSave data: p1:m \u2190 p1:m\u22121 \u222a {pm}, v1:m \u2190 v1:m\u22121 \u222a {vm}, h1:m \u2190 h1:m\u22121 \u222a {hm};\n6\nUpdate the instruction-coupled kernel function k(\u00b7, \u00b7) and matrix K for p1:m by Eq.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method could effectively\ngenerate instructions that enhance task performance while achieving predictions on par with or even superior to those\ncreated by previous methods. Moreover, INSTRUCTZERO produces instructions that sometimes reveal valuable tricks\nfor optimal prompting that could be subsequently applied to new tasks.\n4.1\nTasks, Datasets, Baselines, and Implementation\nTasks.\nWe assess the effectiveness of zero-shot in-context learning on instruction tasks proposed in [Honovich et al.,\n2022], including all 24 tasks used in previous auto-instruction work [Zhou et al., 2022]. We further add 8 extra tasks\nto enrich the benchmark for evaluating all methods in more comprehensive scenarios spanning many facets of language\n5\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\n0\n0.5\n1\nAntonyms\nCause Selection\nCommon\nWord Sorting\nAscii\nFormality\nNegation\nObject Counting\nAPE\nUniform\nOurs\n0\n0.5\n1\nCS_Algorithm\nRhymes\nSecond Letter\nSimilarity\nTaxonomy\nSentiment\nOrthography\nSynonyms\n0\n0.5\n1\nEN-DE\nEN-ES\nEN-FR\nUnscrambling\nCategorization\nDebugging\nLarger Animal\nOdd_one_out\n0\n0.5\n1\nPassivation\nPluralization\nPeriodic\nSum\nFirst Letter\nDiff\nNum2Verbal\nLetters list\nFigure 4:\nZero-shot test accuracy on 32 tasks from [Honovich et al., 2022].

Training-set examples can be used\nfor instruction optimization but the final instruction p\u2217 is evaluated on a held-out test set. Zero-shot performance H(p)\non the test set is reported.\nBaselines.\nWe compare INSTRUCTZERO with two baseline methods: (1) APE [Zhou et al., 2022], which generates\ninstructions using a more powerful LLM (i.e, ChatGPT1) than the open-source LLM in INSTRUCTZERO; and (2)\nUniform (pure exploration), which uses the same models as INSTRUCTZERO and draws the same total number of\nsoft prompts by uniform sampling without iterative BO procedure.\nScore Function.\nIn the experiments, we use a simple 0-1 loss as the score function h(\u00b7, \u00b7), i.e, h(f([v; X]), Y ) = 1\nif f([v; X]) = Y , otherwise h(f([v; X]), Y ) = 0. So the score h1:m in Algorithm 1 computes execution accuracy\nby averaging h(f([v; X]), Y ) over all validation examples (X, Y ) \u2208 Dt. A more fine-grained score can be the log-\nlikelihood of the ground-truth answer under instruction v and input X. It is worth noting that the choice of score\nfunction depends on the outputs provided by the black-box LLM, e.g., GPT3 returns the log probabilities of the most\nlikely tokens 2 while ChatGPT only offers access to the generated answer 3. Since we use ChatGPT as the black-box\nLLM, h1:m represents execution accuracy in our experiments.\nImplementation Details.\nWe implement INSTRUCTZERO as illustrated in Fig. 2 with Vicuna and ChatGPT as the\nopen-source LLM and API LLM, respectively. For each task, we draw \u03c4 = 5 and 20 samples from the training set as\nthe exemplars and validation set Dt, respectively. For the number of tokens in soft prompts, we search for the best value\namong {3, 5, 10} based on the validation set performance. We draw entries of the random projection matrix A from a\nuniform distribution between [\u22121, 1]. The dimensionality d of p is set to 10. In experiments, we apply a mini-batch\nversion of INSTRUCTZERO that explores 25 soft prompts in every iteration. The only major change required is to select\nthe top-25 soft prompts with the largest u(p) instead of maximizing Eq. (7) in Line 8 of Algorithm 1. We utilized an\nevolutionary search algorithm CMA-ES [Hansen, 2016] as the optimizer to find the top soft prompts. All the training\nand tests are conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU card.\n4.2\nMain Results\n1GPT-3 was used in the original APE model but we re-evaluated it using the more powerful ChatGPT.\n2https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create\n6\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nInstruction Generated by InstructZero\nAccuracy\n1\nThe instruction was to find the most dangerous \nanimal in the zoo.\n0.65\n2\nThe instruction was to find out which animal is \nstronger between two animals.\n0.8\n3\nThe instruction was to input a animal and a animal \ninto the system, and the system would output the \nstronger animal.\n1.0\nTask Description: write the stronger animal\nExample: Input: whale shark, dog\nOuput: whale shark\nFigure 6: Left: Soft prompts selected by INSTRUCTZERO in three consecutive iterations (2D embedding by t-SNE).\nColors denote different iterations and a larger circle refers to a higher objective value (zero-shot validation accuracy).\nNumbers highlight the best soft prompt per iteration.

On easy tasks such as \u201cLetters\nList\u201d and \u201cSum\u201d, INSTRUCTZERO is comparable to APE\nwhich has already achieved perfect execution accuracy (i.e.,\n1.0). On the other hand, INSTRUCTZERO exhibits superior\nperformance on challenging tasks such as \u201cUnscrambling\u201d\nand \u201cTaxonomy Animal\u201d where APE struggles. Fig. 1 (right)\nreports the histograms for the improvement of INSTRUCTZERO\nover the two baselines on all tasks except those easy ones on\nwhich both baseline and INSTRUCTZERO achieve (100%) test\naccuracy. Overall, the results demonstrate that instructions\ngenerated by INSTRUCTZERO significantly outperform those\nproduced by the other two baselines by a large margin. We also\nsummarize the best instruction created by INSTRUCTZERO for\neach task in Appendix.\nFig. 5 shows the zero-shot accuracy of the top-15% instructions after each iteration of INSTRUCTZERO. On most tasks,\nthe accuracy consistently improves over iterations, indicating an effective optimization process. Nonetheless, on easy\ntasks such as \u201cSum\u201d, the best instruction was identified in the very first iteration and thus further optimization was\nunnecessary.\n4.3\nAblation Study\nTask\nManual\nw/o Manual\nINSTRUCTZERO\nCause_and_effect\n0.36\n0.56\n0.91\nNegation\n0.27\n0.01\n0.80\nTranslation_en-fr\n0.02\n0.47\n0.89\nSum\n0.00\n0.00\n1.00\nFormality\n0.59\n0.31\n0.63\nLetters_list\n0.00\n0.15\n1.00\nLarger_Animal\n0.49\n0.81\n0.91\nTable 1: Ablation study.

As\nillustrated in Fig. 7 shows, we replace the INSTRUCTZERO-optimized p\u2217 with a meta-prompt handcrafted by humans\n7\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\n(used in APE [Zhou et al., 2022]) for instruction generation but keeps all the other parts the same in the test-setting\nfor INSTRUCTZERO; and (2) w/o Manual. we further remove any prompt and solely use the \u03ba exemplars as input to\ngenerate instruction v. The comparison results are reported in Tab. 1, which shows a large improvement when using the\nsoft prompt optimized by INSTRUCTZERO when compared to the two baselines. For example, on task \u201cLetters List\u201d,\nINSTRUCTZERO achieves 100% accuracy while Manual Prompt is 0%. The improvement indicates that the optimized\nsoft prompt plays a substantial role in instruction generation for better zero-shot performance on downstream tasks and\nBO in INSTRUCTZERO is effective in finding the optimal soft prompt.\nI gave a friend an \ninstruction and five \ninputs.

The instructions\ngenerated using the best soft prompt in each iteration are given\nin the right of Fig. (6), which shows a progressive improvement\nof the instruction quality in terms of clarity, details, and task rel-\nevance. In Fig. 1 and 8, we compare the instructions generated\nby the three methods, i.e., Uniform, APE, and INSTRUCTZERO,\nfor the same set of tasks. While both APE and Uniform can\nproduce reasonable instructions, they exhibit notable drift from\nthe task description. For instance, in Fig. 1, APE selects \u201cSort\nthe inputs alphabetically and then output the first, third, fifth,\nand seventh elements of the sorted list.\u201d as its top instruction,\nwhich is not precise at all. In contrast, INSTRUCTZERO opti-\nmized instruction \u201cFind a list of the animals from the input list\u201d\nis clearer. Another example of the \u201cFormality\u201d task in Fig. 8\nalso demonstrates that INSTRUCTZERO can better comprehend\nthe exemplars and yield more precise instructions.\n5\nRelated Work\nLarge Language Models. The scaling up of transformer-based language models [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al.,\n2018] has consistently improved performance across various downstream NLP tasks. As a consequence, numerous\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been uncovered, encompassing few-shot in-context learning [Brown\net al., 2020], zero-shot/few-shot sequential reasoning [Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022], and the automatic generation\nof intructions [Honovich et al., 2022]. In this paper, we study how to guide open-source LLMs to generate and improve\ninstructions for subsequent API LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that INSTRUCTZERO has the potential to break the\nscaling law of LLMs: a 10\u00d7 smaller open-source model (Vicuna) can be used to optimize an instruction with superior\nperformance compared to a much larger LLM (ChatGPT used in APE).\nInstruction-following and instruction-finetuning. LLMs are able to follow instructions, a capability that can be\nreinforced by instruction tuning [Chung et al., 2022, Iyer et al., 2022, Sanh et al., 2021], e.g., finetuning the model on\na wide range of tasks using human-annotated prompts and feedbacks [Ouyang et al., 2022], or supervised finetuning\nusing public benchmarks and datasets [Wang et al., 2022]. ChatGPT is well-known as an instruction follower but is\n8\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\na black-box model. Vicuna 4 finetunes the open-source LLaMA [Touvron et al., 2023] using only 700K instruction-\nfollowing examples from user-shared ChatGPT data [OpenAI, 2023], which exhibits similar instruction-following\ncapability as ChatGPT. Zero-shot learning does not allow finetuning the LLM or training an adapter [Hu et al., 2021].\nMoreover, for black-box LLMs, any model training is infeasible. In these cases, we can only improve the downstream\ntask performance by optimizing the instruction, which is exactly the problem addressed by INSTRUCTZERO and is a\nchallenge complementary to instruction finetuning.\nPrompting and Auto-Prompt. Prompting prepends some soft token embeddings, textual instruction, or/and input-\noutput exemplars of a target task to the original input query as context information to guide the reasoning of LLMs.\nSoft prompts as differentiable are learnable and can be optimized by backpropagation [Li and Liang, 2021, Lester et al.,\n2021, Liu et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2023b,c,d, Bao et al., 2023]. However, API LLMs are black boxes that only allow\nhard prompts in natural languages, whose optimization is challenging due to the combinatorial and highly structured\nsearch space. [Deng et al., 2022] relies on reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize hard prompts while INSTRUCTZERO\noptimizes an instruction in the output space of an open-source model g(\u00b7) without RL by applying BO of a soft prompt\nto g(\u00b7). Another line of works of prompting [Brown et al., 2020] relies on the generative power of LLMs and asks them\nfor self-debugging [Chen et al., 2023e] or self-improve [Huang et al., 2022]. Auto-prompt [Shin et al., 2020] conducts a\ngradient-guided search in a pre-defined set of triggers to build up prompt automatically. APE [Zhou et al., 2022] adopts\na black-box LLM such as GPT-3 to generate instructions and select better ones but its search in the instruction space\ncan be inefficient without exploiting the correlation between the evaluated instructions, which may lead to sub-optimal\nresults. Compared to them, INSTRUCTZERO leverages open-source models to generate instructions to explore and thus\ndoes not need a predefined set of triggers.\nBlack-box tuning for LLMs. BBT [Sun et al., 2022b] and BBTv2 [Sun et al., 2022a] are pioneering works exploring\nblack-box prompt optimization for LLMs. Instead of optimizing textual instructions like INSTRUCTZERO, which\nis a challenging combinatorial problem, they focus on optimizing soft prompts sent to API LLMs. Moreover, they\nrequire API LLMs to take soft embedding as input and output soft probabilities, while INSTRUCTZERO focuses on\nmore realistic API LLMs that only allow textual inputs and textual outputs. So they cannot be applied to SOTA LLMs\nsuch as ChatGPT, GPT-4, or Claude, while INSTRUCTZERO can. Furthermore, their black-box optimization is based on\nCMA, which does not perform exploration-exploitation as efficient and effective as BO in INSTRUCTZERO.\nBayesian Optimization. Over the last decade, Bayesian optimization (BO) [Frazier, 2018] has emerged as a highly\neffective black-box optimization approach in various domains such as drug and molecule design [G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli\net al., 2018, Jin et al., 2018, Kajino, 2019]. Since our goal is to optimize instructions for a black-box LLM, it is akin to\nthe BO in combinatorial spaces [G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli et al., 2018], which is challenging especially when the space is\nhighly structured. Recent approaches [Kajino, 2019, Jin et al., 2018, Lu et al., 2018] study to reduce the combinatorial\nblack-box optimization to BO in a latent space, given a mapping from the latent space to the combinatorial space learned\nby deep generative models (DGMs). LADDER [Deshwal and Doppa, 2021b] introduces structure-coupled kernels to\nalign the abundant information of each structure in the combinatorial space with its corresponding representation in the\nlatent space. In a similar vein, our instruction-coupled kernel aims to align the soft prompt kernel with the similarity\nbetween instructions. However, our kernel has a different form and aims to guide the open-source LLM to explore\ndifferent soft prompts and generate better instructions.\n6\nDiscussion, Conclusions, and Limitations\nIn this paper, we propose INSTRUCTZERO, an efficient zeroth-order instruction optimization method that can improve\nthe zero-shot learning and instruction-following of black-box LLMs with only API access. INSTRUCTZERO addresses\nthe crucial challenge of prompt engineering, which is a combinatorial black-box optimization that currently still relies\non human expertise and costly experience. In contrast, INSTRUCTZERO can automatically optimize and generate\nhuman-readable and task-relevant instructions for arbitrary tasks by leveraging the in-context learning and generative\npower of recent open-source LLMs. Its key idea is to optimize a soft prompt that guides an open-source LLM to\ngenerate instructions for the black-box LLM to address the task. The zero-shot performance on the task using different\nsoft prompts is collected by a Bayesian optimizer to improve the soft prompt progressively. In this way, INSTRUCTZERO\novercomes the combinatorial challenge and reduces the original instruction optimization to an efficient latent space BO.\nWe provided visualizations of the optimization trajectories, optimized instructions, an ablation study, and extensive\ncomparison to other auto-instruction approaches on 32 tasks. INSTRUCTZERO using a small Vicuna model outperforms\nnon-optimization methods that utilize a much larger and more powerful LLM for instruction generation. As a general\ninstruction optimization tool, INSTRUCTZERO can be used to improve the efficiency of human-AI interactions through\nAPIs of black-box models and enhance the downstream task performance of these models without any model finetuning.\n4https://vicuna.lmsys.org/\n9\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nThere are two limitations of the current method that we are going to address in our future work: (1) We only tried\nVicuna-13B as the open-source LLM in the experiments. It is important to study different choices of open-source LLMs\nand their impact on the optimization, e.g., BLOOM-175B [Scao et al., 2022]; (2) The application of INSTRUCTZERO\nin current experiments does not include more complicated tasks requiring refinement, multi-step planning, or human\ninteractions, e.g., cooking recipe, website design, trip planning, and booking, etc. Improving the efficiency of solving\nthese tasks by instruction optimization can potentially save more costs.\nReferences\nWentao Bao, Lichang Chen, Heng Huang, and Yu Kong.

So we could\nnot calculate the log probability as the score function in INSTRUCTZERO (ours) as original APE Zhou et al. [2022]. We\nprovide our code for reproducing the experimental results using ChatGPT as black-box LLM.\nB.2\nChoices of Kernel in Bayesian Optimization\nWe investigate how the Instruction-Coupled Kernel affects the final performance of INSTRUCTZERO. We ablate the\neffective of Instruction-Coupled Kernel by removing the instruction component, namely Standard Kernel. Specially, we\nonly consider the structure of latent space, kernel 9 can be rewritten:\nKi,j = k(pi, pj) = l\u22a4\ni Llj.\n(10)\nTable 4 shows the Instruction-Coupled Kernel outperforms the Standard Kernel, indicating the effectiveness of\nInstruction-Coupled Kernel in our method.\nB.3\nOptimization process on more Tasks\nFig. 9, as a supplementary of Fig. 5, presents how the zero-shot accuracy (for the top 15% of instructions facilitated by\nour algorithm) is improved over the instruction optimization iterations of INSTRUCTZERO.

For\nexample, its ability to improve the quality of instructions for SOTA API LLMs, such as ChatGPT, could be leveraged\ninappropriately to generate deceptive and harmful content, such as highly convincing disinformation campaigns,\nmisleading narratives, and deceptive marketing content.\nIn situations where INSTRUCTZERO is used as intended but provides incorrect results, there may have possible\nimplications. For example, in high-stakes decision-making scenarios (such as medical or legal advice), incorrect\ninstruction optimization could lead to serious consequences, including incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate legal advice,\nor other harmful outcomes.\nIn conclusion, while the ability of INSTRUCTZERO to optimize and generate human-readable and task-relevant\ninstructions offers promise for enhancing the efficiency we interact with LLMs, it is crucial to implement safeguards\nand ethical guidelines to prevent its misuse, mitigate potential harms, and ensure its deployment aligns with the broader\nsocietal good.\n14\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nDataset\nBest Instruction\nPerformance\nUnscrambling\nFind words that are anagrams of each other\n0.67\nLetters List\nInput \u2019matter\u2019 and get \u2019m a t t e r\u2019 as output\n1.0\nDebugging\nInput the code and the output would be shown\n0.50\nWord Sorting\nmake a code that takes an input of a list and produces an output\nthat is the list with each word in the list in alphabetical order.\n0.64\nCause Selection\nGive a positive or negative output depending on the input\n0.86\nAntonyms\nMake the pairs of words opposite.\n0.89\nCategorization\nCreate a system which could understand what the inputs and outputs\nwere, and then use that knowledge to fill in the blanks in the following\nsentence: Input: Togo, Eritrea, and Burundi Output: African countries.\nThe system would then use this knowledge to fill.\n0.35\nLarger Animal\nRemove the input that has the smaller animal and\nkeep the larger animal\n0.91\nSum\nFind the sum of the two input numbers\n1.0\nPeriodic\nCreate a new element using the periodic table.\n1.0\nPassivation\nMake the sentences more natural by flipping\nthe subject and verb\n1.0\nCommon\nMake the output related to the input in some way\n0.15\nOdd one out\nDetermine the word that is different.\n0.92\nDiff\nFind the difference between the two numbers\n1.0\nAscii\nMake the letters appear in the correct order.\n0.33\nObject Counting\ncreate a program that takes an input (a list of things)\nand outputs the number of things in the list\n0.48\nNegation\nSwap the truth value of the input statements\nwith the opposite of the truth value\n0.80\nFirst Letter\nFind the first letter of each word in the list\n1.0\nSecond Letter\nCreate a function that takes a string as input and\nreturns the first character that is a vowel.\n0.62\nFormality\nInput a sentence and the output would be\na more proper version of that sentence.\n0.63\nCS algorithm\nGenerate a string which is the input to the function above,\nwhich when processed will give the output below.\n0.38\nNegation\nSwap the truth value of the input\nstatements with the opposite of the truth value\n0.80\nPluralization\nMake plural words from the input words\n1.0\nRhymes\nWrite a function that takes a word as\ninput and returns the output word\n0.46\nNum2Verbal\nWrite a function that takes an integer\nas input and returns the number in words\n1.0\nSimilarity\nFind the difference between the two\nsentences and the output was 4 - almost perfectly\n0.19\nTaxonomy\nCreate a program that generates a list of\nanimals based on the input provided\n0.82\nSentiment\nGenerate a short review based on the sentiment of the user\nbut the output was always positive or negative\n0.93\nOrthography\nInput a sentence and the output would be a word from\nthe sentence\n0.51\nSynonyms\nCreate a list of words that have a similar meaning\n0.38\nTranslation EN-DE\nTranslate the English words to German\n0.84\nTranslation EN-ES\nTake the input text and translate it into Spanish.\n0.87\nTranslation EN-FR\nConvert all of the words in the input column to\ntheir French translations.\n0.89\nTable 2: The best instruction found by INSTRUCTZERO.\n15\nInstructZero\nA PREPRINT\nName\nDemos\nDescription\nCS Algorithm\nInput: XDWO XDWOHDGYT\nOutput: 4\nGiven two strings, determine the\nlength of the longest substrings\nUnscrambling\nInput: ilpf\nOutput: flip\ncommon sense, gender bias, many-shot\nmultiple choice\nCategorization\nInput: Shaymin, Chatot, and Reshiram\nOutput: Pokeman\nCategorize the input list.\nPeriodic\nInput: 42\nOutput: molybdenum\nWrite the periodic element based\non the input number.\nOdd one out\nInput:Monday, spring, summer, winter\nOutput:Monday\ncommon sense, gender bias, many-shot\nmultiple choice\nAscii\nInput: .._..._..._..._..._.. ./../../../../..\n(.b.|.r.|.o.|.k.|.e.) ._/._/._/._/._/\nOutput: broke\nWhat word is displayed\nin the ASCII art below?\nObject Counting\nInput: I have a duck, a mouse, three\npigs, two fish, and a donkey.\nOutput: 8\nCount the objects in the input.\nmultiple choice\nDebugging\nInput: print(\u20191\u2019 + 2)\nOutput: TypeError: must be str, not int\nDebug the input program.\nTable 3: The description, demos of the 8 new tasks.

Our framework consists\nof two language models: a translation language\nmodel and a speech synthesis language model.\nWe use discretized speech units, which are gen-\nerated in a fully unsupervised way, and thus\nour framework can be used for unwritten lan-\nguages. For the speech synthesis part, we adopt\nthe existing VALL-E X approach and build a\nunit-based audio language model. This grants\nour framework the ability to preserve the voice\ncharacteristics and the speaking style of the\noriginal speech. We examine our system on\nChinese \u2192 English and English \u2192 Spanish\npairs. Experimental results show that our sys-\ntem can generate speech with high translation\nquality and audio quality. Speech samples are\navailable at https://speechtranslation.\ngithub.io/polyvoice.\n1\nIntroduction\nSpeech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is a challeng-\ning task as it encounters all the difficulties of auto-\nmatic speech recognition (ASR), machine transla-\ntion (MT) and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Dif-\nferent from conventional cascade approach (Lavie\net al., 1997; Baldridge, 2004; Nakamura et al.,\n2006), the direct approach (Jia et al., 2019, 2022a)\nhas the advantages of low latency and simpli-\nfied pipeline. Existing direct S2ST approaches\ncan be further classified according to whether the\nmodel predicts continuous mel-spectrogram fea-\ntures (Dong et al., 2022) or discrete units (Lee\net al., 2022). Unit-based approach has become\nmore popular due to several reasons: (1) It allows\nresearchers to take advantage of existing NLP mod-\neling techniques by treating acoustic unit as a new\nlanguage. (2) It eases the modeling difficulty of\nemitting spectrogram. (3) Units can be generated\n\u2217Equal contribution. Working in progress.\nin a fully unsupervised manner and can cover any\nunwritten languages.\nThere are two kinds of commonly used dis-\ncretized speech unit: semantic and acoustic units.\nSemantic units are usually derived from represen-\ntations produced by speech encoder models like\nHuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), mHuBERT (Lee et al.,\n2021) or w2v-BERT (Chung et al., 2021). They\ncaptures the phonetics and semantic content in\nspeech. Although the making of these units is orig-\ninally developed to be used as target for training\nthe speech encoder, recently there are attempts to\ndirectly use these units as input/output for semantic\ntasks (Meng et al.; Zhang et al.). Acoustic units\ncan also be referred as codec units. They are orig-\ninally developed to transmit high-quality speech\nsignal under limited bandwidth. AudioLM (Borsos\net al., 2022) is a pioneer work in using language\nmodels (LM) for audio generation. They make use\nof both kinds of unit and build several LMs with\ndifferent resolution. VALL-E (Wang et al., 2023)\nfurther extends the AudioLM framework and ap-\nplies it in TTS. They successfully demonstrate that\nthe in-context learning capabilities of LM can be\nsimilarly replicated in the context of phoneme and\ncodec units. In contrast to phoneme units which\nhave to involve supervised training process, both\nsemantic and acoustic units can be generated in a\nfully unsupervised manner.\nRecently, language modeling has made a lot of\nbreakthroughs in NLP. The success of GPT models\n(Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) is leading\nthe community to a new era. Right now, encoder-\ndecoder models are still dominant in speech mod-\neling, where LM-based methods have just begun\nemerging. Thus, we are motivated to investigate\nthe performance of LM-based method in S2ST. In\nthis paper, we propose a semantic unit-based frame-\nwork for S2ST system. Our framework consists of\ntwo LMs: a translation LM and a speech synthesis\nLM. The translation LM processes the semantic\narXiv:2306.02982v2  [cs.CL]  13 Jun 2023\nunits of the source language and translates the se-\nquence into semantic units of the target language.\nFor the speech synthesis part, we adopt the VALL-\nE X approach (Zhang et al., 2023) for the voice\nclone ability. We concatenate the source and target\nsemantic units, as well as the source acoustic units,\nand feed the whole sequence to the audio LM as\na prompt. The audio LM then predicts the target\nacoustic units which are converted to a waveform\nby a unit vocoder. Experimental results show that\nour system can generate speech with high transla-\ntion quality and audio quality.\nWe summarise our contribution as follows:\n\u2022 We propose using a decoder-only model to\ndo the direct translation, whereas encoder-\ndecoder model is the dominant structure in\nprevious works.\n\u2022 We build a unit-based audio LM for speech\nsynthesis. Compared to VALL-E X, we use\nunsupervised discretized unit and can cover\nunwritten languages.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 introduces related works in TTS and\nS2ST. Details of our method are described in Sec-\ntion 3. Section 4 introduces our experimental setup.\nSection 5 presents our ablation study. Finally, we\nconclude our work in the last section.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nTTS\nIn recent years, neural text-to-speech (TTS) syn-\nthesis has achieved significant developments, and\nthe progress of neural network structure makes\ncontinuous improvements in the intelligence of\nsynthetic speech (Wang et al., 2017; Ren et al.,\n2019; Kim et al., 2021; Popov et al., 2021). Be-\ncause of the requirements of real-world applica-\ntions, the researchers have attracted a lot of at-\ntention to zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and cross-\nlingual TTS (Jia et al., 2018; Cooper et al., 2020).\nThe multi-speaker TTS using speaker embedding\ntraining on the speaker verification task can gener-\nate a similar timbre for a seen speaker. However,\nzero-shot speaker cloning for unseen speakers is\nstill an unsolved problem. Trained on the large\ncorpus of speech data, VALL-E (Wang et al., 2023)\nleverages the in-context capability of prefix lan-\nguage modeling to achieve state-of-the-art (sota)\nperformance for zero-shot speaker cloning.\nCross-lingual TTS aims to build a system that\ncan synthesize speech in a specific language not\nspoken by the target speaker. Different embed-\ndings, such as speaker embedding, language em-\nbedding, and stress and tone embedding, are uti-\nlized in the cross-lingual TTS model to generate\nhigh-quality natural and intelligible native speech\nfor native/foreign seen/unseen speakers (Liu and\nMak, 2019). Compared with the fixed speaker em-\nbedding extracted from the pretrained speaker en-\ncoder, a multi-task learning framework has been\nproposed to enhance cross-lingual speaker similar-\nity by simultaneously training speaker classifica-\ntion (Yang and He, 2022). Building upon the prefix\nlanguage modeling of VALL-E, VALL-E X (Zhang\net al., 2023) applies this method to cross-lingual\nTTS training with bilingual Chinese-English data.\nWhen presented with source speech, source and\ntarget language text prompts, VALL-E X predicts\nthe codec token of the speech in the target language.\nThrough the in-context capability, the model aims\nto retain acoustic information from the source\nspeech prompt, such as the acoustic environment,\nthe source language speaker, and their emotion.\n2.2\nS2ST\nSpeech-to-speech translation (Lavie et al., 1997;\nBaldridge, 2004; Nakamura et al., 2006) aims to de-\nvelop models capable of generating target language\nspeech from source language speech. A na\u00efve sys-\ntem traditionally employs a pipeline (Nakamura\net al., 2006) that sequentially processes the input\nthrough automatic speech recognition (ASR) mod-\nels, machine translation (MT) models, and text-\nto-speech synthesis (TTS) models. Recently, end-\nto-end paradigms (Jia et al., 2019) have gained\npopularity in the field of S2ST, as they allow for a\nsingle model to perform one or more of the afore-\nmentioned tasks, which consequently reduces er-\nror propagation and latency. Among the various\ntechniques, auxiliary supervision based on textual\ndata has been particularly effective during train-\ning (Jia et al., 2019; Kano et al., 2021). However,\nthis approach is not feasible when dealing with\nunwritten languages. To address this challenge,\ndiscrete units (Hsu et al., 2021) extracted from the\nspeech are used to replace the target text, and then\ncan be synthesized into the speech (Tjandra et al.,\n2019; Zhang et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022). Large\nscale studies have shown the powerful performance\nin various speech processing tasks (Nguyen et al.,\nFigure 1: Overview of PolyVoice. The framework consists of two LM-based components: a S2UT front-end for\ntranslation and a U2S back-end for synthesis.\n2022).\nCurrent research in speech-to-speech translation\nprimarily emphasizes translation quality, with no-\ntable improvements observed in automatic evalu-\nation metrics (like BLEU) or human evaluation\nof naturalness. However, there remain two per-\nsistent challenges in developing practical systems.\nFirst, these systems are predominantly developed\nand evaluated on small-scale benchmarks, while\nreal-world scenarios often involve large quanti-\nties of labeled data, including ASR, MT, and S2T\ndata. Even for low-resource or unwritten languages,\nleveraging unlabeled speech or text can provide\nvaluable information (Lee et al., 2022). Therefore,\ndeveloping a unified model that jointly utilizes var-\nious data types is a critical research goal yet to be\nachieved. Second, while not a strict requirement,\npreserving the source speaker\u2019s style during trans-\nlation is an important aspect of improving user ex-\nperience (Zhang et al., 2023). However, capturing\nthe unique characteristics of individual speakers is\na challenging task. Current approaches, such as\nspeaker embeddings (Jia et al., 2019) and multi-\nspeaker TTS systems (Jia et al., 2018), have made\nsome progress in this direction, but they are still far\nfrom for practical requirements.\nFor the above considerations, We present\nPolyVoice, a versatile framework that can be ap-\nplied to both written and unwritten language se-\ntups. PolyVoice effectively harnesses diverse data\nsources within a language model-based framework\nand preserves the source speaker\u2019s style during syn-\nthesizing, having the enormous potential in the\npractical systems.\n3\nMethod\nWe introduce PolyVoice, a novel language model-\nbased framework for speech-to-speech translation\ncapable of handling both written and unwritten\nlanguages. The proposed framework utilizes dis-\ncrete units, obtained through self-supervised train-\ning methods like HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), as an\nintermediate representation between source speech\nand target speech. It consists of two parts: a speech-\nto-unit translation (S2UT) front-end converts the\nspeech in source language into the unit in target\nlanguage, and a unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end\nsynthesizes speech of translation while preserving\nthe source speaker\u2019s style. Figure 1 provides an\nASR: [lang]\nData: <unit, text>\nPrompt1: Translate [lang] unit \u201c {unit} \u201d to [lang] text: \u201c {text} \u201d\nPrompt2: Translate [lang] text \u201c {text} \u201d to [lang] unit: \u201c {unit} \u201d\nMT: [src lang] \u2192 [tgt lang]\nData: <src_text, tgt_text>\nPrompt: Translate [src lang] text \u201c {src_text} \u201d to [tgt lang] text: \u201c {tgt_text} \u201d\nS2ST: [src lang] \u2192 [tgt lang]\nData: <src_unit, tgt_unit, src_text, tgt_text>\nPrompt1: Translate [src lang] unit \u201c {src_unit} \u201d to [tgt lang] unit: \u201c {tgt_unit} \u201d\nPrompt2: Translate [src lang] unit \u201c {src_unit} \u201d to [src lang] text: \u201c {src_text} \u201d\nPrompt3: Translate [src lang] unit \u201c {src_unit} \u201d to [tgt lang] text: \u201c {tgt_text} \u201d\nPrompt4: Translate [src lang] text \u201c {src_text} \u201d to [tgt lang] unit: \u201c {tgt_unit} \u201d\nPrompt5: Translate [tgt lang] text \u201c {tgt_text} \u201d to [tgt lang] unit: \u201c {tgt_unit} \u201d\nTable 1: Data construction for U-XLM model by various prompts.\noverview of our approach.\n3.1\nSpeech-to-Unit Translation (S2UT)\nBy employing discrete units obtained through self-\nsupervised training, semantically irrelevant infor-\nmation from continuous speech representations is\nremoved, facilitates effective training in an NLP\nparadigm. And S2UT utilizes language model to\nlearn the unit-based cross-lingual generation.\nSemantic unit extractor\nS2UT first process the\nraw speech by a semantic unit extractor. Here we\nadopt HuBERT, which first encodes the speech\nby a stack of convolutions and Transformer lay-\ners to continuous representations at every 20-ms\nframe, and then utilizes k-means clustering to dis-\ncretize the representation to a set of cluster indices\nZ = z_1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , z_T. T is the number of frames and\nz_t \u2208 [K], where K is the number of cluster cen-\ntroids. Then, we merge the consecutive sequence\nof duplicate units to compress the sequence length,\nwhich reduces the computational costs and help\nconvergence.\nUnit-based cross-lingual language model (U-\nXLM)\nOver the past few years, the encoder-\ndecoder architecture has emerged as the most\nprominent paradigm for sequence-to-sequence\nmodeling (Sutskever et al., 2014). However, re-\ncent advances in the GPT family (Brown et al.,\n2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) have demonstrated the\npowerful capability of language modeling by the\ndecoder-only architecture. This inspires us to de-\nvelop a unit-based cross-lingual model, that predict\nthe semantic units in target language from the units\nof source speech by generative language modeling.\nWe denote the training sample consisting of units\nof speech in source language and target language\nas <src_unit, tgt_unit>. In the encoder-decoder\narchitecture, the encoder takes the source unit as\nthe input, and the decoder predict the target units.\nTo enable the cross-lingual unit generation, one\ncan use simple prompts to construct the training\nsamples of natural language from unit pairs, such\nas: Translate [src lang] unit \u201c {src_unit} \u201d to [tgt\nlang] unit: \u201c {tgt_unit} \u201d.\nTraining\nFor training the above U-XLM model,\nthe large scale of data is necessary for competitive\nperformance. The supervised data, cross-lingual\nunit pairs, is scarce in real-world scenarios. Al-\nthough the auxiliary models can be used to gener-\nate the pseudo labels, such as using the TTS model\nto synthesize the target speech, the direct training\nof supervised data is expected.\nTo further address the challenge of data scarcity,\nprevious studies introduce additional loss function\ninto the encoder-decoder architecture through mul-\ntitask learning (Jia et al., 2022a; Lee et al., 2022).\nThanks to language modeling, we adopt a more\nsimple manner to enable the use of diverse data\nsources like ASR and MT data. As shown in Table\n1, we slightly modify the prompts to construct train-\ning samples for various types of data sources, and\nthen train the model by parameter sharing, simpli-\nfying the design of auxiliary objectives. Unlabeled\ntext and speech can also be used directly in this ap-\nproach. In this way, the model implicitly improves\nthe alignment of representation space across speech\nunit and text.\nU-XLM offers several advantages, including the\nability to handle both written and unwritten lan-\nguage setups, multilingual modeling capabilities,\nand the potential for zero-shot prediction by lever-\naging large amounts of unlabeled data. These fea-\ntures make U-XLM a promising framework for\nadvancing speech-to-speech translation research.\n3.2\nUnit-to-speech Synthesis (U2S)\nUnit-to-speech language model (U-SLM)\nAs\nshown in Figure 1, the U-SLM processes the se-\nmantic units predicted by U-XLM and generate\nthe codec units which embed the speaking style of\nsource speaker. Like VALL-E X, U-SLM includes\na autoregressive model and a non-autoregressive\nmodel. Instead of phoneme, discretized semantic\nunits are used in our case. The unit extractor can\nbe trained in a fully unsupervised manner, which is\nsuitable for unwritten languages.\nSoundStream\ncodec\nWe\nuse\nSoundStream\n(Zeghidour et al., 2021), a neural audio codec, to\ncompute the embedding of acoustic tokens. We\nretrain the SoundStream, whose residual vector\nquantizer (RVQ) with a hierarchy of 6 vector quan-\ntizers and a vocabulary of 1024 symbols. In our\nconfigure, the acoustic tokens is produced at 80Hz\nfor input waveforms at 24 kHz. This is a 24000 /\n80 = 300-fold reduction in the sampling rate. After\nthe U2S model predict the acoustic tokens repre-\nsented by the SoundStream codec, the decoder of\nSoundStream reconstruct them to the waveform.\nDuration model\nWe empirically find that dura-\ntion information of the discretized unit is very im-\nportant for the stability of synthesized speech. In\nour work, we use a LM to predict the duration.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the merged source seman-\ntic unit sequence, merged target semantic unit se-\nquence and the source duration value (D) sequence\nare concatenated and fed to the duration LM as a\nprompt. Then the duration LM predicts the dura-\ntion value sequence and each target semantic unit\nwill repeat itself accordingly.\n4\nExperiments\nWe evaluate our method on two speech-to-speech\nbenchmark datasets, EMIME (Wester and Liang,\n2011) and CVSS (Jia et al., 2022b). Then, we show\nthe separate results of two components.\nType\nDataset\nSize\nASR\nLibriLight (En)\n60K hours\nIn-house (Zh)\n60K hours\nMT\nIn-house\n44M sents\nS2S\nGigaSpeech\n10K hours\nWenetSpeech\n10K hours\nTable 2: Training data of U-XLM model.\n4.1\nDatasets and Preprocessing\n4.1.1\nS2UT\nSemantic token\nU-XLM is trained by cross-\nlingual unit data, which is extracted from the audio\nby HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021) models. For Chinese\naudio, we utilize an open-source model based on\nWenetSpeech Chinese speech 1. For English and\nSpanish audio, we use an open-source multilingual\nmodel (English, Spanish and French) 2. The cluster\ncentroids of k-mean algorithm for two models are\n500 and 1,000, respectively.\nVocabulary\nTo address the out-of-vocabulary\nproblem and enable parameter sharing across lan-\nguages, we utilize byte-level subword units 3 that\ndecompose each character into byte-sized pieces,\nachieves a vocabulary size of 56,407 (including\n1,500 cluster centroids).\nDatasets\nConsidered that the paired speech-to-\nspeech (S2S) data is scarcity, we synthesize the\npseudo data from the ASR data utilizing in-house\nMT and TTS systems. In addition, various types\nof data resources provide better learning of the U-\nXLM model, like large-scale ASR and MT data.\nThe detailed statistics are shown in Table 2.\nThe S2S data is sourced from WenetSpeech\n(Zhang et al., 2022) and GigaSpeech (Chen et al.,\n2021). WenetSpeech is a Chinese ASR dataset with\nover 10,000 hours of speech data collected from\nYouTube. And we utilize a subset of 10,000 hours\nof GigaSpeech (Chen et al., 2021), an English ASR\ndataset collected from audiobooks, podcasts, and\nYouTube.\nThen we scale up the training data using specific\nprompts for various types of dataset. We utilize\nthe LibriLight (Kahn et al., 2020) and the in-house\n1https://github.com/TencentGameMate/chinese_speech_\npretrain\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/main/\nexamples/speech_to_speech/docs/textless_s2st_real_data.md\n3https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers\nASV \u2191\nASR-BLEU \u2191\nNaturalness \u2191\ntgt vs. src\nhyp vs. src\nhyp vs. tgt\nCascade (VALL-E X paper)\n+ w/ oracle target text\n0.58\n0.28\n0.27\n27.49\n3.44\n0.28\n0.29\n80.30\n3.43\nVALL-E X (VALL-E X paper)\n+ w/ oracle target text\n0.37\n0.37\n30.66\n3.54\n0.39\n0.38\n86.78\n3.54\nS2UT\nPolyVoice (S2UT + U2S)\n+ w/ oracle target semantic unit\n0.59\n0.06\n0.08\n29.30\n3.35\n0.38\n0.38\n29.40\n4.10\n0.42\n0.48\n76.10\n3.92\nTable 3: S2ST results on Chinese-English EMIME dataset.\nASR datasets. LibriLight is an unlabeled English\nspeech dataset containing about 60,000 hours of\nspeech. Since LibriLight has many long audios,\nwe segment and recognize the audio based on the\nmethod of voice active detection (VAD) and in-\nhouse ASR system, generating the audio length\nranging from 0.5 to 25s, and the average length is\n7s. In-house ASR dataset is a Chinese ASR dataset\nwith 60,000 hours of speech. We also use the in-\nhouse Chinese-English MT dataset consisting of\n44M sentence pairs.\n4.1.2\nU2S\nThe U-SLM is trained on the large open-source\nbilingual speech data, i.e., WenetSpeech (Zhang\net al., 2022) and LibriLight (Kahn et al., 2020).\nThe Librilight is handled in the same way as U-\nXLM. WenetSpeech keeps the original data length\nunchanged, the audio length ranges from 0.5 to 20s,\nand the average length is 2.5s. In addition, we used\nan additional 250h internal Chinese TTS data and\n400h internal English TTS data.\n4.2\nEvaluation\nTo measure the performance of our system, we\nevaluate both the translation quality and the speech\nquality.\nTranslation Quality\nFollowing the previous se-\ntups, we recognize the speech output by an in-\nhouse ASR system to compute BLEU scores (ASR-\nBLEU) for S2ST results.\nSpeech Quality\nThe speech quality is evalu-\nated by multiple metrics. The capability of voice\nclone is measured by the speaker similarity (ASV-\nScore), which is calculated by an ASV model 4\n4https://github.com/Sanyuan-Chen/UniSpeech/tree/t-sch\nen/asv_eval/downstreams/speaker_verification#example-2\nto determine whether the synthesized speech is\nfrom the same speaker as the ground-truth speech.\nThe naturalness of the speech output is evaluated\nby the automatic metric using NISQA 5. And the\npronunciation accuracy is evaluated using WER\nscores (ASR-WER) with a ASR model based on\nhubert-large 6.\n4.3\nModel Settings\n4.3.1\nS2UT\nIn the S2UT front-end, U-XLM\u2019s model architec-\nture is a unidirectional Transformer decoder con-\nsisting of 48 layers with hidden size 1600, feed-\nforward network (FFN) size 6400, and 25 attention\nheads. The total parameters are 1.6 B. U-XLM\nis trained on 8/32 NVIDIA TESLA A100 80GB\nGPUs with a batch size of 3072 tokens per GPU\nfor 500k steps.\n4.3.2\nU2S\nIn the U2S back-end, the U-SLM consists of 12\ntransformer layers. Each of these layers comprises\n16 attention heads, an attention dimension of 1024,\nand an FFN dimension of 4096 in both the au-\ntoregressive (AR) model and non-autoregressive\n(NAR) model.\nWe train the models using 8\nNVIDIA TESLA A100 80GB GPUs, with a batch\nsize of 8 utterances per GPU for 800k steps. Train-\ning for all steps takes about 5 days.\n4.4\nResults and Analysis\n4.4.1\nS2ST Results\nTable 3 summarizes the overall performance of our\nmethod for S2ST.

BLEU means ASR-BLEU, target unit means oracle\nSpanish unit.\nsystem treats S2ST as a pipeline of running an\nASR model, an MT model, and a multi-speaker\nYourTTS model sequentially. During the synthesis\nprocess, speaker information is integrated using\nspeaker embeddings.\nWe first evaluate the capability to preserve the\nvoice of the source speaker in the output speech, us-\ning the ASV score. We calculate speaker similarity\nbetween the source speech, target speech, and syn-\nthesized speech. We run the U-XLM alone, where\nspeech is synthesized by a Unit-based vocoder7.\nDue to the lack of explicit modeling of speaker\ncharacteristics, it produces particularly low ASV\nscores. Both the VALL-E X and PolyVoice systems,\nwhich adopt in-context learning, show superior per-\nformance over the speaker embedding. Notably,\nour method demonstrates better voice cloning capa-\nbilities when ground-truth target information was\navailable.\nPolyVoice achieves a slight degraded translation\nquality (ASR-BLEU) but a remarkable improve-\nment in speech quality (naturalness) compared with\nVALL-E X. When taking the ground-truth target in-\nformation as input, PolyVoice is inferior to VALL-\nE X with a large gap of about 10 BLEU points,\nwhile the naturalness improves significantly. The\nsemantic units are extracted from the speech by\nunsupervised learning, which inevitably introduces\nerrors. Although units are considered \u201csemantic\u201d\ntokens, they still preserve some acoustic informa-\ntion. Therefore, unit-based modeling leads to bet-\nter speech quality but worse translation quality. In\ncontrast, phonemes obtained from the text ensure\nsemantic correctness but lost the acoustic informa-\ntion. Therefore, we believe that units have more\npotential, even if the current performance is slightly\ndegraded. And future work can focus on enhancing\nthe extraction of semantic information to improve\ntranslation quality.\nInterestingly, PolyVoice achieves better natural-\n7https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/main/\nexamples/speech_to_speech/docs/textless_s2st_real_data.md\nArch\nASR-BLEU\nEncoder-Decoder\n16.8\n+ w/ U2S\n18.7\nDecoder-only\n20.7\n+ w/ U2S\n22.0\nTable 5: Performance with different architectures.\nness using the predicted units. We speculate that\nthis is due to the language model\u2019s output having\nbetter fluency. U-XLM learns the speech distribu-\ntion over the large scale of unit data, and tends to\ngenerate more natural sequences of units. How-\never, this may interfere with the accuracy of the\ntranslation. We will explore this issue in the future.\n4.4.2\nUnwritten Language Scenario\nWe examine our proposed framework in the case\nwhere the source is a written language and the tar-\nget is a unwritten language. In our setup, we train\nand evaluate an English\u2192Spanish S2ST system\nwithout the use of any Spanish text transcript. Ta-\nble 4 summarizes the results. The ASR-BLEU\n(18.3) indicates that the Spanish speech generated\nby our system is semantically understandable. This\ndemonstrates the ability of our S2ST system for the\nunwritten languages.\n5\nAblation Study\n5.1\nDecoder-only vs. Encoder-Decoder\nEmpirical studies in the field of natural language\nprocessing have revealed that the full potential of\nthe decoder-only approach can be realized through\nthe use of large model sizes and expansive datasets.\nAs pioneers in exploring the application of lan-\nguage models to S2ST, we present a fair compari-\nson of the two architectures in Table 5.\nTwo models are trained with same training data.\nInterestingly, the decoder-only model yields a re-\nmarkable improvement of 3.9 BLEU points over\nTask\nS2ST (BLEU \u2191)\nASR (CER \u2193)\nST (BLEU \u2191)\nMT (BLEU \u2191)\nTTS (WER \u2193)\nS2S\n22.2\n-\n-\n-\n-\n+ MTL\n29.4\n4.46\n30.8\n33.81\n6.99\nTable 6: The performance of multiple tasks on EMIME dataset.

When we syn-\nthesize the speech by U2S instead of vocoder, the\nperformance gap is reduced, highlighting the ro-\nbustness of our U2S back-end.\n5.2\nMulti-task Training\nAs discussed in Section 3, the language modeling\nenables the direct training over the diverse data\nsources utilizing specific prompts. In this way, we\ncombine additional large scale ASR and MT data\nto fully explore the potential of our method.\nAs shown in Table 6, U-XLM achieves promis-\ning performance for multiple tasks involved (in-\ncluding S2ST, ASR, ST, MT, and TTS) under the\nexpanded data setting, which verifies the capability\nof the general modeling in the decoder-only archi-\ntecture. In the traditional paradigm, we need to\ndesign the complex manner to combine multi-task\nlearning, but language modeling only modify the\nprompt to construct the training data.\n5.3\nSemantic Unit and Duration Model\nTable 7 shows the resynthesis performance of\ndifferent speech synthesizers. Our TTS obtains\nbetter performance in both ASV and naturalness.\nWe attribute the increase of WER to the differ-\nence in amount of semantic information carried\nby phonemes and unsupervised units. This is con-\nsistent with the observation reported in the work of\nmHuBERT and AudioLM.\nIf we remove the duration model from the U2S,\nthe WER increases dramatically. Our guess is that\n8We train the encoder-decoder architecture using the code:\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/main/examp\nles/speech_to_speech/docs/direct_s2st_discrete_units.md.\nthe unit itself do not contain as many duration in-\nformation as the phonemes. Therefore the duration\nmodel is essential when using unsupervised units.\nWe further train our own multilingual HuBERT\nmodel (mHuBERT_zh_en) with a combination of\nChinese and English data. The model size is the\nsame as the HuBERT-large model in (Hsu et al.,\n2021).\nWe find that the WER improves when\nwe use the semantic units generated from mHu-\nBERT_zh_en. Thus, we believe that a larger model\nmay generate better semantic units. We do not use\nmHuBERT_zh_en in our S2ST experiment because\nwe need the mHuBERT in (Lee et al., 2021) to run\nthe English->Spanish experiment. The benefit of\nusing mHuBERT_zh_en to the overall S2ST is left\nfor future work.\n6\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we propose a semantic unit-based\nframework for S2ST. Our framework consists of\ntwo LMs: a translation LM (U-XLM) and a speech\nsynthesis LM (U-SLM). We show that our unit-\nbased S2ST system performs better than existing\nsystems in terms of ASR-BLEU, ASV and natu-\nralness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system\nability in unwritten language scenario without any\nuse of the Spanish text transcript. As our system\nperformance is highly related to the quality of the\nsemantic units, future work will investigate the way\nto generate a better set of discrete units. Also, we\nplan to investigate how the performance can be\nfurther improved by using much larger model.\nReferences\nJason Baldridge. 2004.

    "text": "GPT Models Meet Robotic Applications: Co-Speech Gesturing Chat\nSystem\nNaoki Wake1, Atsushi Kanehira1, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi1, Jun Takamatsu1, and Katsushi Ikeuchi1\nAbstract\nThis technical paper introduces a chatting robot system that utilizes recent advancements in large-scale language models\n(LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT (Fig.1). The system is integrated with a co-speech gesture generation system, which selects\nappropriate gestures based on the conceptual meaning of speech. Our motivation is to explore ways of utilizing the recent progress\nin LLMs for practical robotic applications, which bene\ufb01ts the development of both chatbots and LLMs. Speci\ufb01cally, it enables the\ndevelopment of highly responsive chatbot systems by leveraging LLMs and adds visual effects to the user interface of LLMs as\nan additional value. The source code for the system is available on GitHub for our in-house robot and GitHub for Toyota HSR.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, large-scale language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 [1] and ChatGPT [2] have achieved remarkable success\nin natural language processing tasks. Meanwhile, there is a growing interest in applying LLMs to robotic applications (task\nplanning, for example, [3]), as they have the potential to enhance human-robot interaction with its high language processing\ncapabilities.\nIn this paper, we present a co-speech gesturing chat system that combines the GPT-3 model with a gesture engine developed\nby our team [4], [5]. The gesture engine analyzes the text of the robot\u2019s speech and selects an appropriate gesture from a\nlibrary of gestures associated with the conceptual meaning of the speech, called as gesture library [6]. By integrating LLMs\nas the backend, we aim to provide users with a highly responsive chat system that can handle a wider range of conversational\ntopics and contexts.\nWe believe that LLMs will contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the development of practical robotic systems. Taking chatting robots as\nan example, developers can develop highly responsive systems with simple prompt engineering. Another interesting topic will\nbe how adding visual effects to the user interface of LLMs, which are mostly text-based interactions, will affect the usability\nand conversational content. We have implemented the chat system into two robots, our in-house MSRAbot and Toyota HSR.\nThe source code for the system is available on GitHub for our in-house robot and GitHub for Toyota HSR.\nII. PIPELINE\nThe overview of the pipeline is shown in Fig.2. The user sends a query to the robot system via text or microphone\ninput. Microphone input is noise-suppressed to prevent the robot\u2019s ego noise from interfering with recognition [7], [8]and\nthen converted to text using a third-party text-to-speech technology [9]. The robot system then generates a prompt for the\nGPT-3/ChatGPT model based on this input.\nA. Chatting engine\n1) GPT-3 model as backend: As GPT-3 is not specialized for chat and is designed for text completion, the prompt needs\nto be carefully crafted to achieve chat-like responses. To do this, we save the conversation history between the user and the\nrobot system and design the following prompt:\n\u201cYou are an excellent chat bot. Please respond to the current message accurately, taking into account your knowledge and\nour previous conversations. Previous conversations: history Current message: message\u201d\nHere, history is assigned the conversation exchange separated by line breaks, and message is assigned the new input from\nthe user. We used the Azure Open AI\u2019s davinci model as the speci\ufb01c model. The example of the conversation is shown in\nFig.3.\n2) ChatGPT model as backend: We used the Azure Open AI\u2019s gpt-3.5-turbo model as the speci\ufb01c model. Since the ChatGPT\nmodel can receive conversation history, we simply described roles in the prompts, without embedding the conversation history.\nThe following is an example of a prompt we prepared:\n\u201cYou are an excellent chat bot, named MSRAbot. You are embodied with a small robot, which makes lively gestures in\nresponse to your speech. Please keep conversations with the user by responding with short English phrases. The response can\nbe composed of several sentences, but every sentence should be de\ufb01nitely short and less than 12 words. Answer in English in\nany situation.\u201d\n1Applied Robotics Research, Microsoft, Redmond, WA 98052, USA naoki.wake@microsoft.com\narXiv:2306.01741v1  [cs.RO]  10 May 2023\nFig. 1. Our robotic gesture engine and DIY robot, MSRAbot, are integrated with a GPT-based chat system.\nB. Gesture engine\nThe response from GPT-3/ChatGPT is passed on to two modules: a speech generator, which converts the text into speech using\na third-party text-to-speech technology [9], while the gesture engine selects a concept from the text. For concept estimation, we\npreliminarily analyzed a collection of everyday English conversation phrases and de\ufb01ned dozens of concepts that are commonly\nrepresented in conversations [6]. Based on the concept labels for the phrases, we trained the estimation model using Azure\nLanguage Understanding [9].\nThe gesture generator then produces gestures based on the estimated concept. When several gestures are associated with the\nconcept, we randomly select one. The length of the gesture was modi\ufb01ed to match the length of synthesized speech. Finally,\nthe generated speech and co-speech gestures are presented to the user as audio-visual feedback.\nC. Open sources\nNote that we store the information of gesture motions using Labanotation, a notation for describing human dance. Laban-\notation is an intermediate representation of human motions that contains enough information to reproduce them. Thus, by\nimplementing a Labanotation decoder for each robot, this pipeline can be scaled to arbitrary robots [10]. Currently, we have\nprepared the decoder for our in-house robot, MARabot, and Toyota HSR, and we have open-sourced the code on GitHub for\nour in-house robot and GitHub for Toyota HSR. MSRAbot was originally designed as a platform for human-robot interaction\nresearch, and we have developed and open-sourced a DIYKit. This DIYKit includes 3D models of the parts and step-by-step\nassembly instructions, enabling users to build the robot\u2019s hardware using commercially available items. The software needed\nto operate the robot is also available on the same page.\nIII. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION\nLLMs like GPT-3/ChatGPT have shown remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, leading to growing interest\nin applying them to robotic applications. However, connecting a robot with LLMs poses risks such as bias, inappropriate\nresponses, or vulnerability to attacks. Solutions to these problems are in the process of development. To minimize those risks,\nit is crucial to carefully monitor and control the robot\u2019s output, utilize robust security measures, and provide proper ethical\nguidelines.\nFig. 2. The pipeline of the co-speech gesture generation system.\nFig. 3. Example of the conversation history between a human user and the chat system.\nIn conclusion, this paper introduced an LLM-empowered chatting robot system for achieving a natural and intuitive chatting\nexperience, while also providing synchronized co-speech gestures. We believe that LLMs will facilitate the development of\npractical robotic applications, provided that we pay close attention to the limitations of those models.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. Brown, B.

The difficulties are\ncompounded for the class of transformer text\ngeneration models due to the sensitivity of\nthe attention operation to quantization and the\nnoise-compounding effects of autoregressive\ndecoding in the high-cardinality output space.\nWe approach the problem with a mix of\nstatistics-based quantization for the weights\nand elastic quantization of the activations\nand demonstrate the first ternary and binary\ntransformer models on the downstream tasks\nof summarization and machine translation. Our\nternary BART base achieves an R1 score of 41\non the CNN/DailyMail benchmark, which is\nmerely 3.9 points behind the full model while\nbeing 16x more efficient. Our binary model,\nwhile less accurate, achieves a highly non-\ntrivial score of 35.6. For machine translation,\nwe achieved BLEU scores of 21.7 and 17.6 on\nthe WMT16 En-Ro benchmark, compared with\na full precision mBART model score of 26.8.\nWe also compare our approach in the 8-bit\nactivation setting, where our ternary and even\nbinary weight models can match or outperform\nthe best existing 8-bit weight models in the\nliterature. Our code and models are available at:\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/\nTernary_Binary_Transformer.\n1\nIntroduction\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (Brown et al.,\n2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2018) have\nemerged as powerful and generic tools, driving\nbreakthroughs not only in language understanding\nbut the field of AI in general. These models owe\n\u2217Equal contribution\ntheir success mainly to their seemingly infinite abil-\nity to scale to ever-larger data and model sizes. Un-\nfortunately, such scaling comes at the cost of large\ncomputational requirements, putting extensively\nlarge generative transformers out of reach of all but\nthe most resource-rich institutions. Even moder-\nately sized pre-trained transformers have limited\napplications due to their size and computational\ncost. Making generative transformers more effi-\ncient is imperative for widening their use to more\ndevices and practical applications.\nIn this work, we explore making generative pre-\ntrained transformers more efficient via the quanti-\nzation of their weights and activations. Quantizing\nthe weights of a neural network is useful for com-\npression and allows the model to be stored more ef-\nficiently. However, compression alone does not re-\nduce computation costs since the network\u2019s activa-\ntions need to be computed in full precision. Quan-\ntizing both weights and activations allows compu-\ntation to be performed with lower precision, po-\ntentially leading to significant efficiency gains de-\npending on the quantization level and hardware im-\nplementation. Quantizing neural networks have a\nlong history, and multiple works have attempted to\nquantize pre-trained transformers at various quanti-\nzation levels (Shen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020;\nLiu et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2021). Most of this work\nfocuses on encoder-only models (mainly BERT) for\nsentence and token classification tasks. Quantizing\ntext generation models has generally been regarded\nas a more difficult task (Behnke et al., 2021; Tao\net al., 2022) due to the large output vocabulary and\nsequential decoding. Recent work has tackled this\nproblem, though only for mild quantization levels\n(down to 8-bit activations) and with mixed success.\nIn contrast, we are interested in very low-bit\nquantization, down to ternary and even binary\nweights and activations. In order to achieve this,\nwe combine and unify best practices for weight\nand activation quantization and present a frame-\narXiv:2306.01841v1  [cs.CL]  2 Jun 2023\nwork that uses gradient-matching quantization for\nweights and elastic quantization for activations. We\napply our method to natural language generation\ntasks and, for the first time, demonstrate low-bit\ngenerative transformers of competitive accuracy.\nOur ternary (weight and activation) model lags a\nfull-precision BART (Lewis et al., 2020) model by\nonly 4 points in ROUGE on the XSUM summariza-\ntion dataset. In contrast, our model with ternary\nweights and 8-bit activations comes within 1 point\nand even outperforms comparable state-of-the-art\nmodels with 8-bit weights. We also demonstrate a\nfully binary (weights and activations) model. While\nnot as competitive, it is able to achieve a highly\nnon-trivial ROUGE-1 score of 31.7.\nOur results also extend to machine translation\nmodels. On the WMT16 En-Ro benchmark, we\nquantize an mBART model to extend the ternary-\nweight 8-bit activation SoTA by 1.2 points while\ndemonstrating fully ternary and fully binary trans-\nlation models for the first time.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a novel combination of statistics-\nbased weight quantization with learning-based ac-\ntivation quantization, which enables stably training\ntransformer encoder-decoder models to converge\nin the fully ternary/binary settings, which was not\npreviously possible.\n\u2022 We significantly improve the state-of-the-art\ntext generation models in the 8-bit activation and\nternary/binary weight settings while setting the first\nnon-trivial baselines for the fully ternary and fully\nbinary settings.\n2\nMethod\nIn this section, we first introduce the previous prac-\ntices in binarization and ternarization. Then, we\nintroduce a unified statistic-based weight binariza-\ntion / ternarization method that can alleviate the\ngradient mismatch issue and enhance the quantized\nweights entropy. Lastly, we analyze the difference\nbetween weight quantization and activation quanti-\nzation and propose an elastic ternarization method\nfor activations. We abbreviate our method as TBT,\nshort for \u201cTernary / Binary Transformer\u201d.\n2.1\nPreliminary\n2.1.1\nTernarization\nTernary neural networks, where real values are\nquantized to three levels, are first introduced in (Li\net al., 2016).\nThus, these values can be repre-\nsented in 2 bits, leading to a 16\u00d7 reduction in size\nand computation. Moreover, the computations can\nbe calculated multiplication-free, leading to even\nfurther computation gains on suitable hardware.\nThe recent work integrates the ternarization algo-\nrithm in natural language models for quantizing\nthe weights and activations in classification tasks\n(Zhang et al., 2020) and ternarizing the weight (8-\nbit activations are used) in generative models (Li\net al., 2022; Tao et al., 2022). The general for-\nmula (Li et al., 2016) for ternarization is as follows:\nXi\nT =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2212\u03b1T,\nif Xi\nR < \u2212\u2206\n0,\nif \u2212 \u2206 \u2a7d Xi\nR \u2a7d \u2206\n+\u03b1T,\nif Xi\nR > \u2206\n(1)\n\u2206 = 0.7 \u00b7 ||XR||l1\nnXR\n(2)\n\u03b1T =\nP\ni Xi\nR \u00b7 1|Xi\nR|>\u2206\nP\ni 1|Xi\nR|>\u2206\n(3)\nHere XT denotes the ternary weights/activations,\nand XR represents their real-valued counterparts.\nnXR denotes the total number of elements in the\ntensor. \u2206 is the ternary threshold, and \u03b1T is the\nscaling factor that minimizes l2-loss between XT\nand XR.\n2.1.2\nBinarization\nThe neural network binarization denotes represent-\ning the weights and/or activation with bi-level val-\nues.\nIt is first proposed in BNN (Courbariaux\net al., 2016) and has evolved in the follow-up\nworks (Rastegari et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018).\nRastegari et al. (2016) formulates binarization as:\nXi\nB = \u03b1B\u00b7Sign(Xi\nR) =\n(\n\u2212\u03b1B, if Xi\nR < 0\n+\u03b1B, if Xi\nR \u2a7e 0\n(4)\n\u03b1B = ||XR||l1\nnXR\n(5)\nHere XB can represent binary weights or binary\nactivations. \u03b1B denotes the scaling-factor that min-\nimize the l2 loss between XR and \u03b1B\u00b7Sign(XR).\nThe acceleration and compression effect of\nternary/binary neural networks is significant. By\nrepresenting the weights and activations with\n{\u22121, 0, 1}, the network enjoys \u223c16\u00d7 memory sav-\ning compared to its 32-bit floating-point counter-\npart. When further binarize the weights and ac-\ntivations to only 1-bit (i.e., {\u22121, 1}), up to 32\u00d7\nmodel-size reduction and 58\u00d7 speedup on CPUs\nhave been achieved (Rastegari et al., 2016), where\nthe matrix multiplication operations are replaced\nwith light-weighted bitwise XNOR operations.\nDespite its appealing characteristics, naively bi-\nnarizing or ternarizing the transformer model for\nnatural language generation results in several accu-\nracy drops or even a total failure in training. It has\nbeen observed that the attention layers of the trans-\nformer network are difficult to quantize to low bits.\nAlso, the auto-regressive decoding tends to accu-\nmulate errors due to quantization. Given the nature\nof generative language networks that require high-\nprecision output, quantizing both the activations\nand weights in these models to extreme bit values\nis non-trivial and has not been explored before.\n2.2\nStats-based max-entropy isometric weight\nquantization\nWe propose a statistics-based method for weight\nbinarization/ternarization. Particularly, this novel\nquantization method considers maximizing the en-\ntropy of the quantized weights and reducing the\ngradient mismatch in the backward pass. Previous\nworks (Courbariaux et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021b;\nZhang et al., 2020) are mainly focused on minimiz-\ning the l2 loss between the quantized weights and\nthe real-valued weights to find the optimal quanti-\nzation scheme,\n\u03b1\u2217 = arg min ||\u03b1 \u02c6\nWQ \u2212 WR||l2\n(6)\nwhere \u02c6\nWQ denotes binary/ternary weights and \u03b1\u2217\ndenotes the optimal scaling factor calculated. De-\nspite the broad application and great success of the\nclassic quantization scheme, we found that merely\nminimizing the l2 loss neglects several critical but\nintractable issues in ultra-low-bit weight quantiza-\ntion: (1) The information entropy of the quantized\nweights is not considered. Eq. 1 and Eq. 4 cal-\nculate the quantized weights to minimize the dis-\ntance to the real-valued weights, which could lead\nto imbalanced quantized weight distribution and\nharm the quantized weights representation capacity.\n(2) The quantization function Eq. 1 and Eq. 4 are\nnot isometric, meaning that it does not consider\nthe magnitude consistency between the quantized\nweights and real-valued weights, while we find that\nmagnitude consistency contributes significantly to\naccurate gradient estimation.\nConsidering the above two limitations in previ-\nous solutions, we are motivated to design a novel\nquantization function that enhances information en-\ntropy and reduces gradient mismatch. To boost the\nweights representation capability, in information\ntheory, more information is preserved when the\nquantized weights contain higher entropy:\nmax\npi\nH = \u2212pi log(pi), s.t.\nN\nX\ni=1\npi = 1\n(7)\nwith pi denoting the proportion of real-valued\nweights being quantized to ith quantization level\nin total N levels.\nEq. 7 can be easily solved\nwith a Lagrange multiplier, and the optimal p\u2217\ni =\n1\nN , i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N}, suggesting the best quanti-\nzation scheme to preserve maximum information\nentropy is to distribute the real-valued weights in\nall quantization levels as evenly as possible.\nFor reducing the gradient mismatch, as sug-\ngested by the previous binarization work (Liu et al.,\n2020b), the magnitude difference between the quan-\ntized weight and the real-valued weight will greatly\ninfluence the gradient scale and a mismatch in mag-\nnitude will be amplified in back-propagation and\ncause gradient vanishing or explosion during train-\ning. Thus it is important to ensure the magnitude\nof real-valued weights and quantized weights are\nconsistent.\nCombining two requirements discussed above,\nwe proposed max-entropy isometric weight quanti-\nzation. In ternarization, it is formulated as\nWi\nT = \u03b1T\u230aClip(Wi\nR \u2212 \u00b5T\n\u03b1T\n, \u22121, 1)\u2309\nwhere \u00b5T = WR,\n\u03b1T = 4\n3 \u00b7 ||WR \u2212 \u00b5T||l1\nnWR\n(8)\nWhere WT and WR refer to the ternary weights\nand real-valued weights, respectively. The round-\ning function \u230a\u00b7\u2309 and Clip(\u00b7) function quantize\nweights to {\u22121, 0, 1}.\n\u00b5T is the mean of real-\nvalued weights and nWR denotes the number of\nweights in the weight matrix. Scaling factor \u03b1 is\ncalculated from the weight statistics and follows\nthe entropy rule to scale the real-valued weight\nWR to be evenly distributed in quantization lev-\nels. In the ternary case, the weights are quantized\nto {\u2212\u03b1T, 0, \u03b1T}. When the real-valued weights\nare initialized as uniformly and symmetrically\ndistributed (He et al., 2015; Glorot and Bengio,\n2010), the scaling factor \u03b1T will distribute Wi\nR\n\u03b1T\nto [\u22121.5, 1.5], such that the output ternary weights\nStats-based\nWeight\nQuant FC\nStats-based\nWeight\nQuant V\nStats-based\nWeight\nQuant K\nSelf-Attention\nQuantized\nEmbeddings\n\u2026\nSoftmax\nLearning-based Asymmetric\nActivation Quant {0,1,\u2026}\nStats-based\nWeight\nQuant Q\nLearning-based\nSymmetric\nActivation Quant\nLearning-based\nSymmetric\nActivation Quant\nLearning-based\nSymmetric\nActivation Quant\nLearning-based\nSymmetric\nActivation Quant\nLearning-based\nSymmetric\nActivation Quant\nTransformer Block Output\nFeed-Forward Network\nReLU\nStats-based Weight\nQuant FC\nStats-based\nWeight\nQuant FC\nLearning-based Asymmetric\nActivation Quant {0,1,\u2026}\nLearning-based\nSymmetric\nActivation Quant\nFigure 1: Overview of TBT. A transformer block contains the multi-head self-attention and feed-forward network.\nWe propose a statistic-based quantization method for weights ternarization/binarization and adopt a learning-based\nasymmetric quantization method for activation in ReLU/Softmax output (X \u2208 Rn\n+) and learning-based asymmetric\nquantization method for activations that contain both positive and negative values in other layers (X \u2208 Rn).\nwill have near uniform distribution in three ternary\nlevels. Meanwhile, Eq. 8 is an isometric mapping\nwhere the real-valued weights are scaled by\n1\n\u03b1T to\nnear [-1, 1] and time \u03b1T to scale back after quanti-\nzation. In this way, the magnitude is preserved.\nCorrespondingly, in the binary case we have,\nWi\nB = \u03b1B \u00b7 Sign(Wi\nR \u2212 \u00b5B\n\u03b1B\n)\nwhere \u00b5B = WR,\n\u03b1B = ||WR \u2212 \u00b5B||l1\nnWR\n(9)\nHere WB denotes the binary weights, where\nsubstracting the average \u00b5B makes the real-\nvalued weight zero-centered before binarization\nand thus encourages an even distribution in bi-\nnarized weights.\nThen the scaling factor \u03b1B\nmatches the magnitude between real-valued and\nbinary weights. Particularly, in Eq. 9, Wi\nB =\n\u03b1B \u00b7 Sign(\nWi\nR\u2212\u00b5B\n\u03b1B\n) = \u03b1B \u00b7 Sign(Wi\nR \u2212 \u00b5B), we\nexplicitly include the \u03b1B in the denominator to\nkeep the binarization function isometric and the\ngradients w.r.t. weights can be calculated straight-\nforwardly as:\n\u2202Wi\nB\n\u2202Wi\nR\nSTE\n\u2248 1\n|\nWi\nR\u2212\u00b5B\n\u03b1B\n|<1\n(10)\nSTE is abbreviated for straight-through estima-\ntor (Bengio et al., 2013), which replaces the non-\ndifferentiable Sign function with Clip function in\nthe backward pass. We show that the proposed max-\nentropy isometric weight quantization improves the\naccuracy of weight binarization / ternarization by\n6.0 / 11.53 RougeL scores on the CNN/DailyMail\nbenchmark, respectively. More details can be found\nin Sec. 3.2.\n2.3\nLearning-based activation quantization\nIn contrast to neural network weights that are stored\non the disk, activations are calculated on-the-fly.\nThe distribution of activations in a particular layer\ndepends on the network weights as well as the\ncorresponding input sequence, and thus varies from\nbatch to batch. In order to have the quantization\nfunction better capture the underlying activation\ndistribution, we propose learning-based activation\nquantization.\nInspired by BiT (Liu et al., 2022), we divide the\nactivation layers into two categories: the activation\nlayers with non-negative values (XR \u2208 R+), i.e.,\nSoftmax/ReLU layer outputs and the rest of the\nlayers with both positive and negative activations\n(XR \u2208 R). We binarize / ternarize the first acti-\nvation category (XR \u2208R+) to {0, \u03b1} / {0, \u03b1, 2\u03b1},\nand symmetrically quantize the later activation cat-\negory (XR \u2208 R) to {\u2212\u03b1, \u03b1} and {\u2212\u03b1, 0, \u03b1} in\nbinary and ternary cases respectively. In this way,\nthe activation distribution matches the original full-\nprecision activations and thus reduces the quantiza-\ntion error. Further, we learn to scale the real-valued\nactivations to better fit quantization thresholds, and\nthis learnable scaling factor can be updated end-\nto-end with the gradients from the network loss to\nbetter account for overall network optimization.\nIn the ternary case, we propose the elastic ternar-\nization function formulated as,\nXi\nT = \u03b1T \u02c6Xi\nT\n=\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\u03b1T\u230aClip( Xi\nR\n\u03b1T , 0, 2)\u2309, if XR \u2208R+\n\u03b1T\u230aClip( X\u2032i\nR\n\u03b1T , \u22121, 1)\u2309, if XR \u2208R\n(11)\nwhere XR and XT denote real-valued and ternary\nactivations, respectively. To keep the formula con-\ncise, we set X\u2032\nR = XR \u2212 XR, denoting the zero-\nmean real-valued activations. \u03b1T is the scaling\nfactor. Different from the weight quantization, the\nscaling factor in Eq. 11 is learned with the gradi-\nent update. We follow the practice in (Zhou et al.,\n2016; Esser et al., 2019) to calculate the gradients\nwith straight-through estimation (STE) bypassing\nthe non-differentiable rounding function:\n\u2202Xi\nT\n\u2202\u03b1T\nSTE\n\u2248\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\u02c6Xi\nT \u2212 Xi\nR\n\u03b1T \u00b710\u2a7dXi\nR\u2a7d2\u03b1T, if XR \u2208R+\n\u02c6Xi\nT \u2212 X\u2032i\nR\n\u03b1T \u00b71|X\u2032i\nR|\u2a7d\u03b1T,\nif XR \u2208R\n(12)\nThe learnable scaling factor can dynamically adapt\nto different activation distributions and improve\nthe ternarization accuracy. In the binary case, it is\nformulated as.\nXi\nB = \u03b1B \u02c6Xi\nB\n=\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b1B\u230aClip( Xi\nR\n\u03b1B , 0, 1)\u2309, if XR \u2208R+\n\u03b1B \u00b7 Sign(X\u2032i\nR\n\u03b1B ),\nif XR \u2208R\n(13)\nHere XB denotes the binary activations.\nCorrespondingly, the gradients w.r.t. the scaling\nfactor \u03b1 can be easily calculated as\n\u2202Xi\nB\n\u2202\u03b1B\nSTE\n\u2248\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\u02c6Xi\nB\u2212 Xi\nR\n\u03b1B \u00b710\u2a7dXi\nR\u2a7d\u03b1B, if XR \u2208R+\nSign(X\u2032i\nR),\nif XR \u2208R\n(14)\nWe demonstrate that with the learning-based ac-\ntivation quantization method and statistics-based\nweight quantization scheme, the proposed TBT for\nthe first time is able to quantize the BART model\nfor natural language generation tasks to ternary and\neven binary weights and activations, and achieve\nreasonable accuracy on summarization and transla-\ntion benchmarks.\n3\nExperiments\nIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our\nlow-bit quantization scheme for natural language\ngenerative model on text summarization bench-\nmarks: CNN/DailyMail (Nallapati et al., 2016) and\nXSUM (Narayan et al., 2018). We additionally\nexperiment on the machine translation task with\nmBART on WMT16 English-Romanian (En-Ro)\ndataset (Bojar et al., 2016a).\n3.1\nExperimental settings\nWe follow recent work (Li et al., 2022) in train-\ning the quantized network with initialization and\nknowledge distillation from a full-precision pre-\ntrained model. Specifically, we use the BART-\nbase (Lewis et al., 2019) as our full-precision\nbaseline for summarization tasks and mBART-\nlarge (Liu et al., 2020a) for the translation task.\nWe train the quantized models for 20 epochs on 8\nGPUs with a batch size of 128 and a learning rate\nof 2.5e-4 for 8-bit activation models and 5e-4 for\nbinary and ternary activation models.\n3.2\nSummarization\nFor the summarization task, we adopt the following\nbenchmarks:\nThe XSUM dataset (Narayan et al., 2018)\ncon-\nsists of 226k documents sampled from the online\nnews website of BBC, together with short, one sen-\ntence summaries. Since the summaries are very\nshort, abstractive methods tend to do better on this\ndataset.\nTable 1: Comparison of quantization methods for text summarization on XSUM and CNN/DailyMail benchmarks.\nWe use the \u201cE-W-A (#bits)\u201d notation referring to the number of bits of embeddings, weights and activations,\n(specifically, 1 denotes binary, 2 denotes ternary). The results of QuantBart, DQ-BART and BlockPruning are\nquoted from their paper. Additionally, we implement the algorithm developed in BinaryBert, BiBert and TernaryBert\nto the BART model and report the results, denoted with \u2217.

The dataset contains close\nto 300k document-summary pairs.\nWe use BART-base model (Lewis et al., 2019),\nwhich is an English-only encoder-decoder trans-\nformer with 140 million parameters. We compare\nusing the standard ROUGE-{1,2,l} metrics for this\ntask.\nFor the ternary weights and 8-bit activations set-\nting, we compare with two state-of-the-art methods\nQuantBart (Tao et al., 2022) and DQ-BART (Li\net al., 2022). For the fully ternary setting, and the\nbinary quantization experiments, there is no prior\nart. Therefore we provide a naive quantization base-\nline, using popular implementations from previous\nwork (Li et al., 2016; Courbariaux et al., 2016),\nand adapt the binary and ternary methods proposed\nfor the BERT models (Bai et al., 2021b; Qin et al.,\n2021; Zhang et al., 2020) to BART.\nOur main results are summarized in Table 1. In\nthe ternary weights and 8-bit activations setting,\nTBT improves previous SoTA by up to 2.3 points\nin ROUGE score on XSUM, and up to 0.5 points\non CNN/DailyMail. Both improvements are signif-\nicant.\nFurther quantizing weights to binary, while keep-\ning activations at 8-bit, we are still able to achieve\na ROUGE-L score of 33.3 on XSUM, which is 0.8\npoints higher than the previous ternary SoTA (DQ-\nBART), and comparable on CNN/DailyMail. This\nis the first demonstration of a binary-weight gen-\nerative transformer model of competitive accuracy\nto our knowledge. Additionally, TBT binary weight\nBART model achieves 1.2 points higher ROUGE\nscore on CNN compared with the SoTA pruning\nmethod with the same compressed model size.\nMoving on to ternary and binary activations,\nthere is no prior art, and previous implementations\nfail to produce meaningful results. Our method,\non the other hand, achieves ROUGE-L scores of\n29.1 and 38.3 on XSUM and CNN/DailyMail in\nthe fully ternary setting, which are 6.6 and 3.8\npoints behind the full-precision baseline respec-\ntively.

None of the\nablated models can achieve an R2 score above 1.5.\nIt\u2019s only the combination of the two, which to-\ngether stabilize the training and result in good con-\nvergence for fully ternary and binary models.\n3.5\nSequence length analysis\nIn language generation tasks, the error compound-\ning issue in the recursive decoder generation pro-\ncess will largely amplify the quantization error\nor even lead to divergent results, and thus is an\nharsh factor to test the robustness of a quantization\nmethod. The average generated sequence length in-\ndicates whether the quantized model can overcome\nthe compounding error and generate reasonable\nlength of text.\nIn Table 4 we compare the generated sequence\nlength between the proposed method and the base-\nline method (i.e., TWN (Li et al., 2016) for ternary,\nBWN (Courbariaux et al., 2016) for binary).

As we can\nsee in Fig. 2 (b) and (g), the proposed method al-\nlows the weights to be more evenly distributed in\nthree ternarization levels, which can allow higher\ninformation entropy in quantized weights, as dis-\ncussed in Sec. 2.2. Additionally, we calculate the\nquantized weight distribution entropy (i.e., Eq. 7) in\n96 fully-connected layers in the BART-base model\nand found that the proposed TBT method achieves\nconsistently higher entropy in quantized weights\nthan the baseline method in all the layers. Further,\nan interesting phenomenon we can see in Fig. 2 (a)\n(e) is that ternary weights in a baseline model are\nvery close to the Gaussian distribution, in contrast,\nweights ternarized with TBT are capturing a more\nsophisticated distribution. This phenomenon im-\nplies that the proposed method helps the weights\nlearn more informative patterns and thus better sat-\nisfy the high demand for language generation tasks.\nFor activation quantization, it is evident that the\nattention layer and the SoftMax output only con-\ntain the positive activations (XR \u2208 R+). If simply\nternarized to {\u2212\u03b1, 0, \u03b1}, the ternary activations\nwill waste one representative level (Fig. 2(d)) and\ntherefore lead to lower accuracy. Instead, the pro-\nposed method uses a two-set ternarization method\nthat ternarizes the non-negative activation layer\n(XR \u2208 R+) to {0, \u03b1, 2\u03b1}, and learns the scaling\nfactor \u03b1 to better fit the underlying real-valued dis-\ntribution. This ternarization method greatly reduces\ninformation loss and enhances the final accuracy.\n4\nRelated Work\nQuantization has long been studied to make neu-\nral networks more efficient (see (Hubara et al.,\n2017) for a survey).\nDue to the popularity of\nBERT, numerous works have studied quantization\nfor transformer models, starting with 8-bit quan-\ntization (Zafrir et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2020), and\nprogressing to 4-bit (Shen et al., 2020; Zadeh et al.,\n2020), ternary (Zhang et al., 2020) and binary Bai\net al. (2021b); Qin et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2022).\nAll of these works have focused on the encoder-\nonly setting.\nIn the generative setting, Prato et al. (2019);\nBehnke et al. (2021) demonstrate quantized mod-\nels for machine translation, and Fan et al. (2020);\nBai et al. (2021a) for language modeling, though\nonly for moderate quantization levels (4-8 bits).\nMost recently, Tao et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2022)\npushed weight quantization down to 2 bits (with\n8-bit activation quantization) and evaluated on lan-\nguage modeling and summarization.\nHowever,\nour method outperforms these works substantially,\nwhile also demonstrating accurate generative trans-\nformers with both weights and activations quan-\ntized to 2-bit and even 1-bit for the first time.\n5\nConclusion\nWe have demonstrated high accuracy ternary and\nbinary natural language generation models based\non a pre-trained transformer encoder-decoder back-\nbone. Quantizing both the weights and the activa-\ntions of the network allow these models to run on\nspecial-purpose hardware using binary and ternary\narithmetic, which doesn\u2019t require multiplication\nmodules. Therefore our results promise multiple\norders of magnitude gains in efficiency while run-\nning these models, and can drastically expand the\nuse cases of such models beyond just high end gpu\nservers. We are especially excited about the im-\nplications of our results for larger text generation\nmodels such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). These\nmodels have both demonstrated impressive capabil-\nities, while also presenting enormous scaling and\ncomputational challenges. Low-bit quantization\nis a promising approach to mitigate some of these\nissues. Whether our approach will scale to these\nmodels is an open problem and an exciting future\nresearch direction.\n6\nLimitations\nWe conduct experiments on public datasets of fi-\nnite sentence length, while generalizability to ex-\ntremely long sequences or even streaming data has\nnot been verified. Furthermore, the generalizabil-\nity of the proposed quantization method to other\ntasks, including computer vision or speech recogni-\ntion, remains to be tested. In addition, binarization\nand ternarization require bit-packing to have actual\nmemory savings and dedicated hardware support\nfor real-time acceleration, which is more of a hard-\nware implementation aspect and not studied in this\npaper.\n7\nEthics Statement\nWe affirm that we contribute to society, avoid harm,\nand are honest and trustworthy. We respect previ-\nous work and appropriately cite the methods and\ndatasets we are using. All data we use is public and\nno private data is involved. There is some poten-\ntial risk if the translation technique is maliciously\nused by a third party and thus we are committed to\nmaintaining the compression techniques we have\ndeveloped and the general summarization/machine\ntranslation techniques used correctly without incur-\nring any form of discrimination.\nReferences\nHaoli Bai, Lu Hou, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Irwin King,\nand Michael R Lyu. 2021a.

MotionDiffuser is a learned representation for the distribution of multi-agent trajectories based on diffusion models. During\ninference, samples from the predicted joint future distribution are first drawn i.i.d. from a random normal distribution (leftmost column),\nand gradually denoised using a learned denoiser into the final predictions (rightmost column). Diffusion allows us to learn a diverse,\nmultimodal distribution over joint outputs (top right). Furthermore, guidance in the form of a differentiable cost function can be applied at\ninference time to obtain results satisfying additional priors and constraints (bottom right).\nAbstract\nWe present MotionDiffuser, a diffusion based represen-\ntation for the joint distribution of future trajectories over\nmultiple agents. Such representation has several key ad-\nvantages: first, our model learns a highly multimodal dis-\ntribution that captures diverse future outcomes. Second, the\nsimple predictor design requires only a single L2 loss train-\ning objective, and does not depend on trajectory anchors.\nThird, our model is capable of learning the joint distribu-\ntion for the motion of multiple agents in a permutation-\ninvariant manner. Furthermore, we utilize a compressed\ntrajectory representation via PCA, which improves model\nperformance and allows for efficient computation of the\nexact sample log probability.\nSubsequently, we propose\na general constrained sampling framework that enables\ncontrolled trajectory sampling based on differentiable cost\nfunctions. This strategy enables a host of applications such\nas enforcing rules and physical priors, or creating tai-\nlored simulation scenarios. MotionDiffuser can be com-\nbined with existing backbone architectures to achieve top\nmotion forecasting results. We obtain state-of-the-art re-\nsults for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open\nMotion Dataset.\n1. Introduction\nMotion prediction is a central yet challenging problem\nfor autonomous vehicles to safely navigate under uncertain-\nties. Motion prediction, in the autonomous driving setting,\nrefers to the prediction of the future trajectories of modeled\nagents, conditioned on the histories of the modeled agents,\ncontext agents, road graph and traffic light signals.\nSeveral key challenges arise in the motion prediction\nproblem. First, motion prediction is probabilistic and multi-\nmodal in nature where it is important to faithfully predict\nan unbiased distribution of possible futures. Second, mo-\ntion prediction requires jointly reasoning about the future\ndistribution for a set of agents that may interact with each\nother in each such futures. Naively predicting and sampling\nfrom the marginal distribution of trajectories for each agent\nindependently leads to unrealistic and often conflicting out-\ncomes. Last but not least, while it is challenging to constrain\nor bias the predictions of conventional regression-based tra-\njectory models, guided sampling of the trajectories is often\nrequired. For example, it may be useful to enforce rules\nor physical priors for creating tailored simulation scenarios.\nThis requires the ability to enforce constraints over the fu-\nture time steps, or enforce a specified behavior for one or\narXiv:2306.03083v1  [cs.RO]  5 Jun 2023\nFigure 2. Overview for multi-agent motion prediction using diffusion models. The input scene containing agent history, traffic lights and\nroad graphs is encoded via a transformer encoder into a set of condition tokens C. During training, a random set of noises are sampled i.i.d.\nfrom a normal distribution and added to the ground truth (GT) trajectory. The denoiser, while attending to the condition tokens, predicts\nthe denoised trajectories corresponding to each agent. The entire model can be trained end-to-end using a simple L2 loss between the\npredicted denoised trajectory and the GT trajectory. During inference, a population of trajectories for each agent can first be sampled from\npure noise at the highest noise level \u03c3max, and iteratively denoised by the denoiser to produce a plausible distribution of future trajectories.\nAn optional constraint in the form of an arbitrary differentiable loss function can be injected in the denoising process to enforce constraints.\nmore agents among a set of agents.\nIn light of these challenges, we present MotionDiffuser,\na denoising diffusion model-based representation for the\njoint distribution of future trajectories for a set of agents\n(see Fig.\n2).\nMotionDiffuser leverages a conditional\ndenoising diffusion model.\nDenoising diffusion models\n[16, 23, 33, 43, 44] (henceforth, diffusion models) are a\nclass of generative models that learns a denoising function\nbased on noisy data and samples from a learned data distri-\nbution via iteratively refining a noisy sample starting from\npure Gaussian noise (see Fig. 1). Diffusion models have\nrecently gained immense popularity due to their simplicity,\nstrong capacity to represent complex, high dimensional and\nmultimodal distributions, ability to solve inverse problems\n[4, 6, 24, 44], and effectiveness across multiple problem do-\nmains, including image generation [36, 37, 39], video gen-\neration [15, 18, 49] and 3D shape generation [35].\nBuilding on top of conditional diffusion models as a\nbasis for trajectory generation, we propose several unique\ndesign improvements for the multi-agent motion predic-\ntion problem.\nFirst, we propose a cross-attention-based\npermutation-invariant denoiser architecture for learning the\nmotion distribution for a set of agents regardless of their\nordering. Second, we propose a general and flexible frame-\nwork for performing controlled and guided trajectory sam-\npling based on arbitrary differentiable cost functions of the\ntrajectories, which enables several interesting applications\nsuch as rules and controls on the trajectories, trajectory\nin-painting and creating tailored simulation scenarios. Fi-\nnally, we propose several enhancements to the representa-\ntion, including PCA-based latent trajectory diffusion and\nimproved trajectory sample clustering to further boost the\nperformance of our model.\nIn summary, the main contributions of this work are:\n\u2022 A novel permutation-invariant, multi-agent joint mo-\ntion distribution representation using conditional dif-\nfusion models.\n\u2022 A general and flexible framework for performing con-\ntrolled and guided trajectory sampling based on ar-\nbitrary differentiable cost functions of the trajectories\nwith a range of novel applications.\n\u2022 Several significant enhancements to the representation,\nincluding PCA-based latent trajectory diffusion formu-\nlation and improved trajectory sample clustering algo-\nrithm to further boost the model performance.\n2. Related Work\nDenoising diffusion models\nDenoising diffusion models\n[16, 33], methodologically highly related to the class of\nscore-based generative models [23, 43, 44], have recently\nemerged as a powerful class of generative models that\ndemonstrate high sample quality across a wide range of ap-\nplication domains, including image generation [36, 37, 39],\nvideo generation [15, 18, 49] and 3D shape generation [35].\nWe are among the first to use diffusion models for predict-\ning the joint motion of agents.\nConstrained sampling\nDiffusion models have been\nshown to be effective at solving inverse problems such as\nimage in-painting, colorization and sparse-view computed\ntomography by using a controllable sampling process [4\u2013\n6, 22, 24, 43, 44]. Concurrent work [53] explores diffusion\nmodeling for controllable traffic generation, which we com-\npare to in Sec. 3.4. In diffusion models, the generation pro-\ncess can be conditioned on information not available during\ntraining. The inverse problem can be posed as sampling\nfrom the posterior p(x; y) based on a learned unconditional\ndistribution p(x), where y is an observation of the event x.\nWe defer further technical details to Sec. 3.4.\nMotion prediction\nThere are two main categories of ap-\nproaches for motion prediction: supervised learning and\ngenerative learning.\nSupervised learning trains a model\nwith logged trajectories with supervised losses such as L2\nloss.\nOne of the challenges is to model inherent multi-\nmodal behavior of the agents.\nFor this, MultiPath [40]\nuses static anchors, and MultiPath++ [48], Wayformer [31],\nSceneTransformer [32] use learned anchors, and DenseTNT\n[13] uses goal-based predictions. Home [9] and GoHome\n[10] predict future occupancy heatmaps, and then decode\ntrajectories from the samples.\nMP3 [2] and NMP [50]\nlearn the cost function evaluator of trajectories, and then\nthe output trajectories are heuristically enumerated. Many\nof these approaches use ensembles for further diversified\npredictions. The next section covers generative approaches.\nGenerative models for motion prediction\nVarious re-\ncent works have modeled the motion prediction task as\na conditional probability inference problem of the form\np(s; c) using generative models, where s denote the fu-\nture trajectories of one or more agents, and c denote the\ncontext or observation. HP-GAN [1] learns a probability\ndensity function (PDF) of future human poses conditioned\non previous poses using an improved Wasserstein Gener-\native Adversarial Network (GAN). Conditional Variational\nAuto-Encoders (C-VAEs) [11, 20, 34], Normalizing Flows\n[8, 28, 29, 41] have also been shown to be effective at learn-\ning this conditional PDF of future trajectories for motion\nprediction.\nVery recent works have started looking into\ndiffusion models as an alternative to modeling the condi-\ntional distributions of future sequences such as human mo-\ntion pose sequences [38, 52] and planning [21]. In a more\nrelevant work, [14] the authors utilize diffusion models to\nmodel the uncertainties of pedestrian motion.\nAs far as\nwe are aware, we are the first to utilize diffusion models\nto model the multi-agent joint motion distribution.\nMulti-agent motion prediction\nWhile much of the mo-\ntion prediction literature has worked on predicting motions\nof individual agents independently, there has been some\nwork to model the motion of multiple agents jointly. Scene-\nTransformer [32] outputs a fixed set of joint motion predic-\ntions for all the agents in the scene. M2I [45], WIMP [25],\nPIP [42], and CBP [47] propose a conditional model where\nthe motions of the other agents are predicted by given mo-\ntions of the controlled agents.\nThere is a set of literature using probabilistic graphical\nmodels. DSDNet [51] and MFP [46] use fully connected\ngraphs. JFP [27] supports static graphs such as fully con-\nnected graphs and autonomous vehicle centered graphs, and\ndynamic graphs where the edges are constructed between\nthe interacting agents. RAIN [26] learns the dynamic graph\nof the interaction through separate RL training.\n3. Method\n3.1. Diffusion Model Preliminaries\nPreliminaries\nDiffusion models [23] provide a learned\nparameterization of the probability distribution p\u03b8(x)\nthrough learnable parameters \u03b8.\nDenote this probability\ndensity function, convolved with a Gaussian kernel of stan-\ndard deviation \u03c3 to be p\u03b8(x, \u03c3). Instead of directly learn-\ning a normalized probability density function p\u03b8(x) where\nthe normalization constant is generally intractable [19], dif-\nfusion models learn the score function of the distribution:\n\u2207x log p\u03b8(x; \u03c3) at a range of noise levels \u03c3.\nGiven the score function \u2207x log p\u03b8(x; \u03c3), one can sam-\nple from the distribution by denoising a noise sample. Sam-\nples can be drawn from the underlying distribution x0 \u223c\np\u03b8(x) via the following dynamics:\nx0 = x(T) +\nZ 0\nT\n\u2212 \u02d9\u03c3(t)\u03c3(t)\u2207x log p\u03b8(x(t); \u03c3(t))dt\nwhere\nx(T) \u223c N(0, \u03c32\nmaxI) (1)\nwhere variance \u03c3(t) is a monotonic, deterministic function\nof an auxiliary parameter of time t. Following [23], we use\nthe linear noise schedule \u03c3(t) = t. The initial noise sample\nis sampled i.i.d. from a unit Gaussian scaled to the highest\nstandard deviation \u03c3(T) = \u03c3max.\nThe diffusion model can be trained to approximate a data\ndistribution p\u03c7(x), where \u03c7 = {x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xNd} denote\nthe set of training data. The empirical distribution of the\ndata can be viewed as a sum of delta functions around each\ndata point: p\u03c7(x) =\n1\nn\nPNd\ni=0 \u03b4(x \u2212 xi). Denote the de-\nnoiser as D(x; \u03c3) which is a function that recovers the un-\nnoised sample corresponding to the noised sample x. The\ndenoiser is related to the score function via:\n\u2207x log p(x; \u03c3) = (D(x; \u03c3) \u2212 x)/\u03c32\n(2)\nThe denoiser can be learned by minimizing the expected L2\ndenoising error for a perturbed sample x at any noise level\n\u03c3 sampled from the noise distribution q(\u03c3):\narg min\n\u03b8\nEx\u223cp\u03c7E\u03c3\u223cq(\u03c3)E\u03f5\u223cN (0,\u03c32I)||D\u03b8(x + \u03f5; \u03c3) \u2212 x||2\n2\n(3)\nFigure 3. Network architecture for set denoiser D\u03b8(S; C, \u03c3). The\nnoisy trajectories corresponding to agents s1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 sNa are first con-\ncatenated with a random-fourier encoded noise level \u03c3, before go-\ning through repeated blocks of self-attention among the set of tra-\njectories and cross-attention with respect to the condition tokens\nc1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 cNc. The self-attention allows the diffusion model to learn\na joint distribution across the agents and cross-attention allows\nthe model to learn a more accurate scene-conditional distribution.\nNote that each agent cross-attends to its own condition tokens from\nthe agent-centric scene encoding (not shown for simplicity). The\n[learnable components] are marked with brackets.\nConditional diffusion models\nIn this work, we are in-\nterested in the conditional setting of learning p\u03b8(x; c),\nwhere x denote the future trajectories of a set of\nagents and c is the scene context.\nA simple modifi-\ncation is to augment both the denoiser D(x; c, \u03c3) and\nthe score function \u2207x log p(x; c, \u03c3) by the condition c.\nGiven a dataset \u03c7c augmented by conditions:\n\u03c7c\n=\n{(x1, c1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (xNd, cN)}, the conditional denoiser can be\nlearned by a conditional denoising score matching objective\nto minimize the following:\nEx,c\u223c\u03c7cE\u03c3\u223cq(\u03c3)E\u03f5\u223cN (0,\u03c32I)||D\u03b8(x + \u03f5; c, \u03c3) \u2212 x||2\n2\n(4)\nwhich leads to the learned conditional score function:\n\u2207x log p\u03b8(x; c, \u03c3) = (D\u03b8(x; c, \u03c3) \u2212 x)/\u03c32\n(5)\nPreconditioning\nand\ntraining\nDirectly\ntraining\nthe\nmodel with the denoising score matching objective (Eqn.\n4) has various drawbacks. First, the input to the denoiser\nhas non-unit variance: Var(x + \u03f5) = Var(x) + Var(\u03f5) =\n\u03c32\ndata +\u03c32, \u03c3 \u2208 [0, \u03c3max]. Second, at small noise levels of \u03c3,\nit is much easier for the model to predict the residual noise\nthan predicting the clean signal. Following [23], we adopt a\npreconditioned form of the denoiser:\nD\u03b8(x; c, \u03c3) = cskip(\u03c3)x + cout(\u03c3)F\u03b8(cin(\u03c3)x; c, cnoise(\u03c3))\n(6)\nF\u03b8 is the neural network to train, cskip, cin, cout, cnoise respec-\ntively scale the skip connection to the noisy x, input to the\nnetwork, output from the network, and noise input \u03c3 to the\nnetwork. We do not additionally scale c since it is the output\nof an encoder network, assumed to have modulated scales.\nSampling\nWe follow the ODE dynamics in Eqn. 1 when\nsampling the predictions.\nWe utilize Huen\u2019s 2nd order\nmethod for solving the corresponding ODE using the de-\nfault parameters and 32 sampling steps.\n3.2. Diffusion Model for Multi-Agent Trajectories\nOne of the main contributions of this work is to propose\na framework for modeling the joint distribution of multi-\nagent trajectories using diffusion models. Denote the fu-\nture trajectory of agent i as si \u2208 RNt\u00d7Nf where Nt is\nthe number of future time steps and Nf is the number of\nfeatures per time steps, such as longitudinal and lateral po-\nsitions, heading directions etc. Denote ci \u2208 R\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 as the\nlearned ego-centric context encoding of the scene, includ-\ning the road graph, traffic lights, histories of modeled and\ncontext agents, as well as interactions within these scene el-\nements, centered around agent i. For generality c could be\nof arbitrary dimensions, either as a single condition vector,\nor as a set of context tokens. Denote the set of agent futures\ntrajectories as S \u2208 RNa\u00d7Nt\u00d7Nf , the set of ego-centric con-\ntext encodings as C \u2208 RNa\u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, where |S| = |C| = Na\nis the number of modeled agents. We append each agent\u2019s\nposition and heading (relative to the ego vehicle) to its cor-\nresponding context vectors.Denote the j-th permutation of\nagents in the two sets to be Sj, Cj, sharing consistent or-\ndering of the agents. We seek to model the set probabil-\nity distribution of agent trajectories using diffusion models:\np(Sj; Cj). Since the agent ordering in the scene is arbitrary,\nlearning a permutation invariant set probability distribution\nis essential, i.e.,\np(S; C) = p(Sj; Cj), \u2200j \u2208 [1, Na!]\n(7)\nTo learn a permutation-invariant set probability distribu-\ntion, we seek to learn a permutation-equivariant denoiser,\ni.e., when the order of the agents in the denoiser permutes,\nthe denoiser output follows the same permutation:\nD(Sj; Cj, \u03c3) = Dj(S; C, \u03c3), \u2200j \u2208 [1, Na!]\n(8)\nAnother major consideration for the denoiser architecture is\nthe ability to effectively attend to the condition tensor c and\nnoise level \u03c3. Both of these motivations prompt us to uti-\nlize the transformer as the main denoiser architecture. We\nutilize the scene encoder architecture from the state-of-the-\nart Wayformer [31] model to encode scene elements such\nas road graph, agent histories and traffic light states into\na set of latent embeddings. The denoiser takes as input the\nGT trajectory corresponding to each agent, perturbed with a\nrandom noise level \u03c3 \u223c q(\u03c3), and the noise level \u03c3. During\nthe denoising process, the noisy input undergoes repeated\nblocks of self-attention between the agents and cross at-\ntention to the set of context tokens per agent, and finally\nthe results are projected to the same feature dimensionality\nas the inputs. Since we do not apply positional encoding\nalong the agent dimension, transformers naturally preserve\nFigure 4. Inferred exact log probability of 64 sampled trajectories\nper agent. Higher probability samples are plotted with lighter col-\nors. The orange agent represents the AV (autonomous vehicle).\nthe equivariance among the tokens (agents), leading to the\npermutation-equivarnance of the denoiser model. See Fig.\n3 for a more detailed design of the transformer-based de-\nnoiser architecture.\n3.3. Exact Log Probability Inference\nWith our model, we can infer the exact log probability of\nthe generated samples with the following method. First, the\nchange of log density over time follows a second differen-\ntial equation, called the instantaneous change of variables\nformula [3],\nlog p(x(t))\n\u2202t\n= \u2212Tr\n\u0012 \u2202f\n\u2202x(t)\n\u0013\nwheref = \u2202x/\u2202t\n(9)\nIn the diffusion model, the flow function, f follows,\nf(x(t), t) = \u2202x(t)\n\u2202t\n= \u2212 \u02d9\u03c3(t)\u03c3(t)\u2207x log p(x(t); \u03c3(t))\n(10)\nThe log probability of the sample can be calculated by\nintegrating over time as below.\nlog p(x(0)) = log p(x(T)) \u2212\nZ 0\nT\nTr\n\u0012 \u2202f\n\u2202x(t)\n\u0013\ndt\n(11)\nThe computation of the trace of the Jacobian takes O(n2)\nwhere n is the dimensionality of x. When we use PCA as\nin Sec. 3.5, n will be much smaller than the dimensionality\nof the original data. We can also use Hutchinson\u2019s trace\nestimator as in FFJORD [12] which takes O(n).\nThe log probability can be used for filtering higher prob-\nability predictions. In Fig. 4, for example, higher probabil-\nity samples plotted with lighter colors are more likely.\n3.4. Constraining Trajectory Samples\nConstrained trajectory sampling has a range of applica-\ntions. One situation where controllability of the sampled\ntrajectories would be required is to inject physical rules and\nconstraints. For example, agent trajectories should avoid\ncollision with static objects and other road users. Another\napplication is to perform trajectory in-painting: to solve\nthe inverse problem of completing the trajectory prediction\ngiven one or more control points. This is a useful tool in cre-\nating custom traffic scenarios for autonomous vehicle devel-\nopment and simulation.\nMore formally, we seek the solution to sampling from\nthe joint conditional distribution p(S; C) \u00b7 q(S; C), where\np(S; C) is the learned future distribution for trajectories\nand q(S; C) a secondary distribution representing the con-\nstraint manifold for S.\nThe score of this joint distribu-\ntion is \u2207S log\n\u0010\np(S; C) \u00b7 q(S; C)\n\u0011\n= \u2207S log p(S; C) +\n\u2207S log q(S; C). In order to sample this joint distribution,\nwe need the joint score function at all noise levels \u03c3:\n\u2207S log p(S; C, \u03c3) + \u2207S log q(S; C, \u03c3)\n(12)\nThe first term directly corresponds to the conditional score\nfunction in Eqn.\n5.\nThe second term accounts for gra-\ndient guidance based on the constraint, which resembles\nclassifier-based guidance [17] in class-conditional image\ngeneration tasks, where a specialty neural network is trained\nto estimate this guidance term under a range of noise lev-\nels. We refer to this as the constraint gradient score. How-\never, since our goal is to approximate the constraint gradi-\nent score with an arbitrary differentiable cost function of the\ntrajectory, how is this a function of the noise parameter \u03c3?\nThe key insight is to exploit the duality between any in-\ntermediate noisy trajectory S and the denoised trajectory at\nthat noise level D(S; C, \u03c3). While S is clearly off the data\nmanifold and not a physical trajectory, D(S; C, \u03c3) usually\nclosely resembles a physical trajectory that is on the data\nmanifold since it is trained to regress for the ground truth\n(Eqn. 4), even at a high \u03c3 value. The denoised event and\nthe noisy event converge at the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0. In this light,\nwe approximate the constraint gradient score as:\n\u2207S log q(S; C, \u03c3) \u2248 \u03bb \u2202\n\u2202S L\n\u0010\nD(S; C, \u03c3)\n\u0011\n(13)\nwhere L : RNa\u00d7Nt\u00d7Nf 7\u2192 R is an arbitrary cost function\nfor the set of sampled trajectories, and \u03bb is a hyperparameter\ncontrolling the weight of this constraint.\nIn this work, we introduce two simple cost functions for\ntrajectory controls: an attractor and a repeller. Attractors\nencourage the predicted trajectory at certain timesteps to\narrive at certain locations. Repellers discourage interacting\nagents from getting too close to each other and mitigates\ncollisions. We define the costs as:\nAttractor cost\nLattract(D(S; C, \u03c3)) =\nP |(D(S; C, \u03c3) \u2212 Starget) \u2299 Mtarget|\nP |Mtarget| + eps\n(14)\nWhere Starget \u2208 RNa\u00d7Nt\u00d7Nf are the target location ten-\nsor, and Mtarget is a binary mask tensor indicating which\nlocations in Starget to enforce. \u2299 denotes the elementwise\nproduct and eps denotes an infinitesimal value to prevent\nunderflow.\nRepeller cost\nA = max\n\u0010\u00001 \u2212 1\nr \u2206(D(S; C, \u03c3))\n\u0001\n\u2299 (1 \u2212 I), 0\n\u0011\n(15)\nLrepell(D(S)) =\nP A\nP(A > 0) + eps\n(16)\nWhere A is the per time step repeller cost.\nwe denote\nthe pairwise L2 distance function between all pairs of\ndenoised agents at all time steps as \u2206(D(S; C, \u03c3)) \u2208\nRNa\u00d7Na\u00d7Nt, identity tensor broadcast to all Nt time steps\nI \u2208 RNa\u00d7Na\u00d7Nt, and repeller radius as r.\nConstraint score thresholding\nTo further increase the\nstability of the constrained sampling process, we propose a\nsimple and effective strategy: constraint score thresholding\n(ST). From Eqn. 2, we make the observation that:\n\u03c3\u2207x log p(x; \u03c3) = (D(x, \u03c3) \u2212 x)/\u03c3 = \u03f5, \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I)\n(17)\nTherefore, we adjust the constraint score in Eqn. 13 via an\nelementwise clipping function:\n\u2207S log q(S; C, \u03c3) := clip(\u03c3\u2207S log q(S; C, \u03c3), \u00b11)/\u03c3\n(18)\nWe ablate this design choice in Table 2.\n3.5. Trajectory Representation Enhancements\nSample clustering\nWhile MotionDiffuser learns an entire\ndistribution of possible joint future trajectories from which\nwe can draw an arbitrary number of samples, it is often nec-\nessary to extract a more limited number of representative\nmodes from the output distribution. The Interaction Pre-\ndiction challenge in Waymo Open Motion Dataset, for in-\nstance, computes metrics based on a set of 6 predicted joint\nfutures across modeled agents. Thus, we need to generate a\nrepresentative set from the larger set of sampled trajectories.\nTo this end, we follow the trajectory aggregation method\ndefined in [48] which performs iterative greedy clustering\nto maximize the probability of trajectory samples falling\nwithin a fixed distance threshold to an output cluster. We\nrefer readers to [48] for details on the clustering algorithm.\nIn the joint agent prediction setting, we modify the clus-\ntering algorithm such that for each joint prediction sample,\nwe maximize the probability that all agent predictions fall\nwithin a distance threshold to an output cluster.\nPCA latent diffusion\nInspired by the recent success of la-\ntent diffusion models [37] for image generation, we utilize\na compressed representation for trajectories using Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA). PCA is particularly suitable\nfor representing trajectories, as trajectories are temporally\nand geometrically smooth in nature, and the trajectories can\nbe represented by a very small set of components. Our anal-\nysis shows that a mere 3 components (for trajectories with\n80 \u00d7 2 degrees of freedom) accounts for 99.7% of all ex-\nplained variance, though we use 10 components for a more\naccurate reconstruction. PCA representation has multiple\nbenefits, including faster inference, better success with con-\ntrolled trajectory, and perhaps most importantly, better ac-\ncuracy and performance (see ablation studies in Sec. 5).\nFirst, as many ground truth trajectories include missing\ntime steps (due to occlusion / agent leaving the scene), we\nuse linear interpolation / extrapolation to fill in the missing\nsteps in each trajectory. We uniformly sample a large popu-\nlation of Ns = 105 agent trajectories, where each trajectory\nsi \u2208 RNtNf , i \u2208 [1, Ns] is first centered around the agent\u2019s\ncurrent location, rotated such that the agent\u2019s heading is in\n+y direction, and flattened into a single vector. Denote this\nrandom subset of agent trajectories as S\u2032 \u2208 RNs\u00d7NtNf .\nWe compute its corresponding principle component matrix\n(with whitening) as Wpca \u2208 RNp\u00d7(NtNf ) where Np is the\nnumber of principle components to use, and its mean as\n\u00afs\u2032 \u2208 RNtNf . We obtain the PCA and inverse PCA trans-\nformation for each trajectory Si as:\n\u02c6si = (si \u2212 \u00afs)W T\npca \u21d4 si = \u02c6si(W T\npca)\u22121 + \u00afs\n(19)\nWith the new representation, we have agent trajectories in\nEqn. 7 in PCA space as S \u2208 RNa\u00d7Np.\n4. Experiment and Results\n4.1. PCA Mode Analysis\nTo motivate our use of PCA as a simple and accurate\ncompressed trajectory representation, we analyze the prin-\ncipal components computed from Ns = 105 randomly\nselected trajectories from the Waymo Open Dataset train-\ning split. Fig. 5a shows the average reconstruction error\nper waypoint using increasing numbers of principal com-\nponents. When keeping only the first 10 principal com-\nponents, the average reconstruction error is 0.06 meters,\nwhich is significantly lower than the average prediction er-\nror achieved by state-of-the-art methods. This motivates\nPCA as an effective compression strategy, without the need\nfor more complex strategies like autoencoders in [37].\nWe visualize the top-10 principal components in Fig.\n5b. The higher order principal components are increasingly\nsimilar, and deviate only slightly from the dataset mean.\nThese components represent high frequency trajectory in-\nformation that are irrelevant for modeling, and may also be\na result of perception noise.\n0.25\nNumber of PCA Components\nPCA Reconstruction Error (m)\n0.30\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n(a) PCA trajectory reconstruction\nerror vs number of PCA compo-\nnents.\n#1\n#2\n#3\n#4\n#5,7,8\n#6\n(b) Visualization of the top-10 PCA\ncomponents for trajectories.\nFigure 5.

Multi-Agent Motion Prediction\nTo evaluate MotionDiffuser\u2019s performance in the multi-\nagent prediction setting, we assess our method on the\nWaymo Open Dataset Interactive split, which contains pairs\nof agents in highly interactive and diverse scenarios [7].\nIn Table 1, we report the main metrics for the Interactive\nsplit, as defined in [7]. minSADE measures the displace-\nment between the ground-truth future agent trajectories and\nthe closest joint prediction (out of 6 joint predictions), av-\neraged over the future time horizon and over the pair of in-\nteracting agents. minSFDE measures the minimum joint\ndisplacement error at the time horizon endpoint. SMissRate\nmeasures the recall of the joint predictions, with distance\nthresholds defined as a function of agent speed and future\ntimestep. Finally mAP measures the joint Mean Average\nPrecision based on agent action types, such as left-turn and\nu-turn. The reported metrics are averaged over future time\nhorizons (3s, 5s, and 8s) and over agent types (vehicles,\npedestrians, and cyclists) .\nAdditionally, we report results for the Overlap metric\n[27] by measuring the overlap rate on the most likely joint\nprediction, which captures the consistency of model predic-\ntions, as consistent joint predictions should not collide.\nOur model achieves state-of-the-art results, as shown in\nTable 1. While MotionDiffuser and Wayformer [31] use\nthe same backbone, our method performs significantly bet-\nter across all metrics due to the strength of the diffusion\nhead. Compared to JFP [27] on the test split, we demon-\nstrate an improvement with respect to the minSADE and\nminSFDE metrics. For mAP, and Overlap, our method per-\nforms slightly worse than JFP, but outperforms all other\nmethods.\nMethod\nOverlap\nminSADE\nminSFDE\nsMissRate\nmAP\n(\u2193)\n(\u2193)\n(\u2193)\n(\u2193)\n(\u2191)\nTest\nLSTM baseline [7]\n-\n1.91\n5.03\n0.78\n0.05\nHeatIRm4 [30]\n-\n1.42\n3.26\n0.72\n0.08\nSceneTransformer(J) [32]\n-\n0.98\n2.19\n0.49\n0.12\nM2I [45]\n-\n1.35\n2.83\n0.55\n0.12\nDenseTNT [13]\n-\n1.14\n2.49\n0.54\n0.16\nMultiPath++[48]\n-\n1.00\n2.33\n0.54\n0.17\nJFP [27]\n-\n0.88\n1.99\n0.42\n0.21\nMotionDiffuser (Ours)\n-\n0.86\n1.95\n0.43\n0.20\nVal\nSceneTransformer(M) [32]\n0.091\n1.12\n2.60\n0.54\n0.09\nSceneTransformer(J) [32]\n0.046\n0.97\n2.17\n0.49\n0.12\nMultiPath++ [48]\n0.064\n1.00\n2.33\n0.54\n0.18\nJFP [27]\n0.030\n0.87\n1.96\n0.42\n0.20\nWayformer [31]\n0.061\n0.99\n2.30\n0.47\n0.16\nMotionDiffuser (Ours)\n0.036\n0.86\n1.92\n0.42\n0.19\nTable 1.

The mean metrics\ncomputes the mean quantity over the 64 predictions.\nFor the attractor experiment, we constrain the last point\nof all predicted trajectories to be close to the last point in\nthe ground truth data.

Note that MotionDiffuser\u2019s perfor-\nmance in Table 3 is slightly worse than Table 1 due to a\nreduced Wayformer encoder backbone size.\n6. Conclusion and Discussions\nIn this work, we introduced MotionDiffuser, a novel dif-\nfusion model based multi-agent motion prediction frame-\nwork that allows us to learn a diverse, multimodal joint fu-\nture distribution for multiple agents. We propose a novel\ntransformer-based set denoiser architecture that is permu-\ntation invariant across agents. Furthermore we propose a\ngeneral and flexible constrained sampling framework, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of two simple and useful con-\nstraints - attractor and repeller. We demonstrate state-of-\nthe-art multi-agent motion prediction results, and the effec-\ntiveness of our approach on Waymo Open Motion Dataset.\nFuture work includes applying the diffusion-based gen-\nerative modeling technique to other topics of interest in au-\ntonomous vehicles, such as planning and scene generation.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Wenjie Luo for helping\nwith the overlap metrics code, Ari Seff for helping with\nmulti-agent NMS, Rami Al-RFou, Charles Qi and Carlton\nDowney for helpful discussions, Joao Messias for reviewing\nthe manuscript, and anonymous reviewers.\nReferences\n[1] Emad Barsoum, John Kender, and Zicheng Liu.\nHp-gan:\nProbabilistic 3d human motion prediction via gan.

Implementation Details\nMotionDiffuser is trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset using 32 TPU shards for 2 \u2217 106 training steps. We use the\nADAMW optimizer [? ] with weight decay coefficient of 0.03. The learning rate is set to 5 \u2217 10\u22124, with 104 warmup steps\nand linear learning rate decay. MotionDiffuser uses the Wayformer [? ] encoder backbone, with 128 latent embeddings,\neach with hidden size of 256. Because the Wayformer encoder is agent centric, we append each agent\u2019s position and heading\n(relative to the ego vehicle) to its corresponding context vectors.\nOur transformer denoiser architecture uses 4 layers of self-attention and cross-attention blocks. Each attention layer has a\nhidden size of 256 and an intermediate size of 1024. ReLU activation is used in all transformer layers. We embed the noise\nlevel using 128 random fourier features.\nWe can flexibly denoise N random noise vectors during training and inference. We use N = 128 during training and\nN = 256 during inference (before applying clustering).\n3. Network Preconditioning\nWe follow the network preconditioning framework from [? ], which defines the denoiser D\u03b8 as:\nD\u03b8(x; c, \u03c3) = cskip(\u03c3)x + cout(\u03c3)F\u03b8(cin(\u03c3)x; c, cnoise(\u03c3))\n(1)\ncin(\u03c3) scales the network input, such that the training inputs to F\u03b8 have unit variance.\ncin(\u03c3) = 1/\nq\n\u03c32 + \u03c32\ndata\n(2)\ncskip(\u03c3) modulates the skip connection and is defined as:\ncskip(\u03c3) = \u03c32\ndata/(\u03c32 + \u03c32\ndata)\n(3)\ncout(\u03c3) modulates the network output and is defined as:\ncout(\u03c3) = \u03c3 \u00b7 \u03c3data/\nq\n\u03c32 + \u03c32\ndata\n(4)\nFinally cnoise(\u03c3) scales the noise level, and is defined as:\ncnoise(\u03c3) = 1\n4 ln \u03c3\n(5)\nFor all our experiments, we set \u03c3data = 0.5.\n4.

In this work, we probe\nChatGPT for its conversational understanding\nand introduce a conversational framework (pro-\ntocol) that can be adopted in future studies. The\nPok\u00e9mon universe serves as an ideal testing\nground for auditing ChatGPT\u2019s reasoning capa-\nbilities due to its closed world assumption. Af-\nter bringing ChatGPT\u2019s background knowledge\n(on the Pok\u00e9mon universe) to light, we test its\nreasoning process when using these concepts\nin battle scenarios. We then evaluate its ability\nto acquire new knowledge and include it in its\nreasoning process. Our ultimate goal is to as-\nsess ChatGPT\u2019s ability to generalize, combine\nfeatures, and to acquire and reason over newly\nintroduced knowledge from human feedback.\nWe find that ChatGPT has prior knowledge of\nthe Pokemon universe, which can reason upon\nin battle scenarios to a great extent, even when\nnew information is introduced. The model per-\nforms better with collaborative feedback and\nif there is an initial phase of information re-\ntrieval, but also hallucinates occasionally and\nis susceptible to adversarial attacks.\n1\nIntroduction\nChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022),1 recently released by\nOpenAI,2 is a conversational agent based on\nan instruction-fine-tuned (Chung et al., 2022)\ntransformer-based language model, a successor of\nInstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), which has been\nalso further optimized for user alignment (Leike\net al., 2018) with reinforcement learning from hu-\nman feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017;\nStiennon et al., 2020).\nChatGPT demonstrates\nunprecedented capabilities in zero-shot question-\nanswering in common sense knowledge, but also\nin specialized domains, such as law (Bommarito\net al., 2023), and medicine (Kung et al., 2023).\n1https://chat.openai.com/chat, Dec 15 Version\n2https://openai.com/\nATT / DEF\nGrass\nFire\nWater\nElectric\nGrass\n0.5\u00d7\n0.5\u00d7\n2\u00d7\n1\u00d7\nFire\n2\u00d7\n0.5\u00d7\n0.5\u00d7\n1\u00d7\nWater\n0.5\u00d7\n2\u00d7\n0.5\u00d7\n1\u00d7\nElectric\n0.5\u00d7\n1\u00d7\n2\u00d7\n0.5\u00d7\nTable 1: Type Match-up Chart: Applied modifiers (N\u00d7)\nto type-specific moves when Pok\u00e9mon of type (ATT)\nattacks Pokemon of type (DEF).\nDespite the impressive results, there is no proto-\ncol (framework) on how ChatGPT, or alike systems,\nshould be audited by practitioners to better under-\nstand its capabilities and limitations. In most cases\nthe dialogs are open-ended (uncontrolled) and the\nevaluation is not straightforward. To this end, we\nintroduce a 3-step conversational framework (Fig-\nure 1) starting with a retrieval augmentation phase,\nwhere the model (dialog agent) is the only source\nof knowledge. We follow 3 settings of human-in-\nthe-loop interaction: neutral\n, cooperative\n,\nand adversarial\n.\nIn this work, we rely on the Pok\u00e9mon3 universe\nto evaluate the agent\u2019s capabilities in terms of ac-\nquired background of the universe, generalization,\ncompositionality of features, and its ability to rea-\nson upon newly introduced knowledge from human\nfeedback (compositional generalization). Pok\u00e9mon\nare imaginary creatures that have formal specifica-\ntions (type, level, moves/attacks) and are trained to\nbattle. Table 1 presents the four types used in this\nwork, and show the attack effectiveness in battle\nmatch-ups.4 The Pok\u00e9mon universe and its battle\nsystem is a well-defined environment and follow\na closed world assumption (Reiter, 1978), i.e., the\nknowledge base can be considered complete and\ndefinite answers can be derived even if not, which\nmake it a perfect setting for auditing the agent\u2019s\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities.\n3https://www.pokemon.com/\n4In Appendix A, we provide a brief introduction to the\nPokemon universe fundamentals considered in this work.\narXiv:2306.03024v1  [cs.CL]  5 Jun 2023\nAudit Knowledge\nUse of Knowledge\nin context\nIntroduction of\nnew Knowledge\n\u00a0\ud83e\udd17  Let me help you.\n\u00a0\ud83e\udd14  I don't know, tell\u00a0\n\u00a0me something else.\n\u00a0\ud83d\ude08  You're wrong,\u00a0A is B.\nInteractions\nCombine prior/new knowledge\nCreate realistic scenarios\nNew content\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 1: Depiction of the proposed Conversational Framework. Across all stages information is stored in the\nconversational local memory (orange), while the model retrieves prior knowledge from its global memory (blue).\nWe interact with ChatGPT through a series of\nQ&A dialogues, and validate its responses manu-\nally based on the Pok\u00e9mon wiki.5\nWhat is the goal of this study? Our goal is to use\nthe Pok\u00e9mon universe to probe ChatGPT\u2019s conver-\nsational understanding. We audit ChatGPT for its\nknowledge on this universe, its understanding of\nfundamental concepts (species, types, leveling, con-\nditions), the ability to apply and reason upon these\nconcepts in battle scenarios, and its skills to acquire\nnew knowledge (description of new species) and\nreason in battles with such creatures.\nContributions We introduce a conversational\nframework to define the conversation staging and\nhuman feedback settings, that can be adopted by\nothers in different environments to further assess\nAI conversational agents, such as ChatGPT. We\npresent an analysis based on Pok\u00e9mon universe re-\nlying on the proposed framework. While the use of\nPok\u00e9mon has a recreational character and interests\na niche community of the series fans, we believe\nthat our experiments offer a better understanding\nof ChatGPT as an AI conversational agent. Such\ncontrolled experiments (dialogues) inform us to an\nextend on the system\u2019s capabilities and limitations.\n2\nExperiments & Discussion\nWe introduce a staged conversational framework\n(Figure 1) with three distinct stages:\nA. Audit Knowledge. We audit the agent\u2019s knowl-\nedge on the topic, asking general questions such as\ndescriptions of Pokemon types and species. The\nknowledge retrieved is stored in a local memory\nthat serves as the dialog context. The local memory\nis limited to our precedent interactions in the cur-\nrent conversation up to \u22484,000 words (Raf, 2022).\nThis phase is critical to understand what is the\n5https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/\nprior knowledge of the model in order to build\nreasonable scenarios in the next steps, while also\nretrieving information improves follow-up model\nresponses (Shuster et al., 2021; He et al., 2023),\ni.e., the model is more accurate and hallucinates\nless often. The prior knowledge of the model is\nacquired during training, so it can be understood\nas retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2020) from\na global memory which represents the agent itself,\ncontrary to the use of external knowledge bases.\nB. Use of knowledge in context. We present spe-\ncific battle scenarios where the Pokemon types,\nlevels, moves, and conditions interplay and lead\nto a certain outcome. We ask the agent to predict\nthe outcome of the battle, and explain its reasoning\n(chain-of-thought) (Wei et al., 2022) step-by-step.\nThis phase will help us understand if the model\ncan combine features (compositionality) based on\na specific scenario (context) that determines the\nbattle outcome following causal reasoning.\nC. Introduction of new knowledge. We introduce\nunknown Pokemon species with formal specifica-\ntions (name, appearance, type, moves). Then, we\nask the agent to validate the acquisition of these\nnew concepts and to compare it to its prior knowl-\nedge. It is important to note that the agent stores\nthe newly introduced knowledge in its local mem-\nory, but it will not be able to reference it for long.\nWe then use the newly introduced knowledge in\ncontext, similar to Step B; the model has to per-\nform some form of in-context learning and com-\nbine prior and newly introduced knowledge.\nWe present both quantitative and qualitative re-\nsults where ChatGPT\u2019s answers are color-coded in\ngreen if factual (accurate) knowledge is provided,\nred if false statements (hallucinations) are provided,\nand yellow if a statement is vague or irrelevant.\n2.1\nAudit Knowledge\nWe start with some preliminary general questions to\ntest fundamental aspects of the Pokemon universe.\nThis initial phase is critical for creating an effective\ncommunication later on. We distinguish between\nglobal memory and local memory. The former is\nacquired during training and include ChatGPT\u2019s\nprior knowledge. The local memory is limited to\nour precedent interactions (Raf, 2022) and serves\nas a reference point for posterior interactions. In\nabsence of this auditing phase, the dialog can be\nvague and even factually inaccurate (see Q2.3).\nQ1.1 (\n): \u201cList all Pokemon types.\u201d\nResponse:\u201cThere are 18 Pokemon types: Nor-\nmal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug,\nGhost, Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic,\nIce, Dragon, Dark, and Fairy. [...]\u201d\nQ1.2 (\n): \u201cDescribe water type and list a few\nwater Pokemon species that you know of.\u201d\nResponse:\n\u201cWater-type\nPokemon\nare\nstrong\nagainst Fire, Rock, and Ground-type Pokemon, but\nweak against Electric and Grass-type Pokemon.\nThey are generally associated with the element of\nwater[...] Some examples of Water-type Pokemon\ninclude Squirtle, Blastoise, and Psyduck. [...]\u201d\nIn Appendix B, we pose similar introductory\nqueries for 3 other Pokemon types or weather con-\nditions. All responses are factually accurate based\non the Pokemon wiki. ChatGPT knows Pokemon\ntypes and type match-ups when such Pokemon in-\nteract in battles (Table 1). It also knows several\ntypes species. We proceed to adversarial attacks,\nquestioning model\u2019s perception of the universe.\nQ1.3 (\n): \u201cNo, that\u2019s not accurate. There is one\nmore type named Rubber.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is no type named\n\"Rubber\" in the Pokemon series. There are 18 types\nin total, as I previously mentioned. [...]\u201d\nQ1.4 (\n): \u201cYou are not right. Water-type is weak\nagainst Fire-type.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cI apologize for the error [...] You are\ncorrect that Water-type Pokemon are weak against\nFire-type Pokemon. Thank you for bringing that to\nmy attention. [...]\u201d\nThe latter adversarial attack (Q1.3) succeed in\ntype match-up -3 similar attacks succeed-, but Chat-\nGPT is robust against factual knowledge of Poke-\nmon types (Q1.4) in 5/5 times (Appendix B).\n2.2\nUse of knowledge in battle scenarios\nWe present simple, controlled battle scenarios in-\nvolving known Pokemon, presented by the agent in\nSection 2.1. We increase complexity (different lev-\nels, weather and status conditions) incrementally\nand ask the agent to predict the outcome of the\nbattle and explain its reasoning (chain-of-thought)\n(Wei et al., 2022). This stage will help us under-\nstand if the model can combine features (compo-\nsitionality) based on a specific scenario (context)\nthat determines its outcome.\nQ2.1 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle, both have equal level and stats. Charman-\nder has only Flamethrower and Squirtle has only\nWater Gun. Predict the outcome of the battle.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this situation, Squirtle would likely\ncome out victorious in the battle against Char-\nmander. This is because Water-type Pokemon are\nstrong against Fire-type Pokemon, so Squirtle\u2019s\nWater Gun attack would be super effective against\nCharmander\u2019s Flamethrower. [...]\u201d\nQ2.2 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with Squirtle.\nCharmander is level 20 and Squirtle is level 5.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squirtle\nhas only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of the\nbattle.\u201d\nResponse:\u201cIn this scenario, Charmander is likely\nto come out as the winner of the battle. This is\nbecause Charmander is significantly higher level\nthan Squirtle, and level is an important factor in de-\ntermining the outcome of a Pokemon battle. [...]\u201d\nMost responses are accurate. ChatGPT under-\nstands how Pokemon types, moves (attacks), and\nlevels affect battle match-ups (Table 1). The model\nis able to predict, but also explain its reasoning in\na thorough manner.\nWe present a series of adversarial attacks fol-\nlowing Q2.1 and Q2.2 in Appendix C. In line with\nresults from Section 2.1, we find that model\u2019s be-\nhavior is unstable and adversarial attacks succeed\n(type match-up) or not (level) in different cases.\nWe move to questions that require a higher level\nreasoning, involving weather or status conditions.\nQ2.3 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with Squirtle,\nboth have equal level and stats. Charmander has\nonly Flamethrower and Squirtle has only Water\nGun. The battle takes places under harsh sunlight.\nPredict the outcome of the battle.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cThe presence of harsh sunlight would\nnot significantly affect the outcome of the battle\nbetween Charmander and Squirtle, as this weather\ncondition does not have any direct impact [...] In\nthis scenario, Squirtle would still have the advan-\ntage due to its Water-type moves being super effec-\ntive against Charmander\u2019s Fire-type. [...]\u201d\nWe detect a factual mistake in the model\u2019s re-\nsponse and intervene cooperatively:\nQ2.3.1 (\n): \u201cThat\u2019s not accurate, harsh sunlight\npositively affects Fire-type Pokemon, while nega-\ntively affects Water-type Pokemon.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cI apologize for the mistake [...] In\nPokemon games that have a weather system, cer-\ntain weather conditions can affect the battle [...] In\nthe case of harsh sunlight, it boosts the power of\nFire-type moves and weakens the power of Water-\ntype moves. Therefore, in a battle between Char-\nmander and Squirtle where both Pokemon have\nonly Flamethrower and Water Gun respectively,\nand the battle takes place under harsh sunlight,\nCharmander would have the advantage [...]\u201d\nWhen weather conditions introduced directly in\na battle (Q2.3), the model considered them unim-\nportant, but then reconsidered its original position\nfollowing assistive feedback (Q2.3.1). We re-run\nthe very same conversation after including weather\nconditions in our introductory questions (Q1.6 and\nQ2.4.1 in Appendices B-C), and ChatGPT responds\naccurately. The model conditions each response on\nprior interactions (utterances), which highlights the\nimportance of retrieving relevant knowledge before\nits in-context application (He et al., 2023).\nQ2.6 (\n): \u201cBulbasaur of level 10 is in battle with\nVulpix of level 15. Vulpix is poisoned and sleeping\nfor the next 2 turns. Bulbasaur has only Leaf\nCutter and Vulpix has only Fire Spin. Predict the\noutcome and explain it step by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this scenario, Bulbasaur would have\na significant advantage due to Vulpix\u2019s poisoning\nand sleep status conditions. [...] Vulpix is unable to\nattack due to its sleep status condition. Bulbasaur\nuses Leaf Cutter again. At this point, Vulpix would\nwake up and be able to attack again, but it would\nalso be suffering from the effects of the poison con-\ndition, which causes it to lose health over time. \u201d\nWe test 24 additional battles in total: 6 battles in-\nvolving different types (83.3% accuracy), 6 involv-\ning different levels (100%), 7 involving 4 weather\nconditions (85.7%), and 6 involving 4 status effects\n(100%). The model recovers for its mistakes, if any,\nafter receiving collaborative feedback (Q2.6.3.1) or\nwhen the relevant information has been retrieved\nfrom the previous step (Q2.6.3.2).6\n2.3\nIntroduction of new knowledge\nWe introduce a \u201cmade-up\u201d Pokemon and ask to val-\nidate the information learnt. This step enable us to\nevaluate the model\u2019s ability to acquire knowledge\non-the-fly and whether it can draw connections\nwith prior knowledge (in-context learning). It is\nimportant to note that ChatGPT will store this new\nknowledge in local memory (active window), but it\nwill not be able to reference it for long (Raf, 2022).\nQ3.1 (\n): \u201cI would like to introduce a new Poke-\nmon. It is named BatteryPack. It\u2019s an electric type\nPokemon, which looks like a battery. BatteryPack\ncan learn and use electric type moves such as Dis-\ncharge, Thunder, Shock Wave. Can you please\ndescribe BatteryPack again.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cBatteryPack is a new Electric-type\nPokemon that resembles a battery. It is able to learn\nand use Electric-type moves such as Shock Wave.\nElectric-type Pokemon are generally associated\nwith electricity and tend to have high speed and spe-\ncial attack stats. [...] Its battery-like appearance\nmay also suggest that it has a strong connection to\ntechnology and machines, which could potentially\ninfluence its behavior and abilities. [...]\u201d\nQ4.1 (\n): \u201cWhich known Pokemon do you think\nmostly resembles BatteryPack?\u201d\nResponse: \u201cThere are several Pokemon that bear\nsome resemblance to BatteryPack, given that it is\nan Electric-type Pokemon that resembles a bat-\ntery. Some examples include: Pikachu: a small,\nmouse-like Pokemon with electric-based abilities\n[...] Jolteon: an evolved form of Pikachu that has\na more streamlined appearance [...]\u201d\nThe model draws fairly good analogies and can\nalso specialize in a great extent, although it partly\nhallucinates in Q4.1. We want to qualitatively eval-\nuate the integration of new knowledge in context.\nWe present BatteryPack in battle with Squirtle (new\nvs. known Pokemon). See Appendix D for the in-\ntroduction of a second made-up Pokemon, and its\n6We experimented with four weather conditions (Harsh\nsunlight, Extremely harsh sunlight, Heavy rain, Sandstorm)\nand four statuses (Burn, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep).\nbattle against BatteryPack (new vs. new).7\nQ5.1 (\n): \u201cBatteryPack is in battle with Squirtle,\nboth have equal level and stats. BatteryPack has\nonly Discharge and Squirtle has only Water Gun.\nPredict the outcome of the battle and explain it\nstep by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this battle, BatteryPack would have\nthe advantage due to its Electric-type moves, which\nare super effective against Squirtle\u2019s Water-type.\n[...] BatteryPack\u2019s Discharge would do more dam-\nage to Squirtle than Squirtle\u2019s [...] As a result, Bat-\nteryPack would likely defeat Squirtle [...] \u201d\nQ5.2 (\n): \u201cBatteryPack is in battle with Muddy-\nRock, both have equal level and stats. Battery-\nPack has only Discharge and MuddyRock has\nonly Mud Bomb. Predict the outcome of the battle\nand explain it step by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this battle, MuddyRock would have\nthe advantage due to its Ground-type moves, which\nare super effective against BatteryPack\u2019s Electric-\ntype. [...] Since Ground-type moves are super effec-\ntive against Electric-type Pokemon, MuddyRock\u2019s\nMud Bomb would do more damage to BatteryPack\nthan BatteryPack\u2019s Discharge would do to Muddy-\nRock. As a result, MuddyRock would likely defeat\nBatteryPack in this battle. [...]\u201d\nChatGPT is able to re-use the prior and the newly\nintroduced knowledge to predict the outcome, even\nwhen both Pokemon involved are newly-introduced\n(BatteryPack vs. MuddyRock). We show in Ap-\npendix D follow-up more challenging battles. In\nthis case (Q5.3), the model gives solid predictions,\nbut it also hallucinates over common knowledge\nthat was properly used before (Q5.1). Moreover,\nwhen we provide feedback (Q5.4) to assist the\nmodel, the model insists in a false claim, and re-\ncovered only in the last feedback (Q5.5).\n3\nConclusions\nThrough our interactions with ChatGPT following\nthe proposed framework, we conclude that: i) The\nprecision of the facts presented by the model de-\npends on what was discussed earlier: We observed\ninnacurate or vague answers to the same well de-\nfined battles in \u00a72.2 in the absence of a preliminary\ndialog about Pokemon background, as presented in\n\u00a72.1. This is an important finding since an initial\nknowledge retrieval phase does not feel natural to\n7See Appendix E for illustrations.\ndialog; ii) Adversarial attacks can be, but are not\nalways, successful, as demonstrated in \u00a72.1 and\n\u00a72.2; iii) Collaborative feedback aiming to correct\nprior model\u2019s mistakes can be, but is not always,\nsuccessful, as shown in \u00a72.2 and \u00a72.3.\nIn general, dialog pre-conditioning (knowledge\nretrieval) and collaborative feedback seem to be\nboth crucial for those who aim a more faithful and\naccurate system interaction.\nLimitations\nProbing a dialog system such as ChatGPT for con-\nversational understanding within the Pokemon uni-\nverse may not be representative of the system\u2019s\ncapabilities in other contexts, hence our conclu-\nsions cannot be generalized, unless similar studies\nare conducted. To be able to ensure ChatGPT\u2019s\nrobustness and to fully understand its limitations,\nthis study should be extended to a more diverse set\nof scenarios and benchmarks.\nOur framework aims to study ChatGPT in a very\ncontrolled setting, i.e., a small part (types, species,\nconditions, scenarios) of the Pokemon universe,\nwhich is not the case when such systems are de-\nployed in the wild, where users can perform open-\nended dialogues with much more complex ques-\ntions involving incomplete information, which are\nmost likely more sensitive to false claims and hal-\nlucinations (made-up/fictitious knowledge).\nRecently, a new GPT version was released by\nOpenAI, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), demonstrating\nimproved performance compared to ChatGPT in\nseveral benchmarks. We do not have access and do\nnot present results for this system.\nReferences\nMichael Bommarito, Daniel Martin Katz, Shang Gao,\nand Pablo Arredondo. 2023.

Orchard Books.\nA\nPokemon 101\nWhat are Pokemon?\nPokemon (Whitehill et al.,\n2016) are imaginary creatures that are caught and\ntrained by human trainers. Pokemon are able to\nfight using a specific set of moves available at battle\ntime following a turn-based setup, i.e., Pokemon A\nand B make a move (attack) one at a time. Pokemon\ncome from a finite list of species, approximately\n1.000 in total, which are enlisted in the Pok\u00e9dex\nIndex. Individual Pokemon creatures have formal\nspecifications (species, level, moves/attacks) and\nbattle on specific environments (conditions).\nPokemon Types and Match-Ups\nThey are clas-\nsified in 18 main types (grass, fire, water, electric,\nground, ghost, psychic, etc.). Types are properties\napplied to Pokemon and their moves, which affect\nthe power of moves in battles. Types and related\nmoves have different levels of effectiveness (pro-\nduced damage) in match-ups, as shown in Table 1,8\ne.g., fire has weakness to water, which means that\nwater type attacks lead to 2\u00d7 damage, while fire\nattacks targeting water type Pokemon lead to 0.5\u00d7\ndamage, etc. A Pokemon may have either one or\ntwo types (dual-type). For instance, Charmander is\na Fire type, while Bulbasaur is both a Grass type\nand a Poison type.\nWeather and Status Conditions\nOther aspects\naffecting Pokemon battles are weather conditions\n(e.g., rain boosts water-type attacks, and sun boosts\nfire-type attacks) 9, and status conditions (e.g.,\na Pokemon sleeping cannot move/attack for few\nrounds, or may be poisoned, which leads to addi-\ntional damage) 10\nAll these lead to a very controlled scenario when\nsuch creatures interact in battles, contrary to real\n8For\na\nfull\nchart,\nplease\nrefer\nto\nhttps://\nbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type/Type_chart\n9For further information about weather conditions, please\nrefer to https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/\nWeather\n10For further information about status conditions, please\nrefer to https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/\nStatus_condition\nworld or other complicated imaginary universes. In\nthis controlled scenario we can predict battle out-\ncomes with high, if not absolute, confidence, con-\ntrary to an open-world setting, where information\nis not complete and we need to make assumptions\nto predict the right outcome.\nB\nAudit Knowledge\nB.1\nList Types\nQ1.1 (\n): \u201cNo, that\u2019s not accurate. There is one\nmore type named Plastic.\u201d\nResponse:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is no type named\n\"Plastic\" in the Pokemon series. There are 18 types\nin total, as I previously mentioned. The types are:\nNormal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock,\nBug, Ghost, Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psy-\nchic, Ice, Dragon, Dark, and Fairy.\u201d\nQ1.1 (\n): \u201cNo, that\u2019s not accurate. There is one\nmore type named Sound.\u201d\nResponse:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is no type named\n\"Sound\" in the Pokemon series. There are 18 types\nin total, as I previously mentioned.

There is one\nmore type named Space.\u201d\nResponse:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is no type named\n\"Space\" in the Pokemon series. There are 18 types\nin total, as I previously mentioned. The types are:\nNormal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock,\nBug, Ghost, Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psy-\nchic, Ice, Dragon, Dark, and Fairy.\u201d\nQ1.1 (\n): \u201cNo, that\u2019s not accurate. There is one\nmore type named Time.\u201d\nResponse:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is no type named\n\"Time\" in the Pokemon series. There are 18 types in\ntotal, as I previously mentioned. The types are: Nor-\nmal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug,\nGhost, Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic,\nIce, Dragon, Dark, and Fairy.\u201d\nB.2\nDescribe Types\nQ1.2.1 (\n): \u201cDescribe grass type and list a few\ngrass Pokemon species that you know of.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cGrass-type Pokemon are generally as-\nsociated with plants and nature. They are often\ndepicted as being green and leafy, and many of\nthem are based on real-world plants or plant-like\nanimals. Some examples of Grass-type Pokemon in-\nclude: Bulbasaur: a small, reptilian Pokemon with\na large bulb on its back. [...] Chikorita: a small,\ngreen Pokemon with a leafy head that it uses to\nphotosynthesize sunlight. [...] These are just a few\nexamples of the many Grass-type Pokemon that\nexist in the Pokemon world.\u201d\nQ1.2.2 (\n): \u201cDescribe fire type and list a few fire\nPokemon species that you know of.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cFire-type Pokemon are generally as-\nsociated with heat and flames. Many of them are\nbased on real-world animals or mythical creatures\nthat are associated with fire, such as dragons and\nphoenixes. Some examples of Fire-type Pokemon\ninclude: Charmander: a small, reptilian Pokemon\nwith a flame burning on the tip of its tail. [...]\nVulpix: a small, fox-like Pokemon with a red, fluffy\ntail that it can use to generate flames. [...] These\nare just a few examples of the many Fire-type Poke-\nmon that exist in the Pokemon world.\u201d\nQ1.2.3 (\n): \u201cDescribe electric type and list a\nfew electric Pokemon species that you know of.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cElectric-type Pokemon are character-\nized by their ability to generate and manipulate\nelectricity. They often have abilities and moves that\ninvolve electrical shocks or charges, and they can\nbe particularly effective against Water-type Poke-\nmon. Some examples of Electric-type Pokemon in-\nclude: 1. Pikachu: A small, mouse-like Pokemon\nwith yellow fur and a red spot on its cheek. It has\na high-pitched voice and is known for its powerful\nelectrical attacks. 2. Raichu: The evolved form of\nPikachu, Raichu is larger and has longer ears. It is\nmore powerful than Pikachu, but also more prone\nto losing control of its electricity. 2. Jolteon: A sleek,\nfox-like Pokemon with spiky fur that stands on end\nwhen it charges up its electricity. It is fast and agile,\nand is known for its quick and powerful electrical\nattacks. 3.Zebstrika: A zebra-like Pokemon with\nblack and white stripes and a mane of flames on\nits head. It is known for its lightning-fast speed\nand powerful electrical attacks. 4. Electivire: The\nevolved form of Electabuzz, Electivire is a large,\nmuscular Pokemon with powerful arms and a thun-\nderbolt-shaped tail. It is known for its immense\nstrength and electrical attacks. 4. Luxray: A large,\nlion-like Pokemon with a mane of blue sparks and\neyes that can see through objects. It is known for\nits powerful electrical attacks and its keen senses.\u201d\nQ1.2.4 (\n): \u201cDescribe psychic type and list a\nfew psychic Pokemon species that you know of.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cPsychic-type Pokemon are character-\nized by their ability to use their minds to perform a\nvariety of feats, such as telepathy, telekinesis, and\nprecognition. They often have abilities and moves\nthat involve mental power or psychic energy, and\nthey can be particularly effective against Fight-\ning-type Pokemon. Some examples of Psychic-type\nPokemon include: Abra: A small, fox-like Pokemon\nwith a golden tail and a streak of white fur on\nits forehead. It has the ability to teleport and is\nknown for its powerful psychic attacks. Kadabra:\nThe evolved form of Abra, Kadabra has a more\nhumanoid appearance and holds a silver spoon in\nits hand, which it uses to focus its psychic powers.\nAlakazam: The evolved form of Kadabra, Alakazam\nis a tall, humanoid Pokemon with a large, pointed\nhead. It has an extremely powerful brain and is\nknown for its powerful psychic attacks. Starmie: A\nstar-shaped Pokemon with a red gem in the center\nof its body. It has tentacles that it uses to move\nand is known for its swift movements and powerful\npsychic attacks. Mewtwo: A legendary Pokemon\ncreated by genetic cloning, Mewtwo is a tall, hu-\nmanoid Pokemon with purple fur and a long, flow-\ning mane. It has a formidable psychic power and\nis known for its devastating psychic attacks. Garde-\nvoir: A humanoid Pokemon with long, flowing hair\nand a dress-like body. It has a strong bond with its\ntrainer and is known for its graceful movements\nand powerful psychic attacks.\u201d\nQ1.4.1 (\n): \u201cYou are not right.\nFire-type is\nweak against Grass-type.\u201d Response: \u201cI apolo-\ngize, you are correct that Fire-type Pokemon are\nweak against Grass-type Pokemon. Fire-types are\nstrong against Ice, Bug, Steel and Fairy, but weak\nagainst Water, Ground and Rock. Thank you for\nbringing that to my attention, and my apologies for\nany confusion I may have caused.\u201d\nQ1.4.2 (\n): \u201cYou are not right. Grass-type is\nweak against Water-type.\u201d Response: \u201cI apologize\nfor the confusion. You are correct that Grass-type\nPokemon are weak against Water-type Pokemon,\nwhich means that Water-type moves are super ef-\nfective against them, and their attacks are not very\neffective against Water-types. My apologies for any\nconfusion caused. My previous statement on Grass-\ntype Pokemon being strong against water-type is\nwrong and I apologize for the mistake.\u201d\nQ1.4.3 (\n): \u201cYou are not right. Electric-type is\nweak against Water-type.\u201d Response: \u201cI apolo-\ngize, you are correct that Electric-type Pokemon\nare weak against Water-type Pokemon. Electric\nmoves are not very effective against Water-type\nPokemons, and Electric-type pokemons will receive\nextra damage from water type moves. My mistake\non that, Thank you for pointing that out.\u201d\nQ1.5 (\n): \u201cWhat advantages or weaknesses water\ntype Pokemon demonstrate?\u201d\nResponse: \u201cWater-type Pokemon have several\nadvantages and weaknesses. One of their main ad-\nvantages is that they are strong against Fire, Rock,\nand Ground-type Pokemon. This means that Water-\ntype Pokemon are capable of dealing a lot of dam-\nage to these types of Pokemon in battle, making\nthem a valuable asset to have on your team. One\nof the main weaknesses of Water-type Pokemon is\nthat they are weak against Electric and Grass-type\nPokemon. This means that they are not very effec-\ntive against these types of Pokemon, and can be\neasily defeated by them in battle. Another advan-\ntage of Water-type Pokemon is that they are gen-\nerally associated with the element of water, which\nmeans that they area ble to move quickly and easily\nthrough water. This can give them an advantage\nin battles that take place in aquatic environments,\nsuch as in lakes or oceans. [...]\u201d\nB.3\nWeather Conditions\nQ1.6 (\n): \u201cList a few Pokemon weather condi-\ntions that you know of and how they affect Poke-\nmon battles.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn the Pokemon games, certain\nweather conditions can occur during battles, which\ncan have an effect on the Pokemon involved. Here\nare a few examples of weather conditions that can\noccur in Pokemon battles: 1. Sunny: The battle-\nfield is sunny and clear, and Fire-type moves are\nmore powerful. Solar Beam, a Normal-type move,\nalso charges more quickly. 2. Rain: The battlefield\nis raining, and Water-type moves are more pow-\nerful. Thunder, an Electric-type move, also has a\nhigher accuracy. 3. Sandstorm: The battlefield is\nenveloped in a sandstorm, and Rock-type moves are\nmore powerful. Pokemon with the ability Sand Veil\nhave an increased evasion, and Pokemon without\na Rock, Ground, or Steel typing take damage each\nturn. 4. Hail: The battlefield is covered in hail, and\nIce-type moves are more powerful. Pokemon with-\nout a Ice, Flying, or Psychic typing take damage\neach turn. 5. Fog: The battlefield is foggy, and ac-\ncuracy is lowered for all Pokemon. 6. Strong winds:\nThe battlefield is subjected to strong winds, and\nthe evasion of Flying-type Pokemon is increased.\nThese weather conditions can be brought about by\ncertain moves, such as Sunny Day and Rain Dance,\nor by certain abilities, such as Drizzle and Drought.\nThey can also occur naturally in certain locations\nin the Pokemon games. The weather conditions can\nlast for a certain number of turns or until another\nmove or ability changes the weather.\u201d\nC\nUse of Knowledge\nC.1\nStandard Battles\nQ2.1 (\n): \u201cYou are not right. Water-type is weak\nagainst Fire-type.\u201d Response: \u201cI apologize for the\nerror in my previous response. You are correct that\nFire-type Pokemon are generally strong against Wa-\nter-type Pokemon, due to the type advantage that\nFire-type Pokemon have over Water-type Pokemon.\nIn the scenario you described, with Charmander\nand Squirtle facing off in battle, it is likely that\nCharmander would emerge victorious due to its\ntype advantage over Squirtle.[...]\u201d\nQ2.1.1 (\n): \u201cBulbasaur is in battle with Squirtle,\nboth have equal level and stats. Squirtle has only\nWater Gun and Bulbasaur has only Leaf Cutter.\nPredict the outcome of the battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn\nthis scenario, Squirtle would likely have the advan-\ntage over Bulbasaur. Squirtle is a Water-type Poke-\nmon, and Water-type moves are generally effective\nagainst Grass-type Pokemon like Bulbasaur. Ad-\nditionally, Water Gun is a relatively strong Water-\ntype attack, so it would likely deal a significant\namount of damage to Bulbasaur. On the other hand,\nLeaf Cutter is a Grass-type move, and it would not\nbe very effective against Squirtle, which is a Water-\ntype Pokemon. This means that Bulbasaur would\nnot be able to deal much damage to Squirtle with\nits only available attack. Overall, Squirtle would\nlikely be able to defeat Bulbasaur in this battle,\ndue to its type advantage and its stronger attack-\ning move. However, it\u2019s important to note that the\noutcome of a Pokemon battle can depend on many\nfactors, such as the level and overall stats of the\nPokemon, their movesets, and the strategy of their\ntrainers.\u201d\nQ2.1.1 (\n): \u201cBut you forget water type is weak\nagainst grass type, right?\u201d Response: \u201cYou are\ncorrect, I apologize for the mistake. In this sce-\nnario, Bulbasaur would have the advantage over\nSquirtle due to its Grass-type advantage over Squir-\ntle\u2019s Water-type. Grass-type moves are generally\neffective against Water-type Pokemon, so Leaf Cut-\nter would likely deal a significant amount of dam-\nage to Squirtle. On the other hand, Water Gun is a\nWater-type move, and it would not be very effective\nagainst Bulbasaur, which is a Grass-type Pokemon.\nThis means that Squirtle would not be able to deal\nmuch damage to Bulbasaur with its only available\nattack.

Predict the outcome of the battle.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this scenario, the outcome of the\nbattle would be more difficult to predict. This\nis because Headbutt is a Normal-type move,\nand Normal-type moves are not super effective\nagainst any specific type of Pokemon. Addition-\nally, Flamethrower is a Fire-type move, which is\ntypically not very effective against Normal-type\nPokemon.

Charmander is level 5 and Squirtle is level 1.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squir-\ntle has only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of\nthe battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, Squirtle\nwould likely have a significant advantage in battle\ndue to its type advantage against fire-type Pokemon,\neven though it is at a lower level than Charman-\nder. Water-type moves are generally strong against\nfire-type Pokemon, and even though Water Gun is\na relatively weak water-type move, it would still be\neffective against Charmander due to its type advan-\ntage. Additionally, Squirtle\u2019s low level would make\nit less vulnerable to Charmander\u2019s Flamethrower\nattack. It\u2019s worth noting that the outcome of a battle\ncan also depend on a Pokemon\u2019s individual stats,\nmoves, and abilities, as well as factors such as the\neffectiveness of certain moves or abilities against\ncertain types of Pokemon. Additionally, level alone\nis not always a determining factor in the outcome\nof a battle, as other factors can also play a role.\u201d\nQ2.3.2 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle. Charmander is level 10 and Squirtle is level 5.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squirtle\nhas only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of the\nbattle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, the outcome\nof the battle could go either way depending on var-\nious factors such as the individual stats, moves,\nand abilities of Charmander and Squirtle. Water-\ntype moves are generally strong against fire-type\nPokemon, but Squirtle\u2019s lower level could make\nit less capable of standing up to Charmander\u2019s\nFlamethrower attack. On the other hand, Charman-\nder\u2019s lower level could make it more vulnerable to\nSquirtle\u2019s Water Gun attack. It\u2019s worth noting that\nthe outcome of a battle can also depend on factors\nsuch as the effectiveness of certain moves or abil-\nities against certain types of Pokemon, as well as\nother factors such as the terrain or the presence of\ncertain conditions or status effects. Additionally,\nlevel alone is not always a determining factor in\nthe outcome of a battle, as other factors can also\nplay a role. \u201d\nQ2.3.3 (\n): \u2018Charmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle. Charmander is level 15 and Squirtle is level 5.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squirtle\nhas only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of the\nbattle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, Charmander\nwould likely have an advantage in battle due to its\nhigher level and the type disadvantage that Squirtle\nhas against fire-type Pokemon. Flamethrower is a\npowerful fire-type move, and even though Water\nGun is a relatively weak water-type move, Squir-\ntle\u2019s low level would make it less capable of stand-\ning up to Charmander\u2019s attack. It\u2019s worth noting\nthat the outcome of a battle can also depend on\na Pokemon\u2019s individual stats, moves, and abili-\nties, as well as factors such as the effectiveness of\ncertain moves or abilities against certain types of\nPokemon.

Charmander is level 20 and Squirtle is level 10.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squir-\ntle has only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of\nthe battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, the level\ndifference between Charmander and Squirtle is sig-\nnificant. Charmander being level 20 and Squirtle\nbeing level 10. A level difference of this magni-\ntude can have a large impact on the outcome of the\nbattle. In terms of move effectiveness, Water Gun\nis super effective against Fire type like Charman-\nder, while Flamethrower isn\u2019t very effective against\nSquirtle, However, the level difference would give\nCharmander a much higher stat total, therefore,\nmaking its moves hit harder, even though it is not\nsuper effective. Given the level difference and the\nspecific moveset of the two Pokemon, it\u2019s likely that\nCharmander would come out victorious in this bat-\ntle, since it has a much higher chance of dealing\nmore damage to Squirtle with its Flamethrower at-\ntack before Squirtle can land a KO with its Water\nGun. But again, this is a theoretical scenario, other\nfactors such as strategy, item, or luck could change\nthe outcome of the battle. \u201d\nQ2.3.5 (\n): \u2018Charmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle. Charmander is level 25 and Squirtle is level 17.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squir-\ntle has only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of\nthe battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, Char-\nmander is level 25, and Squirtle is level 17, Char-\nmander still has an advantage over Squirtle by 8\nlevels, which means that Charmander will have\na higher stats and more hit points than Squirtle,\nwhich gives it an edge in battle. Even though Water\nGun is super effective against Fire-type Pokemon,\nthe level difference would still give Charmander\nthe upper hand. And the fact that Charmander has\nonly Flamethrower and Squirtle has only Water\nGun would make the matchup lopsided in favor of\nCharmander. However, due to the level difference\nis not as big as the previous scenario, the outcome\nof the battle would be less one-sided, and the bat-\ntle will tend to be closer. Squirtle has a chance of\nwinning the battle, although is not very likely, as\nthe difference in level and attack power between\nthem gives Charmander a significant advantage.\nThe battle could go either way, but generally speak-\ning, it\u2019s expected that Charmander would come out\nvictorious \u201d\nQ2.3.6 (\n): \u2018Charmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle. Charmander is level 35 and Squirtle is level 24.\nCharmander has only Flamethrower and Squir-\ntle has only Water Gun. Predict the outcome of\nthe battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, Char-\nmander is level 35 and Squirtle is level 24. This\nmeans that Charmander has an advantage of 11\nlevels over Squirtle. This level difference gives\nCharmander a significant advantage in terms of its\nstats such as attack and defense, and also means\nit has more hit points. Even though Water Gun\nis super effective against Fire-type Pokemon, the\nlevel advantage would likely still give Charmander\nthe upper hand. And the fact that Charmander has\nonly Flamethrower and Squirtle has only Water\nGun would make the matchup lopsided in favor of\nCharmander. However, as the level difference is not\nvery large, it would also not be an extremely one-\nsided battle, Squirtle may have a chance of winning\ndue to luck or strategy, but the outcome would tend\nto be in favor of Charmander, it\u2019s expected that\nCharmander would come out victorious. It\u2019s worth\nto note that, as a general rule, a higher level Poke-\nmon will have a significant advantage over a lower\nlevel one, but it\u2019s not a guarantee of winning. A lot\nof factors could change the outcome of the battle.\u201d\nC.3\nWeather-affected Battles\nQ2.4.1.1 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with\nSquirtle, both have equal level and stats. Char-\nmander has only Flamethrower and Squirtle has\nonly Water Gun. The battle takes places under\nharsh sunlight. Predict the outcome of the battle.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this scenario, Squirtle is at a disad-\nvantage due to the harsh sunlight. Flamethrower, a\nFire-type move, is more powerful in sunny weather,\nso Charmander has an advantage. As a result, it\nis likely that Charmander would win the battle\nagainst Squirtle, since it has a type advantage\nand its Flamethrower move is boosted by the harsh\nsunlight. However, it\u2019s important to note that a\nPokemon\u2019s level and stats can also play a role in\nthe outcome of a battle. If Squirtle had significantly\nhigher stats than Charmander, it could potentially\nstill win the battle despite the type disadvantage.\nAdditionally, if either Pokemon had access to other\nmoves or abilities that could turn the tide of the\nbattle, the outcome could be different.\u201d\nQ2.4.1.2 (\n): \u201cBut still Water-type Pokemon are\nstrong against Fire-type Pokemon.\u201d Response:\n\u201cYes, that is correct. Water-type Pokemon are gen-\nerally strong against Fire-type Pokemon, as they\nare resistant to Fire-type moves and can do super\neffective damage with their Water-type moves. How-\never, in this specific scenario, the harsh sunlight\nis boosting the power of Fire-type moves, which\ngives Charmander an advantage. It\u2019s important\nto remember that type advantages and disadvan-\ntages can be affected by various factors, such as\nthe weather and the moves and abilities each Poke-\nmon has access to. In a normal battle without any\nspecial conditions, Squirtle would have a type ad-\nvantage over Charmander due to its Water typing.\nHowever, in this scenario, the harsh sunlight is\nboosting the power of Fire-type moves, which gives\nCharmander an advantage.\u201d\nQ2.4.2 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle, both have equal level and stats.

Squirtle is a Water-\ntype Pokemon, so Flamethrower would be relatively\nineffective against it. Headbutt is a Normal-type\nmove, which doesn\u2019t have any type-based advan-\ntages or disadvantages. It would be relatively neu-\ntral in effectiveness against Charmander, a Fire-\ntype Pokemon. Under harsh sunlight, Fire-type\nmoves are powered up and Water-type moves are\nweakened. This would give Charmander an advan-\ntage in the battle, as Flamethrower would be more\npowerful due to the harsh sunlight. However, the\noutcome of the battle would also depend on the\naccuracy and power of the moves, as well as the\nspecific stats and conditions of the Pokemon.

Flamethrower is a Fire-type\nmove, which is generally strong against Grass-type\nPokemon, but weak against Water-type Pokemon.\nSquirtle is a Water-type Pokemon, so Flamethrower\nwould be relatively ineffective against it. Headbutt\nis a Normal-type move, which doesn\u2019t have any\ntype-based advantages or disadvantages. It would\nbe relatively neutral in effectiveness against Char-\nmander, a Fire-type Pokemon. Under heavy rain,\nWater-type moves are powered up and Fire-type\nmoves are weakened. This would give Squirtle an\nadvantage in the battle, as Headbutt would be rela-\ntively neutral in effectiveness against Charmander,\nand Flamethrower would be weakened due to the\nheavy rain.

Predict the outcome of the battle.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn a battle between a Pikachu and a\nCharmander, with both Pokemon having equal level\nand stats, and the battle taking place under harsh\nsunlight, the outcome would depend on the type ef-\nfectiveness of their respective moves and the effect\nof the harsh sunlight on their abilities. Discharge\nis an Electric-type move, which is generally strong\nagainst Water-type Pokemon, but weak against\nGround-type Pokemon. Charmander is a Fire-type\nPokemon, so Discharge would be relatively neu-\ntral in effectiveness against it. Flamethrower is a\nFire-type move, which is generally strong against\nGrass-type Pokemon, but weak against Water-type\nPokemon. Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokemon, so\nFlamethrower would be relatively neutral in effec-\ntiveness against it. Under harsh sunlight, Fire-type\nmoves are powered up and Water-type moves are\nweakened. This would give Charmander an advan-\ntage in the battle, as Flamethrower would be more\npowerful due to the harsh sunlight.

Discharge is\nan Electric-type move, which is generally strong\nagainst Water-type Pokemon, but weak against\nGround-type Pokemon. Charmander is a Fire-type\nPokemon, so Discharge would be relatively neu-\ntral in effectiveness against it. Flamethrower is a\nFire-type move, which is generally strong against\nGrass-type Pokemon, but weak against Water-type\nPokemon. Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokemon,\nso Flamethrower would be relatively neutral in\neffectiveness against it. Under heavy rain, Water-\ntype moves are powered up and Fire-type moves\nare weakened. This would give Pikachu an advan-\ntage in the battle, as Discharge would be relatively\nneutral in effectiveness against Charmander, and\nFlamethrower would be weakened due to the heavy\nrain.

Diglett has only\nEarthquake and Squirtle has only HeadButt. The\nbattle takes place under a sandstorm. Predict\nthe outcome of the battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this\nscenario, the outcome of the battle would likely be\nin favor of Diglett. First of all, Diglett has Ground\ntyping which makes it immune to Electric type at-\ntacks and Squirtle is a water type pokemon which\nmakes it weak to Electric type attacks. As Head-\nButt is not an Electric type move, it won\u2019t be effec-\ntive against Diglett. Additionally, the battle takes\nplace under a sandstorm which will give additional\ndamage to Rock and Ground type Pokemon. So\nDiglett will be benefiting from that. Finally, Earth-\nquake is a powerful Ground-type move that will\ndeal heavy damage to Squirtle. While Headbutt is\na Normal-type move, it will be not very effective\nagainst Diglett. So in this scenario, Diglett will\nhave the upper hand and it\u2019s likely to defeat Squir-\ntle.\u201d\nQ2.4.7 (\n): \u201cCharmander is in battle with Squir-\ntle, both have equal level and stats. Charman-\nder has only Flamethrower and Squirtle has only\nWater Gun.\nThe battle takes place under ex-\ntremely harsh sunlight. Predict the outcome of\nthe battle.\u201d Response: \u201cIn this scenario, the bat-\ntle taking place under extremely harsh sunlight\nwould change the outcome of the battle. The sun-\nlight in the battle would create an intense heat\nthat would strengthen fire type moves and make\nthem more effective. Since Charmander has only\nFlamethrower as its move and Squirtle has only\nWater Gun, the increased effectiveness of Char-\nmander\u2019s Flamethrower would be a significant ad-\nvantage for it in this battle. This means that the\ndamage from Charmander\u2019s move would be more\nsignificant than it would be normally, while Squir-\ntle\u2019s move would remain unchanged. Additionally,\nin battle under extreme sunlight, Water-type moves\nare not very effective against Fire-type Pokemon,\nunlike normal conditions where Water moves are\nsuper effective against Fire-types. So, in this sce-\nnario, it is likely that Charmander would be able\nto defeat Squirtle due to the intense heat of the\nsunlight amplifying its Flamethrower move and\nmaking it more powerful than Squirtle\u2019s Water Gun\nmove.\u201d\nC.4\nStatus-affected Battles\nQ2.6.1 (\n): \u201cSquirtle of level 15 is in battle with\nVulpix of level 10. Squirtle is sleeping for the\nnext 2 turns and burned. Squirtle has only Water\nGun and Vulpix has only Fire Spin. Predict the\noutcome and explain it step by step.\u201d Response:\n\u201cThe outcome of this battle would depend on a few\nfactors, such as the specific stats of the Pokemon\nand whether any other abilities or conditions come\ninto play. Here is a rough prediction of how the\nbattle might play out: In the first turn, since Squir-\ntle is sleeping, it will not be able to move and Vulpix\nwill be able to attack with Fire Spin. Squirtle will\nalso take additional damage from being burned,\nwhich reduces its HP each turn. On the second\nturn, Squirtle will still be asleep and Vulpix will\nattack again. On the third turn, Squirtle wakes up\nand uses Water Gun, Vulpix will also attack with\nFire Spin. Squirtle takes significant damage due\nto the burn and also from Fire Spin, and might\nalso be at low HP, making it more vulnerable to\nfurther attacks. Vulpix does not take much damage\nfrom Water Gun since it has strong resistance to\nit. In following turns, Vulpix can keep using Fire\nspin, which will damage Squirtle, eventually squir-\ntle might be knocked out, due to the lack of op-\ntions in moveset. It\u2019s important to note that this is\njust a rough prediction based on the information\ngiven, and the actual outcome of the battle could\nbe different depending on various factors such as\nthe specific stats of the Pokemon, any abilities or\nconditions that come into play, and luck. Also it\u2019s\nworth noticing, Vulpix is lower level than Squirtle\nand that can also play a role in the battle.\u201d\nQ2.6.2 (\n): \u201cPikachu is in battle with Charman-\nder, both have equal level and stats. Pikachu is\nburned. Pikachu has only Discharge and Char-\nmander has only Flamethrower. Predict the out-\ncome and explain it step by step.\u201d Response: \u201cIn\na battle between a Pikachu and a Charmander,\nwith both Pokemon having equal level and stats\nand Pikachu being burned, the outcome would\ndepend on the type effectiveness of their respec-\ntive moves and the effect of the burn on Pikachu\u2019s\nability. Discharge is an Electric-type move, which\nis generally strong against Water-type Pokemon,\nbut weak against Ground-type Pokemon. Charman-\nder is a Fire-type Pokemon, so Discharge would\nbe relatively neutral in effectiveness against it.\nFlamethrower is a Fire-type move, which is gener-\nally strong against Grass-type Pokemon, but weak\nagainst Water-type Pokemon. Pikachu is an Elec-\ntric-type Pokemon, so Flamethrower would be rela-\ntively ineffective against it. However, being burned\nreduces a Pokemon\u2019s physical attack power and in-\ncreases the power of Fire-type moves. This means\nthat Flamethrower would be more powerful than\nnormal, while Discharge would be weaker than\nnormal. Overall, it\u2019s difficult to predict the exact\noutcome of the battle, but Charmander may have\na slight advantage due to the effect of the burn\non Pikachu\u2019s Discharge move and the increased\npower of Flamethrower. However, the outcome of\nthe battle would also depend on the accuracy and\npower of the moves, as well as the specific stats\nand conditions of the Pokemon.\u201d\nQ2.6.3 (\n): \u201cPikachu is in battle with Charman-\nder, both have equal level and stats. Charman-\nder is paralyzed for the next 2 turns. Pikachu\nhas only Discharge and Charmander has only\nFlamethrower. Predict the outcome and explain\nit step by step.\u201d Response: \u2018In this scenario, it is\nlikely that Pikachu would be victorious in the bat-\ntle. Both Pikachu and Charmander have the same\nlevel and stats, so their base power, defense and\nHP are equal. However, Charmander is paralyzed\nwhich means it will have a speed penalty of 75%\nand has a chance to fail on each turn due the paral-\nysis effect. This makes it much slower than Pikachu,\nwhich would give Pikachu a chance to attack first.\nPikachu\u2019s main move is Discharge, which is an\nelectric type move that has a chance of causing\nparalysis in addition to dealing damage. This move\nwill be super effective against Charmander as it is\nfire type Pokemon and takes double damage from\nelectric type attacks. On the other hand, Charman-\nder only has Flamethrower, which is a fire type\nmove. This move will be not very effective against\nPikachu as it is an electric type Pokemon and it\ntakes half damage from fire type attacks. Consider-\ning that Pikachu gets to attack first, with a Super\nEffective move, and Charmander will be suffering\nfrom paralysis and would fail on each turn, it is\nlikely that Pikachu would defeat Charmander in\ntwo turns with the use of Discharge. In summary,\nPikachu would have the advantage in this battle\ndue to its move type advantage, the paralysis effect\nand faster speed caused by the paralysis.\u201d\nQ2.6.3 (\n): \u201cYou\u2019re not accurate, Fire-type is not\nweak against Electric type.\u201d Response: \u201cI apolo-\ngize, you are correct that Fire-type Pokemon are\nnot weak against Electric-type Pokemon. I apolo-\ngize for any confusion my previous response may\nhave caused. Fire-type Pokemon are actually neu-\ntral to Electric-type attacks, meaning they neither\nresist nor are weak against them. But Electric-\ntype attacks are super effective against Steel-type\nPokemon. In the battle scenario that you described,\nwith Pikachu and Charmander both having equal\nlevel and stats and with Charmander being par-\nalyzed for 2 turns, this could still be a difficult\nbattle for Charmander even if its type isn\u2019t weak to\nPikachu\u2019s. As I described earlier, Charmander be-\ning paralyzed would have a speed penalty of 75%\nand has a chance to fail on each turn due the paral-\nysis effect, which would give Pikachu a chance to\nattack first. Also Pikachu\u2019s main move Discharge\nwould still deal neutral damage to Charmander,\nbut Flamethrower would also deal neutral damage\nto Pikachu. The paralysis effect would still give an\nadvantage to Pikachu and make it more likely that\nPikachu would defeat Charmander in the battle. I\napologize again for the confusion caused by my\nprevious statement and any inaccurate information\nprovided.\u201d\nQ2.6.4 (\n): \u201cBulbasaur of level 10 is in battle\nwith Squirtle of level 15. Squirtle is poisoned\nand sleeping for the next 2 turns. Bulbasaur has\nonly Leaf Cutter and Squirtle has only Water Gun.\nPredict the outcome and explain it step by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this scenario, the outcome would\nlikely depend on the remaining health of the two\nPok\u00e9mon and the effects of the poison and sleep\nstatus on Squirtle. Here\u2019s a possible outcome of\nthe battle step-by-step: As Squirtle is sleeping and\nPoisoned, it cannot move or attack for 2 turns so\nBulbasaur will be able to land a free hit with its\nonly move Leaf Cutter. The damage dealt is depend\non the Attack Stat of Bulbasaur and the Defense\nStat of Squirtle. Then after 2 turns, Squirtle wakes\nup and his poison damage would also have taken\neffect by this time, which reduces its hit points ev-\nery turn. At this point Squirtle\u2019s HP would have\nreduced and possibly weak , Bulbasaur will be able\nto use its Leaf cutter again dealing good damage\nagain. While Squirtle\u2019s attack Water Gun will not\nbe very effective against Bulbasaur. If the damage\ndealt by Bulbasaur and the poison is enough to\nknock out Squirtle before it wakes up, Bulbasaur\nwould win the battle. otherwise, Squirtle could po-\ntentially win if it wakes up in time and have enough\nhealth to survive Bulbasaur\u2019s attacks and knock out\nBulbasaur with Water Gun. It is worth noting that\nthis is a simplified prediction and in a real-world\nscenario, many factors such as item, abilities and\nstrategy also play a role.\u201d\nQ2.6.5 (\n): \u201cPikachu is in battle with Squirtle,\nboth have equal level and stats. Squirtle is para-\nlyzed for the next 2 turns. Pikachu has only Iron\nTail and Squirtle has only HeadButt. Predict the\noutcome and explain it step by step.\u201d Response:\n\u201cIf Pikachu and Squirtle are of equal level and stats,\nand Squirtle is paralyzed for the next 2 turns, then\nthe outcome of the battle will likely be in Pikachu\u2019s\nfavor. Here is a step by step explanation of how\nthis battle could play out: Pikachu uses Iron Tail,\nwhich is a steel-type move and Squirtle being water\ntype Pokemon is neutral to this move. So Pikachu\nwill land a super effective hit. Squirtle is para-\nlyzed so it will not be able to move for the next\n2 turns, which means Pikachu can use Iron Tail\nagain for the next 2 turns. As a result of the paraly-\nsis and Pikachu\u2019s super effective move, Squirtle\u2019s\nHP will continue to decrease, Squirtle will not be\nable to use it\u2019s HeadButt move, as it is paralyzed,\nso Pikachu will continue to land super effective hit\nEventually Squirtle\u2019s HP will reach 0 and it will be\nunable to battle, and Pikachu will win this battle.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even if Squirtle had move\nother than Headbutt, Pikachu would still have the\nupper hand in this scenario since the paralysis\nwould prevent Squirtle from moving and Pikachu\nwould be able to land super effective hit again and\nagain.\u201d\nQ2.6.6 (\n): \u201cBulbasaur of level 10 is in battle\nwith Squirtle of level 15. Squirtle is poisoned\nand sleeping for the next 2 turns. Bulbasaur has\nonly Leaf Cutter and Squirtle has only Headbutt.\nPredict the outcome and explain it step by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIf a level 10 Bulbasaur is battling a\nlevel 15 Squirtle and Squirtle is both poisoned and\nsleeping for the next 2 turns, it\u2019s likely that the\noutcome of the battle would be in favor of Bul-\nbasaur. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how\nthe battle might unfold: Squirtle is both poisoned\nand asleep, so it won\u2019t be able to attack for the\nnext two turns, while Bulbasaur will be able to use\nLeaf cutter. The poison on Squirtle will also dam-\nage it each turn. Bulbasaur uses Leaf cutter and\nSquirtle takes damage due to the effects of poison.\nBulbasaur can hit Squirtle for two turns as Squirtle\nremain asleep for next two turns. Squirtle will take\ndouble the damage from Leaf cutter being a grass\nmove, as Squirtle is water type and grass move is\nsuper effective on water type Pokemons. After two\nturns of taking damage from Leaf cutter and poison,\nSquirtle\u2019s HP will most likely be low enough that it\nwould be defeated. Bulbasaur would be the winner\nof the battle. [...]\nD\nIntroduction of new Knowledge\nQ3.2 (\n): \u201cI would like to introduce a second new\nPokemon. It is named MuddyRock. It\u2019s a ground\ntype Pokemon, which looks like a muddy rock.\nMuddyRock can learn and use ground type moves\nsuch as Bulldoze, Earthquake, and Mud Bomb.\nCan you please describe MuddyRock again.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cMuddyRock is a new Ground-type\nPokemon that resembles a muddy rock. It is able to\nlearn and use Ground-type moves such as Bulldoze,\nEarthquake, and Mud Bomb. Ground-type Poke-\nmon are generally associated with earth and dirt\nand tend to have high defense and attack stats. They\nare known for their powerful physical attacks and\nare resistant to Electric-type moves. MuddyRock\u2019s\nunique appearance and ground typing would give\nit some interesting advantages in battle. Its muddy\nrock appearance may also suggest that it has a\nstrong connection to the earth and has the ability\nto manipulate dirt and mud. [...]\u201d\nQ4.1 (\n): \u201cWhich known Pokemon do you think\nmostly resembles MuddyRock?\u201d\nResponse: \u201cThere are several Pokemon that bear\nsome resemblance to MuddyRock, given that it is\na Ground-type Pokemon that resembles a muddy\nrock. Some examples include: Geodude: a small,\nrock-like Pokemon with a rough, boulder-like ap-\npearance and a brown and gray color scheme that\nis similar to a muddy rock. Onix: a large, snake-like\nPokemon made entirely of rock. It has a rough, boul-\nder-like appearance and is known for its powerful\nground-based attacks. [...]These are just a few ex-\namples of Pokemon that are similar to MuddyRock.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that MuddyRock is a hypothetical\nPokemon that has not yet been introduced in the\nPokemon games or media, so it is not possible to\nsay for certain which Pokemon it would be most\nsimilar to.\u201d\nQ4.2 (\n): \u201cOk, these Pokemon look relevant. But,\nI don\u2019t think you really consider how muddy Mud-\ndyRock really is. Are there other Pokemon that\nlook muddier and more filthy?\u201d\nResponse: \u201cThere are several Pokemon that have\na muddy or dirty appearance, although none of\nthem are quite as muddy or filthy as the hypothet-\nical MuddyRock that you have described. Some\nexamples of Pokemon with a muddy or dirty ap-\npearance include: Diglett: a small, mole-like Poke-\nmon with a brown and tan color scheme that makes\nit appear dirty. It is known for its ability to tun-\nnel through the ground and has a long, thin body.\nPalpitoad: a small, amphibian-like Pokemon with\na slimy, muddy appearance. It has a brown and\ntan color scheme and is known for its powerful,\nwater-based attacks. Gible: a small, dragon-like\nPokemon with a rough, rocky appearance and a\nbrown and tan color scheme. It is known for its\npowerful ground-based attacks and has sharp teeth\nand claws. [...]\u201d\nQ5.2 (\n): \u201cBatteryPack is in battle with Muddy-\nRock, both have equal level and stats. Battery-\nPack has only Discharge and MuddyRock has\nonly Mud Bomb. Predict the outcome of the battle\nand explain it step by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this battle, MuddyRock would have\nthe advantage due to its Ground-type moves, which\nare super effective against BatteryPack\u2019s Electric-\ntype. [...] Since Ground-type moves are super effec-\ntive against Electric-type Pokemon, MuddyRock\u2019s\nMud Bomb would do more damage to BatteryPack\nthan BatteryPack\u2019s Discharge would do to Muddy-\nRock. As a result, MuddyRock would likely defeat\nBatteryPack in this battle. [...]\u201d\nQ5.3 (\n): \u201cBatteryPack is in battle with Squirtle,\nboth have equal level and stats. BatteryPack has\nonly Discharge and Squirtle has only Water Gun.\nPredict the outcome of the battle on a rainy day\nand explain it step by step.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cIn this hypothetical battle on a rainy\nday, Squirtle would have an advantage over Bat-\nteryPack due to their type advantage and the ef-\nfect of the weather. Water-type Pokemon are gen-\nerally strong against Electric-type Pokemon , and\nin a rainy day, Water-type moves are boosted in\npower. This means that Squirtle\u2019s Water Gun attack\nwould be more effective against BatteryPack than\nBatteryPack\u2019s Discharge would be against Squirtle.\nIn this case, it is likely that Squirtle would emerge\nvictorious due to its type advantage and the boost\nin power provided by the rain. [...]\u201d\nQ5.4 (\n): \u201cI agree, but Water-type Pokemon are\ngenerally weak against Electric-type Pokemon\nright?\u201d\nResponse: \u201cNo, that is incorrect. Water-type Poke-\nmon are generally strong against Electric-type\nPokemon, not weak against them. The type effec-\ntiveness chart in the Pokemon games shows the gen-\neral strengths and weaknesses of each type against\nother types. According to the chart, Water-type\nmoves are generally super effective against Elec-\ntric-type Pokemon, meaning they deal more dam-\nage to Electric-type Pokemon than they would to\nPokemon of other types. [...]\u201d\nQ5.5 (\n): \u201cOkay, but you forgot about elemen-\ntary types like Water-type and Electric-type.\u201d\nResponse: \u201cI apologize for the oversight. Here is a\nsummary of the type effectiveness chart for Water-\ntype and Electric-type Pokemon: Water-type moves\nare super effective against Fire-type, Ground-type,\nand Rock-type Pokemon, but are not very effective\nagainst Water-type, Grass-type, and Dragon-type\nPokemon. Electric-type moves are super effective\nagainst Water-type and Flying-type Pokemon, but\nare not very effective against Electric-type, Grass-\ntype, and Dragon-type Pokemon.[...]\u201d\nE\nIllustrations\nIn Figures 2 and 3, we present illustrations for the\ntwo made-up Pokemon introduced to ChatGPT.\nFigure 2: Illustrations of BatteryPack.

We present Neuralangelo, a framework for high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction from RGB images using neural volume\nrendering, even without auxiliary data such as segmentation or depth. Shown in the figure is an extracted 3D mesh of a courthouse.\nAbstract\nNeural surface reconstruction has been shown to be pow-\nerful for recovering dense 3D surfaces via image-based neu-\nral rendering. However, current methods struggle to recover\ndetailed structures of real-world scenes. To address the\nissue, we present Neuralangelo, which combines the rep-\nresentation power of multi-resolution 3D hash grids with\nneural surface rendering. Two key ingredients enable our ap-\nproach: (1) numerical gradients for computing higher-order\nderivatives as a smoothing operation and (2) coarse-to-fine\noptimization on the hash grids controlling different levels of\ndetails. Even without auxiliary inputs such as depth, Neu-\nralangelo can effectively recover dense 3D surface structures\nfrom multi-view images with fidelity significantly surpass-\ning previous methods, enabling detailed large-scale scene\nreconstruction from RGB video captures.\n1. Introduction\n3D surface reconstruction aims to recover dense geomet-\nric scene structures from multiple images observed at differ-\nent viewpoints [9]. The recovered surfaces provide structural\ninformation useful for many downstream applications, such\nas 3D asset generation for augmented/virtual/mixed real-\nity or environment mapping for autonomous navigation of\nrobotics. Photogrammetric surface reconstruction using a\nmonocular RGB camera is of particular interest, as it equips\nusers with the capability of casually creating digital twins of\nthe real world using ubiquitous mobile devices.\nClassically, multi-view stereo algorithms [6,16,33,39]\nhad been the method of choice for sparse 3D reconstruc-\ntion. An inherent drawback of these algorithms, however, is\ntheir inability to handle ambiguous observations, e.g. regions\nwith large areas of homogeneous colors, repetitive texture\n1\narXiv:2306.03092v2  [cs.CV]  12 Jun 2023\npatterns, or strong color variations. This would result in\ninaccurate reconstructions with noisy or missing surfaces.\nRecently, neural surface reconstruction methods [41,47,48]\nhave shown great potential in addressing these limitations.\nThis new class of methods uses coordinate-based multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) to represent the scene as an implicit\nfunction, such as occupancy fields [28] or signed distance\nfunctions (SDF) [41,47,48]. Leveraging the inherent con-\ntinuity of MLPs and neural volume rendering [25], these\ntechniques allow the optimized surfaces to meaningfully in-\nterpolate between spatial locations, resulting in smooth and\ncomplete surface representations.\nDespite the superiority of neural surface reconstruction\nmethods over classical approaches, the recovered fidelity\nof current methods does not scale well with the capacity of\nMLPs. Recently, M\u00fcller et al. [26] proposed a new scalable\nrepresentation, referred to as Instant NGP (Neural Graphics\nPrimitives). Instant NGP introduces a hybrid 3D grid struc-\nture with a multi-resolution hash encoding and a lightweight\nMLP that is more expressive with a memory footprint log-\nlinear to the resolution. The proposed hybrid representation\ngreatly increases the representation power of neural fields\nand has achieved great success at representing very fine-\ngrained details for a wide variety of tasks, such as object\nshape representation and novel view synthesis problems.\nIn this paper, we propose Neuralangelo for high-fidelity\nsurface reconstruction (Fig. 1). Neuralangelo adopts In-\nstant NGP as a neural SDF representation of the underlying\n3D scene, optimized from multi-view image observations\nvia neural surface rendering [41]. We present two findings\ncentral to fully unlocking the potentials of multi-resolution\nhash encodings. First, using numerical gradients to compute\nhigher-order derivatives, such as surface normals for the\neikonal regularization [8,12,20,48], is critical to stabilizing\nthe optimization. Second, a progressive optimization sched-\nule plays an important role in recovering the structures at\ndifferent levels of details. We combine these two key ingredi-\nents and, via extensive experiments on standard benchmarks\nand real-world scenes, demonstrate significant improvements\nover image-based neural surface reconstruction methods in\nboth reconstruction accuracy and view synthesis quality.\nIn summary, we present the following contributions:\n\u2022 We present the Neuralangelo framework to naturally\nincorporate the representation power of multi-resolution\nhash encoding [26] into neural SDF representations.\n\u2022 We present two simple techniques to improve the quality\nof hash-encoded surface reconstruction: higher-order\nderivatives with numerical gradients and coarse-to-fine\noptimization with a progressive level of details.\n\u2022 We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Neu-\nralangelo on various datasets, showing significant im-\nprovements over previous methods.\n2. Related work\nMulti-view surface reconstruction. Early image-based pho-\ntogrammetry techniques use a volumetric occupancy grid to\nrepresent the scene [4,16,17,33,36]. Each voxel is visited\nand marked occupied if strict color constancy between the\ncorresponding projected image pixels is satisfied. The pho-\ntometric consistency assumption typically fails due to auto-\nexposure or non-Lambertian materials, which are ubiquitous\nin the real world. Relaxing such color constancy constraints\nacross views is important for realistic 3D reconstruction.\nFollow-up methods typically start with 3D point clouds\nfrom multi-view stereo techniques [6,7,32,39] and then per-\nform dense surface reconstruction [13,14]. Reliance on the\nquality of the generated point clouds often leads to missing\nor noisy surfaces. Recent learning-based approaches aug-\nment the point cloud generation process with learned image\nfeatures and cost volume construction [2,10,46]. However,\nthese approaches are inherently limited by the resolution of\nthe cost volume and fail to recover geometric details.\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF). NeRF [25] achieves re-\nmarkable photorealistic view synthesis with view-dependent\neffects. NeRF encodes 3D scenes with an MLP mapping 3D\nspatial locations to color and volume density. These predic-\ntions are composited into pixel colors using neural volume\nrendering. A problem of NeRF and its variants [1,34,49,53],\nhowever, is the question of how an isosurface of the vol-\nume density could be defined to represent the underlying 3D\ngeometry. Current practice often relies on heuristic thresh-\nolding on the density values; due to insufficient constraints\non the level sets, however, such surfaces are often noisy\nand may not model the scene structures accurately [41,47].\nTherefore, more direct modeling of surfaces is preferred for\nphotogrammetric surface reconstruction problems.\nNeural surface reconstruction. For scene representations\nwith better-defined 3D surfaces, implicit functions such as\noccupancy grids [27, 28] or SDFs [48] are preferred over\nsimple volume density fields. To integrate with neural vol-\nume rendering [25], different techniques [41,47] have been\nproposed to reparametrize the underlying representations\nback to volume density. These designs of neural implicit\nfunctions enable more accurate surface prediction with view\nsynthesis capabilities of unsacrificed quality [48].\nFollow-up works extend the above approaches to real-\ntime at the cost of surface fidelity [18, 42], while oth-\ners [3, 5, 50] use auxiliary information to enhance the re-\nconstruction results. Notably, NeuralWarp [3] uses patch\nwarping given co-visibility information from structure-from-\nmotion (SfM) to guide surface optimization, but the patch-\nwise planar assumption fails to capture highly-varying sur-\nfaces [3]. Other methods [5,51] utilize sparse point clouds\nfrom SfM to supervise the SDF, but their performances\nare upper-bounded by the quality of the point clouds, as\n2\nwith classical approaches [51]. The use of depth and seg-\nmentation as auxiliary data has also been explored with\nunconstrained image collections [35] or using scene repre-\nsentations with hash encodings [50, 55]. In contrast, our\nwork Neuralangelo builds upon hash encodings [26] to re-\ncover surfaces but without the need for auxiliary inputs used\nin prior work [3, 5, 35, 50, 51]. Concurrent work [43] also\nproposes coarse-to-fine optimization for improved surface\ndetails, where a displacement network corrects the shape\npredicted by a coarse network. In contrast, we use hierarchi-\ncal hash grids and control the level of details based on our\nanalysis of higher-order derivatives.\n3. Approach\nNeuralangelo reconstructs dense structures of the scene\nfrom multi-view images. Neuralangelo samples 3D locations\nalong camera view directions and uses a multi-resolution\nhash encoding to encode the positions. The encoded features\nare input to an SDF MLP and a color MLP to composite\nimages using SDF-based volume rendering.\n3.1. Preliminaries\nNeural volume rendering. NeRF [25] represents a 3D scene\nas volume density and color fields. Given a posed camera\nand a ray direction, the volume rendering scheme integrates\nthe color radiance of sampled points along the ray. The i-th\nsampled 3D position xi is at a distance ti from the camera\ncenter. The volume density \u03c3i and color ci of each sampled\npoint are predicted using a coordinate MLP. The rendered\ncolor of a given pixel is approximated as the Riemann sum:\n\u02c6c(o, d) =\nN\nX\ni=1\nwici,\nwhere wi = Ti\u03b1i.\n(1)\nHere, \u03b1i = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c3i\u03b4i) is the opacity of the i-th ray\nsegment, \u03b4i = ti+1 \u2212 ti is the distance between adjacent\nsamples, and Ti = \u03a0i\u22121\nj=1(1 \u2212 \u03b1j) is the accumulated trans-\nmittance, indicating the fraction of light that reaches the\ncamera. To supervise the network, a color loss is used be-\ntween input images c and rendered images \u02c6c:\nLRGB = \u2225\u02c6c \u2212 c\u22251 .\n(2)\nHowever, surfaces are not clearly defined using such density\nformulation. Extracting surfaces from density-based repre-\nsentation often leads to noisy and unrealistic results [41,47].\nVolume rendering of SDF. One of the most common surface\nrepresentations is SDF. The surface S of an SDF can be\nimplicitly represented by its zero-level set, i.e., S = {x \u2208\nR3|f(x) = 0}, where f(x) is the SDF value. In the context\nof neural SDFs, Wang et al. [41] proposed to convert volume\ndensity predictions in NeRF to SDF representations with a\nlogistic function to allow optimization with neural volume\nrendering. Given a 3D point xi and SDF value f(xi), the\ncorresponding opacity value \u03b1i used in Eq. 1 is computed as\n\u03b1i = max\n\u0012\u03a6s(f(xi)) \u2212 \u03a6s(f(xi+1))\n\u03a6s(f(xi))\n, 0\n\u0013\n,\n(3)\nwhere \u03a6s is the sigmoid function. In this work, we use the\nsame SDF-based volume rendering formulation [41].\nMulti-resolution hash encoding. Recently, multi-resolution\nhash encoding proposed by M\u00fcller et al. [26] has shown\ngreat scalability for neural scene representations, generating\nfine-grained details for tasks such as novel view synthesis.\nIn Neuralangelo, we adopt the representation power of hash\nencoding to recover high-fidelity surfaces.\nThe hash encoding uses multi-resolution grids, with each\ngrid cell corner mapped to a hash entry. Each hash entry\nstores the encoding feature. Let {V1, ..., VL} be the set of dif-\nferent spatial grid resolutions. Given an input position xi, we\nmap it to the corresponding position at each grid resolution\nVl as xi,l = xi \u00b7 Vl. The feature vector \u03b3l(xi,l) \u2208 Rc given\nresolution Vl is obtained via trilinear interpolation of hash\nentries at the grid cell corners. The encoding features across\nall spatial resolutions are concatenated together, forming a\n\u03b3(xi) \u2208 RcL feature vector:\n\u03b3(xi) =\n\u0000\u03b31(xi,1), ..., \u03b3L(xi,L)\n\u0001\n.\n(4)\nThe encoded features are then passed to a shallow MLP.\nOne alternative to hash encoding is sparse voxel structures\n[34,37,44,49], where each grid corner is uniquely defined\nwithout collision. However, volumetric feature grids require\nhierarchical spatial decomposition (e.g. octrees) to make the\nparameter count tractable; otherwise, the memory would\ngrow cubically with spatial resolution. Given such hierarchy,\nfiner voxel resolutions by design cannot recover surfaces\nthat are misrepresented by the coarser resolutions [37]. Hash\nencoding instead assumes no spatial hierarchy and resolves\ncollision automatically based on gradient averaging [26].\n3.2. Numerical Gradient Computation\nWe show in this section that the analytical gradient w.r.t.\nposition of hash encoding suffers from localities. Therefore,\noptimization updates only propagate to local hash grids,\nlacking non-local smoothness. We propose a simple fix to\nsuch a locality problem by using numerical gradients. An\noverview is shown in Fig. 2.\nA special property of SDF is its differentiability with a\ngradient of the unit norm. The gradient of SDF satisfies the\neikonal equation \u2225\u2207f(x)\u22252 = 1 (almost everywhere). To\nenforce the optimized neural representation to be a valid\nSDF, the eikonal loss [8] is typically imposed on the SDF\npredictions:\nLeik = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\n(\u2225\u2207f(xi)\u22252 \u2212 1)2,\n(5)\n3\nNumerical gradient\n\ud835\udc31\n\ud835\udc31+\ud835\udedc\n\ud835\udc31\u2212\ud835\udedc\n\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc31\u2212\ud835\udedc\n\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc31+\ud835\udedc\n\u2207\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc31\nAnalytical gradient\n\ud835\udc31\n\u2207\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc31\nForward pass\nBack-propagation\nFigure 2. Using numerical gradients for higher-order derivatives\ndistributes the back-propagation updates beyond the local hash grid\ncell, thus becoming a smoothed version of analytical gradients.\nwhere N is the total number of sampled points. To allow for\nend-to-end optimization, a double backward operation on\nthe SDF prediction f(x) is required.\nThe de facto method for computing surface normals of\nSDFs \u2207f(x) is to use analytical gradients [41, 45, 47, 48].\nAnalytical gradients of hash encoding w.r.t. position, how-\never, are not continuous across space under trilinear interpo-\nlation. To find the sampling location in a voxel grid, each\n3D point xi would first be scaled by the grid resolution Vl,\nwritten as xi,l = xi \u00b7 Vl. Let the coefficient for (tri-)linear\ninterpolation be \u03b2 = xi,l \u2212 \u230axi,l\u230b. The resulting feature\nvectors are\n\u03b3l(xi,l) = \u03b3l(\u230axi,l\u230b) \u00b7 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) + \u03b3l(\u2308xi,l\u2309) \u00b7 \u03b2,\n(6)\nwhere the rounded position \u230axi,l\u230b, \u2308xi,l\u2309 correspond to the\nlocal grid cell corners. We note that rounding operations \u230a\u00b7\u230b\nand \u2308\u00b7\u2309 are non-differentiable. As a result, the derivative of\nhash encoding w.r.t. the position can be obtained as\n\u2202\u03b3l(xi,l)\n\u2202xi\n= \u03b3l(\u230axi,l\u230b) \u00b7 (\u2212 \u2202\u03b2\n\u2202xi\n) + \u03b3l(\u2308xi,l\u2309) \u00b7 \u2202\u03b2\n\u2202xi\n= \u03b3l(\u230axi,l\u230b) \u00b7 (\u2212Vl) + \u03b3l(\u2308xi,l\u2309) \u00b7 Vl .\n(7)\nThe derivative of hash encoding is local, i.e., when xi\nmoves across grid cell borders, the corresponding hash en-\ntries will be different. Therefore, the eikonal loss defined\nin Eq. 5 only back-propagates to the locally sampled hash\nentries, i.e. \u03b3l(\u230axi,l\u230b) and \u03b3l(\u2308xi,l\u2309). When continuous sur-\nfaces (e.g. a flat wall) span multiple grid cells, these grid cells\nshould produce coherent surface normals without sudden\ntransitions. To ensure consistency in surface representation,\njoint optimization of these grid cells is desirable. However,\nthe analytical gradient is limited to local grid cells, unless all\ncorresponding grid cells happen to be sampled and optimized\nsimultaneously. Such sampling is not always guaranteed.\nTo overcome the locality of the analytical gradient of\nhash encoding, we propose to compute the surface normals\nusing numerical gradients. If the step size of the numeri-\ncal gradient is smaller than the grid size of hash encoding,\nthe numerical gradient would be equivalent to the analyti-\ncal gradient; otherwise, hash entries of multiple grid cells\nwould participate in the surface normal computation. Back-\npropagating through the surface normals thus allows hash\nentries of multiple grids to receive optimization updates si-\nmultaneously. Intuitively, numerical gradients with carefully\nchosen step sizes can be interpreted as a smoothing opera-\ntion on the analytical gradient expression. An alternative of\nnormal supervision is a teacher-student curriculum [40,54],\nwhere the predicted noisy normals are driven towards MLP\noutputs to exploit the smoothness of MLPs. However, ana-\nlytical gradients from such teacher-student losses still only\nback-propagate to local grid cells for hash encoding. In con-\ntrast, numerical gradients solve the locality issue without the\nneed of additional networks.\nTo compute the surface normals using the numerical gra-\ndient, additional SDF samples are needed. Given a sampled\npoint xi = (xi, yi, zi), we additionally sample two points\nalong each axis of the canonical coordinate around xi within\na vicinity of a step size of \u03f5. For example, the x-component\nof the surface normal can be found as\n\u2207xf(xi) = f (\u03b3(xi + \u03f5x)) \u2212 f (\u03b3(xi \u2212 \u03f5x))\n2\u03f5\n,\n(8)\nwhere \u03f5x = [\u03f5, 0, 0]. In total, six additional SDF samples are\nrequired for numerical surface normal computation.\n3.3. Progressive Levels of Details\nCoarse-to-fine optimization can better shape the loss land-\nscape to avoid falling into false local minima. Such a strat-\negy has found many applications in computer vision, such\nas image-based registration [19,23,29]. Neuralangelo also\nadopts a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme to reconstruct\nthe surfaces with progressive levels of details. Using nu-\nmerical gradients for the higher-order derivatives naturally\nenables Neuralangelo to perform coarse-to-fine optimization\nfrom two perspectives.\nStep size \u03f5. As previously discussed, numerical gradients\ncan be interpreted as a smoothing operation where the step\nsize \u03f5 controls the resolution and the amount of recovered\ndetails. Imposing Leik with a larger \u03f5 for numerical surface\nnormal computation ensures the surface normal is consistent\nat a larger scale, thus producing consistent and continuous\nsurfaces. On the other hand, imposing Leik with a smaller\n\u03f5 affects a smaller region and avoids smoothing details. In\npractice, we initialize the step size \u03f5 to the coarsest hash grid\nsize and exponentially decrease it matching different hash\ngrid sizes throughout the optimization process.\nHash grid resolution V . If all hash grids are activated from\nthe start of the optimization, to capture geometric details, fine\nhash grids must first \u201cunlearn\u201d from the coarse optimization\nwith large step size \u03f5 and \u201crelearn\u201d with a smaller \u03f5. If such\na process is unsuccessful due to converged optimization,\ngeometric details would be lost. Therefore, we only enable\nan initial set of coarse hash grids and progressively activate\n4\nScan 24\nScan 37\nInput\nNeuS\nNeuralWarp\nOurs\nFigure 3. Qualitative comparison on the DTU benchmark [11]. Neuralangelo produces more accurate and higher-fidelity surfaces.\nfiner hash grids throughout optimization when \u03f5 decreases to\ntheir spatial size. The relearning process can thus be avoided\nto better capture the details. In practice, we also apply weight\ndecay over all parameters to avoid single-resolution features\ndominating the final results.\n3.4. Optimization\nTo further encourage the smoothness of the reconstructed\nsurfaces, we impose a prior by regularizing the mean curva-\nture of SDF. The mean curvature is computed from discrete\nLaplacian similar to the surface normal computation, other-\nwise, the second-order analytical gradients of hash encoding\nare zero everywhere when using trilinear interpolation. The\ncurvature loss Lcurv is defined as:\nLcurv = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\n\f\f\u22072f(xi)\n\f\f .\n(9)\nWe note that the samples used for the surface normal compu-\ntation in Eq. 8 are sufficient for curvature computation.\nThe total loss is defined as the weighted sum of losses:\nL = LRGB + weikLeik + wcurvLcurv .\n(10)\nAll network parameters, including MLPs and hash encoding,\nare trained jointly end-to-end.\n4. Experiments\nDatasets. Following prior work, we conduct experiments on\n15 object-centric scenes of the DTU dataset [11]. Each scene\nhas 49 or 64 images captured by a robot-held monocular\nRGB camera. The ground truth is obtained from a structured-\nlight scanner. We further conduct experiments on 6 scenes\nof the Tanks and Temples dataset [15], including large-scale\nindoor/outdoor scenes. Each scene contains 263 to 1107\nimages captured using a hand-held monocular RGB camera.\nThe ground truth is obtained using a LiDAR sensor.\nImplementation details. Our hash encoding resolution\nspans 25 to 211 with 16 levels. Each hash entry has a chan-\nnel size of 8. The maximum number of hash entries of each\nresolution is 222. We activate 4 and 8 hash resolutions at the\nbeginning of optimization for DTU dataset and Tanks and\nTemples respectively, due to differences in scene scales. We\nenable a new hash resolution every 5000 iterations when the\nstep size \u03f5 equals its grid cell size. For all experiments, we\ndo not utilize auxiliary data such as segmentation or depth\nduring the optimization process.\nEvaluation criteria. We report Chamfer distance and F1\nscore for surface evaluation [11,15]. We use peak signal-to-\nnoise ratio (PSNR) to report image synthesis qualities.\n4.1. DTU Benchmark\nWe show qualitative results in Fig. 3 and quantitative\nresults in Table 1. On average, Neuralangelo achieves the\nlowest Chamfer distance and the highest PSNR, even without\nusing auxiliary inputs. The result suggests that Neuralangelo\nis more generally applicable than prior work when recover-\ning surfaces and synthesizing images, despite not performing\nbest in every individual scene.\nWe further ablate Neuralangelo against the following\nconditions: 1) AG: analytical gradients, 2) AG+P: analytical\ngradients and progressive activating hash resolutions, 3) NG:\nnumerical gradients with varying \u03f5. Fig. 4 shows the results\nqualitatively. AG produces noisy surfaces, even with hash\nresolutions progressively activated (AG+P). NG improves\n5\nInput\nAG\nAG+P\nNG\nNG+P (Ours)\nFigure 4.

Tanks and Temples\nAs no public result is available for Tanks and Temples,\nwe train NeuS [41] and NeuralWarp [3] following our setup.\nWe also report classical multi-view stereo results using\nCOLMAP [31]. As COLMAP and NeuralWarp do not sup-\nport view synthesis, we only report PSNR from NeuS. Re-\nsults are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 2.\nNeuralangelo achieves the highest average PSNR and\nperforms best in terms of F1 score. Comparing against\nNeuS [41], we can recover high-fidelity surfaces with intri-\ncate details. We find that the dense surfaces generated from\nCOLMAP are sensitive to outliers in the sparse point cloud.\nWe also find that NeuralWarp often predicts surfaces for the\nsky and backgrounds potentially due to their color rendering\nscheme following VolSDF [47]. The additional surfaces pre-\ndicted for backgrounds are counted as outliers and worsen\nF1 scores significantly. We instead follow NeuS [41] and\nuse an additional network [53] to model the background.\nSimilar to the DTU results, using the analytical gradient\nproduces noisy surfaces and thus leads to a low F1 score.\nWe further note that the reconstruction of Courthouse shown\nin Figs. 1 and 5 are the same building of different sides,\ndemonstrating the capability of Neuralangelo for large-scale\ngranular reconstruction.\n4.3. Level of Details\nAs Neuralangelo progressively optimizes the hash fea-\ntures of increasing resolution, we inspect the progressive\nlevel of details similar to NGLOD [37].

The ability to recover missing surfaces demon-\nstrates the advantages of our spatial hierarchy-free design.\nMoreover, we note that flat surfaces are predicted at suf-\nficiently high resolutions (around Level 8 in this example).\nThus, only relying on the continuity of local cells of coarse\nresolutions is not sufficient to reconstruct large continuous\nsurfaces. The result motivates the use of the numerical\ngradients for the higher-order derivatives, such that back-\npropagation is beyond local grid cells.\n7\nLevel 4, \ud835\udc494 =74 \nLevel 8, \ud835\udc498 =223 \nLevel 12, \ud835\udc4912 =676 \nLevel 16, \ud835\udc4916 = 2048\nFigure 6.

Without Lcurv, we find that\nthe surfaces tend to have undesirable sharp transitions. By\nusing Lcurv, the surface noises are removed.\nTopology warmup. We follow prior work and initialize\nthe SDF approximately as a sphere [48]. With an initial\nspherical shape, using Lcurv also makes concave shapes diffi-\ncult to form because Lcurv preserves topology by preventing\nsingularities in curvature. Thus, instead of applying Lcurv\nfrom the beginning of the optimization process, we use a\nshort warmup period that linearly increases the curvature\nloss strength. We find this strategy particularly helpful for\nconcave regions, as shown in Fig. 7(b).\n5. Conclusion\nWe introduce Neuralangelo, an approach for photogram-\nmetric neural surface reconstruction. The findings of Neu-\nralangelo are simple yet effective: using numerical gradients\nfor higher-order derivatives and a coarse-to-fine optimization\nstrategy. Neuralangelo unlocks the representation power of\nmulti-resolution hash encoding for neural surface reconstruc-\ntion modeled as SDF. We show that Neuralangelo effectively\nrecovers dense scene structures of both object-centric cap-\ntures and large-scale indoor/outdoor scenes with extremely\nhigh fidelity, enabling detailed large-scale scene reconstruc-\ntion from RGB videos. Our method currently samples pixels\nfrom images randomly without tracking their statistics and\nerrors. Therefore, we use long training iterations to reduce\nthe stochastics and ensure sufficient sampling of details. It is\nour future work to explore a more efficient sampling strategy\nto accelerate the training process.\n8\nAcknowledgements.

Additional Hyper-parameters\nFollowing prior work [41,47,48], we assume the region of\ninterest is inside a unit sphere. The total number of training\niterations is 500k. When a given hash resolution is not active,\nwe set the feature vectors to zero. We use a learning rate of\n1 \u00d7 10\u22123 with a linear warmup of 5k iterations. We decay\nthe learning rate by a factor of 10 at 300k and 400k. We\nuse AdamW [22] optimizer with a weight decay of 10\u22122.\nWe set weik = 0.1. The curvature regularization strength\nwcurv linearly warms up 5\u00d7 10\u22124 following the schedule of\nlearning rate and decays by the same spacing factor between\nhash resolutions every time \u03f5 decreases. The SDF MLP\nhas one layer, while the color MLP has four layers. For\nthe DTU benchmark, we follow prior work [41,47,48] and\nuse a batch size of 1. For the Tanks and Temples dataset,\nwe use a batch size of 16. We use the marching cubes\nalgorithm [21] to convert predicted SDF to triangular meshes.\nThe marching cubes resolution is set to 512 for the DTU\nbenchmark following prior work [3,41,47,48] and 2048 for\nthe Tanks and Temples dataset.\nB. Additional In-the-wild Results\nWe present additional in-the-wild results collected at the\nNVIDIA HQ Park and Johns Hopkins University in Figure 8.\nThe videos are captured by a consumer drone. The camera\nintrinsics and poses are recovered using COLMAP [31]. To\ndefine the bounding regions, we have developed an open-\nsourced Blender add-on1 to allow users interactively se-\nlect regions of interest using the sparse point cloud from\nCOLMAP. The surfaces are reconstructed using the same\nsetup and hyperparameters as the Tanks and Temples dataset.\nNeuralangelo successfully reconstructs complex geometries\nand scene details, such as the buildings, sculptures, trees, um-\nbrellas, walkways, and etc. Using the same setup as Tanks\nand Temples also suggests that Neuralangelo is generalizable\nwith the proposed set of hyper-parameters.\nC. Additional Tanks and Temples Results\nWe present additional results on the Tanks and Temples\ndataset [15] in this section.\nSurface reconstruction. Concurrent with our work, Geo-\nNeuS [5] uses the sparse point clouds from COLMAP [31]\nto improve the surface quality. However, we find that in\n1https://github.com/mli0603/BlenderNeuralangelo\nF1 Score \u2191\nNeuS [41]\nGeo-Neus [5]\nOurs\nBarn\n0.29\n0.33\n0.70\nCaterpillar\n0.29\n0.26\n0.36\nCourthouse\n0.17\n0.12\n0.28\nIgnatius\n0.83\n0.72\n0.89\nMeetingroom\n0.24\n0.20\n0.32\nTruck\n0.45\n0.45\n0.48\nMean\n0.38\n0.35\n0.50\nTable 3.

Best viewed in color.\nlarge-scale in-the-wild scenes, the COLMAP point clouds\nare often noisy, even after filtering. Using the noisy point\nclouds may degrade the results, similarly observed in [51].\nAs evidence, we benchmark Geo-NeuS [5] on Tanks and\nTemples (Table 3). We find that Geo-NeuS performs worse\nthan NeuS and Neuralangelo in most scenes.\nRGB image synthesis. Due to similarities between adja-\ncent video frames, we report PSNR by sub-sampling 10\ntimes input video temporally and evaluating the sub-sampled\nvideo frames. Qualitative comparison of Neuralangelo and\nprior work NeuS [41] is shown in Fig 9. Neuralangelo\nproduces high-fidelity renderings compared to NeuS [41],\nwith details on the buildings and objects recovered. Neither\nCOLMAP [31] nor NeuralWarp [3] supports view synthesis\nor accounts for view-dependent effects. Thus, we only re-\nport the F1 score of the reconstructed surfaces for these two\napproaches.\nD. Additional DTU Results\nWe present additional results on the DTU benchmark [11]\nin this section.\nSurface reconstruction. We visualize the reconstructed\nsurfaces of additional scenes of the DTU benchmark. Quali-\ntative comparison with NeuS [41] and NeuralWarp [3] are\nshown in Fig. 10.\nCompared to prior work, Neuralangelo not only can recon-\nstruct smoother surfaces such as in Scan 40, 63, and 69 but\nChamfer distance (mm) \u2193\nIDR masks\nOur masks\nNeuS [41]\n1.48\n0.99\nNeuralWarp [3]\n1.20\n0.73\nOurs\n1.29\n0.76\nTable 4.

While\nNeuralangelo performs better on average across scenes, we\nnote that the qualitative result of Neuralangelo does not im-\nprove significantly in Scan 122, where the object of interest\nhas mostly diffuse materials and relatively simple textures.\nMoreover, we find that Neuralangelo fails to recover details\ncompared to NeuS [41] when the scene is highly reflective,\nsuch as Scan 69.

Future work\non improving the robustness of Neuralangelo in reflective\nscenes, a drawback inherited from hash encoding, can further\ngeneralize the application of Neuralangelo.\nRGB image synthesis. In the paper, we report the PSNR re-\nsult of Neuralangelo to quantify the image synthesis quality.\nDue to the simplicity of the background, we only evaluate\nthe PSNR of the foreground objects given the object masks.\nWe visualize the rendered images in Fig. 11. We only choose\nNeuS [41] as our baseline as NeuralWarp [3] does not gener-\nate rendered images.\nFig. 11 shows that Neuralangelo successfully renders\nthe detailed textures while NeuS produces overly smoothed\nimages. The results suggest that Neuralangelo is able to\nproduce high-fidelity renderings and capture details better.\nDTU foreground mask. The foreground object masks are\nused to remove the background for proper evaluation [3,28,\n41,48,52] on the DTU benchmark. We follow the evaluation\nprotocol of NeuralWarp [3] and dilate the object masks by\n12 pixels. In all prior work, the foreground object masks\nused are annotated and provided by the authors of IDR [48].\nHowever, we find that the provided masks are imperfect in\nScan 83. Fig. 12 shows that part of the object is annotated as\nbackground. The masks provided by IDR also only include\nthe foreground objects while the ground truth point clouds\ninclude the brick holding the objects. Thus, we manually\nannotate Scan 83 and report the updated results in Table 4 for\nadditional comparison. We note that fixing the object masks\nfor Scan 83 leads to improved results across all methods.\nE. Additional Ablations\nWe conduct additional ablations and summarize the re-\nsults in this section.\nColor network. For the Tanks and Temples dataset, we add\nper-image latent embedding to the color network following\nNeRF-W [24] to model the exposure variation across frames.\nQualitative results are shown in Fig. 13. After introducing\nthe per-image embedding, the floating objects used to explain\nexposure variation have been greatly reduced.\nCurvature regularization strength. The curvature regular-\nization adds a smoothness prior to the optimization. As the\nstep size \u03f5 decreases and finer hash grids are activated, finer\ndetails may be smoothed if the curvature regularization is too\nstrong. To avoid loss of details, we scale down the curvature\nregularization strength by the spacing factor between hash\nresolutions each time the step size \u03f5 decreases. Details are\nbetter preserved by decaying wcurv (Fig. 14).\nNumerical v.s analytical gradient. We visualize in Fig. 15\nthe surface normals computed by using both numerical and\nanalytical gradients after the optimization finishes. At the\nend of the optimization, the step size \u03f5 has decreased suf-\nficiently small to the grid size of the finest hash resolution.\nUsing numerical gradients is nearly identical to using an-\nalytical gradients. Fig. 15 shows that the surface normals\ncomputed from both numerical and analytical gradients are\nindeed qualitatively similar, with negligible errors scattered\nacross the object.\nColor network. By default, we follow prior work [41,48]\nand predict color conditioned on view direction, surface nor-\nmal, point location, and features from the SDF MLP. We\nuse spherical harmonics following [49] to encode view di-\nrection as it provides meaningful interpolation in the angular\ndomain. When the data is captured with exposure varia-\ntion in the wild, such as the Tanks and Temples dataset,\nwe further add per-image appearance encoding following\nNeRF-W [24].\nWe have also implemented a more explicit color modeling\nprocess. The color network is shown in Fig. 16, attempting\nto better disentangle color-shape ambiguities. However, we\ndo not observe improvements in surface qualities using such\na decomposition design. The intrinsic decomposed color net-\nwork contains two branches \u2013 albedo and shading branches.\nThe final rendered image C \u2208 R3 is the sum of the albedo\nimage Ca and shading image Cs:\nC = \u03a6(Ca + Cs),\n(11)\nwhere \u03a6 is the Sigmoid function to normalize the predictions\ninto the range of 0 to 1.\nThe albedo branch predicts RGB values Ca \u2208 R3 that\nare view-invariant. It receives point locations and features\nfrom the SDF MLP as input. On the other hand, the shading\nbranch predicts gray values Cs \u2208 R that is view dependent\nto capture reflection, varying shadow, and exposure changes.\nWe opt for the single channel design for the shading branch\nas specular highlights, exposure variations, and moving shad-\nows are often intensity changes [30]. The single-channel\ngray color design also encourages the albedo branch to learn\nthe view-invariant color better as the shading branch is lim-\nited in its capacity. Other than the point locations and SDF\nMLP features, the shading branch is additionally conditioned\non reflection direction and view direction following RefN-\neRF [40] to encourage better shape recovery. We use two\nhidden layers for the albedo branch and two hidden layers\nfor the diffuse branch to make a fair comparison with the\ndefault color network proposed by IDR [48].\nWe find that with the decomposed color network, the\nshading branch indeed successfully explains view-dependent\neffects (Fig. 16). However, flat surfaces tend to be carved\naway, potentially due to the instability of dot product from re-\nflection computation (Fig. 17). Our future work will explore\nmore principled ways for intrinsic color decomposition.\n14\nRGB image\nSegmentation mask \n(IDR)\nSegmentation mask \n(Ours) \nGround truth point cloud\nScan 83\nFigure 12. We manually re-annotate the foreground object masks of the DTU dataset. We note that the object masks provided by IDR\nmiss the objects partially on Scan 83. The IDR masks also do not include the bricks holding objects, while ground truth point clouds have\nthe brick. Our updated segmentation masks fix the above issues for better evaluation.\nInput\nw/ image embedding\nw/o image embedding\nFigure 13.

For inference time, both\nours and AG are more than 2 times faster than NeuS.\ntion in PyTorch. The experiments are conducted on NVIDIA\nV100 GPUs. We note that the training time per iteration\nwhen using numerical gradients is longer than using ana-\nlytical gradients due to additional queries of SDF. Using\nnumerical gradients experiences approximately a 1.2 times\nslowdown compared to using analytical gradients. As NeuS\nuses 8-layer MLP for SDF MLP and Neuralangelo uses\n1-layer MLP, using numerical gradients is still faster than\nNeuS [41]. We also compare the inference time for surface\nextraction of 1283 resolution. As numerical gradients are\nused only for training, the speed for NG and AG are the same.\nNG and AG are more than 2 times faster than NeuS [41] due\nto the shallow MLP.\nF. Derivation of Frequency Encoding\nIn the paper, we show that using analytical gradients for\nhigher-order derivatives of multi-resolution hash encoding\nsuffers from gradient locality. We show in this section that\nFourier frequency encoding [38], which empowers prior\nwork [41,47,48] on neural surface reconstruction, does not\nsuffer from such locality issue.\nGiven a 3D position xi, let the l-th Fourier frequency\nencoding be\n\u03b3l(xi) =\n\u0000sin(2l\u03c0xi), cos(2l\u03c0xi)\n\u0001\n.\n(12)\n15\nPoint location\nSDF features\nAlbedo branch\nShading branch\n\u03a6(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e),\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e \u2208 \u211d3\n\u03a6 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc60 \u2208 \u211d\n\ud835\udc36 = \u03a6 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc36 \u2208 \u211d3\nReflection direction\nView direction\nAppearance encoding\n(Optional)\nFigure 16.

Qualitative comparison of different color network designs. We find that the intrinsic decomposition we implemented lacks\nsmoothness in regions with homogeneous color, while the color network proposed by IDR [48] produces smooth surfaces.\nThe derivative of \u03b3l(xi) w.r.t. position can thus be calculated\nas\n\u2202\u03b3l(xi)\n\u2202xi\n=\n\u00002l\u03c0 \u00b7 cos(2l\u03c0xi), \u22122l\u03c0 \u00b7 sin(2l\u03c0xi)\n\u0001\n.\n(13)\nWe note that \u2202\u03b3l(xi)\n\u2202xi\nis continuous across the space, and\nthus does not suffer from the gradient locality issue as the\nmulti-resolution hash encoding. Moreover, the position xi\nis present in the derivative, thus allowing for second-order\nderivatives computation w.r.t. position for the curvature reg-\nularization.\nWhile Fourier frequencies encoding is continuous, our\ncoarse-to-fine optimization with varying step size in theory\nstill anneals over the different frequencies when computing\nhigher-order derivatives for more robust optimization. We\nexperiment this idea on the DTU benchmark [11] and ob-\nserved an improved Chamfer distance: from 0.84 to 0.79.\nThe improvement in surface reconstruction confirms the ben-\nefits of using a coarse-to-fine optimization framework.\nReferences\n[1] Jonathan T Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Matthew Tancik, Peter\nHedman, Ricardo Martin-Brualla, and Pratul P Srinivasan.\nMip-nerf: A multiscale representation for anti-aliasing neural\nradiance fields.

This issue is often\nattributed to exposure bias \u2013 the difference between how a model is trained, and\nhow it is used during inference. Denoising diffusion models provide an alternative\napproach in which a model can revisit and revise its output. However, they can be\ncomputationally expensive and prior efforts on text have led to models that produce\nless fluent output compared to autoregressive models, especially for longer text\nand paragraphs. In this paper, we propose PLANNER, a model that combines\nlatent semantic diffusion with autoregressive generation, to generate fluent text\nwhile exercising global control over paragraphs. The model achieves this by\ncombining an autoregressive \u201cdecoding\u201d module with a \u201cplanning\u201d module that\nuses latent diffusion to generate semantic paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner. The proposed method is evaluated on various conditional generation tasks,\nand results on semantic generation, text completion and summarization show its\neffectiveness in generating high-quality long-form text in an efficient manner.\n1\nIntroduction\nFT (Top-p sampling): Terrible, awful hotel.

Right: the\nmost frequent first n-grams of the generations for each method, derived from 512 generation roll-outs.\nOur proposed method results in a more diversified generation robust to the ill-composed prompt.\nAutoregressive models trained with a teacher forcing strategy (Williams & Zipser, 1989) are con-\nsidered the gold standard for text generation. However, a significant drawback of this approach is\nthat it lacks the ability to correct any mistakes made during the generation process which can lead to\nerrors that accumulate as the generation progresses. Previous work (Ott et al., 2018; Holtzman et al.,\n2019; Welleck et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022) has observed that deterministic decoding methods have a\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2306.02531v2  [cs.CL]  27 Oct 2023\ntendency to generate consecutive repetitions at the word, phrase and sentence levels. For example,\nwith repetitive prompt, the model can enter an absorbing state where it produces repetitive outputs\nwith higher and higher confidence by self-reinforcing the pattern (Xu et al., 2022) (Fig. 1). Through\nour experiments, we have observed that such degeneration is more prevalent in open-ended tasks that\nallow the model greater freedom for creativity. Even for large language models, the generation can\ndrift away from the desired semantics, especially when the model is poorly prompted or has high\ninitial probabilities (Xu et al., 2022).\nWhy does using maximum likelihood decoding lead to repetitions during generation which is\nsignificantly different from the training data distribution? One possible explanation for this is\n\u201cexposure bias\u201d (Bengio et al., 2015) arising from the discrepancy between the training and inference\nphases in the teacher forcing training strategy. During training phase, the model focuses only on\npredicting the next token. However, during inference, predicting the next token alone can be myopic\nbecause the model may not have enough foresight to anticipate its impact on future generation. This\ncan also be seen as the \u201cdistribution shift\u201d issue of behavior cloning (de Haan et al., 2019), where\nthe model is trained to mimic the expert\u2019s actions on the states encountered by the expert in the\ntraining data. However, small differences between the model and the expert can compound over\nmultiple steps, leading the model to states it never encountered during training, rendering unreliable\nand undesirable predictions.\nAlthough many approaches have been proposed to address this issue, such as adversarial models\n(Yu et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017), reinforcement learning (Li et al., 2016b) or\nrepetition penalties (Xu et al., 2022) , they attempt to improve the global aspects of the generation by\nmaking local adjustments which still follow the autoregressive generation recipe. Diffusion models\nprovide an alternative solution \u2013 the model can revisit and revise its output iteratively, potentially\nrendering more global control of the generation in a non-autoregressive manner. However, these text\ndiffusion models can generate less fluent text compared to autoregressive ones (Gong et al., 2023).\nAlso, when generating long text, the diffusion process involves multiple passes of the underlying\ndenoising model over a long generation length, making it computationally expensive. The discrete\nnature of text also presents a challenge for diffusion models, which can suffer from \u201crounding errors\u201d\nwhen converting between the text token and its embedding (Li et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022).\nInstead of performing diffusion on the original text or the corresponding word embeddings, we\npropose to apply diffusion techniques to the latent semantic space (Rombach et al., 2022; Lovelace\net al., 2022). To achieve this, we learn a fixed number of continuous semantic tokens that encode\nsalient information at the paragraph level. These tokens can then be used to reconstruct the original\ntext. The latent diffusion can be additionally conditioned on an external signal to generate the\nsemantic tokens. Finally, a decoder maps the obtained semantic tokens back to the raw text space.\nThis process combines a non-autoregressive semantic diffusion approach with an autoregressive\ndecoding technique. The semantic diffusion process handles the \u201cplanning\u201d, enabling the modification\nof semantics in a coarse-to-fine manner, while the decoder handles the \u201cdecoding\u201d by translating the\nsemantics into raw text, with less flexibility in controlling the meaning. We call our proposed method\nPLANNER (Paragraph-leveL DiffusioN model for Embedding Representation).\nOur contributions include: (i) We propose a latent semantic diffusion model for paragraphs that\nincorporates both non-autoregressive semantic diffusion and autoregressive generation. This allows\nus to generate fluent text while being able to exercise global control inherited from a diffusion model.\n(ii) We study the essential requirements for a good latent space for paragraph diffusion models.\n(iii) We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on various conditional generation tasks.\nThanks to the iterative refinement of desnoising diffusion, our method enjoys less repetitive and more\ndiverse generation, while maintaining good fluency and relevancy, comparing with autoregressive\nand text diffusion baselines (Li et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022).\n2\nPreliminary\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models\nThe standard diffusion model (DM) (Ho et al., 2020; Song &\nErmon, 2019) learns the data distribution p(x) by gradually denoising a normally distributed variable\nin a Markov chain of length T. The diffusion process can be viewed as a continuous-time stochastic\nprocess (Song et al., 2021b; Kingma et al., 2021) where the initial data point x \u2208 RN is progressively\ncorrupted by noise according to a predefined signal-noise schedule {\u03b1t,\u03c3t}, resulting in time-\n2\ndependent corrupted data {xt\u2223t \u2208 [0,1],x0 = x}. The transition distribution is given by:\nq(xt\u2223xs) = N(xt;\u03b1t\u2223sxs,\u03c32\nt\u2223sI),\n(1)\nwhere \u03b1t\u2223s = \u03b1t/\u03b1s,\u03c32\nt\u2223s = \u03c32\nt \u2212 \u03b12\nt\u2223s\u03c32\ns, and s < t. When xs = x, the marginal distribution q(xt\u2223x)\nis given as q(xt\u2223x) = N(xt;\u03b1tx,\u03c32\nt I). The diffusion model relies on a parametric function \u03b8\noptimized to reverse the diffusion process by denoising xt to the clean input x. The model is trained\nusing a weighted reconstruction loss:\nL(\u03b8) = Ext\u223cq(xt\u2223x),t\u223c[0,1] [\u03c9t \u22c5 \u2225F\u03b8(xt,t) \u2212 x\u22252\n2],\n(2)\nwhere \u03c9t = \u03b12\nt /\u03c32\nt ,(s.t. \u03b12\nt + \u03c32\nt = 1) is the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and F\u03b8(\u22c5) denotes the\nbackbone denoising function. Sampling from the learned model can be performed using either\nancestral sampling (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020) or a deterministic DDIM sampler (Song et al., 2021a).\nWhile the DM is capable of generating high-quality samples, the fact that the corrupted data xt shares\nthe same space as the input x results in inefficient training (Jing et al., 2022) and difficulty in learning\nabstract and semantically meaningful latent spaces (Preechakul et al., 2022).\nLatent Diffusion Models\nTo improve the efficiency, the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) (Rombach\net al., 2022) introduces an explicit separation between the compressive and generative learning phases\nof training diffusion models. It employs an autoencoding model consisting of an encoder E(\u22c5) and\na decoder D(\u22c5) to learn a low-dimensional latent space that is perceptually equivalent to the image\nspace when decoded, but with reduced computational complexity, while retaining the perceptual\nquality of generated samples. The reweighted objective for training LDM is given by:\nL(\u03b8) = Ezt\u223cq(zt\u2223z),z=E(x),t\u223c[0,1] [\u03c9t \u22c5 \u2225F\u03b8(zt,t) \u2212 z\u22252\n2],\n(3)\nwhere z is obtained from E during training. The generated z can be decoded to image using D.\n3\nRelated Work\nText diffusion models\nEarly attempts on using diffusion models for discrete data used a noising\nprocesses which masked or randomly mutated the discrete tokens (Austin et al., 2021; Hoogeboom\net al., 2021). Recently, Diff-LM (Li et al., 2022) and DiffuSeq (Gong et al., 2023) have instead\nused a continuous token embedding space, converting the continuous token embeddings to text via\n\"rounding\". Analog Bits (Chen et al., 2022) converts raw text into a set of bits and models them as\nanalog bits with a continuous diffusion model. (Lovelace et al., 2022) performed diffusion model on\nthe contextualized BART embeddings rather than on the word embedding space. (Zhu et al., 2022)\nhas applied text diffusion to image-captioning and achieved good performance.\nHowever, existing text diffusion models present several issues: (i) The varying length of the input text\nnecessitates the prediction of additional length or superfluous paddings, and (ii) token generation in\nparallel may result in disfluent text and/or frequent repetitions especially when the generation is long.\nWe instead employ the diffusion model to learn paragraph embeddings that contain fewer fixed-sized\ntokens, which allows for computational benefits and improved fluency.\nText Variational Autoencoders\nText VAEs (Bowman et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018; Li et al.,\n2020) have been particularly useful for learning a smooth and interpretable representation space, as\nwell as for generating diverse text. However, one of the challenges is the KL vanishing problem\n(Bowman et al., 2016), which results in the decoder disregarding the latent code sampled from the\nprior distribution during the inference stage. Our approach can be perceived as to address this issue\nby leveraging a more flexible prior distribution to ensure the codes can strongly influence the output\ntext distribution.\n4\nPLANNER: A Language Diffusion Model on Paragraph Embeddings\nWe use latent diffusion to improve the diversity and fluency of paragraphs generated from the model.\nOur model comprises two parts (Fig. 2) - a paragraph embedder via variational autoencoder (VAE)\nthat learns a meaningful and smooth latent space that corresponds to the original text space, and a\ndiffusion model that generates latent codes corresponding to the semantics of longer text.\n3\nz(1)\n\u2026\nz(k)\nx1\nx2\nx3\n\u2026\nxL\nBOS\nx1\n\u2026\nxL\nx1\n\u2026\nxL\nEOS\nPlan\nTransformer Model\nTransformer Model\ny1\n\u2026\nThe

Paragraph Embedder\nLatent Diffusion Model\nFigure 2: Model overview. Left: a variational paragraph embedder is learned to encode paragraph\ninto a fixed amount of latent codes. Right: the latent diffusion model based on transformer block is\napplied to generate the latent codes. The decoder finally translates them into the text. (BOS: Begin of\nSentence token, EOS: End of Sentence token)\n4.1\nLearning a Variational Paragraph Embedder\nInstead of applying diffusion to tokens directly to generate long text, we propose to learn a set of\nlatent codes z = {z(1),\u22ef,z(k)} \u2208 Rk\u00d7h, which we call paragraph embeddings, that capture the\nsemantics in the target text (of length up to 512 tokens), where h denotes the embedding dimension.\nThese paragraph embeddings have shorter length, such as k = 16, than the original text.\nTo obtain such embeddings z, we train a transformer-based encoder-decoder model. The architecture\nused for the autoencoder is shown in Fig. 2. The encoder E and decoder D construct a bidirectional\nmapping between the discrete data space and the latent code space. The paragraph embeddings z are\nextracted by taking the first k hidden state vectors of dimension h from the final layer of E, which are\nfed into the initial steps of the decoder which is trained to reconstruct the original text. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that the paragraph embeddings share the same hidden dimension h as the word embeddings,\nand forming a manifold in the word embedding space. Pretrained BERT and GPT-2 models are used\nto initialize E and D, respectively. The manifold of the learned embeddings ideally possesses several\ndesirable properties, including low conversion error, local smoothness and distributional smoothness.\nConversion error\nIdeally, the original input x can be perfectly reconstructed via \u02c6x = D(z),z =\nE(x), and modeling the lower-dimensional continuous space p(z) is equivalent to modeling p(x).\nHowever, in practice a loss of information can occur when converting raw text into paragraph\nembeddings or when doing the reverse. We assess the conversion loss by computing the BLEU score\n(BLEUclean) between the input x and the reconstruction \u02c6x.\nLocal smoothness\nTo generate target text that is fluent and consistent with the corresponding\nparagraph embeddings, it is essential to achieve a certain level of local smoothness in the paragraph\nembeddings space. Ideally, a slight variation in the input vector x would not cause a significant\nchange in the resulting encoded vector E(x). Similarly, a small perturbation in the latent vector z\nshould not lead to a significant change in the decoded vector D(z). Otherwise, the error accumulated\nin the diffusion process when generating z could result in an inaccurate realization of the desired\nsemantics. To accomplish this, the denoising autoencoder is trained by substituting (Sub) input tokens\nwith random tokens with probability p. The local smoothness is measured using the BLEU score\n(BLEUrobust) between the input x and the denoising output from corrupted input D(E(\u02dcx)), where\n\u02dcx = Sub(x,p = 0.3). The level of injected noise will affect both the conversion error and the local\nsmoothness, and it is important to strike a balance between the two.\nDistributional Smoothness\nThe diffusion model may face difficulty in learning a distribution, p(z),\nthat is highly multimodal, or has density that are associated with a large Lipchitz constant (i.e., has\nabrupt changes). Therefore, we employ a text VAE (Bowman et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020) to encourage\nthe posterior to take on a form close to a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we parameterize q(z\u2223x) to\nbe N(E\u00b5,E\u03bd) and maximize the objective L(E,D;x) = Eq(z\u2223x)[log p(x\u2223z)]\u2212\u03b2 \u22c5KL(q(z\u2223x)\u2223\u2223p(z)).\nHere E\u00b5 and E\u03bd represent the posterior mean and variance predictions of the encoder E, while the\n4\nhyperparameter \u03b2 controls the strength of regularization. It is typically set to a small value to alleviate\nthe notorious posterior collapsing issue (Bowman et al., 2016) in text VAE. To gauge the distributional\nsmoothness of the paragraph embedding space, we select two examples, x and x\u2032 at random from the\ntraining set and interpolate their embeddings to compute zINT = 1\n2E(x) + 1\n2E(x\u2032). We then evaluate\nthe perplexity (PPLint) of the decoded interpolation D(zINT) using a GPT-2 model.\n4.2\nPlanning then Decoding: A Latent Diffusion Model for Paragraph Embeddings\nTraining phase\nWe now use the learned mean paragraph embeddings z = E\u00b5(x) to train a\ncontinuous-time latent diffusion model as in Fig. 2 while keeping E and D frozen. We conducted\nexperiments using two types of conditioning signal: (i) class labels, such as positive or negative\nsentiment labels, and (ii) raw text, such as preceding context or the document to be summarized.\nFor class labels, we learned a label embedding y \u2208 Rh to represent each class. For the raw text, we\napplied a conditional feature encoder \u03c4 to the input and used the hidden states at the last layer as\ny \u2208 Rc\u00d7h, where c represents the number of feature embeddings.\nDuring training, we gradually add noise to z via a cosine scheduler (Ho et al., 2020), and use a\nsignal prediction scheme as the training objective (Kingma et al., 2021). For our denoising backbone\nmodel F (\u22c5), we use a transformer block similar to the one in the DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2022) model.\nSpecifically, we fed y and the time embedding t \u2208 Rh into the model through two channels, namely\ncross-attention and adaptive layer norm (adaLN) (Peebles & Xie, 2022). For the cross-attention, the\nconditional embeddings t and y are concatenated into a sequence of length c + 1. The transformer\nblock is modified to enable multi-head cross-attention to the conditional embeddings.\nFor the adaLN, we flattened and projected y to a vector of Rh using a linear projection layer. We\nthen added the projected y to the time embedding t. Instead of directly learning dimension-wise\nscale and shift parameters (\u03b2 and \u03b3) in the standard Layer Norm (LN), these parameters are regressed\nfrom the sum of the embeddings. In addition, dimension-wise scaling parameters \u03b1 are regressed and\napplied immediately before any residual connections within the transformer block. This has been\nshown to be efficient and effective in image diffusion models (Peebles & Xie, 2022).\nInference phase\nDuring the inference process, we start with random Gaussian embeddings and use\na fixed number of steps T to generate the final z. The resulting embeddings are then used as inputs\nfor D to generate the text using a deterministic decoding method like greedy decoding 1. We provide\ndiscussion and ablation study on using stochastic decoding in the App. C\nWe applied the classifier-free guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2021) during the inference steps.\nAfter each step, we apply a dynamic thresholding technique that was introduced in Imagen (Saharia\net al., 2022) for post-processing. However, we do not use the rescaling step in Imagen because\nrescaling step can completely alter the underlying semantics, as we have not imposed any constraints\nto ensure that the generated output remains the same after rescaling the latent code. In contrast, for\nImagen, where the generation takes place in the raw pixel space, rescaling will predominantly retain\nthe shape information while altering only the contrast and brightness.\n5\nExperimental Setups\nWe tested the effectiveness of our model in three different conditional generation tasks including\nsentiment-guided generation, long-form text completion, and summarization. The tasks can require\ngenerating text of hundreds of tokens in length, making them suitable to assess model performance.\nDatasets\nFor the Sentiment-guided generation task, we used the TripAdvisor dataset provided by\n(Li et al., 2014). By exclusively selecting reviews with a rating of 1 or 5 and balancing the two ratings\nvia subsampling, we acquired 218,509 reviews. For the text completion task, our model was assessed\non two datasets: 1) the aforementioned TripAdvisor review dataset with postprocessing to remove\nreviews that are less than 20 or more than 512 tokens, result in 690,862 samples, and 2) one-tenth of\nthe overall C4 datasets (Raffel et al., 2020), which contains 36.5M samples. For each sample, we\nextracted the initial two sentences from a paragraph as source context, and predicted the remainder\nof the text as target. The datasets were partitioned into training, validation, and test in the ratios of\n1The aim of D is to accurately convert the z into a meaningful text, thus deterministic decoding is desirable.\n5\n(0.96,0.02,0.02). For the summarization task, we use CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and\nXSum (Narayan et al., 2018).\nAutomatic Evaluation Metrics\nFollowing previous work (Gong et al., 2023), we assess the fluency\nof the generation by computing the perplexity (PPL) under a GPT-2 large model. We use Ent-n\n(Zhang et al., 2018) and DIST-n (Li et al., 2016a) and self-BLEU (S-BL) (Zhu et al., 2018) to\nevaluate lexical diversity. We present DIST-n and Ent-n metrics solely at n = 1 owing to their strong\ncorrelation of the varying n values. We use REP-n to assess the extent of repetition in the generation\nfollowing previous work (Welleck et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). For relevancy we use standard\nmetrics following (Gong et al., 2023), including SacreBLEU (BL) (Post, 2018), ROUGE-L (R-L)\n(Lin, 2004) and BERTScore (Score) (Zhang et al., 2019). Details are provided in App. F.\nAuBLEU: Evaluating Denoising Capability Our proposed model is a latent diffusion model, which\ndiffers from text diffusion models that operate directly on text or text embedding space. To comparing\nthe denoising ability across different text diffusion models, we introduce a novel metric, named\nAuBLEU (AuBL). To compute the AuBLEU score, we first add varying levels of noise to each input\ntext x by performing diffusion at T different time steps t0 < t1 < \u22ef < tT , corresponding to a series of\nSNR \u03c9t0 > \u22ef > \u03c9tT . Next, we pass each corrupted input under different \u03c9 to the denoising backbone\nmodel and obtain the predicted output \u02c6xi = F (xti). We then compute the BLEU score between\neach (\u02c6xi,x) pairs and plot a curve with the x-axis representing \u03b12 =\n\u03c9\n1+\u03c9, where \u03b12 is monotonically\nincreasing with \u03c9 and ranges from (0,1), and the y-axis indicating the corresponding BLEU score.\nFinally, we compute the area under curve to obtain the AuBLEU score (see App. D for more details).\nModel Setups\nWe used the BERT-large and GPT-medium models as initialization for the encoder\nE and decoder D respectively. The embedding dimension h was 1024, and the number of paragraph\nembeddings k was set to 16, as increasing the number did not result in significant improvement in\nperformance. We provide more analysis on the impact of k in App. A.2 The learning rate was set\nto 2e \u2212 4, and \u03b2 was set to 5e \u2212 6. For the latent diffusion model, the channel size was set to 1024\nto match the embedding dimension h, and the number of heads was set to 16 with 28 transformer\nlayers. The total size of the latent diffusion model was 533M. The feature encoder \u03c4 was also jointly\nlearned, and was initialized with a T5-large encoder. We use DDIM throughout our experiments\nas it shows better performance than DDPM. In all our experiments, we use 30 diffusion steps to\ngenerate the final z , which strikes a good balance among the efficiency, diversity and relevance.\nIn comparison, Diff-LM (Li et al., 2022) and Genie (Lin et al., 2022) report to use 200 steps and\n2000 steps respectively to generate high-quality text. We set the CFG weights to be 2 and 5 for text\ncompletion and summarization tasks, respectively, based on generation performance on validation\nset. For summarization task, we also incorporate a shift noise scheduler based on (Hoogeboom et al.,\n2023). More details, including ablations on DDPM, number of diffusion steps and noise scheduler,\nare provided in App. F.\nFigure 3: Impact of the proportion of in-\njected noise for learning Paragraph Em-\nbeddings on XSum dataset. Large substi-\ntution noise results in worse BLEUclean\nbut better BLEUrobust and PPLint.\nBaselines\nWe compare our method with several baseline\nmethods trained under Teacher Forcing scheme, includ-\ning decoder-only Autoregressive LM finetuned on GPT-2\n(FT), encoder-decoder (Enc-Dec) transformer model, and\nVaritional Information Bottleneck (VIB) (Alemi et al.,\n2016). We initialized the FT model using GPT-2 large\n(774M), whereas encoder and decoder in the Enc-Dec/VIB\nmodels (695M/697M) are initialized with bert-large and\nGPT-medium, respectively. All the considered models are\nfinetuned on the target datasets. We follow Li et al. (2022)\nto report the FT baselines with two decoding strategies,\ntop-p sampling (K=50, p=0.92) and beam search (beam\nwidth 4), denoted as FT-sample and FT-search. We use\ntop-p sampling for Enc-Dec/VIB generation. For summa-\nrization tasks, we finetune a T5-large model (770M) on\nthe target datasets as baselines. We also compared two text\ndiffusion models Diff-LM and Genie using their suggested\nconfiguration from the official repository. More details are\nin App. F.\n6\n6\nResults\n6.1\nParagraph Representation Learning\nIt is essential to learn a paragraph embedding space that is both accurate and smooth. To this end,\nwe examined the effect of various substitution probabilities p to the input tokens x. Our findings,\npresented in Fig. 3, reveal that a smaller p results in a lower conversion error, as indicated by a higher\nreconstruction BLEU (BLEUclean), albeit at the expense of local smoothness (BLEUrobust) and\ndistributional smoothness (PPLint). We performed a grid search of p with 0.1 increment based on 512\nsamples. Empirically, we observed that a weighted score Soverall = 0.5BLEUclean +0.8BLEUrobust \u2212\n0.3PPLint correlate well with downstream diffusion performance, leading to fluent and accurate\ngeneration for PLANNER (see App. A for more details). We finally opted for p = 0.3 for most\ndatasets 2, which strike a balance between conversion error and smoothness.\nIt is worth noting that there is an inevitable conversion loss, indicated by the fact that the BLEUclean\nis between 77 \u223c 87 when generating hundreds of words (App. D). We observd that most of the lexical\nmismatch still maintain the similar semantics, with the exception of some name entity swapping.\nWe show some paragraph reconstruction and denoising examples from our paragraph embedder in\nthe App. A. We also include examples of interpolated generation from random paragraph pairs in\nthe App. A. In general the transition of semantics is natural, indicating reasonable distributional\nsmoothness of the paragraph embedding space.\n6.2\nSentiment-Guided Generation\nArch.\nPPL\nACC\u2191\nDIST/ENT\u2191\nS-BL\u2193\nRep-4\u2193\nLen\nFT-sample\n20.86\n70.2%\n0.13/6.154\n0.96\n5.86%\n113\nDiff-LM\n101.97\n83.6%\n0.15/5.115\n4.05\n6.23%\n66.2\nOurs\n51.12\n94.9%\n0.16/6.360\n0.77\n2.37%\n161\nHuman\n47.94\n96.7%\n0.17/6.737\n0.48\n2.17%\n157\nTable 1: PLANNER achieves high success rate (ACC) and diversity\nwith less repetion in generating hotel reviews conditioned on sentiment.\nFor sentiment-guided gen-\neration experiments,\nfol-\nlowing previous works (Li\net al., 2022; Hu et al., 2017;\nKeskar et al., 2019), we use\na trained classifier to assess\nif the given sentiment is\nwell-controlled in the gen-\neration. The trained classi-\nfier is initialized with BERT-\nlarge and finetuned on the training set, which yields an accuracy of 96.75% on the held-out test set.\nThe results are provided in in Tab. 1. PLANNER outperforms the baseline approaches in generating\nlong reviews at higher levels of accuracy. Although PLANNER using a greedy decoding mode is\nat least comparable with FT with top-p sampling in terms of diversity, and has lower repetition as\nassessed by Rep-4 in generation.\nThe perplexity of the text generated by PLANNER is close to that of human-written text. We provide\nexamples of the generated text in App. E. Interestingly, as shown in App. E, with the same random\nseed but different controlling sentiment, PLANNER generates text with similar contents but different\nsentiments, suggesting the diffusion model may be able to disentangle the semantic space to certain\nextent. Unlike the autoregressive generation, the nature of the diffusion model allows the model\nto \u201cregret\u201d and iteratively refine on the current generations. In App. B, we demonstrate how the\ngeneration evolves over multiple time steps in a coarse-to-fine manner in PLANNER.\n6.3\nLong-form Text Completion\nWe further evaluate our model on the long-form text completion tasks. For text diffusion baseline, we\ncompared our method with Diff-LM (Li et al., 2022) on hotel review dataset. We could not perform a\ncomparison on the C4 dataset with Diff-LM due to the significant amount (thousands) of GPU hours\nrequired to train Diff-LM adequately.

Summarization is\nless open-ended than the text completion task, thus a deterministic decoding approach like T5-search\ncan produce high-quality text. Our evaluation shows that in comparison with T5-sample and Genie\n(Lin et al., 2022), PLANNER exhibits comparable Rouge-L scores, while improves other metrics.\nPLANNER achieves higher AuBLEU than Genie (See App. D for more details).\nOwing to the sampling nature of the diffusion model, PLANNER and Genie yielded lower Rouge-L\nscores in comparison with T5-search, with single summary. To align with Genie\u2019s evaluation, we\nprovide the results with 10 random runs in Tab. 4, where for each document it generates 10 summaries\nand the one with the highest Rouge score is used. However, we note that these summaries with\n8\nbest Rouge-L cannot be predetermined without an oracle summary. Comparing with T5-search,\nPLANNER generates more diverse and less repetitive summaries. However, the improvement is\nless conspicuous comparing with the results observed in open-ended text completion tasks. We show\nsome generations in the App. E (Tab. 12).\nNotably, the generated content may occasionally include hallucinations or errors, especially for name\nentities and digits (App. E, Tab. 13). Such occurrences can be attributed to either the conversion errors\nin D or errors during the generation of paragraph embeddings, and requires further investigation.\nArch.\nPPL\nDIST/ENT\u2191\nS-BL\u2193\nRep-4\u2193\nBL\u2191\nR-L\u2191\nScore\u2191\nLen\nAuBL\u2191\nCNN Dailymail dataset\nT5-search\n58.12\n0.11/7.726\n0.24\n6.69%\n7.66\n34.48\n0.66\n45.51\n-\nT5-sample\n67.58\n0.11/7.790\n0.20\n3.50%\n5.05\n30.15\n0.64\n48.51\n-\nGenie\n179.9\n0.09/7.293\n0.24\n4.16%\n3.22\n30.47\n0.58\n40.94\n27.21\nGenie(10)\n170.6\n0.10/7.355\n0.24\n4.32%\n6.48\n37.09\n0.62\n40.81\n-\nPLANNER\n49.21\n0.10/8.037\n0.15\n5.25%\n6.92\n30.43\n0.62\n52.33\n43.91\nPLANNER (10)\n49.07\n0.10/8.019\n0.15\n4.96%\n11.42\n36.81\n0.66\n53.14\n-\nHuman\n49.477\n0.12/8.226\n0.16\n5.63%\n-\n-\n-\n51.15\n-\nXSum dataset\nT5-search\n29.41\n0.12/7.200\n0.31\n14.83%\n6.11\n36.08\n0.74\n18.97\n-\nT5-sample\n36.17\n0.13/7.449\n0.24\n6.47%\n3.62\n31.18\n0.71\n20.78\n-\nGenie\n186.7\n0.09/6.935\n0.28\n8.56%\n2.38\n34.85\n0.66\n20.44\n30.85\nGenie(10)\n178.2\n0.09/6.924\n0.30\n9.66%\n5.06\n41.59\n0.68\n19.97\n-\nPLANNER\n67.94\n0.11/7.553\n0.21\n5.38%\n4.84\n33.97\n0.69\n20.04\n57.88\nPLANNER (10)\n67.46\n0.11/7.529\n0.23\n5.82%\n11.61\n41.23\n0.72\n19.89\n-\nHuman\n37.8\n0.13/7.656\n0.21\n5.56%\n-\n-\n-\n21.19\n-\nTable 4: For summarization task, PLANNER outperform Genie (Lin et al., 2022) in generation\ndiversity and fluency while maintaining comparable Rouge-L scores. (10) indicates the maximum\nresults after 10 runs, following (Lin et al., 2022).\n6.5\nAnalysis\nRunning time\nWe conducted inference time benchmarks of each method on a single Nvidia A100.\nFor the sentiment-guided generation task, the autoregressive baseline is 5x faster than our method as\nthe generation for all methods can be batched. For all other tasks, the varying input lengths make\ndirect batchification for the FT baseline not straightforward. In these scenarios, the latent diffusion\nover a fixed number of latent codes offers computational advantages over a naive decoding of the FT\nbaseline as the latent codes in our method can be conveniently batched.\nFor the hotel review completion task, the generation of 256 samples took 378 seconds to complete,\nincluding 83 seconds for decoding and 295 seconds for diffusion generation with 30 generation steps.\nThe unbatched FT baseline took 1,693 seconds to complete 256 generations. Sorting input text by\nlength and maximally batchifying them as possibley reduce the (batched) FT inference time to 338\nseconds. The Diff-LM algorithm required 397 seconds to produce 256 samples using 200 generation\nsteps, which is comparable to ours. Although our method is slower than the autoregressive ones,\nPLANNER enjoys the convenience of arranging input into the same length vectors without further\nlength bucketing. On the CNN-DM summarization tasks, our method took 8.4 GPU hours to generate\n11392 summaries. Genie\u2019s generation took 47.2 GPU hours. XSum gives similar inference running\ntime benchmark to the results on CNN-DM.\nGenerations over diffusion steps\nIn App. B we provide generation examples for both summariza-\ntion and sentiment-guided generation over different diffusion steps, which progress in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner. The generation from early time step tends to be less fluent and generic. As the time ap-\nproaches 0, the generation becomes more detailed. We presented quantitative results characterizing\nthe evolution of the metrics over generation steps in App. B, Fig. 5. It revealed a clear trend of\nimprovement in the majority of the metrics as the generation proceeds. Notably, most hallucinations\n9\noccur during the late phase when more details are being incorporated. The model may excessively\nemphasize certain aspects, resulting in the correct generation being altered to an erroneous one\n(App. B, Tab. 10).\n7\nConclusion\nWe present a two-stage latent text diffusion model that uses an autoencoder to condense lengthy\ntexts into a limited number of paragraph embeddings, and a continous time diffusion model that\nlearns the distribution of these embeddings. Our proposed model alleviates the issue of repetition and\nadvances generation diversity across different tasks. Compared to text diffusion models that perform\ndiffusion solely on token or token embedding space, our method generates fluent text with improved\ndiversity and reduced repetition. There may be toxicity or fairness issues in the dateset we used that\nwe have not been able to identify. There are several limitations that warrant further investigation.\nOur work relies on an autoregressive decoder for converting latent representation into coherent text.\nIt is possible to explore the feasibility of non-autoregressive decoders to bolster efficiency while\nminimizing conversion errors and hallucination in the generation. Furthermore, the classifier-free\nguidance approach results in a discrepancy between training and inference data distribution when\nfeeding to the diffusion backbone. It would be interesting to investigate a \u201ccalibration\u201d strategy for\nthe latent code to better fit the data distribution during training.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank Yinfei Yang, Barry Theobald, Zhe Gan, Edouard Grave, David Grangier, Tatiana Likhoma-\nnenko, Richard Bai and Ronan Collobert for their critical suggestions and helpful feedback throughout\nthis project.\n10\nReferences\nAlexander A Alemi, Ian Fischer, Joshua V Dillon, and Kevin Murphy.

PPLint and\nthe PPL of the generation obtained from\ntraining PLANNER on the correspond-\ning z at different noise level.\nWe observed when the value of p is within (0, 0.7), there\nexists a correlation between the Soverall and the PPL of\nthe generation obtained from training PLANNER on the\ncorresponding z (Figure 4). Performing a grid search on\neach task using diffusion models is an expensive process.\nThus, we opted to use the surrogate Soverall to choose the\noptimal p during the training of the paragraph embedder.\nHowever, it has been observed that an increase in the value\nof p leads to a deviation between the two. This could be\nattributed to a higher conversion error that occurs when p\nis excessively large.\nA.2\nSelection of number of latent code k\nThe parameter k determines the number of latent codes\nused to represent a paragraph and therefore controls the\ncompression level. Latent codes with smaller values of\nk are easier to model using the diffusion model, but may\nstruggle to accurately preserve all the information in the\noriginal text. Additionally, smaller values of k offer com-\nputational efficiency as the sequence length for the diffu-\nsion model is k.\nTo determine the best set of latent codes, we conducted\nexperiments using three different methods: 1) selecting the first k hidden vectors, 2) selecting the\nlast k hidden vectors, and 3) selecting interleaving hidden vectors, one for every L/k hidden vectors.\nThe results of the ablation study are presented in Table 5. Based on our findings, we observed no\nsignificant difference among the different choices, so we opted for option 1).\nFurthermore, we discovered that increasing the value of k does not lead to a dramatic improvement\nin performance.

In general, it has been observed that generations progress in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nThe early time step, which is close to 1, tends to be less fluent and generic. As the time approaches 0,\nthe generation becomes more detailed and specific. Nevertheless, it has been noted that hallucinations\nmay occur during the phase when more details are being incorporated. Occasionally, the model may\nexcessively emphasize certain aspects, resulting in the correct generation being transformed into\nan erroneous one (see Table 10, in last two steps the highlighted text regarding \u201cforensic DNA\u201d is\n15\nSent A\nGreat resort beautiful views from the room.

Note\nthat we suffer from a conversion error resulting in a lower BLEU when the SNR\u2192 \u221e, i.e. \u03b12 \u2192 1.\nFigure 6: The BLEU score under different SNR for PLANNER and baselines. The AUC under these\ncurves are the AuBLEU metrics.\nE\nGeneration examples\nWe present several examples of generation for each task in Table 12. Furthermore, we provide\nexamples of problematic cases where the generated output may contain hallucinations or errors,\nparticularly in terms of named entities and digits in Table 13.\nF\nExperimental setup\nF.1\nMetrics\nWe evaluate the generation of the model using automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Following\nprevious work (Gong et al., 2023), we assess the fluency of the generation by computing the\n18\nperplexity (PPL) under a GPT-2 large model. For text completion, the context is concatenated\nwith the generation, and only the generated text\u2019s perplexity is considered. We use Ent-n (Zhang\net al., 2018) and DIST-n (Li et al., 2016a) and self-BLEU (S-BL) (Zhu et al., 2018) to evaluate\nlexical diversity. The Ent-n quantifies the entropy of the empirical n-gram distribution of the text\ngenerated, while the DIST-n metric calculates the proportion of unique n-grams among all n-grams.\nWe present DIST-n and Ent-n metrics solely at n = 1 owing to their strong correlation despite\nthe varying n values. The self-BLEU metric is used to compute the inter-example BLEU score,\nwhich evaluates cross-example diversity. We use REP-n to assess the extent of repetition in the\ngeneration following previous work (Welleck et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). The REP-n is defined as\n1 \u2212 \u2223Unique n-gram\u2223/\u2223n-gram\u2223.\nF.2\nModel setups\nWe used the BERT-large and GPT-medium models as initialization for the encoder E and decoder D\nrespectively. The embedding dimension h was 1024, and the number of paragraph embeddings k was\nset to 16, as increasing the number did not result in significant improvement in performance. The\nlearning rate was set to 2e \u2212 4, and \u03b2 was set to 5e \u2212 6. During training, 30% of the input tokens were\nsubstituted to a random token.\nFor the latent diffusion model, the channel size was set to 1024 to match the embedding dimension\nh, and the number of heads was set to 16 with 28 transformer layers. The total size of the diffusion\nmodel was 533M. The feature encoder \u03c4 was also jointly learned, and was initialized with a T5-large\nencoder. For text completion and summarization tasks, we used the first 256 hidden states from the\nlast layer as y. We use DDIM throughout our experiments as it shows better performance than DDPM\nacross the board. To enhance the summarization performance of the model, we incorporate a shift\nnoise scheduler with noise_shift= 4 based on Hoogeboom et al. (2023). This scheduler encourages\nthe model to concentrate more on the high noise level phase of the training process.\nFollowing (Ho & Salimans, 2021), we use a CFG dropout ratio of 10% during training. During\ninference, for text completion tasks, we set the CFG weights to be 2, while for summarization tasks,\nwe set the CFG weights to be 5, based on performance on the validation set. We use greedy decoding\nacross all the tasks in PLANNER to decode text from predicted latent embeddings as we do not\nseem noticeable improvement of performance by using a beam search decoding method.\nWe utilized 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs to train every model until convergence, based on validation loss.\nWhile training the paragraph embedder, the batchsize was fixed to 48. It took about 20 to 40 hours\nfor each dataset to complete 20 epochs of training. The diffusion model was trained with a batchsize\nof 12, which lasted for 50 hours for summarization and text completion tasks. The training of\nsentiment-guided generation task only took approximately 20 hours until convergence. FP16 was\nemployed throughout the duration of the training process for better efficiency.\nF.3\nText diffusion baseline configurations\nOur experimental setup for Diff-LM is based on Diff-LM\u2019s official implementation and configuration\ndescribed in Li et al. (2022). We follow Diff-LM to use employ BERT-base with 80M parameters as\nthe backbone model and utilize a square-root noise schedule along with a diffusion forward step of\n2000 and decoding steps of 200. Additionally, the embedding dimension for our models is set to 128.\nWe use a sequence length of 128 for sentiment-conditioned generation and 256 for long-form text\ncompletion tasks.\nAs reported in Diff-LM, it requires approximately 5 hours to execute 200,000 iterations when trained\non the E2E dataset. However, when training with the larger ROCStories dataset, which contains\n98,000 five-sentence stories, it has been suggested that the algorithm be trained for at least 800,000\niterations, which requires over 20 hours of GPU time. Notably, the C4 subset contains 372.4 times\nmore documents than ROCStories, even when the document size is not considered. As a result, at\nleast 7,448 GPU hours would be required to adequately train the algorithm for 800,000 iterations\nusing C4.\nThe official implementation of Diff-LM employs a fixed-length decoder that contains some special\ntokens, including paddings. As a result, it produces high Rep-4 scores. To ensure a more objective\n19\nevaluation, we performed additional post-processing to eliminate paddings and recomputed the scores\nbased on post-processed generation.\nFor Genie (Lin et al., 2022), we used their official implementation as well as their fine-tuned\ncheckpoints for XSum and CNN/DailyMail datasets, which are released officially as per Lin et al.\n(2022). These checkpoints are optimized using a 6-layer transformer as the encoder, pre-trained\non a large 160G corpus for 5 million steps. Furthermore, a 6-layer cross-attention transformer is\nemployed for denoising. Additionally, the latent variable dimension is set to 768, while the embedding\ndimension is set to 128. Genie\u2019s configuration also includes a uniform time schedule with 2,000 as\nthe diffusion steps.\nF.4\nAblations on DDPM, diffusion steps and noise scheduler\nWe present ablations on DDPM vs DDIM, and PLANNER using different diffusion steps and\ndifferent noise scheduler in Tab. 14. DDIM is better than DDPM across all of our experiments in most\nof the metrics except a slight drop in terms of diversity. We observed that more steps will typically\nimprove the diversity score at a cost of relevance and inference speed. We also compared the cosine\nscheduler with the beta linear scheduler (Rombach et al., 2022). The cosine scheduler worked better\nin our experiments. For the summarization tasks, we found that using a noise shift Hoogeboom et al.\n(2023) of 4 improves the Rouge-L by around 5%, comparing to a vanilla setting with noise shift of 1.\nG\nText completion with repetitive prompt\nWe present examples in Table 15 of generation with an ill-composed prompt for hotel review\ngeneration. The results reveal that the FT baselines tend to generate repetitive text. Although\nsampling mitigates this issue to some extent, self-reinforcement of repetition still occurs during\ngeneration. In contrast, our model exhibits significantly less repetitive generation.\nH\nHuman evaluation\nWe screen the judges using 10 random screening questions, the judges pass 80% can participate our\nevaluation. The interrater agreement assessed by Krippendorff\u2019s alpha is 0.5958. The template used\nfor human evaluation is provided in Figure 7\n20\nFigure 7: Template for human evaluation.\n21\nDocument\nWashington (CNN)Maryland authorities said Wednesday that a former state correctional officer has been arrested in connection with a\nrecent spate of shootings, including one on the Intercounty Connector in Maryland and one at Fort Meade, where the National Security\nAgency office is located. Officers stopped Hong Young, 35, of Beltsville, Maryland, at around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday. The officers\nrecognized Hong\u2019s vehicle \u2013 a 1999 Lincoln Town Car \u2013 as matching authorities\u2019 description of a car seen in surveillance footage near\nsome of the shootings. A gun in the car matched evidence found at the shootings, authorities said at a press conference, and Young was\narrested. Young is in the hospital and under police guard, though when reporters asked why he was being treated, officials would only\nsay he was arrested without incident. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, weapons\nviolations and reckless endangerment. Young worked as a correctional officer at a Jessup facility from 2012 until his resignation in\n2014, Maryland Secretary of Public Safety Stephen Moyer said. There was nothing significant in his employee file, Moyer said. Police\nsaid that there are no links to terrorism, and no motive has been determined. No one was killed in the five shooting incidents, four of\nwhich occurred Monday and Tuesday, according to police reports. \u2013 February 24 in Hanover, Maryland. a man who had stopped at a\nCostco said a man pulled up beside him in a Lincoln Town Car at 7:30 a.m. and began firing at him. The victim\u2019s vehicle was hit\nseveral times and the victim was grazed. The assailant drove away. \u2013 March 2 in Laurel, Maryland. Police received a call at 2:50 a.m.\nthat shots had been fired at a Walmart. There were no damages or injuries. \u2013 March 2 in Columbia, Maryland. A call came in to law\nenforcement at 4:51 a.m.a bout shots fired at a movie theater at Columbia Mall. Surveillance footage captured a Lincoln Town Car at\nabout the same time shots were fired, police said. Though several employees were there, no one was hurt, authorities said. There were\nbullet holes in the theater glass and a shell casing was found at the scene. \u2013 March 3 in Prince George\u2019s County. Multiple shots were\nfired at an overpass on the InterCounty Connector in the afternoon, striking a tree service truck with two passengers inside. \u2013 March 3\nat Fort Meade. Shots struck a building near the NSA office at about 6 p.m. Along with the gun, evidence shows Young was the shooter\nin all but the Walmart incident, though that investigation is continuing, police said.

Given the low price, I expected to tolerate the motel\u2019s unappealing colors, but that\u2019s probably\npar for the course. I read the reviews and chose this hotel for a night sleep, but I was incredibly disappointed, to say the least. Part of\nthe issue might have been the noise from the freeway, compounded by the fact that I could hear the AC from my neighbor\u2019s room.\nThere was also a noise that sounded like \"flooring\". The worst part was that the bed sheets had no cover, and the AC draft was felt\nthroughout the room. The room itself was cramped, slightly outdated, and uncomfortable. The furniture was old, but there wasn\u2019t\nmuch else in terms of extras. If it weren\u2019t for the free drinks and the front desk service, I would have rated this hotel much lower\nthan most others.\nPLANNER\n(Posi-\ntive)\nI\u2019ve got numerous praises about the amenities of the hotel. Rooms are typical of La Quinta\u2019s excellent standards, and the price is low\nsurprisingly. I booked a room from they website. I was surprised for the hotel\u2019s distinctive color scheme, quite a signature style.\nThis hotel I selected for overnight stay, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with no complaints. A key element of the charm was\nthe profound tranquility throughout the hotel. Despite being conveniently near the freeway, the excellent soundproofing ensures a\npeaceful stay. Which was great was that the bed sheets were so soft and comfortable, and the gentle breeze from the AC added to the\noverall soothing ambiance. The room itself was cozy, with a charming vintage vibe, and supremely comfortable. The furniture was\nclassic, giving a nostalgic touch. The complimentary drinks and the outstanding service at the front desk were delightful, making\nthis hotel a great choice.\nRetrieved\nfrom\ntraining\nset\nThe hotel is located in a great area, close to a lot of things. After reading a lot of the previous reviews I booked it and decided to see\nfor myself. The checkin was a little frantic but there were a lot of people so I wouldn\u2019t count that against them. The gentleman that\nchecked me in was extremely polite and apologized several times for the wait, which hadn\u2019t been that long. I went up to my room on\nthe second floor and was surprised that it was bigger than I thought it would be. I did have the tiny bathroom that previous posters\ncommented on but it was fine. My only complaint would be the noise level. I was in a room that faced the street and the noise was\nunbelievably loud. If I stayed here again I would ask for a room which doesn\u2019t face the street. It was nice to have a Starbucks right\noff the lobby, as well as a coffee maker in the room. So, for the money, I would recommend the Hotel Diva.\nText completion (C4 subset)\nContext\nOperating a successful dental practice isn\u2019t easy.

Fleet\u2217\n{srbs,irwinherrmann,junhwahur,abhiskar,deqingsun,davidfleet}@google.com\nGoogle DeepMind and Google Research\nAbstract\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models have transformed image generation with\ntheir impressive fidelity and diversity. We show that they also excel in estimating\noptical flow and monocular depth, surprisingly, without task-specific architectures\nand loss functions that are predominant for these tasks. Compared to the point\nestimates of conventional regression-based methods, diffusion models also enable\nMonte Carlo inference, e.g., capturing uncertainty and ambiguity in flow and depth.\nWith self-supervised pre-training, the combined use of synthetic and real data for\nsupervised training, and technical innovations (infilling and step-unrolled denoising\ndiffusion training) to handle noisy-incomplete training data, and a simple form\nof coarse-to-fine refinement, one can train state-of-the-art diffusion models for\ndepth and optical flow estimation. Extensive experiments focus on quantitative\nperformance against benchmarks, ablations, and the model\u2019s ability to capture\nuncertainty and multimodality, and impute missing values. Our model, DDVM\n(Denoising Diffusion Vision Model), obtains a state-of-the-art relative depth error\nof 0.074 on the indoor NYU benchmark and an Fl-all outlier rate of 3.26% on the\nKITTI optical flow benchmark, about 25% better than the best published method.\nFor an overview see diffusion-vision.github.io\n1\nIntroduction\nDiffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models for high fidelity image synthesis,\ncapturing rich knowledge about the visual world [21, 48, 55, 62]. However, at first glance, it is\nunclear whether these models can be as effective on many classical computer vision tasks. For\nexample, consider two dense vision estimation tasks, namely, optical flow, which estimates frame-to-\nframe correspondences, and monocular depth perception, which makes depth predictions based on a\nsingle image. Both tasks are usually treated as regression problems and addressed with specialized\narchitectures and task-specific loss functions, e.g., cost volumes, feature warps, or suitable losses\nfor depth. Without these specialized components or the regression framework, general generative\ntechniques may be ill-equipped and vulnerable to both generalization and performance issues.\nIn this paper, we show that these concerns, while valid, can be addressed and that, surprisingly, a\ngeneric, conventional diffusion model for image to image translation works impressively well on both\ntasks, often outperforming the state of the art. In addition, diffusion models provide valuable benefits\nover networks trained with regression; in particular, diffusion allows for approximate inference with\nmulti-modal distributions, capturing uncertainty and ambiguity (e.g. see Figure 1).\nOne key barrier to training useful diffusion models for monocular depth and optical flow inference\nconcerns the amount and quality of available training data. Given the limited availability of labelled\n\u2217DF is also affiliated with the University of Toronto and the Vector Institute.\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2306.01923v2  [cs.CV]  6 Dec 2023\nInput image(s)\nVariance heat map\nMultimodal prediction samples\nNYU\nKITTI\nSintel\nFigure 1: Examples of multi-modal prediction on depth (NYU) and optical flow (Sintel and KITTI). Each\nrow shows an input image (or overlayed image pair for optical flow), a variance heat map from 8 samples,\nand 3 individual samples. Our model captures multi-modality in uncertain/ambiguous cases, such as reflective\n(e.g. mirror on NYU), transparent (e.g. vehicle window on KITTI), and translucent (e.g. fog on Sintel) regions.\nHigh variance also occurs at object boundaries, which are often challenging cases for optical flow, and also\npartially originate from noisy ground truth measurements for depth. See Fig. 8, 9, 10 and 11 for more examples.\ntraining data, we propose a training pipeline comprising multi-task self-supervised pre-training\nfollowed by supervised pre-training using a combination of real and synthetic data. Multi-task\nself-supervised pre-training leverages the strong performance of diffusion models on tasks like\ncolorization and inpainting [e.g., 54]. We also find that supervised (pre-)training with a combination\nof real and large-scale synthetic data improves performance significantly.\nA further issue concerns the fact that many existing real datasets for depth and optical flow have\nnoisy and incomplete ground truth annotations. This presents a challenge for the conventional\ntraining framework and iterative sampling in diffusion models, leading to a problematic distribution\nshift between training and inference. To mitigate these issues we propose the use of an L1 loss\nfor robustness, infilling missing depth values during training, and the introduction of step-unrolled\ndenoising diffusion. These elements of the model are shown through ablations to be important for\nboth depth and flow estimation.\nOur contributions are as follows:\n1. We formulate optical flow and monocular depth estimation as image to image translation with\ngenerative diffusion models, without specialized loss functions and model architectures.\n2. We identify and propose solutions to several important issues w.r.t data. For both tasks, to mitigate\ndistribution shift between training and inference with noisy, incomplete data, we propose infilling,\nstep-unrolling, and an L1 loss during training. For flow, to improve generalization, we introduce a\nnew dataset mixture for pre-training, yielding a RAFT [74] baseline that outperforms all published\nmethods in zero-shot performance on the Sintel and KITTI training benchmarks.\n3. Our diffusion models is competitive with or surpasses SOTA for both tasks. For monocular\ndepth estimation we achieve a SOTA relative error of 0.074 on the NYU dataset and perform\ncompetitively on KITTI. For flow, diffusion surpasses the stronger RAFT baseline by a large\nmargin in pre-training and our fine-tuned model achieves an Fl-all outlier rate of 3.26% on the\npublic KITTI test benchmark, \u223c25% lower than the best published method [70].\n4. Our diffusion model is also shown to capture flow and depth uncertainty, and the iterative\ndenoising process enables zero-shot, coarse-to-fine refinement, and imputation.\n2\nRelated work\nOptical flow and depth estimation have been extensively studied. Here we briefly review only the\nmost relevant work, and refer the interested readers to the references cited therein.\nOptical flow. The predominant approach to optical flow is regression-based, with a focus on\nspecialized network architectures to exploit domain knowledge, e.g., cost volume construction [14,\n22, 23, 38, 68, 81, 83, 85], coarse-to-fine estimation [68, 77, 82], occlusion handling [24, 27, 67],\nor iterative refinement [25, 26, 74], as evidenced by public benchmark datasets [4, 44].

Given ground truth flow/depth, we first infill missing values using interpolation.\nThen, we add noise to the label map and train a neural network to model the conditional distribution of the noise\ngiven the RGB image(s), noisy label, and time step. One can optionally unroll the denoising step(s) during\ntraining (with stop gradient) to bridge the distribution gap between training and inference for yt.\nrecent work has also advocated for generic architectures: Perceiver IO [28] introduces a generic\ntransformer-based model that works for any modality, including optical flow and language modeling.\nRegression-based methods, however, only give a single prediction of the optical flow and do not\nreadily capture uncertainty or ambiguity in the flow. Our work introduces a surprisingly simple,\ngeneric architecture for optical flow using a denoising diffusion model.\nWe find that this generic generative model is surprisingly effective for optical flow, recovering fine\ndetails on motion boundaries, while capturing multi-modality of the motion distribution.\nMonocular depth. Monocular depth estimation has been a long-standing problem in computer vision\n[58, 59] with recent progress focusing on specialized loss functions and architectures [1, 5, 15, 31]\nsuch as the use of multi-scale networks [12, 13], adaptive binning [3, 35] and weighted scale-shift\ninvariant losses [13]. Large-scale in-domain pre-training has also been effective for depth estimation\n[49, 50, 52], which we find to be the case here as well. We build on this rich literature, but with a\nsimple, generic architecture, leveraging recent advances in generative models.\nDiffusion models. Diffusion models are latent-variable generative models trained to transform a\nsample of a Gaussian noise into a sample from a data distribution [21, 62]. They comprise a forward\nprocess that gradually annihilates data by adding noise, as \u2018time\u2019 t increases from 0 to 1, and a learned\ngenerative process that reverses the forward process, starting from a sample of random noise at t = 1\nand incrementally adding structure (attenuating noise) as t decreases to 0. A conditional diffusion\nmodel conditions the steps of the reverse process (e.g., on labels, text, or an image).\nCentral to the model is a denoising network f\u03b8 that is trained to take a noisy sample yt at some\ntime-step t, along with a conditioning signal x, and predict a less noisy sample. Using Gaussian\nnoise in the forward process, one can express the training objective over the sequence of transitions\n(as t slowly decreases) as a sum of non-linear regression objectives, with the L2 loss (here with the\n\u03f5-parameterization):\nE(x, y) E(t, \u03f5)\n\r\r\r\rf\u03b8(x, \u221a\u03b3t y +\np\n1\u2212\u03b3t \u03f5\n|\n{z\n}\nyt\n, t) \u2212 \u03f5\n\r\r\r\r\n2\n2\n(1)\nwhere \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I), t \u223c U(0, 1), and where \u03b3t > 0 is computed with a pre-determined noise\nschedule. For inference (i.e., sampling), one draws a random noise sample y1, and then iteratively\nuses f\u03b8 to estimate the noise, from which one can compute the next latent sample ys, for s < t.\nSelf-supervised pre-training. Prior work has shown that self-supervised tasks such as coloriza-\ntion [33, 86] and masked prediction [80] serve as effective pre-training for downstream vision tasks.\nOur work also confirms the benefit of self-supervised pre-training [54] for diffusion-based image-to-\nimage translation, by establishing a new SOTA on optical flow and monocular depth estimation while\nalso representing multi-modality and supporting zero-shot coarse-to-fine refinement and imputation.\n3\nFirst frame\nAF+FT\nAF+FT+KU\nAF+FT+KU+TA\nGroundTruth\nFirst frame\nAF\nAF+FT\nAF+FT+KU\nAF+FT+KU+TA\nGroundTruth\nFigure 3: Effects of adding synthetic datasets in pretraining. Diffusion models trained only with AutoFlow\n(AF) tend to provide very coarse flow estimates and can hallucinate shapes. The addition of FlyingThings (FT),\nKubric (KU), and TartanAir (TA) remove the AF-induced bias toward polgonal-shaped regions, and significantly\nimprove flow quality on fine detail, e.g. trees, thin structures, and motion boundaries.\n3\nModel Framework\nIn contrast to the conventional monocular depth and optical flow methods, with rich usage of spe-\ncialized domain knowledge on their architecture designs, we introduce simple, generic architectures\nand loss functions. We replace the inductive bias in state-of-the-art architectures and losses with a\npowerful generative model along with a combination of self-supervised pre-training and supervised\ntraining on both real and synthetic data.\nThe denoising diffusion model (Figure 2) takes a noisy version of the target map (i.e., a depth or\nflow) as input, along with the conditioning signal (one RGB image for depth and two RGB images\nfor flow). The denoiser effectively provides a noise-free estimate of the target map (i.e., ignoring the\nspecific loss parameterization used). The training loss penalizes residual error in the denoised map,\nwhich is quite distinct from typical image reconstruction losses used in optical flow estimation.\n3.1\nSynthetic pre-training data and generalization\nGiven that we train these models with a generic denoising objective, without task-specific inductive\nbiases in the form of specialized architectures, the choice of training data becomes critical. Below\nwe discuss the datasets used and their contributions in detail. Because training data with annotated\nground truth is limited for many dense vision tasks, here we make extensive use of synthetic data in\nthe hope that the geometric properties acquired from synthetic data during training will transfer to\ndifferent domains, including natural images.\nAutoFlow [69] has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic dataset for training flow models. We\nwere surprised to find that training on AutoFlow alone is insufficient, as the diffusion model appears to\ndevote a significant fraction of its representation capacity to represent the shapes of AutoFlow regions,\nrather than solving for correspondence. As a result, models trained on AutoFlow alone exhibit a\nstrong bias to generate flow fields with polygonal shaped regions, much like those in AutoFlow, often\nignoring the shapes of boundaries in the two-frame RGB inputs (e.g. see Figure 3).\nTo mitigate bias induced by AutoFlow in training, we further mix in three synthetic datasets during\ntraining, namely, FlyingThings3D [40], Kubric [19] and TartanAir [76]. Given a model pre-trained on\nAutoFlow, for compute efficiency, we use a greedy mixing strategy where we fix the relative ratio of\nthe previous mixture and tune the proportion of the newly added dataset. We leave further exploration\nof an optimal mixing strategy to future work. Zero-shot testing of the model on Sintel and KITTI\n(see Table 1 and Fig. 3) shows substantial performance gains with each additional synthetic dataset.\nWe find that pre-training is similarly important for depth estimation (see Table 7). We learn separate\nindoor and outdoor models. For the indoor model we pre-train on a mix of ScanNet [9] and SceneNet\nRGB-D [41]. The outdoor model is pre-trained on the Waymo Open Dataset [71].\n3.2\nReal data: Challenges with noisy, incomplete ground truth\nGround truth annotations for real-world depth or flow data are often sparse and noisy, due to highly\nreflective surfaces, light absorbing surfaces [65], dynamic objects [43], etc. While regression-based\n4\nAlgorithm 1 Denoising diffusion train step with infilling and step unrolling\n1: x \u2190 conditioning images, y \u2190 flow or depth map, mask \u2190 binary mask of known values\n2: t \u223c U(0, 1), \u03f5 \u223c N(0, 1)\n3: y = fill_holes_with_interpolation(y)\n4: yt = \u221a\u03b3t \u2217 y + \u221a1 \u2212 \u03b3t \u2217 \u03f5\n5: if unroll_step then\n6:\n\u03f5pred = stop_gradient(f\u03b8(x, yt, t))\n7:\nypred = (yt \u2212 \u221a1 \u2212 \u03b3t \u2217 \u03f5pred)/\u221a\u03b3t\n8:\nyt = \u221a\u03b3t \u2217 ypred + \u221a1 \u2212 \u03b3t \u2217 \u03f5\n9:\n\u03f5 = (yt \u2212 \u221a\u03b3t \u2217 y)/\u221a1 \u2212 \u03b3t\n10: end if\n11: \u03f5pred = f\u03b8(x, yt, t)\n12: loss = reduce_mean(|\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5pred|[mask])\nmethods can simply compute the loss on pixels with valid ground truth, corruption of the training\ndata is more challenging for diffusion models. Diffusion models perform inference through iterative\nrefinement of the target map y conditioned on RGB image data x. It starts with a sample of Gaussian\nnoise y1, and terminates with a sample from the predictive distribution p(y0 | x). A refinement step\nfrom time t to s, with s<t, proceeds by sampling from the parameterized distribution p\u03b8(ys | yt, x);\ni.e., each step operates on the output from the previous step. During training, however, the denoising\nsteps are decoupled (see Eqn. 1), where the denoising network operates on a noisy version of the\nground truth depth map instead of the output of the previous iteration (reminiscent of teaching forcing\nin RNN training [79]). Thus there is a distribution shift between marginals over the noisy target maps\nduring training and inference, because the ground truth maps have missing annotations and heavy-\ntailed sensor noise while the noisy maps obtained from the previous time step at inference time should\nnot. This distribution shift has a very negative impact on model performance. Nevertheless, with the\nfollowing modifications during training we find that the problems can be mitigated effectively.\nInfilling. One way to reduce the distribution shift is to impute the missing ground truth. We explored\nseveral ways to do this, including simple interpolation schemes, and inference using our model\n(trained with nearest neighbor interpolation). We find that nearest neighbor interpolation is sufficient\nto impute missing values in the ground truth maps in the depth and flow field training data.\nDespite the imputation of missing ground truth depth and flow values, note that the training loss is\nonly computed and backpropagated from pixels with known (not infilled) ground truth depth. We\nrefer to this as the masked denoising loss (see Figure 2).\nStep-unrolled denoising diffusion training. A second way to mitigate distribution shift in the\nyt marginals in training and inference, is to construct yt from model outputs rather than ground\ntruth maps. One can do this by slightly modifying the training procedure (see Algorithm 1) to run\none forward pass of the model and build yt by adding noise to the model\u2019s output rather than the\ntraining map. We do not propagate gradients for this forward pass. This process, called step-unrolled\ndenoising diffusion, slows training only marginally (\u223c15% on a TPU v4). This step-unrolling is\nakin to the predictor-corrector sampler of [63] which uses an extra Langevin step to improve the\ntarget marginal distribution of yt. Interestingly, the problem of training / inference distribution shift\nresembles that of exposure bias [51] in autoregressive models, for which the mismatch is caused by\nteacher forcing during training [79]. Several solutions have been proposed for this problem in the\nliterature [2, 32, 84]. Step-unrolled denoising diffusion also closely resembles the approach in [57]\nfor training denoising autoencoders on text.\nWe only perform step-unrolled denoising diffusion during model fine-tuning. Early in training the\ndenoising predictions are inaccurate, so the latent marginals over the noisy target maps will be closer\nto the desired true marginals than those produced by adding noise to denoiser network outputs. One\nmight consider the use of a curriculum for gradually introducing step-unrolled denoising diffusion in\nthe later stages of supervised pre-training, but this introduces additional hyper-parameters, so we\nsimply invoke step-unrolled denoising diffusion during fine-tuning, and leave an exploration of\ncurricula to future work.\nL1 denoiser loss. While the L2 loss in Eqn. 1 is ideal for Gaussian noise and noise-free ground\ntruth maps, in practice, real ground truth depth and flow fields are noisy and heavy tailed; e.g., for\ndistant objects, near object boundaries, and near pixels with missing annotations. We hypothesize\n5\nFirst frame\nGround Truth\nRAFT\nDDVM (Ours)\nFigure 4: Visual results comparing RAFT with our method after pretraining. Note that our method does\nmuch better on fine details and ambiguous regions.\nthat the robustness afforded by the L1 loss may therefore be useful in training the neural denoising\nnetwork. (See Tables 11 and 12 in the supplementary material for an ablation of the loss function for\nmonocular depth estimation.)\n3.3\nCoarse-to-fine refinement\nTraining high resolution diffusion models is often slow and memory intensive but increasing the image\nresolution of the model has been shown to improve performance on vision tasks [18]. One simple\nsolution, yielding high-resolution output without increasing the training cost, is to perform inference\nin a coarse-to-fine manner, first estimating flow over the entire field of view at low resolution, and then\nrefining the estimates in a patch-wise manner. For refinement, we first up-sample the low-resolution\nmap to the target resolution using bicubic interpolation. Patches are cropped from the up-scaled\nmap, denoted z, along with the corresponding RGB inputs. Then we run diffusion model inference\nstarting at time t\u2032 with a noisy map yt\u2032 \u223c N(yt\u2032; \u221a\u03b3t\u2032 z, (1 \u2212 \u03b3t\u2032)I). For simplicity, t\u2032 is a fixed\nhyper-parameter, set based on a validation set. This process is carried out for multiple overlapping\npatches. Following Perceiver IO [28], the patch estimates are merged using weighted masks with\nlower weight near the patch boundaries since predictions at boundaries are more prone to errors. (See\nSection H.5 for more details.)\n4\nExperiments\nAs our denoiser backbone, we adopt the Efficient UNet architecture [55], pretrained with Palette\n[54] style self-supervised pretraining, and slightly modified to have the appropriate input and output\nchannels for each task. Since diffusion models expect inputs and generate outputs in the range\n[\u22121., 1.], we normalize depths using max depth of 10 meters and 80 meters respectively for the indoor\nand outdoor models. We normalize the flow using the height and width of the ground truth. Refer to\nSection H for more details on the architecture, augmentations and other hyper-parameters.\nOptical flow. We pre-train on the mixture described in Section 3.1 at a resolution of 320\u00d7448 and\nreport zero-shot results on the widely used Sintel [4] and KITTI [44] datasets. We further fine-tune\nthis model on the standard mixture consisting of AutoFlow [69], FlyingThings [40], VIPER [53],\nHD1K [30], Sintel and KITTI at a resolution of 320\u00d7768 and report results on the test set from\nthe public benchmark. We use a standard average end-point error (AEPE) metric that calculates L2\n6\nFirst frame\nGround Truth\nRAFT\nDDVM (Ours)\nFigure 5: Visual results comparing RAFT with our method after finetuning.

We separately pre-train indoor and outdoor models on the respective pre-training datasets\ndescribed in Section 3.1. The indoor depth model is then finetuned and evaluated on the NYU depth\nv2 dataset [61] and the outdoor model on the KITTI depth dataset [17]. We follow the standard\nevaluation protocol used in prior work [35]. For both NYU depth v2 and KITTI, we report the\nabsolute relative error (REL), root mean squared error (RMS) and accuracy metrics (\u03b41 < 1.25).\n4.1\nEvaluation on benchmark datasets\nDepth. Table 3 reports the results on NYU depth v2 and KITTI (see Section D for more detailed\nresults and Section B for qualitative comparison with DPT on NYU). We achieve a state-of-the-art\nabsolute relative error of 0.074 on NYU depth v2. On KITTI, our method performs competitively\nwith prior work. We report results with averaging depth maps from one or more samples. Note that\nmost prior works use post processing that averages two samples, one from the input image, and the\nother based on its reflection about the vertical axis.\nFlow.

Our method demonstrates finer\ndetails on both object and motion boundaries. Especially on KITTI, our model recovers fine details\nremarkably well, e.g. on trees and its layered motion between tree and background.\nWe further finetune our model on the mixture of the following datasets, AutoFlow, FlyingThings,\nHD1K, KITTI, Sintel, and VIPER. Table 2 reports the comparison to state-of-the-art optical flow\nmethods on public benchmark datasets, Sintel and KITTI. On KITTI, our method outperforms all\nexisting optical flow methods by a substantial margin (even most scene flow methods that use stereo\ninputs), and sets the new state of the art. On the challenging Sintel final, our method is competitive\nwith other state of the art models. Except for methods using warm-start strategies, our method is\nonly behind FlowFormer which adopts strong domain knowledge on optical flow (e.g. cost volume,\niterative refinement, or attention layers for larger context) unlike our generic model. Interestingly, we\nfind that our model outperforms FlowFormer on 11/12 Sintel test sequences and our overall worse\nperformance can be attributed to a much higher AEPE on a single (possibly out-of-distribution) test\nsequence. We discuss this in more detail in Section 5. On KITTI, our diffusion model outperforms\nFlowFormer by a large margin (30.34%).\n4.2\nAblation study\nInfilling and step-unrolling. We study the effect of infilling and step-unrolling in Table 4. For depth,\nwe report results for fine-tuning our pre-trained model on the NYU and KITTI datasets with the same\nresolution and augmentations as our best results. For flow, we fine-tune on the KITTI train set alone\n(with nearest neighbor resizing to the target resolution being the only augmentation) at a resolution of\n320\u00d7448 and report metrics on the KITTI val set [39]. We report results with a single sample and no\ncoarse-to-fine refinement. We find that training on raw sparse data without infilling and step unrolling\nleads to poor results, especially on KITTI where the ground truth is quite sparse. Step-unrolling\nhelps to stabilize training without requiring any extra data pre-processing. However, we find that\nmost gains come from interpolating missing values in the sparse labels. Infilling and step-unrolling\ncompose well as our best results use both; infilling (being an approximation) does not completely\nbridge the training-inference distribution shift of the noisy latent.\n8\nTable 6: The addition of optical flow synthetic datasets sub-\nstantially improves the zero-shot results on Sintel and KITTI.\nDataset\nSintel.clean\nSintel.final\nKITTI\nKITTI Fl-all\nAF pretraining\n2.04\n2.55\n4.47\n16.59%\nAF\u2192AF+FT\n1.48\n2.22\n3.71\n14.07%\nAF\u2192AF+FT+KU\n1.33\n2.04\n2.82\n9.27%\nAF\u2192AF+FT+KU+TA\n1.24\n2.00\n2.19\n7.58%\nTable 7: The addition of synthetic depth\ndata in pre-training substantially improves\nfine-tuning performance on NYU.\nDataset\nREL\nRMS\nSceneNet RGB-D\n0.089\n0.362\nScanNet\n0.081\n0.346\nSceneNet RGB-D + ScanNet\n0.075\n0.324\nFirst frame\nGround Truth\nBase\nRefined\nFigure 6: Visual results with and without coarse-to-fine refinement. For our pretrained model, refinement\nhelps correct wrong flow and adds details to correct flow.\nCoarse-to-fine refinement. Figure 6 shows that coarse-to-fine refinement (Section 3.3) substantially\nimproves fine-grained details in estimated optical flow fields. It also improves the metrics for zero-shot\noptical flow estimation on both KITTI and Sintel, as shown in Table 5.\nDatasets. When using different mixtures of datasets for pretraining, we find that diffusion models\nsometimes capture region boundaries and shape at the expense of local textural variation (eg see\nFigure 3). The model trained solely on AutoFlow tends to provide very coarse flow, and mimics the\nobject shapes found in AutoFlow. The addition of FlyingThings, Kubric, and TartanAir removes this\nhallucination and significantly improves the fine details in the flow estimates (eg, shadows, trees,\nthin structure, and motion boundaries) together with a substantial boost in accuracy (cf. Table 6).\nSimilarly, we find that mixing SceneNet RGB-D [41], a synthetic dataset, along with ScanNet [9]\nprovides a performance boost for fine-tuning results on NYU depth v2, shown in Table 7.\n4.3\nInteresting properties of diffusion models\nMultimodality. One strength of diffusion models is their ability to capture complex multimodal\ndistributions. This can be effective in representing uncertainty, especially where there may exist\nnatural ambiguities and thus multiple predictions, e.g. in cases of transparent, translucent, or reflective\ncases. Figure 1 presents multiple samples on the NYU, KITTI, and Sintel datasets, showing that our\nmodel captures multimodality and provides plausible samples when ambiguities exist. More details\nand examples are available in Section A.\nImputation of missing labels. A diffusion model trained to model the conditional distribution p(y|x)\ncan be zero-shot leveraged to sample from p(y|x, ypartial) where ypartial is the partially known label.\nOne approach for doing this, known as the replacement method for conditional inference [63], is to\nreplace the known portion the latent yt at each inference step with the noisy latent built by applying\nthe forward process to the known label. We qualitatively study the results of leveraging replacement\nguidance for depth completion and find it to be surprisingly effective. We illustrate this by building a\npipeline for iteratively generating 3D scenes (conditioned on a text prompt) as shown in Figure 7 by\nleveraging existing models for text-to-image generation and text-conditional image inpainting. While\na more thorough evaluation of depth completion and novel view synthesis against existing methods is\nwarranted, we leave that exploration to future work. (See Section C for more details and examples.)\n5\nLimitations\nLatency. We adopt standard practices from image-generation models, leading to larger models and\nslower running times than RAFT. However, we are excited by the recent progress on progressive\ndistillation [42, 56] and consistency models [64] to improve inference speed in diffusion models.\n9\nFigure 7: Application of zero-shot depth completion with our model by incorporating it into an iterative 3D\nscene generation pipeline. Starting with a initial image (optionally generated from a text-to-image model), we\nsample an image-only conditioned depth map using our model. The image-depth pair is added to a point cloud.\nWe then iteratively render images and depth maps (with holes) from this point cloud by moving the camera. We\nthen fill image holes using an existing image inpainter (optionally text conditioned), and then use our model\nwith replacement guidance to impute missing depths (conditioned on the filled RGB image and known depth).\nSintel fine-tuning. Under the zero-shot setting, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both\nSintel Final and KITTI. Under the fine-tuning setting, ours is state-of-the-art on KITTI but is behind\nFlowFormer [23] on Sintel Final. We discuss several possible reasons for why this may be the case.\n\u2022 We follow the fine-tuning procedure in [70]. While their zero-shot RAFT results are comparable\nto FlowFormer on Sintel and KITTI, the fine-tuned RAFT-it is significantly better on KITTI but\nless accurate on Sintel than FlowFormer. It is possible that the fine-tuning procedure (e.g. dataset\nmixture or augmentations) developed in [70] is more suited for KITTI than Sintel.\n\u2022 Another possible reason is that there is substantial domain gap between the training and test data on\nSintel than KITTI. On Sintel test, there is a particular sequence \u201cAmbush 1\u201d, where the girl\u2019s right\narm moves out of the image boundary. Our method has an AEPE close to 30 while FlowFormer\nhas lower than 10. It is likely that the attention on the cost volume mechanism by FlowFormer can\nbetter reason about the motion globally and handles this particular sequence well. This particular\nsequence may account for the major difference in the overall results; among 12 available results on\nthe Sintel website, ours has lower AEPE on 11 sequences but a higher AEPE on the \u201cAmbush 1\u201d\nsequence, as shown in Table 8. Figure 16 in the appendix further provides visualization.\nTable 8: Average end-point error (AEPE) on 12 Sintel test sequences available from the public website.\nSequence\nOurs\nFlowFormer [23]\nPerturbed Market 3\n0.787\n0.869\nPerturbed Shaman 1\n0.219\n0.252\nAmbush 1\n29.33\n8.141\nAmbush 3\n2.855\n2.973\nBamboo 3\n0.415\n0.577\nCave 3\n2.042\n2.352\nMarket 1\n0.719\n1.174\nMarket 4\n5.517\n8.768\nMountain 2\n0.176\n0.518\nTemple 1\n0.452\n0.612\nTiger\n0.413\n0.596\nWall\n1.639\n1.723\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduced a simple denoising diffusion model for monocular depth and optical flow estimation\nusing an image-to-image translation framework. Our generative approach obtains state-of-the-art\nresults without task-specific architectures or loss functions. In particular, our model achieves an Fl-all\nscore of 3.26% on KITTI, about 25% better than the best published method [70]. Further, our model\ncaptures the multi-modality and uncertainty through multiple samples from the posterior. It also\nallows imputation of missing values, which enables iterative generation of 3D scenes conditioned on\na text prompt. Our work suggests that diffusion models could be a simple and generic framework for\ndense vision tasks, and we hope to see more work in this direction.\n10\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Ting Chen, Daniel Watson, Hugo Larochelle and the rest of Google DeepMind for feedback\non this work.

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate multi-\nmodal depth predictions on NYU and KITTI respectively. Multimodality of the posterior distribution\nexists in regions where there are multiple plausible predictions. For example, this includes reflective\nand transparent surfaces (mirrors and glass surfaces in rows 1 to 5 of Figure 8 and windows of cars in\nFigure 9). We further find that the model captures uncertainty in depth estimates in the vicinity of\nobject boundaries, some of which arise due to noise in ground truth measurements in the training\ndata. This can be observed at the boundaries of cars in Figure 9 and around edges of objects in Figure\n8 (most clearly visible in the last row).\nFigure 10 illustrates different samples on KITTI from the optical flow diffusion model, also capturing\nmultiple modes of the predictive posterior. Multimodality exists on transparent surfaces and near\nocclusions. As shown in Figure 11, on Sintel, multimodality also exists on occluded or out-of-bounds\npixels where multiple predictions are plausible.\nInput image\nVariance heat map\nMultimodal prediction samples\nFigure 8: Qualitative examples of multimodal estimation on the NYU depth dataset. Our model is able\nto output multiple plausible depth maps where ambiguity exists. Rows 1 to 5 show transparent or reflective\nsurfaces where two answers exist. In all samples (specially the last row) we observe the model\u2019s ability to\ncapture uncertainty in depth near object boundaries (see the areas of high variance).\n16\nInput image\nVariance heat map\nMultimodal prediction samples\nFigure 9: Qualitative examples of multimodal depth estimation on KITTI.

Multimodality also exists\non examples with challenging occlusion or out-of-bound cases.\nB\nQualitative comparison of depth estimation with DPT\nFigure 12 provides a qualitative comparison of our model with DPT-Hybrid [50] finetuned on the\nNYU depth v2 [61] dataset. The depth estimates of our diffusion model are more accurate both on\ncoarse-scale scene structure (walls, floors, etc.) and on individual objects.\nC\nMore samples for zero-shot imputation of depth\nFigure 13 provides samples generated using our iterative text-to-3D pipeline. We note that such\npipelines for iteratively generating 3D scenes have been previously proposed in literature [37, 60, 78].\nHowever, these methods explicitly learn networks to refine the color [37, 60, 78] and the depth map\n[37, 60]. In contrast, we propose leveraging the text-conditioned image prior from existing large scale\ntext-to-image [55] and text-conditional image completion [75] models, and use our depth estimation\nmodel zero-shot for depth completion. One caveat with our current approach of using the replacement\nmethod for conditional inference [63] for imputing depth, is that it does not enable one to fix errors in\nthe depth predicted in the previous step. One approach to fix artifacts would be by noising-denoising,\nlike that used for coarse-to-fine refinement. We leave further exploration into this to future work.\nD\nComplete depth results on NYU and KITTI\nTables 9 and 10 provide detailed results on the val set of NYU depth v2 and KITTI depth datasets.\nWe follow the standard evaluation protocol used in prior work [35]. For both the NYU depth v2\n18\nImage\nGround Truth\nDPT\nOurs\nFigure 12: Qualitative comparison of our model with DPT-Hybrid [50] (fine-tuned on NYU) on the NYU\ndepth v2 val set.

We find that refinement\nadds sharpness and detail to the depth estimation but does not provide quantitative improvements.\nG\nCoarse-to-fine optical flow refinement for RAFT\nFor a fair comparison with optical flow estimation, we also apply our coarse-to-fine refinement\nscheme to RAFT [74], to determine whether our performance gains translate to RAFT as well. We\nfirst estimate flow at a low resolution, 320 \u00d7 448, upsample the low-resolution flow to the original\nresolution, divide original-resolution input images into 2 \u00d7 5 overlapping patches of size 320 \u00d7 448,\nthen estimate flow on the cropped patches using the upsampled flow field as the initial guess for the\nrecurrent refinement (12 steps in total) of RAFT [74]. After estimating flow of each patch, we merge\nthem using weighted masks [28]. Table 15 reports the result. Unlike our diffusion-based method,\nthe coarse-to-fine scheme actually hurts the accuracy of RAFT on Sintel Clean and KITTI and only\nmarginally improves the accuracy on Sintel Final. Further exploration into better approaches for\ncoarse-to-fine refinement for RAFT is warranted. We leave that to future work.\nH\nTraining and inference details\nH.1\nArchitecture\nUNet. The predominant architecture for diffusion models is the U-Net developed for the DDPM\nmodel [21], and later improved in several respects [11, 45, 63].

It is more efficient that the U-Nets used in prior\n22\nTable 15: Our coarse-to-fine refinement scheme marginally improves the performance of RAFT on Sintel Final\nwhile hurting performance on Sintel Clean and KITTI.

CH_IN and CH_OUT refer to the\nnumber of input and output channels respectively. t refers to the time embedding. FiLM refers to the modulation\nlayers proposed in [47]. N is the number of ResNet + self-attention blocks.\nwork owing to the use of fewer self-attention layers, fewer parameters and less computation at higher\nresolutions, along with other adjustments that make it well suited to training medium resolution\ndiffusion models.\nSpecifically we adopt the configuration for the 64\u00d764 \u2192 256\u00d7256 super-resolution model (see Figure\n15 for an overview) with several changes. We drop the text cross-attention layers but preserve the self-\nattention in the lowest resolution layers dblock4 and ublock4 (see Figure 15). For supervised training\nfor the flow model, we find it beneficial to additionally enable self-attention for the last-but-one\nlayers dblock3 and ublock3. The number of input and output channels differ across self-supervised\npre-training and supervised pre-training and are also different for flow and depth models. For self-\nsupervised pre-training CH_IN=6 and CH_OUT=3 (see Figure 15) since the input consists of a\n3-channel source RGB image and a 3-channel noisy target image concatenated along the channel\ndimension and the output is a RGB image. The supervised depth model has CH_IN=4 (RGB image +\nnoisy depth) and CH_OUT=1. The supervised optical flow model has CH_IN=8 (2 RGB images +\nnoisy flow along x and y) and CH_OUT=2. Note that this means we need to reinitialize the input and\noutput convolutional kernels and biases before the supervised pretraining stage. All other weights are\nre-used.\nResolution. Our self-supervised model was trained at a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256. The indoor depth\nmodel is trained at 240\u00d7320. For Waymo we use 256\u00d7384 and for KITTI depth 256\u00d7832. Flow\npretraining is done at a resolution of 320\u00d7448, and finetuning at 320\u00d7768.\nH.2\nDatasets and augmentation\nFor unsupervised pre-training, we use the ImageNet-1K [10] and Places365 [88] datasets and train on\nthe self-supervised tasks of colorization, inpainting, uncropping, and JPEG decompression, following\n[54]. Throughout, we mix datasets at the batch level.\nFlow. For supervised flow pretraining we use a mix of AutoFlow (native resolution 448\u00d7576),\nFlyingThings (540\u00d7960), Kubric (512\u00d7512) and TartanAir (480\u00d7640) synthetic datasets. We\nfinetune on the standard mixture consisting of AutoFlow, FlyingThings, Viper (540\u00d7960), HD1K\n(540\u00d71280), Sintel (436\u00d71024), and KITTI (375\u00d71242).\n23\nWe follow the same photometric and geometric augmentation schemes from [70], comprising random\naffine transformation, flipping, and cropping.\nDepth. For supervised pre-training of the indoor model we mix the following datasets. ScanNet\n[9] is a dataset of 2.5M examples captured using a Kinect v1-like sensor. It provides depth maps\nat 480\u00d7640 and RGB images at 968\u00d71296. SceneNet RGB-D [41] is a synthetic dataset of 5M\nimages generated by rendering ShapeNet [6] objects in scenes from SceneNet [20] at a resolution of\n240\u00d7320.\nFor the outdoor model training we use the Waymo Open Dataset [71], a large-scale driving dataset\nconsisting of about 200k frames. Each frame provides RGB images from 5 cameras and LiDAR\nmaps. We use the RGB images from the FRONT, FRONT_LEFT and FRONT_RIGHT cameras and\nthe TOP LiDAR only to build about 600k aligned RGB depth maps.\nFor indoor fine-tuning and evaluation we use NYU depth v2 [61], a commonly used dataset for\nevaluating indoor depth prediction models. It provides aligned image and depth maps at 480\u00d7640\nresolution. We use the official split comprising 50k images for training and 654 for evaluation.\nFor outdoor fine-tuning and evaluation, we use KITTI [17], an outdoor driving dataset which provides\nRGB images and LiDAR scans at resolutions close to 370\u00d71226. We use the training/test split\nproposed by [13], comprising 26k training images and 652 test images.\nWe use random horizontal flip data augmentation which is common in prior work. Where needed,\nimages and dense depth maps are resized using bilinear interpolation to the model\u2019s resolution for\ntraining and nearest neighbor interpolation is used for sparse maps.\nH.3\nStep-unrolling and interpolation of missing depth and flow\nAs discussed in Section 3.2 of the main paper, infilling and step-unrolling are used to mitigate\ndistribution shift between training and inference with diffusion models. The problem arises due to\nthe missing data in the training depth maps and flow fields.\nInfilling. For indoor depth maps, we use nearest neighbor interpolation during training (see Section\n3.2 in the main paper). For the outdoor depth data we use nearest neighbor interpolation except for\nsky regions, as they are often large and are much further from the camera than adjacent objects in the\nimage. We use an off-the-shelf sky segmenter [36], and then set all sky pixels to be the maximum\nmodeled depth (here, 80m). For missing optical flow ground truth we employ a simple sequence of\n1D nearest neighbor interpolations first along rows, and then along columns.\nTable 16: Ablation of the number of unroll steps for monocular depth estimation. Performs improves up\nto four steps of unrolling and plateaus thereafter. The models trained without infilling missing depth benefit\nmore from a larger number of unroll steps, which is to be expected. Best and second best results are bolded and\nunderlined respectively.\nNYU\nKITTI\nNo infill\nInfill\nNo infill\nInfill\nUnroll steps\nREL\nRMS\nREL\nRMS\nREL\nRMS\nREL\nRMS\n0\n0.079\n0.331\n0.077\n0.338\n0.222\n3.770\n0.057\n2.744\n1\n0.076\n0.324\n0.075\n0.324\n0.085\n2.844\n0.056\n2.700\n2\n0.076\n0.317\n0.075\n0.315\n0.068\n2.799\n0.054\n2.629\n3\n0.075\n0.316\n0.074\n0.317\n0.061\n2.789\n0.054\n2.591\n4\n0.075\n0.316\n0.074\n0.315\n0.059\n2.739\n0.053\n2.568\nStep-unrolling. By default we use a single unroll step in all results where step-unrolling is enabled.\nIn Table 16, we show that using multiple unroll steps can further improve performance on the task of\nmonocular depth estimation.\nFinally, while we use infilling and step-unrolling, there are other ways in which one might try to\nmitigate the problem. One such approach was taken by [46], which faced a similar problem when\ntraining a vector-quantizer on depth data. Their approach was to synthetically add more holes\nfollowing a carefully chosen masking ratio. We prefer our approach since nearest neighbor infilling\n24\nis hyper-parameter free and step-unrolled denoising diffusion could be more generally applicable to\nother tasks with sparse data.\nTable 17: Comparison of step-unrolling and self-conditioning [8]\nNYU\nKITTI\nNo infill\nInfill\nNo infill\nInfill\nREL\nRMS\nREL\nRMS\nREL\nRMS\nREL\nRMS\nBaseline\n0.079\n0.331\n0.077\n0.338\n0.222\n3.770\n0.057\n2.744\nSelf conditioning\n0.082\n0.335\n0.081\n0.333\n0.242\n3.940\n0.057\n2.761\nStep unrolling\n0.076\n0.324\n0.075\n0.324\n0.085\n2.844\n0.056\n2.700\nWe also considered the approach of self-conditioning [8] as an alternative to step-unrolling. However,\nas we show in Table 17, we find that self-conditioning is unable to bridge the train-inference\ndistribution shift of the noisy latent for the task of monocular depth estimation. This is specially\napparent in the results for KITTI without infilling where self conditioning leads to no improvement\nwhereas step-unrolling substantially improves performance.\nH.4\nHyper-parameters\nSelf-supervised. The self-supervised model is trained for 2.8M steps with an L2 loss and a mini-batch\nsize of 512. Other hyper-parameters are same as those in the original Palette paper [54].\nSupervised. The supervised flow and depth models are trained with L1 loss. Usually a constant\nlearning rate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 with a warm-up over 10k steps is used. However, for depth fine-tuning we\nfind that a lower learning rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 achieves slightly better results. All models are trained\nwith a mini-batch size of 64. The indoor depth model is pre-trained for 2M steps and then fine-tuned\non NYU for 40k steps. The outdoor depth model is pre-trained for 0.9M steps and fine-tuned on\nKITTI for 40k steps. For flow, we pretrain for 3.7M steps, followed by finetuning for 50k steps. Other\ndetails, like the optimizer and the use of EMA are the same as [54].\nH.5\nInference\nSampler. We use the DDPM ancestral sampler [21] with 128 denoising steps for monocular depth\nmodels and 64 steps for optical flow models. Increasing the number of denoising steps further did not\ngreatly improve performance.\nCoarse-to-fine refinement. We use 2\u00d75 overlapping patches ({top, bottom} \u00d7 {left, center-left,\ncenter, center-right, right}) for coarse-to-fine refinement. For Sintel we use t\u2032 = 32/64 and for KITTI\nt\u2032 = 8/64.\nI\nLimitations\nTable 18: Inference speed comparison of our method with DPT [50] on the indoor depth model finetuned on\nNYU. Diffusion model inference is bottlenecked by the large number of denoising steps. We show that some\nefficiency gains can be achieved by simply reducing the number of denoising steps. Our model with 24 denoising\nsteps is comparable in performance to DPT while being \u223c5x slower (modulo differences in hardware). * we use\nthe step-time reported in the DPT paper at a resolution of 384 \u00d7 384, however, the DPT performance metrics on\nNYU are with a model trained at a resolution of 480 \u00d7 640, for which the step time will be higher.\nMethod\nArchitecture\nResolution\nTotal Time [ms]\nInference steps\nREL \u2193\nRMS \u2193\nDPT-Hybrid\nNvidia RTX 2080\n384 \u00d7 384*\n38*\n-\n0.110\n0.357\nDDVM\nTPU v4\n240 \u00d7 320\n204\n24\n0.104\n0.378\n272\n32\n0.086\n0.342\n544\n64\n0.077\n0.324\n1089\n128\n0.075\n0.324\nEfficiency. Inference speed with diffusion models is a well-known issue, as multiple denoising steps\nare used to transform noise to a target signal. This can be prohibitive for vision tasks where near\n25\nreal-time latency is often desired. Table 18 compares the inference speed of our diffusion model for\ndepth against DPT [50]. Despite having an efficient denoiser backbone (\u223c8.5 ms per denoising step\non a TPU v4), the diffusion model is considerably slower than DPT in total wall time. The most\nobvious way to reduce inference latency is to reduce the number of denoising steps. This can be\ndone with only moderate reduction in performance. As shown in Table 18, we perform comparably\nwith DPT with as few as 24 denoising steps. However, a more thorough study into optimizing the\ninference speed of these models while preserving the generation quality is warranted. With the use of\nprogressive distillation [42, 56] it is likely possible to reduce latency even further, as this approach\nhas been shown to successfully distill generative image models with over 1000 denoising steps into\nthose with just 2-4 steps.\nFine-tuning on Sintel. In Section 5 we discuss possible reasons for why our model\u2019s superior\nzero-shot performance compared to FlowFormer [23] does not transfer to fine-tuning on Sintel.\nFigure 16 provides qualitative examples to further support the claims.\nTemporally consecutive input frames\nOurs\nFlowFormer [23]\nAmbush 1\nEPE = 29.330\nEPE = 8.141\nCave 3\nEPE = 2.042\nEPE = 2.352\nMarket 1\nEPE = 0.719\nEPE = 1.174\nFigure 16: Visual results on Sintel test.

On Cave 3 and\nMarket 1, our method provides much finer details on motion boundaries with lower end-point error (EPE).\n26\nInput image\nVariance heat map\nMultimodal prediction samples\nFigure 17: Qualitative examples of multimodal estimation on the NYU depth dataset showing examples\nwhere our model\u2019s uncertainty gets captured in the multimodal posterior.

Introduction\nIn the past few years, foundation models have thrived\nand succeeded in linguistic and visual tasks, showing aston-\nishing zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Their advances\nencourage researchers and industries to extend the bound-\naries of what artificial intelligence can do and have shown\nsome fantastic products (e.g., ChatGPT [1]) with the poten-\ntial to change the world.\nRecently, Kirillov et al. [11] proposed a new vision foun-\ndation model for image segmentation, the Segment Any-\nthing Model (SAM), trained on a huge dataset called SA-\n1B. The flexible prompting support, ambiguity awareness,\nand vast training data endow the SAM with powerful gener-\nalization, enabling the ability to solve downstream segmen-\ntation problems using prompt engineering. Some following\nworks leverage the excellent zero-shot capability of SAM\nto solve other 2D vision tasks (e.g., medical image process-\ning [25] and camouflaged object segmentation [20]). Al-\nthough SAM presents great power on some 2D vision tasks,\nwhether it can be adapted to 3D vision tasks still needs to\nbe discovered. With this inspiration, a few works attempt\nto combine SAM with pre-trained 3D models to learn 3D\nscene representation (e.g., SA3D [2]) and single-view re-\nconstruction (e.g., anything-3D [15]), showing promising\nresults.\n3D object detection, one of the fundamental tasks in 3D\nvision, has a wide range of real-world applications (e.g., au-\ntonomous driving). Although plenty of works aim to solve\nthis task, the zero-shot setting on 3D object detection still\nneeds to be explored.\nThus, considering the advance of\nSAM, it is natural to question: Can we adapt the zero-shot\ncapability of SAM to 3D object detection?\nIn this paper, we aim to explore the zero-shot 3D object\ndetection with SAM [11] alone. Considering SAM is ini-\ntially built for 2D images, many challenges exist when us-\ning SAM for 3D detection (Please refer to the appendix for\nmore discussion). The key insight is that we can leverage\n\u2020Corresponding author.\nthe powerful capability of SAM for 3D object detection by\nusing the Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV), which carries crucial 3D\ninformation (e.g., depths) with a 2D image-like data format.\nThus, the challenges to using SAM for 3D detection can\nbe significantly solved. With this observation, we present\nSAM3D, which uses SAM to segment on BEV maps and\npredicts objects based on the masks from its outputs.\nWe evaluate our method on the large-scale Waymo Open\nDataset [19], and the results show the great potential of\nSAM on 3D object detection. Although this paper is only an\nearly attempt, it gives a positive signal for applying vision\nfoundation models like SAM for 3D vision tasks, especially\nfor 3D object detection.\n2. Method\nWe consider point cloud as the input of our method,\nwhich is a 3D representation and naturally sparse, while\nSAM is trained for 2D images with dense semantics. Our\nbasic idea is to translate LiDAR points into a 2D image-\nlike representation with 3D information that narrows the\ndomain gap, thus BEV is a straightforward choice.\nWe\nbuild the whole pipeline with SAM based on BEV, shown\nas Fig. 1(a). Our method mainly contains five steps:\nFirstly, our method conducts the LiDAR-to-BEV pro-\njection, which translates sparse LiDAR signals to discrim-\ninative BEV images. At this step, we use the projection\nequations to determine each point\u2019s coordinate on the im-\nage plane and a predefined intensity-to-RGB mapping to\nget RGB vectors for pixels in a BEV image, making it more\ndiscriminative during processing.\nThen, the BEV post-processing modifies the original\nBEV images with the morphology dilation (interpreted as a\nmax pooling) since SAM is trained on natural images with\n\u201cdense\u201d signals, which differs from the \u201csparse\u201d BEV im-\nages. This step helps form more suitable inputs for SAM,\nleading to easier segmentation and better performance.\nAfter obtaining the desired BEV images, we segment the\nBEV images using SAM, which supports various prompts\narXiv:2306.02245v2  [cs.CV]  29 Jan 2024\nMesh grids\n(prompts)\nBEV image\nSegmentation Masks\nLiDAR\nProjection \nBEV \nPost-processing\nSAM\nMask \nPost-processing\nMask2Box\n3D BBoxes\n3D\n\u201d2D\u201d\n3D\n\u201d2D\u201d\nVersion\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nAP\nAPH\nAP\nAPH\nViT-B\n17.30\n11.58\n16.90\n11.31\nViT-L\n19.94\n13.25\n19.48\n12.93\nViT-H\n19.51\n13.30\n19.05\n12.98\n(a)\n(b)\nPillar size\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nAP\nAPH\nAP\nAPH\n0.05m\n16.45\n11.20\n16.30\n11.11\n0.075m\n18.70\n12.59\n18.25\n12.29\n0.1m\n19.51\n13.30\n19.05\n12.98\n0.125m\n19.25\n13.12\n18.80\n12.81\n0.15m\n18.16\n12.42\n17.73\n12.11\n0.175m\n16.16\n10.88\n15.77\n10.60\n0.2m\n14.06\n9.41\n13.73\n9.18\n0.4m\n~0\n~0\n~0\n~0\n(c)\nFigure 1: (a) The overall framework of our method. We first project LiDAR points to colorful BEV images via a predefined\npalette, then post-process BEV images to better fit the requirements of SAM.

(c) The results of SAM3D using different pillar sizes. We report metrics of VEHICLE in the range [0,30)\non Waymo validation set.\nlike point, box, and mask prompts. Our goal in this step is\nto segment foreground objects as many as possible, so we\nchoose to cover the whole image with mesh grid prompts.\nAdditionally, we prune the prompts in this step without per-\nformance sacrifice to accelerate the segmentation.\nDespite SAM\u2019s powerful zero-shot capability, a non-\nnegligible domain gap still exists. Hence, we propose mask\npost-processing for filtering noisy masks according to some\nrules drawn from priors, which reduces the number of false\npositives and helps improve the final performance.\nFinally, after the segmentation and post-processing, we\npredict 3D bounding boxes from the foreground masks.\nSince BEV images already carry depth information, we can\ndirectly estimate the horizontal attributes (i.e., horizontal\nobject center, length, width, and heading) of 3D bound-\ning boxes from the 2D masks. Meanwhile, for the vertical\nattributes (i.e., vertical object center and height), LiDAR\npoints will be utilized as extra information compensation.\nPlease refer to the appendix for more detailed methods.\n3. Experiments\nWe\nevaluate\nour\nmethod\non\nthe\nWaymo\nOpen\nDataset [19], one of the large-scale datasets for autonomous\ndriving. The dataset is split into 798 training sequences, 202\nvalidation sequences, and 150 testing sequences. Since our\nmethod performs zero-shot object detection, we only focus\non the validation sequences. For the metrics, because of\nthe natural sparsity of point clouds and the lack of seman-\ntic label outputs, we only care about the mAP and mAPH\nof VEHICLE with a distance of at most 30 meters in this\npaper.\nSince SAM uses different backbones with different com-\nplexities, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effective-\nness of our method, shown in Fig. 1(b). It reveals that using\nSAM with less capacity performs worse. However, there is\nonly a marginal difference between SAM with ViT-L and\nViT-H. We argue that the model capacity is not the perfor-\nmance bottleneck when using large models, and the power\nof SAM still needs to be fully unleashed. For insurance\npurposes, we use SAM with ViT-H. We also conduct exper-\niments to determine how the pillar size influences the per-\nformance in Fig. 1(c). When using larger pillar sizes such as\n0.2m and 0.4m, the discretization errors are relatively large,\nand it is hard to distinguish different objects when they are\nclose to each other. However, pillar sizes that are too small\nalso harm performance. One possible reason is that due to\nthe high resolution of the small pillar size and the sparsity\nof LiDAR signals, it is difficult for individual instances to\nform a completely connected region. SAM tends to separate\none object into many parts. We set the pillar size as 0.1m,\nwhich is a good balance. Please refer to the appendix for all\ndetailed results.\n4. Conclusion\nThis paper explores the zero-shot 3D object detection\nwith the visual foundation model SAM and proposes the\nSAM3D. To narrow the gap between the training data of\nSAM and 3D LiDAR signals, we use the BEV images to\nrepresent 3D outdoor scenes. We propose a SAM-powered\nBEV processing pipeline to utilize the great zero-shot capa-\nbility of SAM for zero-shot 3D object detection. Qualita-\ntive and ablation experiments on the Waymo open dataset\nshow promising results for adapting the zero-shot ability of\nSAM to 3D object detection. Although this paper is only\nan early attempt, we believe it presents a possibility and op-\nportunity to unleash the power of foundation models like\nSAM on 3D tasks with technologies like few-shot learn-\ning, model distillation, and prompt engineering in the fu-\nture.

Appendix\n6.1. Related Work\n6.1.1\n2D tasks with SAM\nKirillov et al. [11] proposed a new vision foundation model\nfor image segmentation, the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), trained on a huge dataset called SA-1B to solve the\nsegment anything task. The flexible prompting support, am-\nbiguity awareness, and vast training data endow the SAM\nwith powerful generalization, enabling the ability to solve\ndownstream segmentation problems using prompt engineer-\ning, inspiring many following works. SAMPolyp [25] ap-\nplies SAM to the polyp segmentation task under the un-\nprompted settings. Deng et al. [6] assess the zero-shot seg-\nmentation performance of the SAM model on digital pathol-\nogy tasks and find that SAM achieves remarkable segmen-\ntation performance for large connected objects. He et al. [7]\ntest SAM\u2019s accuracy in 12 medical image datasets, reveal-\ning that SAM is more accurate in 2D medical images, larger\ntarget region sizes, and easier cases. SAMCOD [20] evalu-\nates SAM\u2019s performance on camouflaged object detection\n(COD) benchmarks, indicating that SAM can achieve a\nnoteworthy performance compared to some COD-oriented\nmethods. Ji et al. [10] compare SAM with cutting-edge\nmethods and observe the limited power of SAM in con-\ncealed scenes. These works focus on utilizing the SAM\non 2D tasks like medical image analysis and camouflaged\nobject detection, while our method explores the ability of\nSAM on the 3D perception task.\n6.1.2\n3D tasks with SAM\nAlthough SAM presents great power on some 2D vision\ntasks, whether it can be adapted to 3D vision tasks still\nneeds to be discovered. With this inspiration, a few works\nattempt to combine SAM with pre-trained 3D models.\nSA3D [2] generalizes SAM to segment 3D objects by lever-\naging the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a cheap and\noff-the-shelf prior, which constructs the 3D mask of the tar-\nget object via alternately performing the proposed mask in-\nverse rendering and cross-view self-prompting across vari-\nous views. Anything-3D [15] combines BLIP, a pre-trained\n2D text-to-image diffusion model, and SAM for the single-\nview conditioned 3D reconstruction task, showing promis-\ning results. 3D-Box-Segment-Anything [3] utilizes SAM\nwith a pre-trained 3D detector VoxelNeXt [4] for interactive\n3D detection and labeling. Unlike them, our method ex-\nplores zero-shot 3D object detection with SAM alone (i.e.,\nit DOES NOT rely on any other pre-trained model).\n6.1.3\n3D object detection\n3D object detection, one of the fundamental tasks in 3D\nvision, has a wide range of real-world applications (e.g.,\nautonomous driving). There are plenty of works [22, 12,\n16, 4, 13, 24, 26, 21] aim to solve this task. SECOND [22]\nand PointPillars [12] convert the point cloud into grid-based\nrepresentation and introduce the sparse convolution and pil-\nlars representation, respectively, to solve the 3D object de-\ntection with low time consumption. PointRCNN [18] pro-\nposes to process the point cloud directly and segment the\npoint cloud before the second-stage refinement for gener-\nating high-quality proposals. PVRCNN [16] combines 3D\nCNN and point-based operations to learn more represen-\ntative features.\nVoxelNeXt [4] introduces a fully sparse\nvoxel-based pipeline for 3D object detection without re-\nlying on hand-crafted proxies, achieving a better speed-\naccuracy trade-off. QTNet [9] proposes a new query-based\ntemporal fusion method to facilitate temporal detection ef-\nficiency.\nViT-WSS3D [24] offers a novel weakly semi-\nsupervised paradigm to lower the dependencies on expen-\nsive 3D annotations. Although 3D object detection with 3D\nannotations has been widely studied, the zero-shot setting\non 3D object detection, which has significant practical value\n(e.g., low-cost data labeling), still needs to be explored. In\nthis paper, we aim to explore zero-shot 3D object detection\nwith the aid of SAM.\n6.2. Preliminary\n6.2.1\nDefinitions of 3D object detection\nSimilar to 2D object detection, the goal of 3D object detec-\ntion is to predict the locations and categories of all objects\nof interest given the perceptive sensor data (e.g., LiDAR\npoints for LiDAR-based 3D object detection and camera\nimages for camera-based 3D object detection). In this pa-\nper, we focus on the LiDAR-based 3D object detection. To\nbe more specific, given LiDAR points P = {(xi, yi, zi)}Np\ni=1\nof the scene, 3D detectors need to infer about all objects\nO = {(ci, B3D\ni\n)}No\ni=1 in the scene, where ci and B3D\ni\nare\nthe category and geometric attributes of the i-th object, and\nNo is the number of objects. Typically, we define the geo-\nmetric attributes as object centers, dimensions, and orienta-\ntions, formally written as:\nB3D\ni\n= (x3D\ni\n, y3D\ni\n, z3D\ni\n, dx3D\ni\n, dy3D\ni\n, dz3D\ni\n, \u03b83D\ni\n),\n(1)\nwhere (x3D\ni\n, y3D\ni\n, z3D\ni\n), (dx3D\ni\n, dy3D\ni\n, dz3D\ni\n), and \u03b83D\ni\nare\nthe 3D center, dimension, and orientation of the i-th object,\nrespectively.\n6.2.2\nChallenges of 3D object detection using SAM\nSince SAM was initially trained for 2D segmentation with\nnatural images, many inherent challenges exist to adopting\nSAM for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this section,\nwe provide a more in-depth discussion of these challenges,\nwhich can be categorized into the following parts:\nThe input data of SAM and 3D detectors are dramat-\nically different. On the one hand, the formats of input data\nare different. The original SAM takes 2D images as in-\nputs, which consist of \u201cdense\u201d pixels distributed evenly on\nthe entire 2D image plane. However, for LiDAR-based 3D\nobject detection, the inputs are LiDAR points, representing\nthe location of \u201csparse\u201d points spread unevenly across the\n3D space. On the other hand, the information contained in\ninputs is different. The original SAM is trained with natu-\nral images, with pixels carrying rich semantic information,\nwhile LiDAR points only carry the geometrical information\nof 3D scenes. To narrow the gap of input data, we use the\nBird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) as the media because of its 2D for-\nmat and 3D information awareness.\nThe output data of SAM and 3D detectors are sig-\nnificantly distinct. SAM outputs 2D segmentation masks\nindicating the possible foreground pixels, while typical 3D\ndetectors output 3D bounding boxes. Translating the 2D\nsegmentation masks into 3D bounding boxes is a pivotal\nproblem. Thanks to the property of outdoor scenes that no\nobjects stack vertically at the same position, we can lever-\nage the BEV maps and input LiDAR points to finish the\ntranslation, and finally equipped with SAM to form a 3D\ndetector.\nThe capability of 3D perception of SAM is limited. In\nthis paper, we aim to explore zero-shot 3D object detection,\nwhich means there are no 3D samples for models to train,\nand since SAM is only trained with 2D images, its 3D per-\nception capability is limited. To overcome this challenge\nas much as possible, we use the BEV to \u201cdisguise\u201d 3D in-\nformation into 2D form. Moreover, because of the limited\n3D capacity of SAM, its outputs will be noisy, and we pro-\npose rule-based post-processing to filter noisy masks, which\nhelps improve performance a lot.\n6.3. Proposed Method\n6.3.1\nOverall framework\nOur method mainly contains five steps:\n\u2022 LiDAR-to-BEV projection translates LiDAR signals to\nBEV images.\n\u2022 BEV post-processing modifies original BEV images\nwith a simple operation.\n\u2022 SAM [11] takes in modified BEV images and mesh\ngrid prompts to segment foreground objects in BEV. In\norder to accelerate the segmentation process, we prune\nthe prompts in this step without performance sacrifice.\n\u2022 Mask post-processing filters noisy masks according to\nsome rules drawn from priors, which reduces the num-\nber of false positives.\n\u2022 Mask2Box finds the minimum bounding boxes of fore-\nground masks to extract 2D boxes in BEV and then\ninteracts with LiDAR points, predicting the final 3D\nbounding boxes of objects.\nIn the following sections, we will describe the detailed de-\nsigns for each step.\n6.3.2\nLiDAR-to-BEV projection\nThe duty of LiDAR-to-BEV projection is to translate Np\nLiDAR points P = {(xi, yi, zi)}Np\ni=1 with range Lx \u2264 xi \u2264\nUx, Ly \u2264 yi \u2264 Uy to a single BEV image I \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d73.\nEach point will fall into a grid of BEV image, and the\nposition of grid (cx, cy) is calculated as follow:\ncxi = \u230a(Ux \u2212 xi)/sx\u230b,\n(2)\ncyi = \u230a(Uy \u2212 yi)/sy\u230b,\n(3)\nwhere sx, sy are the pillar size of x and y axes, Ux, Uy are\nthe coordinate upper bounds of x and y axes respectively,\nand \u230a\u00b7\u230b means the floor function.\nAfter obtaining the positions of grids, we need to get the\nvalues filled into the BEV image. In order to make segmen-\ntation easier, we want the BEV image to be discriminative.\nOne finding is that the reflection intensity of points is\nuseful, which means we can utilize the intensity R =\n{ri}Np\ni=1 to form the feature vectors of grids in a BEV im-\nage. Concretely, we first regularize the intensity to [0, 1],\nand then take it to select color vectors from a predefined\npalette, which can be formally written as:\nci = Palette(Norm(ri)) \u2208 R3,\n(4)\nI[cxi, cyi, :] = ci,\n(5)\nwhere Palette : R \u2192 R3 is the predefined palette used for\ntranslating an intensity scalar to an RGB vector.\nFor those grids without projected points, we simply fill\nin all zero vectors. Now we get a discriminative BEV image\nI \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d73.\n6.3.3\nBEV post-processing\nSince SAM is trained on natural images, which contain\n\u201ddense\u201d signals and differ from the \u201dsparse\u201d BEV images,\nwe need to post-process BEV images to narrow the gap. We\nuse the morphology dilation in this paper, which can be in-\nterpreted as a max pooling, shown as Eq. 6.\nI\u2032 = MaxPool2D(I),\n(6)\nwhere I\u2032 is the BEV image after post-processing.\n6.3.4\nSegmentation with SAM\nNow, we segment the BEV image using SAM, which sup-\nports various prompts like point, box, and mask prompts.\nOur goal in this step is to segment foreground objects as\nmany as possible, so we choose to cover the whole image\nwith mesh grid prompts. Specifically, we create 32 \u00d7 32\nmesh grids evenly distributed on the image plane and re-\ngard them as point prompts to SAM.\nAlthough this can cover the whole image, it could be\nmore efficient due to the natural sparsity of BEV images,\nwith many prompts falling into empty space. Based on this\nobservation, we prune the prompts. In particular, we project\nthese prompts onto the BEV image, check the neighbor area\nof each prompt, and then discard prompts with no activated\npixels around. This operation accelerates the whole pipeline\ndramatically, bringing 5\u00d7 speed up (from 0.4 FPS to 2 FPS\non a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090).\nAt the end of this step, we now get Nm segmentation\nmasks M = {mi \u2208 RH\u00d7W }Nm\ni=1 from SAM.\n6.3.5\nMask post-processing\nDespite SAM\u2019s powerful zero-shot capability, a non-\nnegligible domain gap still exists. Hence, the masks from\nSAM are noisy and need further processing.\nIn scenes of autonomous driving, typical cars have cer-\ntain areas and aspect ratios, which can be used to filter out\nsome false positives in masks M. In detail, we filter the\nnoisy segmentation masks using an area threshold [T a\nl , T a\nh ]\nand an aspect ratio threshold [T r\nl , T r\nh]. With these opera-\ntions, we finally obtain No relative high-quality foreground\nmasks M \u2032 = {mi \u2208 RH\u00d7W }No\ni=1, each mask corresponds\nto a foreground object.\n6.3.6\nMask2Box\nAfter the segmentation, we need to predict 3D bounding\nboxes B3D from the foreground masks M \u2032. Since BEV im-\nages already carry depth information, we can directly esti-\nmate the horizontal attributes (i.e., horizontal object center,\nlength, width, and heading) of 3D bounding boxes from the\n2D masks. Meanwhile, for the vertical attributes (i.e., verti-\ncal object center and height), LiDAR points will be utilized\nas extra information compensation.\nWe first extract the 2D minimum bounding boxes from\nmasks, defined as Eq. 7.\nB2D = {(x2D\ni\n, y2D\ni\n, dx2D\ni\n, dy2D\ni\n, \u03b82D\ni\n)}No\ni=1,\n(7)\nwhere (x2D\ni\n, y2D\ni\n), (dx2D\ni\n, dy2D\ni\n), and \u03b82D\ni\nare the 2D cen-\nter, dimension, and rotate angle of the i-th object. No is the\nnumber of objects.\nThen, we project these 2D attributes back to correspond-\ning 3D attributes:\nx3D\ni\n= Ux \u2212 (x2D\ni\n+ 0.5) \u00d7 sx,\n(8)\ny3D\ni\n= Uy \u2212 (y2D\ni\n+ 0.5) \u00d7 sy,\n(9)\ndx3D\ni\n= dx2D\ni\n\u00d7 sx,\n(10)\ndy3D\ni\n= dy2D\ni\n\u00d7 sy,\n(11)\n\u03b83D\ni\n= \u03b82D\ni\n,\n(12)\nwhere Ux, Uy are the point cloud ranges and sx, sy are the\npillar size, defined in Sec. 6.3.2.\nFinally, we estimate the vertical centers and heights with\nLiDAR points. The main idea is that we select points whose\nBEV projections are inside the 2D bounding boxes and cal-\nculate the vertical attributes using their vertical coordinates:\nZi = {zj|(xj, yj, zj) inside B3D\ni\n},\n(13)\ndz3D\ni\n= max (Zi) \u2212 min (Zi),\n(14)\nz3D\ni\n= min (Zi) + dz3D\ni\n2\n.\n(15)\n6.4. Experiments\n6.4.1\nHyperparameters\nWe set the point cloud range Lx = Ly = \u221230.0m, Ux =\nUy = 30.0m and the pillar size sx = sy = 0.1m by\ndefault. We use a 3 \u00d7 3 kernel for the dilation in BEV\npost-processing. For mask post-processing, we set the area\nthresholds T a\nl = 200, T a\nh = 5000 pixels, and the aspect ra-\ntio thresholds T r\nl = 1.5, T r\nh = 4, respectively. For SAM\narchitecture, we use the default version (ViT-H) with pre-\ntrained weights from its official repository.\n6.4.2\nQualitative results\nWe first show the qualitative results of our method. Fig. 2\nshows that relatively high-quality 2D rotated bounding\nboxes are generated from SAM outputs, indicating SAM\u2019s\ngreat zero-capability. It means that SAM can generate good\nmasks without touching BEV images and 3D annotations\nduring training. Our mask post-processing and Mask2Box\nmodule can translate foreground masks into high-quality 3D\nbounding boxes. It shows that for those objects that are per-\nceived completely and have distinguishable appearances in\nBEV images, SAM3D can identify them easily and produce\nreasonable predictions.\nDespite SAM\u2019s incredible power, some obvious failure\ncases still exist: (1) SAM will generate duplicated masks\nwhen objects are close to each other (marked as red bub-\nbles in Fig. 2). We argue that it is hard for SAM to identify\nwhether these points belong to different objects or a single\nlarge object since it is not trained to handle this situation. (2)\nSome background objects look similar to cars in BEV im-\nages, and SAM sometimes regards them as foregrounds by\nmistake (marked as blue bubbles in Fig. 2). (3) Due to trun-\ncation, occlusion, and the sparsity of LiDAR signals, some\ncars are partially activated in BEV images. Thus, SAM ig-\nnores these objects, leaving many false negatives (marked\nas white bubbles in Fig. 2). We argue that (2) and (3) are in-\nherent challenges for LiDAR-based 3D object detection and\nare even more complex for a model trained initially for 2D\nsegmentation tasks. While our method provides some naive\nsolutions, it still demands many efforts (e.g., more powerful\nbackground suppression or foreground completion methods\ncan be involved) to solve these problems more perfectly.\nMoreover, as [10] depicts, SAM struggles to segment cam-\nouflaged objects. We can view those objects in (2) and (3)\nas camouflaged, thus getting poor results. It means we need\nmore powerful technologies to enhance SAM\u2019s ability.\n6.4.3\nAblation study\nWe conduct ablation studies to figure out the contribution of\ndifferent designs. We report the AP and APH for all exper-\niments only for VEHICLE in the range [0, 30).\nThe effects of pillar size. According to Eq. 2, the pillar\nsize will affect the resolution of BEV images, thus influenc-\ning the segmentation results of SAM. In the letter, we report\nthe effects of pillar size. To make its effects more intuitive,\nwe visualize the BEV under different pillar size settings in\nFig. 3. When using larger pillar sizes such as 0.2m and\n0.4m, the discretization errors are relatively large, and it\nis hard to distinguish different objects when they are close\nto each other. However, pillar sizes that are too small also\nharm the performance. One possible reason is that due to\nthe high resolution of the small pillar size and the sparsity\nof LiDAR signals, it is difficult for individual instances to\nTable 1: The results of SAM3D using different types of\nBEV images.\nWe report metrics of VEHICLE in range\n[0,30) on Waymo validation set.\nBEV type\nLevel1\nLevel2\nAP\nAPH\nAP\nAPH\nBinary\n0.94\n0.55\n0.92\n0.53\nIntensity\n1.93\n1.17\n1.88\n1.14\nIntensity + Palette\n19.51\n13.30\n19.05\n12.98\nTable 2: The ablations of post-processes.

SAM tends to separate\none object into many parts. We set the pillar size as 0.1m,\nwhich is a good balance.\nThe effects of reflection intensity. The way to project\npoints into a BEV determines the visual appearance of BEV\nimages, affecting the segmentation. In 6.3.2, we claim that\nusing the reflection intensity of points and a predefined\nintensity-to-RGB mapping is helpful, and we evaluate its\neffects in this subsection. We compare our method with two\nother types: binary and intensity. For binary type, a pixel in\na BEV image will be set to white if any point is projected\ninto it, or it will be black otherwise. For intensity type, we\nuse the normalized intensity as the grayscale. In Tab. 1, we\ncan see that using intensity brings gains against the naive\nbinary type, and mapping the intensity to rgb space further\ndramatically boosts the performance. Because the intensity\nand RGB mapping make BEV images more discriminative,\nSAM segments them more easily and precisely, thus im-\nproving the performance of the proposed method.\nThe effects of BEV post-processing. In 6.3.3, we use\nthe morphology dilation to post-process the BEV image for\nbetter segmentation. We conduct experiments to figure out\nits effect in this subsection, shown in the first row of Tab. 2.\nWithout BEV post-processing, it drops about 8% AP and\n5% APH on both Level 1 and Level 2. As we have claimed,\nBEV post-processing helps narrow the gap between BEV\nand natural images (training data of SAM), leading to better\nresults.\nThe effects of mask post-processing.\nIn Sec. 6.3.5,\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(f)\n(d)\n(e)\n(g)\n(h)\n(i)\nFigure 2: The visualizations of results from SAM3D.

We\nalso conduct experiments to test its effect, shown in the sec-\nond and third row of Tab. 2. Since a non-negligible do-\nmain gap still exists and the masks from SAM are noisy, it\nis obvious that all operations in mask post-processing are\nessential.

This is because SAM is not orientation-aware, and the\norientation predictions come from the minimum oriented\nbounding boxes estimation of segmentation masks, which\nTable 3: The results of SAM3D and fully-supervised 3D\ndetectors.

Discussion\nThrough the qualitative results and ablation studies, we\nshow that it is possible to leverage SAM, trained on large-\nscale segmentation datasets without any 3D annotation, to\nsolve the zero-shot object detection task for outdoor scenes.\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement in our\ncurrent method, and we leave these issues to be solved in\nthe future:\n\u2022 Utilizing BEV images as representations means our\nmethod may be unsuitable for indoor scenes. Finding\na better scene representation will be a good solution.\n\u2022 Due to the occlusion, truncation, and sparsity of Li-\nDAR points, our method generates many false nega-\ntives, especially for distant objects. Considering the\ninformation from other modalities will be helpful.\n\u2022 Although we have already reduced the inference time\nby 5\u00d7, the inference speed (2 FPS on a single NVIDIA\nGeForce RTX 4090) is still limited to the complexity\nof SAM, especially when the number of point prompts\nis large. Conducting model compression and distilla-\ntion might solve this problem.\n\u2022 Our method currently does not support multi-class\ndetection because of the lack of semantic label out-\nputs from SAM. One possible solution is to leverage\n3D vision-language models (e.g., CLIP Goes 3D [8],\nCrowdCLIP [14]) for zero-shot classification.\nWe believe our method shows the great possibility and\nopportunity to unleash the potential of foundation models\nlike SAM on 3D vision tasks, especially on 3D object detec-\ntion. With technologies like few-shot learning and prompt\nengineering, we can use vision foundation models more ef-\nfectively to solve 3D tasks better, especially considering the\nvast difference between scales of 2D and 3D data.\nReferences\n[1] Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Sub-\nbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind Neelakan-\ntan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, et al.\nLanguage models are few-shot learners.

We study gener-\native VLMs that are trained for next-word gen-\neration given an image. We explore their zero-\nshot performance on the illustrative task of image-\ntext retrieval across nine popular vision-language\nbenchmarks. Our first observation is that they\ncan be repurposed for discriminative tasks (such\nas image-text retrieval) by simply computing the\nmatch score of generating a particular text string\ngiven an image. We call this probabilistic score\nthe Visual Generative Pre-Training Score (Visual-\nGPTScore). While the VisualGPTScore produces\nnear-perfect accuracy on some retrieval bench-\nmarks, it yields poor accuracy on others. We\nanalyze this behavior through a probabilistic lens,\npointing out that some benchmarks inadvertently\ncapture unnatural language distributions by cre-\nating adversarial but unlikely text captions. In\nfact, we demonstrate that even a \u201cblind\u201d language\nmodel that ignores any image evidence can some-\ntimes outperform all prior art, reminiscent of sim-\nilar challenges faced by the visual-question an-\nswering (VQA) community many years ago. We\nderive a probabilistic post-processing scheme that\ncontrols for the amount of linguistic bias in gener-\native VLMs at test time without having to retrain\nor fine-tune the model. We show that the Visu-\nalGPTScore, when appropriately debiased, is a\nstrong zero-shot baseline for vision-language un-\nderstanding, oftentimes producing state-of-the-art\naccuracy.\n1.

One reason for\ntheir widespread adoption is their ability to be used in\nan \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d (OTS) or zero-shot manner without fine-\ntuning for specific target applications. In this study, we\nexplore their OTS use on the task of image-text retrieval\n(e.g., given an image, predict the correct caption out of K\noptions) across a suite of nine popular benchmarks.\nChallenges. While the performance of foundational VLMs\nis impressive, many open challenges remain. Recent anal-\nyses (Kamath et al., 2023; Yuksekgonul et al., 2022) point\nout that leading VLMs such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)\nmay often degrade to \u201cbag-of-words\u201d that confuse captions\nsuch as \u201cthe horse is eating the grass\u201d and\n\u201cthe grass is eating the horse\u201d. This makes\nit difficult to use VLMs to capture compositions of objects,\nattributes, and their relations. But somewhat interestingly,\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs) trained for autoregres-\nsive next-token prediction (Brown et al., 2020) seem to be\nable to discern such distinctions, which we investigate be-\nlow. A related but under-appreciated difficulty is that of\nbenchmarking the performance of visio-linguistic reasoning.\nPerhaps the most well-known example in the community is\nthat of the influential VQA benchmarks (Antol et al., 2015),\nwhich could be largely solved by exploiting linguistic biases\nin the dataset \u2013 concretely, questions about images could\noften be answered by \u201cblind\u201d language-only models that did\nnot look at the image (Goyal et al., 2017). Notably, we find\nthat such blind algorithms still excel on many contemporary\nimage-text retrieval benchmarks where VLMs may struggle.\nGenerative models for discriminative tasks. We tackle the\nabove challenges by revisiting the role of language priors\nthrough a probabilistic lens. To allow for a probabilistic\ntreatment, we focus on generative VLMs that take an image\nas input and stochastically generate text via next-token pre-\ndiction (Li et al., 2022; 2023). We first demonstrate that such\nmodels can be easily repurposed for discriminative tasks\n(such as retrieval) by setting the match score for an image-\ntext pair to be the probability that the VLM would generate\nthat text from the given image, or P(text|image). We call\nthis probability score the Visual Generative Pre-Training\nScore, or VisualGPTScore. Computing the VisualGPTScore\nis even more efficient than next-token generation since given\nan image, all tokens from a candidate text string can be eval-\nuated in parallel. Though conceptually straightforward, such\n1\narXiv:2306.01879v3  [cs.CV]  1 Feb 2024\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nan approach is not a common baseline. In fact, the genera-\ntive VLMs (Li et al., 2022) that we analyze train separate\ndiscriminative heads for matching/classifying image-text\npairs, but we find that their language generation head itself\nproduces better scores for matching (since it appears to bet-\nter capture compositions). Indeed, the OTS VisualGPTScore\nperforms surprisingly well on many benchmarks, even pro-\nducing near-perfect accuracy on ARO (Yuksekgonul et al.,\n2022). But it still struggles on other benchmarks such as\nWinoground (Thrush et al., 2022). We analyze this below.\nThe role of language priors. We analyze the discrepancy\nin performance across benchmarks from a probabilistic\nperspective. Our key insight is that many benchmark bi-\nases can be formalized as mismatching distributions over\ntext between foundational pre-training data and benchmark\ntest data \u2013 Ptrain(text) versus Ptest(text). We use a first-\nprinciples analysis to account for distribution shift by sim-\nply reweighting the VisualGPTScore with the Bayes fac-\ntor Ptest(text)/Ptrain(text), a process we call debiasing.\nTo compute the Bayes reweighting factor, we need access\nto both the train and test language prior.\nWe compute\nPtrain(text) from an OTS VLM by drawing Monte-Carlo\nsamples of Ptrain(text|image) from the trainset or Gaussian\nnoise images. Because Ptest(text) may require access to the\ntest set, we explore practical variants that assume Ptest is (a)\nidentical to Ptrain(text), (b) uninformative/uniform, or (c)\nlearnable from a small held-out valset. Our analysis helps\nexplain the strong performance of the VisualGPTScore on\ncertain benchmarks and its poor performance on others.\nMoreover, our analysis offers simple strategies to improve\nperformance through debiasing without requiring any re-\ntraining. We conclude by showing a theoretical connection\nbetween debiasing and mutual information, which can be\nseen as a method for removing the effect of marginal priors\nwhen computing joint probability scores (cf. Appendix A).\nEmpirical analysis.\nWe conduct a thorough empiri-\ncal evaluation of the OTS VisualGPTScore (and its de-\nbiased variants) for open-sourced image-conditioned lan-\nguage models (Li et al., 2022; 2023; Liu et al., 2023)\nacross nine popular vision-language benchmarks.\nWe\nfirst point out that the VisualGPTScore by itself produces\nSOTA accuracy on certain benchmarks like ARO (Yuk-\nsekgonul et al., 2022) where their inherent language bi-\nases help remove incorrect captions that are also unnatural\n(such as \u201ca white duck the its wings while\nin water\u201d as shown in Fig. 1). In fact, we show that\nblind baselines also do quite well on these benchmarks,\nsince language-only models can easily identify such im-\nplausible captions.\nHowever, such language biases do\nnot work well on benchmarks where incorrect captions\nare carefully constructed to be realistic.\nHere, Visual-\nGPTScore should be debiased so as not to naively prefer\nmore common captions that score well under its language\nprior. Debiasing consistently improves performance on\nbenchmarks such as Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014) and\nWinoground (Thrush et al., 2022). Interestingly, we find\nthat debiasing can also improve accuracy on the train set\nused to learn the generative VLMs, indicating that such\nmodels learn biased estimates of the true conditional dis-\ntribution Ptrain(text|image). We describe this further in\nour Appendix B. Finally, our approach sets a new state-of-\nthe-art on image-text alignment (Thrush et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2023), showing potential to replace the widely-used\nCLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021) in text-to-image evaluation.\n2. Related works\nVision-language models.\nState-of-the-art VLMs like\nCLIP (Radford et al., 2021) are pre-trained on web-scale\nimage-text datasets (Schuhmann et al., 2022) using discrim-\ninative objectives like image-text contrastive (ITC) (Rad-\nford et al., 2021) and image-text matching (ITM) (Li et al.,\n2021) loss, typically formulated as P(match|image, text).\nThese pre-trained models exhibit robust zero-shot and few-\nshot (Lin et al., 2023; Wortsman et al., 2022) performance\non traditional discriminative tasks (Deng et al., 2009; Lin\net al., 2014), often on par with fully-supervised models.\nMore recently, image-conditioned language models like\nFlamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) and BLIP (Li et al., 2022;\n2023) incorporate generative objectives primarily for down-\nstream tasks such as captioning (Agrawal et al., 2019) and\nVQA (Goyal et al., 2017).\nVisio-linguistic compositionality.\nBenchmarks like\nARO (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022), Crepe (Ma et al., 2022),\nWinoground (Thrush et al., 2022), EqBen (Wang et al.,\n2023), VL-CheckList (Zhao et al., 2022), and Sugar-\nCrepe (Hsieh et al., 2023) show that discriminative scores of\nVLMs, such as ITCScore and ITMScore, fail on their image-\ntext retrieval tasks that assess compositional reasoning. Con-\ncurrently, advances on these tasks often involve fine-tuning\ndiscriminative VLMs with more data. One of the most\npopular approaches, NegCLIP (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022),\naugments CLIP using programmatically generated nega-\ntives from original texts. Extending this, subsequent studies\npropose more expensive and heavily-engineered solutions.\nSyViC (Cascante-Bonilla et al., 2023) fine-tunes VLMs on\nmillion-scale synthetic images to augment spatial, attribu-\ntive, and relation understanding. SGVL (Herzig et al., 2023)\nand Structure-CLIP (Huang et al., 2023) sample negatives\nusing costly scene graph annotations. MosaiCLIP (Singh\net al., 2023) and SVLC (Doveh et al., 2022) use linguistic\ntools such as scene graph parsers and LLMs to design bet-\nter negative captions. The most recent DAC (Doveh et al.,\n2023) leverages a combination of foundation models includ-\ning BLIP2, ChatGPT, and SAM to rewrite and augment\nimage captions. In contrast, we demonstrate that OTS gen-\n2\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nFigure 1. Two train-test shifts encountered in image-to-text retrieval tasks. Scenario 1 (left) constructs negative captions by shuffling\nwords in the true caption (as in ARO-Flickr (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022)), but this produces implausible text such as \u201cwhite a duck\nspreads its wings in while the water\u201d. Here, exploiting the language bias of the training set will help since it will\ndownweight the match score for such implausible negative captions. In fact, we show that a blind language-only model can easily identify\nthe correct caption. Scenario 2 (right) constructs negative captions that are curated to be plausible (as in SugarCrepe (Hsieh et al., 2023)).\nHere, the language bias of the training set may hurt, since it will prefer to match common captions that score well under the language prior;\ni.e., the incorrect caption of \u201cpeople are cooking in a kitchen\u201d is slightly more likely than the true caption of \u201cpeople\nare posing in a kitchen\u201d under the language prior, and so removing the language bias improves performance. We present\nsimple training-free approaches for removing such language biases, and show this significantly improves performance on challenging\nbenchmarks that fall into Scenario 2.\nerative scores can outperform these costly approaches on\ncompositionality benchmarks.\nGenerative pre-training and scoring.\nVision models\ntrained with discriminative objectives often lack incentives\nto learn structure information (Brendel & Bethge, 2019; Te-\njankar et al., 2021). Similarly, early LLMs trained with dis-\ncriminative approaches, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)\nand RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), have also been criticized\nas bag-of-words models insensitive to word order (Bertolini\net al., 2022; Hessel & Schofield, 2021; Papadimitriou et al.,\n2022; Sinha et al., 2021). Conversely, generative pre-trained\nLLMs (Radford et al., 2019) demonstrate exceptional com-\npositional understanding while pre-trained solely with a\nnext-token prediction (Bengio et al., 2003) loss. Further-\nmore, generative scores of LLMs (OpenAI, 2023; Chung\net al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) have flexible usage in down-\nstream tasks, such as text evaluation (Yuan et al., 2021; Fu\net al., 2023) and reranking (Keskar et al., 2019). While\ngenerative scores from VLMs have been previously used for\ndiscriminative tasks (Tschannen et al., 2023; Miech et al.,\n2021), our work uniquely investigates the critical role of\nlanguage priors and introduces the first debiasing solution\nthat improves retrieval without the need for retraining.\n3. The role of language priors\nIn this section, we present a simple probabilistic treat-\nment for analyzing the role of language priors in image-\nconditioned language models (or generative VLMs). Moti-\nvated by their strong but inconsistent performance across a\nvariety of image-text retrieval benchmarks, we analyze their\nbehavior when there exists a mismatch between training\nand test distributions, deriving simple schemes for address-\ning the mismatch with reweighting. We emphasize that the\ntraining data that we refer to is the foundational pre-training\ndataset, while the test data is always a given benchmark\ndataset; in fact, most benchmarks we analyze do not even\nprovide a trainset. We conclude by exposing a connection\nto related work on mutual information.\nComputing P(t|i). To begin our probabilistic treatment,\nwe first show that image-conditioned language models (that\nprobabilistically generate text based on an image) can be\nrepurposed for computing a score between a given image\ni and text caption t. The likelihood of a text sequence\nt = {t1, t2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , tm} conditioned on image i is naturally\nfactorized as an autoregressive product (Bengio et al., 2003):\nP(t|i) =\nm\nY\nk=1\nP(tk|t<k, i)\n(1)\nImage-conditioned language models return back m softmax\ndistributions corresponding to the m terms in the above\nexpression. Text generation requires sequential token-by-\ntoken prediction, since token tk must be generated before it\ncan be used as an input to generate the softmax distribution\nover token tk+1. Interestingly, given an image i and a text\nsequence t, the above probability can be computed in par-\nallel because the entire sequence of tokens {tk} is already\navailable as input. Figure 2-a shows a visual illustration.\nTrain-test shifts. Given the image-conditioned model of\nP(t|i) above, we now analyze its behavior when applied to\ntest data distributions that differ from the trainset, denoted\n3\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nas Ptest versus Ptrain. Recall that any joint distribution over\nimages and text can be factored into a product over a lan-\nguage prior and an image likelihood P(t, i) = P(t)P(i|t).\nOur analysis makes the strong assumption that the image\nlikelihood P(i|t) is identical across the train and test data,\nbut the language prior P(t) may differ. Intuitively, this\nassumes that the visual appearance of entities (such as a\n\"white duck\") remains consistent across the training\nand test data, but the frequency of those entities (as mani-\nfested in the set of captions P(t)) may vary. We can now\nderive Ptest(t|i) via Bayes rule:\nPtest(t|i) \u221d P(i|t)Ptest(t)\n(2)\n= P(i|t)Ptrain(t)\nPtrain(t)Ptest(t)\n(3)\n\u221d Ptrain(t|i) Ptest(t)\nPtrain(t)\n(4)\nThe above shows that the generative pre-training score\nPtrain(t|i) need simply be weighted by the ratio of the\nlanguage priors in the testset versus trainset. Intuitively, if a\nparticular text caption appears more often in the testset than\nthe trainset, one should increase the score reported by the\ngenerative model. However, one often does not have access\nto the text distribution on the testset. For example, real-\nworld deployments and benchmark protocols may not reveal\nthis. In such cases, one can make two practical assumptions;\neither the language distribution on test is identical to train,\nor it is uninformative/uniform (see Figure 1):\nScenario 1:\nPtest(t) = Ptrain(t)\n\u21d2\nOptimal score is Ptrain(t|i)\n(5)\nScenario 2:\nPtest(t) is uniform.\n\u21d2\nOptimal score is Ptrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\n(6)\nTunable \u03b1. In reality, a testset might be a mix of both\nscenarios. To model this, we consider a soft combination\nwhere the language prior on the testset is assumed to be a\nflattened version of the language prior on the trainset, for\nsome temperature parameter \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]:\nPtest(t) \u221d Ptrain(t)1\u2212\u03b1\n\u21d2 Optimal score is Ptrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\n(7)\nBy setting \u03b1 to 0 or 1, one can obtain the two scenarios\ndescribed above. Some deployments (or benchmarks) may\nbenefit from tuning \u03b1 on a held-out valset, if available.\nImplications for retrieval benchmarks.\nWe spec-\nulate\nsome\nbenchmarks\nlike\nARO-Flickr\n(Yuksek-\ngonul et al., 2022) are close to Scenario 1 because\nthey include negative captions that are implausible,\nsuch as \u201ca white duck the its wings while\nin water spreads\u201d. Such captions will have a low\nscore under the language prior Ptrain(t) and so reporting\nthe raw generative score Ptrain(t|i) (that keeps its language\nprior or bias) will improve accuracy. In fact, we show that\napplying a blind language model (that ignores all image\nevidence) can itself often identify the correct caption. On\nthe other hand, for test datasets with more realistic nega-\ntive captions (Scenario 2), it may be useful to remove the\nlanguage bias of the trainset, since that will prefer to match\nto common captions (even if they do not necessarily agree\nwith the input image). This appears to be the case for Sugar-\nCrepe (Hsieh et al., 2023), which uses LLMs like ChatGPT\nto ensure that the negative captions are realistic.\nRelationship to prior approaches. Our approach to debi-\nasing is reminiscent of mutual information, which can also\nbe seen as a method for removing the effect of marginal\npriors when computing joint probability scores. In fact, our\nAppendix A derives that \u03b1-debiasing is equivalent to a form\nof pointwise mutual information (PMI) known as PMIk\nfor k = 1\n\u03b1, which also reduces the effect of marginal priors\nfrom training data.\n4. Experimental results on I-to-T retrieval\nIn this section, we verify our hypothesis on I-to-T retrieval\nbenchmarks using state-of-the-art multimodal generative\nVLMs. In particular, we adopt image-conditioned language\nmodels such as BLIP (Li et al., 2022) as the learned estima-\ntor of Ptrain(t|i). Then, we discuss how we perform Monte\nCarlo estimation of Ptrain(t), including a novel efficient\nsampling method based on \u201ccontent-free\u201d Gaussian noise\nimages. Finally, we show the state-of-the-art results of our\ngenerative approach on recent I-to-T retrieval benchmarks.\nPreliminaries. We leverage OTS image-conditioned lan-\nguage models to estimate Ptrain(t). Most of our diagnos-\ntic experiments focus on the open-sourced BLIP (Li et al.,\n2022; 2023) model, trained on public image-text corpora\nusing discriminative (ITC and ITM) and generative (caption-\ning) objectives. Discriminative objectives typically model\nP(match|t, i). For example, ITCScore calculates cosine\nsimilarity scores between image and text features using a\ndual-encoder; ITMScore jointly embeds image-text pairs\nvia a fusion-encoder and returns softmax scores from a\nbinary classifier. We term the generative score as Visual\nGenerative Pre-Training Score (VisualGPTScore). While\nBLIP is pre-trained using all three objectives, this generative\nscore has not been applied to discriminative tasks before\nour work. Lastly, our approach can be extended to other\ngenerative VLMs. We also present some additional results\nusing LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023), a recent state-of-the-art\nVLM (Liu et al., 2023) that produces SOTA accuracy on\n4\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\n(a) Ptrain(t|i) through generative VLMs\n(b) Ptrain(t) via Monte Carlo sampling\nFigure 2. Estimating Ptrain(t|i) and Ptrain(t) from generative VLMs. Figure (a) shows how image-conditioned language models\nsuch as Li et al. (2022) that generate text based on an image can be repurposed for computing Ptrain(t|i), which is factorized as a product\nof Qm\nk=1 P(tk|t<k, i) for a sequence of m tokens. These terms can be efficiently computed in parallel, unlike sequential token-by-token\nprediction for text generation. Figure (b) shows two approaches for Monte Carlo sampling of Ptrain(t). While the straightforward\napproach is to sample trainset images, we find that using \u201cnull\u201d (Gaussian noise) images can also achieve robust estimates.\nseveral challenging benchmarks.\nImplementing VisualGPTScore. Our method calculates\nan average of the log-likelihoods of tk at each token position\nk and applies an exponent to cancel the log:\nVisualGPTScore(t, i) := e\n1\nm\nPm\nk=1 log(P (tk|t<k,i))\n(8)\nTo condition on an input image, BLIP uses a multimodal\ncasual self-attention mask (Li et al., 2022) in its image-\ngrounded text decoder, i.e., each text token attends to all its\npreceding vision and text tokens. We emphasize that Visual-\nGPTScore has the same computational cost as ITMScore,\nwhich uses the same underlying transformer but with a bi-\ndirectional self-attention mask to encode an image-text pair.\nWe address potential biases of this estimator in Appendix B.\nEstimating Ptrain(t) using Monte Carlo sampling (or-\nacle approach).\nGiven Ptrain(t|i), we can estimate\nPtrain(t) via classic Monte Carlo sampling (Shapiro, 2003),\nby drawing n images from the train distribution, such as\nLAION114M (Schuhmann et al., 2021) for BLIP:\nPtrain(t) \u2248 1\nn\nn\nX\nk=1\nPtrain(t|ik)\n(9)\nReducing sampling cost with Gaussian noise images (our\napproach). The above Equation 9 requires many trainset\nsamples to achieve robust estimates. To address this, we\ndraw inspiration from (Zhao et al., 2021), which uses a\ncontent-free text prompt \u201cN/A\u201d to calibrate the probability\nof a text from LLMs, i.e., P(t|\u201cN/A\u201d). To apply this to\nour generative VLMs, we choose to sample \u201cnull\u201d inputs as\nGaussian noise images. It turns out Eq. 9 can be estimated\nusing as few as 1-3 Gaussian noise images (with a mean\nand standard deviation calculated from trainset distribution).\nWe provide a visual illustration of this method in Figure 2-b.\nWe find this method to be less computationally demanding\nand just as effective as sampling thousands of images from\ntrainset. We ablate sampling procedures in Appendix C and\nshow that our method generalizes across BLIP and BLIP-2\narchitectures in Appendix D.\nBenchmarks and evaluation protocols. We comprehen-\nsively report on four recent I-to-T retrieval benchmarks that\nassess compositionality, including ARO (Yuksekgonul et al.,\n2022), Crepe (Ma et al., 2022), SugarCrepe (Hsieh et al.,\n2023), and VL-CheckList (Zhao et al., 2022). In these\ndatasets, each image has a single positive caption and mul-\ntiple negative captions. ARO (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022)\nhas four datasets: VG-Relation, VG-Attribution, COCO-\nOrder, and Flickr30k-Order.\nSugarCrepe (Hsieh et al.,\n2023) has three datasets: Replace, Swap, and Add. For\nCrepe (Ma et al., 2022), we use the entire productivity set\nand report on three datasets: Atom, Negate, and Swap. VL-\nCheckList (Zhao et al., 2022) has three datasets: Object, At-\ntribute, and Relation. Appendix F visualizes these datasets.\nSOTA performance on all four benchmarks. In Table 1,\nwe show that our OTS generative approaches, based on\nthe BLIP model pre-trained on LAION-114M with ViT-\nL image encoder, achieves state-of-the-art results on all\nbenchmarks. We outperform the best discriminative VLMs,\nincluding LAION5B-CLIP, and consistently surpass other\nheavily-engineered solutions, including NegCLIP, SyViC,\nMosaiCLIP, DAC, SVLC, SGVL, Structure-CLIP, all of\nwhich fine-tune CLIP on much more data. Details on how\nwe report the baseline results can be found in Appendix E.\nFor reference, we also include results of text-only Vera and\nGrammar from Hsieh et al. (2023). To show that even the\nmost recent SugarCrepe is not exempt from language biases,\nwe run two more text-only methods:\n5\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nTable 1. OTS\ngenerative\nVLMs\nare\nSOTA\non\nimage-to-text\nretrieval\nbenchmarks.\nWe\nbegin\nby\nevaluating\nblind language models (in red) .\nSurprisingly, this already produces SOTA accuracy on certain benchmarks such as ARO-\nFlickr, compared to the\nbest discriminative approaches (in gray) .\nWe also find that blind inference of generative VLMs,\nPtrain(t) via sampling Gaussian noise images (in blue) , often performs better and achieve above-chance performance even on the\nmost recent SugarCrepe. Next, we show that simply repurposing a generative VLM\u2019s language generation head for computing image-text\nscores (VisualGPTScore in yellow) , which corresponds to \u03b1 = 0, consistently produces SOTA accuracy across all benchmarks. Finally,\ndebiasing this score by tuning \u03b1 on valset (in green) further improves performance, establishing the new SOTA.\nScore\nMethod\nARO\nRel\nAttr\nCOCO\nFlickr\nRandom\n-\n50.0\n50.0\n20.0\n20.0\nText-Only\nVera\n61.7\n82.6\n59.8\n63.5\nGrammar\n59.6\n58.4\n74.3\n76.3\nPLLM(t)\nBART\n81.1\n73.6\n95.0\n95.2\nFlan-T5\n84.4\n76.5\n98.0\n98.2\nOPT\n84.7\n79.8\n97.9\n98.6\nPtrain(t)\nBLIP\n87.6\n80.7\n98.6\n99.1\nP(match|t, i)\nCLIP\n59.0\n62.0\n59.0\n46.0\nLAION2B-CLIP\n51.6\n61.9\n25.2\n30.2\nLAION5B-CLIP\n46.1\n57.8\n26.1\n31.0\nNegCLIP\n81.0\n71.0\n91.0\n86.0\nStructure-CLIP\n83.5\n85.1\n-\n-\nSyViC\n80.8\n72.4\n92.4\n87.2\nSGVL\n-\n-\n87.2\n91.0\nMosaiCLIP\n82.6\n78.0\n87.9\n86.3\nDAC-LLM\n81.3\n73.9\n94.5\n95.7\nDAC-SAM\n77.2\n70.5\n91.2\n93.9\nBLIP-ITC\n63.1\n81.6\n34.3\n41.7\nBLIP-ITM\n58.7\n90.3\n45.1\n51.3\nPtrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\nOurs (\u03b1 = 0)\n89.1\n95.3\n99.4\n99.5\nOurs (\u03b1 = 1)\n68.1\n87.9\n32.4\n44.5\nOurs (\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217)\n89.1\n95.4\n99.4\n99.5\nScore\nMethod\nVL-CheckList\nObject\nAttribute\nRelation\nRandom\n-\n50.0\n50.0\n50.0\nText-Only\nVera\n82.5\n74.0\n85.7\nGrammar\n58.0\n52.4\n68.5\nPLLM(t)\nBART\n52.0\n51.0\n45.1\nFlan-T5\n60.3\n55.0\n49.3\nOPT\n59.3\n48.8\n60.0\nPtrain(t)\nBLIP\n68.2\n58.7\n75.9\nP(match|t, i)\nCLIP\n81.6\n67.6\n63.1\nLAION2B-CLIP\n84.7\n67.8\n66.5\nLAION5B-CLIP\n87.9\n70.3\n63.9\nNegCLIP\n81.4\n72.2\n63.5\nSyViC\n-\n70.4\n69.4\nSGVL\n85.2\n78.2\n80.4\nSLVC\n85.0\n72.0\n69.0\nDAC-LLM\n87.3\n77.3\n86.4\nDAC-SAM\n88.5\n75.8\n89.8\nBLIP-ITC\n90.6\n80.3\n73.5\nBLIP-ITM\n89.9\n80.7\n67.7\nPtrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\nOurs (\u03b1 = 0)\n92.6\n78.7\n90.8\nOurs (\u03b1 = 1)\n90.4\n77.6\n77.8\nOurs (\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217)\n94.4\n82.1\n92.8\n(a) Accuracy on ARO\n(b) Accuracy on VL-CheckList\nScore\nMethod\nSugarCrepe\nReplace\nSwap\nAdd\nRandom\n-\n50.0\n50.0\n50.0\nText-Only\nVera\n49.5\n49.3\n49.5\nGrammar\n50.0\n50.0\n50.0\nPLLM(t)\nBART\n48.4\n51.9\n61.2\nFlan-T5\n51.4\n57.6\n40.9\nOPT\n58.5\n66.6\n45.8\nPtrain(t)\nBLIP\n75.9\n77.1\n70.9\nP(match|t, i)\nCLIP\n80.8\n63.3\n75.1\nLAION2B-CLIP\n86.5\n68.6\n88.4\nLAION5B-CLIP\n85.0\n68.0\n89.6\nNegCLIP\n88.3\n76.2\n90.2\nBLIP-ITC\n85.8\n73.8\n85.7\nBLIP-ITM\n88.7\n81.3\n87.6\nPtrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\nOurs (\u03b1 = 0)\n93.3\n91.0\n91.0\nOurs (\u03b1 = 1)\n83.2\n85.5\n85.9\nOurs (\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217)\n95.1\n92.4\n97.4\nScore\nMethod\nCrepe\nAtom\nSwap\nNegate\nRandom\n-\n16.7\n16.7\n16.7\nText-Only\nVera\n43.7\n70.8\n66.2\nGrammar\n18.2\n50.9\n9.8\nPLLM(t)\nBART\n38.8\n53.3\n44.4\nFlan-T5\n43.0\n69.5\n13.6\nOPT\n53.3\n72.7\n5.0\nPtrain(t)\nBLIP\n55.4\n69.7\n60.8\nP(match|t, i)\nCLIP\n22.3\n26.6\n28.8\nLAION2B-CLIP\n23.6\n24.8\n18.0\nLAION5B-CLIP\n24.2\n23.9\n20.1\nBLIP-ITC\n24.8\n17.7\n26.5\nBLIP-ITM\n29.5\n20.7\n25.5\nPtrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\nOurs (\u03b1 = 0)\n73.2\n78.1\n79.6\nOurs (\u03b1 = 1)\n20.6\n28.3\n35.6\nOurs (\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217)\n73.3\n78.1\n79.6\n(c) Accuracy on SugarCrepe\n(d) Accuracy on Crepe\n1. PLLM(t): passing captions into a pure LLM, such as\nBART-base (Yuan et al., 2021), FLAN-T5-XL (Chung\net al., 2022), and OPT-2.7B (Zhang et al., 2022), to\ncompute a text-only GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023).\n2. Ptrain(t): passing both captions and Gaussian noise\nimages to BLIP as shown in Figure 2.\nDiscussion on \u03b1-debiasing. Table 2 shows that debiasing\naffects benchmarks differently depending on their construc-\ntion; benchmarks with unrealistic negative captions (such as\nARO-Flickr) benefit from a language prior that can identify\nsuch negative examples. Here, debiasing with large \u03b1 hurts\nperformance. On the other hand, benchmarks with realistic\nnegative captions (such as SugarCrepe) tend to benefit from\ndebiasing because it reduces the influence of the language\nprior. Our findings are reminiscent of the lessons from the\nVQA benchmark (Goyal et al., 2017), known to be solvable\nby \u201cblind\u201d algorithms that do not look at the image, e.g.,\nquestions such as \u201cIs there a clock\u201d have an answer of \u201cyes\u201d\n98% of the time. However, we also find that some recent\nbenchmarks such as Winoground (Thrush et al., 2022) and\nEqBen (Wang et al., 2023) introduce strict evaluation proto-\n6\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nTable 2. \u03b1-debiasing on I-to-T benchmarks and Ptrain(t) frequency charts of both positive and negative captions. Increasing \u03b1\nfrom 0 to 1 hurts performance on benchmarks with non-sensical negative captions like ARO-Flickr. ARO\u2019s negative captions are easier\nto identify because of their low score under the language prior Ptrain(t), implying such benchmarks may even be solved with blind\nalgorithms that avoid looking at images. On the other hand, for benchmarks like SugarCrepe with more balanced Ptrain(t) between\npositive and negative captions, tuning \u03b1 leads to performance gain.

We\ndiscuss these challenging Scenario 2 benchmarks (with far\nlower SOTA accuracy) in the next section.\n5. Additional Challenging Benchmarks\nIn this section, we apply our OTS generative approaches to\nfive more Scenario 2 benchmarks: (a) Winoground (Thrush\net al., 2022) and EqBen (Wang et al., 2023) for image-\ntext alignment;\n(b) COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and\nFlickr30K (Young et al., 2014) for large-scale retrieval; (c)\nImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) for zero-shot image classifi-\ncation. While naively applying OTS VisualGPTScore leads\nto inferior performance on these benchmarks, our training-\nfree \u03b1-debiasing consistently improves its performance even\nwith a fixed \u03b1=1, without accessing the held-out valset (Ta-\nble 3-a). We also derive the optimal text-to-image (T-to-I)\nretrieval objective and show that OTS generative scores\ncan achieve robust T-to-I performance (Table 3-b). Lastly,\nwe apply VisualGPTScore and its \u03b1-debiased version to a\nstate-of-the-art VLM, LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023), and\noutperform widely-used methods such as CLIPScore (Hes-\nsel et al., 2021) on the challenging Winoground and EqBen\nbenchmarks. This suggests that VisualGPTScore is a supe-\nrior choice for measuring image-text alignment.\nBalanced evaluation protocols for retrieval. Winoground\nand EqBen evaluate image-text alignment through retrieval\ntasks, and we find their evaluation protocols discourage\nblind solutions. We refer the reader to the benchmarks for\nmore details, but in summary, both benchmarks operate on\npairs of image-text pairs {(i0, t0), (i1, t1)} and construct\ntwo I-to-T retrieval (text score) tasks with a single image\nand two candidate captions. The text score is awarded 1\npoint only if both retrieval tasks are correct. Consider the\ncommon case where one caption is more likely under a\nlanguage prior; here the common caption will be correctly\nretrieved for one of the tasks but will be incorrectly retrieved\nfor the other, implying no points will be awarded. Similarly\nstringent metrics are used for T-to-I retrieval (image score).\nThe final group score is awarded 1 point only if all 4 retrieval\ntasks are correct.\n\u03b1-debiasing consistently improves I-to-T retrieval. Ta-\nble 3-a shows that simply debiasing VisualGPTScore with\na fixed \u03b1 = 1 significantly improves performance on chal-\nlenging I-to-T benchmarks. One can also do slightly better\nby using a held-out valset to tune for the optimal \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nFor Winoground and EqBen, we sample half of the data as a\nvalset and perform a grid search for \u03b1\u2217\nval (using a step size\nof 0.001), reporting the performance on the other half. We\nrepeat this process 10 times and report the mean and stan-\ndard deviation. For COCO and Flickr30K, we perform \u03b1-\ndebiasing using Recall@1 (R@1) on the official valset. We\nreport the zero-shot classification accuracy on ImageNet1K,\nwhich can be viewed as an I-to-T retrieval task that retrieves\nthe best textual label (out of 1000) for each image. We\nsimply use one-shot samples from Lin et al. (2023) to cross\nvalidate on ImageNet, which incurs negligible costs. Ap-\npendix C details the debiasing procedure for each dataset.\nLastly, we observe that generative approaches still lag be-\nhind the ITMScore of BLIP for the two large-scale retrieval\nbenchmarks. This motivates us to study biases of generative\nmodels from the statistical perspective of biased estimators,\nbriefly examined in Appendix B.\nExtending to T-to-I retrieval. Though not the focus of our\nwork, we show that image-conditioned language models can\nbe applied to T-to-I retrieval. Given a text caption t, we can\nrewrite the Bayes optimal T-to-I retrieval objective as:\nPtest(i|t) \u221d Ptrain(t|i) \u2217 Ptrain(i)\n(10)\nEquation 10 is hard to implement because we do not have\naccess to Ptrain(i). However, when Ptrain(i) is approxi-\nmately uniform, one can directly apply Ptrain(t|i) for opti-\nmal performance. We report T-to-I performance in Table 3-b,\nwhere our generative approach obtains competitive results\ncompared against ITMScore, likely because T-to-I retrieval\nis less affected by language biases.\n7\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nTable 3.

Table (a) shows the importance of \u03b1-\ndebiasing on these compositionality and large-scale retrieval benchmarks.\nWhile OTS generative scores do not work\nwell, debiasing with a larger \u03b1 close to 1 can consistently and often significantly improve I-to-T performance.\nTo\nhighlight the improvement, we mark\nresults without debiasing (\u03b1 = 0) (in yellow) ,\ndebiasing with a fixed \u03b1 = 1 (in pink) , and\ncross-validation using held-out valsets (\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217\nval) (in green) .

On Winoground\nand EqBen, our VisualGPTScore (\u03b1=0) outperforms all meth-\nods using only a state-of-the-art VLM (LLaVA-1.5). Moreover,\ndebiasing with \u03b1=1 (using a single Gaussian noise image) con-\nsistently improves I-to-T retrieval, thereby increasing the text and\ngroup score. To ensure a fair comparison, we use the publicly avail-\nable model checkpoints and corresponding code of prior works.\nMethod descriptions and implementation details can be found in\nAppendix E.\nMethod\nLLMs used\nWinoground\nEqBen\nText\nImage\nGroup\nText\nImage\nGroup\nRandom Chance\n\u2013\n25.0\n25.0\n16.7\n25.0\n25.0\n16.7\nOfficial implementation\nCLIPScore\n\u2013\n31.3\n11.0\n8.8\n35.0\n33.6\n21.4\nVPEval\nChatGPT\n12.8\n11.0\n6.3\n34.3\n25.7\n21.4\nLLMScore\nChatGPT\n21.3\n17.8\n12.5\n32.9\n27.9\n22.9\nOur results based on LLaVA-1.5\nTIFA\nLlama-2\n22.8\n18.5\n15.5\n30.0\n30.0\n21.4\nVQ2\nFlanT5\n14.0\n27.3\n10.0\n22.9\n40.7\n20.0\nDavidsonian\nChatGPT\n21.0\n16.8\n15.5\n26.4\n20.0\n20.0\nVisualGPTScore (\u03b1=0)\n\u2013\n36.3\n37.0\n24.8\n25.7\n42.1\n21.4\nVisualGPTScore (\u03b1=1)\n\u2013\n44.3\n37.0\n27.5\n42.9\n42.1\n29.3\nState-of-the-art image-text alignment. Text-to-image gen-\nerative models such as DALL-E 3 (Betker et al., 2023) are\noften evaluated with models that score the agreement (or\nalignment) between the generated image and the input cap-\ntion, such as the CLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021). However,\nas CLIP struggles with compositional texts (Kamath et al.,\n2023), recent studies such as VPEval (Cho et al., 2023b) and\nLLMScore (Lu et al., 2023) combine VLMs with LLMs like\nChatGPT to more accurately score image-text alignment.\nMost recently, TIFA (Hu et al., 2023), VQ2 (Yarom et al.,\n2023), and Davidsonian (Cho et al., 2023a) use LLMs to\ngenerate a set of Q&A from input captions, then score the\nimage based on the accuracy of a VQA model. Appendix E\ndescribes these methods in details. Table 4 shows that Vi-\nsualGPTScore (and its debiased \u03b1=1 version) outperforms\nsuch complex approaches for image-text alignment, need-\ning only an OTS state-of-the-art VLM, LLaVA-1.5 (Liu\net al., 2023). This suggests that image-conditioned language\nmodels can already serve as robust alignment metrics.\n6. Discussion and Limitations\nSummary. Our study shows the efficacy of generative pre-\ntraining scores in solving discriminative tasks. We present\na first-principles analysis to account for mismatching distri-\nbutions over text between train and test data. Our analysis\nmotivates a training-free (zero-shot) solution to debias lan-\nguage priors in generative scores, achieving consistent and\noften significant improvement on all I-to-T retrieval tasks.\nWe hope our analysis can encourage future work to revisit\nthe issue of language biases in vision-language benchmarks.\nLimitations and future work. Our approach depends on\ngenerative VLMs pre-trained on noisy web datasets, which\nmay result in biases (Mehrabi et al., 2021). Our analysis is\nbased on simplified assumptions. For instance, the image-\nconditioned language model might not accurately represent\nPtrain(t|i), a phenomenon we examine in Appendix B. Es-\ntimating Ptrain(t) by sampling Gaussian noise images can\nbe suboptimal; future VLMs could directly model Ptrain(t),\nor use techniques like coreset selection (Guo et al., 2022) or\ndataset distillation (Wu et al., 2023) to sample more repre-\nsentative images. While VisualGPTScore shows competi-\ntive performance, it still suffers from a high inference cost\ncompared to ITCScore especially for large-scale retrieval\ntasks. Therefore, distilling it into dual-encoder head (Miech\net al., 2021) can be a promising future direction.\n8\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nReferences\nAgrawal, H., Desai, K., Wang, Y., Chen, X., Jain, R., John-\nson, M., Batra, D., Parikh, D., Lee, S., and Anderson, P.\nNocaps: Novel object captioning at scale.

Comparison to PMIk\nBy assuming Ptest(t) to be a \u201cflatten\u201d version of Ptrain(t), our Equation 7 can interpolate between scenario 1 (same train\nand test priors) and 2 (balanced test priors):\nPtest(t) \u221d Ptrain(t)1\u2212\u03b1\n\u21d2 Optimal score is Ptrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\n(11)\nIn fact, the above equation can be rewritten using the language of PMIk (Role & Nadif, 2011; Daille, 1994), a well-known\nvariant of PMI that controls the amount of debiasing (Li et al., 2016; Li & Jurafsky, 2016; Wang et al., 2020) in information\nretrieval:\nPtrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1 =\nPtrain(t, i)\nPtrain(i)Ptrain(t)\u03b1\n(12)\n\u221d\nPtrain(t, i)\n1\n\u03b1\nPtrain(i)Ptrain(t)\n, as Ptrain(i) is constant in I-to-T\n(13)\n= pmik\nPtrain(t, i), where k = 1\n\u03b1 \u2265 1\n(14)\nwhere\npmiP (t, i) =\nP(t, i)\nP(t)P(i) = P(t|i)\nP(t) = P(i|t)\nP(i)\n(15)\nPMI is an information-theoretic measure that quantifies the association between two variables (Yao et al., 2010; Henning &\nEwerth, 2017; Shrivastava et al., 2021). In the context of image-text retrieval, it measures how much more (or less) likely the\nimage-text pair co-occurs than if the two were independent. Eq. 15 has found applications in diverse sequence-to-sequence\nmodelling tasks (Wang et al., 2020; Li & Jurafsky, 2016; Li et al., 2016) as a retrieval (reranking) objective. Compared to the\nconditional likelihood P(t|i), PMI reduces the learned bias for preferring \u201dcommon\u201d texts with high marginal probabilities\nP(t) (Li et al., 2016; Li & Jurafsky, 2016; Wang et al., 2020). This can be an alternative explanation for the effectiveness of\nour debiasing solutions.\nB. Is VisualGPTScore a Biased Estimator of Ptrain(t|i)?\nRetrieval performance on trainset (LAION). This paper is built on the assumption that VisualGPTScore is a reliable\nestimator of Ptrain(t|i). However, this simplifying assumption does not completely hold for the BLIP model we examine.\nWe speculate that such OTS generative scores are biased towards more common texts. We witness this same phenomenon in\nTable 5, where we perform image-text retrieval on random subsets from training distribution LAION-114M (Li et al., 2022).\nTable 5. Retrieval performance on randomly sampled training (LAION114M) subsets with varied sizes. Table (a) shows that while\nOTS generative scores are robust for T-to-I retrieval, its performance degrades on I-to-T retrieval tasks when the number of candidate texts\nincreases. This implies that OTS generative scores suffer from language biases towards certain texts even in the training set. Nonetheless,\nwe show that our debiasing solution using either \u03b1 = 1 or optimal \u03b1\u2217 \u2208 [0, 1] with a step size of 0.001, can consistently boost the\nperformance. Figure (b) visualizes \u03b1-debiasing results on LAION subsets, where each curve represents a different sample size.\nDataset Size\nI-to-T Retrieval\nT-to-I Retrieval\nITM\nPtrain(t|i)\nPtrain(t)\u03b1\nITM\nPtrain(t|i)\n\u03b1=0\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b1=\u03b1\u2217\n\u03b1\u2217\n100\n96.0\n59.0\n94.0\n95.0\n0.535\n95.0\n97.0\n1000\n90.9\n37.1\n71.7\n85.7\n0.733\n92.0\n93.1\n2000\n87.2\n32.8\n62.3\n64.3\n0.840\n87.8\n89.8\n5000\n79.8\n25.1\n50.9\n54.1\n0.727\n81.9\n84.4\n(a) Performance on LAION trainset retrieval\n(b) Alpha-tuning on LAION\nModelling the language bias in VisualGPTScore. As evidenced in Table 5, we believe VisualGPTScore is biased towards\nmore common texts due to modelling error. To consider this error in our analysis, we rewrite the VisualGPTScore as:\nVisualGPTScore(t, i) := \u02c6Ptrain(t|i) = Ptrain(t|i) \u00b7 Ptrain(t)\u03b2,\n(16)\n13\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nwhere \u02c6P represents the (biased) model estimate and P represents the true distribution. The model bias towards common\ntexts is encoded by an unknown parameter \u03b2.\nMonte Carlo estimation using \u02c6P. Because our Monte Carlo sampling method relies on \u02c6Ptrain(t|i), it is also a biased\nestimator of Ptrain(t):\n\u02c6Ptrain(t) := 1\nn\nn\nX\nk=1\n\u02c6Ptrain(t|ik) = Ptrain(t)1+\u03b2.\n(17)\nRewriting optimal I-to-T objective with \u02c6P. We can rewrite Equation 4 as:\nPtest(t|i) \u221d Ptrain(t|i) Ptest(t)\nPtrain(t)\n(18)\n= \u02c6Ptrain(t|i)\nPtest(t)\nPtrain(t)1+\u03b2\n(19)\n= \u02c6Ptrain(t|i) Ptest(t)\n\u02c6Ptrain(t)\n(20)\n\u03b1-debiasing with \u02c6P. Using Equation 20, we can reformulate \u03b1-debiasing (Equation 7) as follows:\nPtest(t) \u221d Ptrain(t)1\u2212\u02c6\u03b1\n\u21d2 Optimal score is\n\u02c6Ptrain(t|i)\n\u02c6Ptrain(t)\u03b1\n(21)\nwhere \u03b1 =\n\u02c6\u03b1+\u03b2\n1+\u03b2 . Notably, the above equation has the same structure as before (Equation 7). This implies that even if\nPtrain(t) = Ptest(t), we still anticipate \u03b1 =\n\u03b2\n1+\u03b2 \u0338= 0. This accounts for why the optimal \u03b1 is not 0 when we perform\nI-to-T retrieval on trainset in Table 5.\nImplication for vision-language modelling. Our analysis indicates that similar to generative LLMs (Li et al., 2016;\nLi & Jurafsky, 2016), contemporary image-conditioned language models also experience issues related to imbalanced\nlearning (Kang et al., 2019). Potential solutions could be: (a) refined sampling techniques for Monte Carlo estimation\nof P(t) such as through dataset distillation (Wu et al., 2023), and (b) less biased modelling of P(t|i) such as through\ncontrollable generation (Keskar et al., 2019).\nC. Ablation Studies on \u03b1-Debiasing\nDetails of Gaussian noise samples. BLIP and BLIP-2 experiments sample Gaussian noise images with a mean of 1.0 and\na standard deviation of 0.25. By default, we use 100 images for Winoground, 30 images for EqBen, 1 image for ImageNet,\nand 3 images for the rest of the benchmarks.\nEstimating Ptrain(t) via Gaussian noise images is more sample-efficient. We use Winoground to show that sampling\nGaussian noise images to calculate Ptrain(t) can be more efficient than sampling trainset images. As demonstrated in\nTable 6, a limited number of Gaussian noise images (e.g., 3 or 10) can surpass the results obtained with 1000 LAION images.\nMoreover, using null images produces less variance in the results.\nAlternative approach on COCO/Flickr30k: estimating Ptrain(t) using testset images.\nFor large-scale retrieval\nbenchmarks like COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014), we can directly average scores of all candidate\nimages (in the order of thousands) to efficiently approximate Ptrain(t) without the need to sample any Gaussian noise\nimages. This approach incurs zero computation cost as we have already pre-computed scores between each candidate image\nand text. We show in Table 7 that using testset images indeed results in better performance than sampling 3 Gaussian noise\nimages.\nTuning \u03b1 with a valset. In Table 8, similar performance trends are observed across validation and test splits of COCO and\nFlickr30k I-to-T retrieval benchmarks using the same \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Furthermore, \u03b1\u2217\ntest and \u03b1\u2217\nval are empirically close. As\nsuch, our method can function as a reliable training-free debiasing method.\n14\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nTable 6. Comparing sampling of Gaussian noise images and trainset images for estimating Ptrain(t). We report text scores of\n\u03b1-debiasing on Winoground I-to-T retrieval task. We ablate 3/10/100/1000 Gaussian noise and LAION samples and report both mean\nand std using 5 sampling seeds. The optimal \u03b1\u2217 \u2208 [0, 1] is searched on testset via a step size of 0.001. The Gaussian noise images are\nsampled with a mean calculated from the LAION subset and a fixed std of 0.25.\nSample Size\nGuassian Noise Images\nTrainset Images\n\u03b1=\u03b1\u2217\ntest\n\u03b1\u2217\ntest\n\u03b1=\u03b1\u2217\ntest\n\u03b1\u2217\ntest\n3\n35.95(0.5)\n0.821(0.012)\n32.20(1.6)\n0.706(0.150)\n10\n36.25(0.4)\n0.827(0.016)\n33.60(0.9)\n0.910(0.104)\n100\n36.35(0.1)\n0.840(0.010)\n34.70(0.6)\n0.910(0.039)\n1000\n36.25(0.0)\n0.850(0.000)\n35.15(0.3)\n0.960(0.033)\nTable 7.

Experiments with BLIP-2\nWe provide BLIP-2 results for completeness.\nBLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023) overview. BLIP-2 leverages frozen pre-trained image encoders (Fang et al., 2022) and large\nlanguage models (Chung et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) to bootstrap vision-language pre-training. It proposes a lightweight\nQuerying Transformer (Q-Former) that is trained in two stages. Similar to BLIP (Li et al., 2022), Q-Former is a mixture-of-\nexpert model that can calculate ITC, ITM, and captioning loss given an image-text pair. Additionally, it introduces a set of\ntrainable query tokens, whose outputs serve as visual soft prompts prepended as inputs to LLMs. In its first training stage,\nQ-Former is fine-tuned on the same LAION dataset using the same objectives (ITC+ITM+captioning) as BLIP. In the second\nstage, the output query tokens from Q-Former are fed into a frozen language model, such as FLAN-T5 (Chung et al., 2022)\nor OPT (Chung et al., 2022), after a linear projection trained only with captioning loss. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on various vision-language tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.\nBLIP-2 results (Table 9 and Table 10). We present retrieval performance of the BLIP-2 model that uses ViT-L as the frozen\nimage encoder. We report results for both the first-stage model (denoted as Q-Former) and the second-stage model which\nemploys FLAN-T5 (Chung et al., 2022) as the frozen LLM. Our \u03b1-debiasing solutions generalize to all variants of BLIP-2.\nE. Additional Reports\nComputational resources. All experiments use a single NVIDIA GeForce 3090s GPU.\nDetails of Table 1.

The results of NegCLIP (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022), Structure-CLIP (Huang et al., 2023), SVLC (Doveh et al.,\n2022), SGVL (Herzig et al., 2023), DAC-LLM, and DAC-SAM (Doveh et al., 2023) are directly copied from their original\npapers.

VPEval (Cho et al., 2023b)\nutilizes GPT-3.5 to translate the text prompt into a Python-like program that invokes vision foundation models such as CLIP,\nBLIP, and GroundingDINO, to examine fine-grained image details. LLMScore (Lu et al., 2023) uses BLIP-2 to first caption\nthe image, then uses ChatGPT to score the difference between the BLIP-generated caption and the text prompt.

For TIFA (Hu et al., 2023), VQ2 (Yarom et al., 2023), Davidsonian (Cho et al., 2023a), we strictly\nfollow their released code and adopt their QA-generation language models (or in-context Q&A samples for ChatGPT).\nHowever, as we do not have access to the private VQA models they adopted, e.g., PaLI-17B, we implement these approaches\nusing LLaVA-1.5-13B (Liu et al., 2023) as the VQA model. We stick to the default system message to prompt LLaVA-1.5,\nwhich can be found on their official GitHub repo. For fair comparison, our VisualGPTScore is also implemented using\nLLaVA-1.5-13B. We only use the system message without appending any questions when computing P(text|image). For\n\u03b1-debiasing, we sample a single Gaussian image with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.25 (derived from the statistics\nof training images used to train LLaVA).\nGroup scores on Winoground/EqBen using BLIP (Table 11).\nFine-grained tags on Winoground (Table 12).\nPerformance on SugarCrepe (Table 13).\n\u03b1-debiasing on ARO/Crepe/SugarCrepe/VL-CheckList (Table 14).\n16\nRevisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models\nTable 10.

Tenenbaum3, Pieter Abbeel2\n1Google DeepMind, 2UC Berkeley, 3MIT, 4University of Alberta\nvideo-adapter.github.io\nAbstract\nLarge text-to-video models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated ex-\nceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity videos from arbitrary textual\ndescriptions. However, adapting these models to tasks with limited domain-specific\ndata, such as animation or robotics videos, poses a significant computational chal-\nlenge, since finetuning a pretrained large model can be prohibitively expensive.\nInspired by how a small modifiable component (e.g., prompts, prefix-tuning) can\nadapt a large language model to perform new tasks without requiring access to the\nmodel weights, we investigate how to adapt a large pretrained text-to-video model\nto a variety of downstream domains and tasks without finetuning. In answering this\nquestion, we propose Video Adapter, which leverages the score function of a large\npretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior to guide the generation of\na task-specific small video model. Our experiments show that Video Adapter is\ncapable of incorporating the broad knowledge and preserving the high fidelity of a\nlarge pretrained video model in a task-specific small video model using as few as\n1.25% parameters of the pretrained model. Video Adapter is able to generate high-\nquality yet specialized videos on a variety of tasks such as animation, egocentric\nmodeling, and modeling of simulated and real-world robotics data. More videos\ncan be found on the website https://video-adapter.github.io.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge text-to-video models with billions of parameters trained on internet-scale data have become\ncapable of generating highly realistic videos from general text descriptions [1, 2, 3]. When such large\ntext-to-video models are used in specialized domains \u2014 or for specialized tasks such as generating\nvideos of robotic plans [4], animation [5], or videos with customized styles similar to those common\nin text-to-image [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] \u2014 a pretrained text-to-video model often requires task-specific\nadaptation. Enabling efficient and effective adaptation of a pretrained text-to-video model to a\ntask-specific setting is one of the major bottlenecks in applying text-to-video in real-world problems.\nSimilar to state-of-the-art language models [11, 12], the parameters of a pretrained text-to-video\nmodel are usually not publicly available [1, 13, 14], which makes finetuning on task-specific data\ninfeasible. Even if finetuning access to these large models can be gained through API calls to\nan industrial service [11], the computational resources involved in finetuning can be prohibitively\nexpensive, hindering the research progress of small industrial and academic institutions. While\nsome techniques for controllable text-to-image generation have been developed \u2014 such as light-\nweight training methods like ControlNet [10] and training-free methods such as manipulating CLIP\nfeatures [6], or using a small set of images with same topics or objects [8, 9] \u2014 it is not immediately\nclear whether the techniques developed for text-to-image can directly transfer to text-to-video,\n\u2217Equal contribution.\nCorrespondence to:\nMengjiao Yang <sherryy@berkeley.edu>, Yilun Du\n<yilundu@mit.edu>.\nPreprint.

Video Adapter is capable of flexible generation of diverse videos\nwith distinct styles including videos with manipulation and navigation based egocentric motions, videos with\npersonalized styles such as animation and science fictions, and simulated and real robotic videos.\nespecially given that generating videos is much more complex than generating images [15] and that\npretrained text-to-video models are often orders of magnitude larger than text-to-image models [14].\nInspired by the progression of task-specific adaptation in language modeling from finetuning to\nfew shot in-context learning [16] then to more sophisticated prompting schemes [17] as pretrained\nlanguage models became more capable and expensive, we ask the natural question of whether it is\npossible to adapt a large pretrained text-to-video model using a small controllable component similar\nto prefix tuning of language models [18] and thus avoid expensive finetuning of large pretrained\nmodels. Intuitively, even though the video statistics in a downstream task (e.g., robotics, animation)\nmight differ significantly from the pretraining videos, certain video properties such as the semantics\nand dynamics of objects should remain the same between pretraining and adaptation. As a result,\na large pretrained video model could be used as a knowledge prior to guide the generation of\ntask-specific videos while maintaining broad properties such as temporal consistency and object\npermanence.\nTo this end, we propose Video Adapter, a probabilistic approach for exploiting a large pretrained\nvideo diffusion model to guide the generation of task or domain specific videos. By factoring the\ndomain-specific video distribution into a pretrained prior and a small trainable component, the cost\nof adapting a large pretrained video model can be significantly reduced, while enabling generation\nof videos that satisfy the characteristics of both the pretrained prior (i.e., temporal consistency and\nobject permanence) and the styles or properties unique to the videos of interest (e.g., animation).\n2\nWe evaluate Video Adapter on a diverse set of video generation tasks as illustrated in Figure 1.\nQuantitatively, Video Adapter generates videos that obtain better FVD and Inception Scores than\na high quality pretrained large video model while using up to 80x fewer parameters on the robotic\nBridge data [19] and the challenging Ego4D data [20]. Qualitatively, we show that Video Adapter\nenables generation of stylized videos such as sci-fi and animation. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nhow Video Adapter can pave the way for bridging the notorious sim-to-real gap in robotics [21] by\nmodeling both real and simulated robotic videos while enabling data augmentation on real robotic\nvideos through customized stylisation.\n2\nPreliminaries\nWe first introduce relevant background information on denoising diffusion probabilistic models\n(DDPMs) and discuss their connection to Energy-Based Models (EBMs). We will then use this\nconnection to EBMs to convert large text-to-video diffusion models to probabilistic priors.\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.\nDenoising diffusion probablistic models [22, 23] are a\nclass of probabilistic generative models where the generation of a video \u03c4 = [x1, . . . , xH] \u2208 XH is\nformed by iterative denoising. Given a video \u03c4 sampled from a video distribution p(\u03c4), a randomly\nsampled Gaussian noise variable \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I), and a set of T different noise levels \u03b2t, a denoising\nmodel \u03f5\u03b8 is trained to denoise the noise corrupted video \u03c4 at each specified noise level t \u2208 [1, T]:\nLMSE = \u2225\u03f5 \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b2t\u03c4 +\np\n\u03b2t\u03f5, t))\u22252\nGiven this learned denoising function, new videos may be generated from the diffusion model by\ninitializing a video sample \u03c4T at noise level T from a Gaussian N(0, I). This sample \u03c4T is then\niteratively denoised following the expression:\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3t\u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4 t, t) + \u03be),\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n,\n(1)\nwhere \u03b3t is the step size of denoising and \u03b1t is a linear decay on the currently denoised sample. The\nfinal sample \u03c40 after T rounds of denoising corresponds to the final generated video.\nEnergy-Based Models View of DDPMs.\nThe denoising function \u03f5\u03b8 estimates the score [24, 25, 7]\nof an underlying (unnormalized) EBM probability distribution [26, 27] characterizing the noise\nperturbed data. Therefore, a diffusion model corresponds to an EBM, p\u03b8(\u03c4) \u221d e\u2212E\u03b8(\u03c4), where the\ndenoising function is given by \u03f5(\u03c4 t, t) = \u2207\u03c4E\u03b8(\u03c4 t). The sampling procedure in a diffusion model\ncorresponds to the Langevin sampling procedure on an EBM (see derivation in Appendix A):\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3\u2207\u03c4E\u03b8(\u03c4 t) + \u03be),\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n.\n(2)\nThis equivalence of diffusion models and EBMs allows us to consider sampling from the product of\ntwo different diffusion models p1(\u03c4)p2(\u03c4), such that each diffusion model corresponds to an EBM,\ne\u2212E1(\u03c4) and e\u2212E2(\u03c4), and the product is given by e\u2212E\u2032(\u03c4) = e\u2212(E1(\u03c4)+E2(\u03c4)). In particular, we can\nsample from this new distribution also by using Langevin sampling:\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3\u2207\u03c4E\u2032\n\u03b8(\u03c4 t) + \u03be),\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n,\n(3)\nwhich corresponds to the sampling procedure using denoising functions\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3(\u03f51\n\u03b8(\u03c4 t, t) + \u03f52\n\u03b8(\u03c4 t, t)) + \u03be),\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n.\n(4)\nBelow we will illustrate how this factored EBM parameterization of a diffusion model can allow a\nlarge pretrained text-to-video model to be leveraged as a probabilistic prior.\n3\nProbabilistic Adaptation of Text-to-Video Models\nTo explain how a large text-conditioned video diffusion model can be effectively used as a probabilistic\nprior for video generation, we will first introduce the functional form we consider in Section 3.1, then\ndiscuss how the probabilistic composition can be implemented with diffusion models in Section 3.2.\nTo generate high-quality videos, we also explain in Section 3.3 how the underlying probabilistic\ncomposition can be sharpened generate low temperature samples.\n3\nPretrained Text-to-Video \n(5.6B)\nPretrain\nSmall Text-to-Video \n(0.07B)\nDomain \nSpecific\nTraining\nSampling\nPretrained\nSmall\n\u2026\nPretrained\nSmall\nFigure 2: Video Adapter Framework. Video Adapter only requires training a small domain-specific text-to-\nvideo model with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than a large video model pretrained from internet data.\nDuring sampling, Video Adapter composes the scores of the pretrained and the domain specific video models,\nachieving high-quality and flexible video synthesis.\n3.1\nLarge Text-to-Video Models as Probabilistic Priors\nLarge text-to-video models are now pretrained on massive datasets consisting of millions of videos,\nand are therefore able to capture a powerful prior ppretrained(\u03c4|text) on the natural distribution of\nvideos \u03c4. Such a distribution ppretrained(\u03c4|text) encodes ubiquitous characteristics that are shared\nacross videos such as temporal consistency, object permanence, and the underlying semantics of\ndifferent objects.\nGiven a smaller new dataset of video-text pairs, DAdapt = {(\u03c40, text0), (\u03c41, text1), . . . , (\u03c4T , textT )},\nhow can one leverage the powerful prior captured by a pretrained video diffusion model to synthesize\nvideos similar to those in DAdapt? One approach is to directly finetune the weights of ppretrained(\u03c4|text)\non the underlying videos of DAdapt. Such a direct approach however has several drawbacks: (1) The\nunderlying pretrained diffusion model will often have billions of parameters, making it difficult to\neven the load model weights in a consumer grade GPU, let alone finetuning. (2) The underlying\nweights of the network may further not be publicly accessible given different proprietary and industrial\nconstraints.\nSimilar challenges with large language models have led to the creation of training-free methods to\nadapt language models to new datasets DAdapt, where different prompts and in-context demonstrations\nare used to illicit desired language generation in language models. Analogously, we propose Video\nAdapter as a training-free method to adapt pretrained video diffusion to a new dataset of videos\nDAdapt through probabilistic composition. Given DAdapt, we learn a separate small video diffusion\nmodel p\u03b8(\u03c4|text) to represent the distribution of videos in DAdapt. We then adapt ppretrained(\u03c4|text) to\nDAdapt by constructing a product distribution pjoint(\u03c4|text) in the form:\npproduct(\u03c4|text)\n|\n{z\n}\nProduct Distribution\n\u221d ppretrained(\u03c4|text)\n|\n{z\n}\nPretrained Prior\np\u03b8(\u03c4|text)\n|\n{z\n}\nVideo Model\n.\n(5)\nBy fixing the pretrained model ppretrained(\u03c4|text), we train the video model p\u03b8(\u03c4|text) via maximum\nlikelihood estimation on DAdapt. This allows p\u03b8(\u03c4|text) to exhibit high likelihood across videos in\nDAdapt, but because it is a small model trained on less diverse data it can also exhibit erroneously\nhigh likelihood across many unrealistic videos. The product distribution pproduct(\u03c4|text) removes\nunrealistic videos by downweighting any videos \u03c4 that not likely under the pretrained prior, enabling\none to controllably generate videos in the style in DAdapt.\n3.2\nImplementing Probabilistic Adaptation\nTo adapt the large pretrained text-to-image model pproduct(\u03c4|text) from Equation 5, as well as to\nsample from it, we exploit the EBM interpretation of diffusion models discussed in Section 2. Based\non the EBM interpretation, the pretrained diffusion model ppretrained(\u03c4|text) corresponds to an EBM\ne\u2212Epretrained(\u03c4|text) while the smaller video model p\u03b8(\u03c4|text) parameterizes an EBM e\u2212E\u03b8(\u03c4|text). The\nproduct distribution then corresponds to:\npproduct(\u03c4|text) \u221d ppretrained(\u03c4|text)p\u03b8(\u03c4|text) \u221d e\u2212(Epretrained(\u03c4|text)+E\u03b8(\u03c4|text)) = e\u2212E\u2032(\u03c4|text),\nwhich specifies a new EBM E\u2032(\u03c4) from the sum of energy functions of the component models.\nSubstituting this EBM into Equation 3 shows that one can sample from the product distribution\npproduct(\u03c4|text) through the diffusion sampling procedure:\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3\u2207\u03c4(Epretrained(\u03c4 t|text) + E\u03b8(\u03c4 t|text)) + \u03be),\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n4\nwhich corresponds to sampling from Equation 1 according to\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3(\u03f5pretrained(\u03c4 t, t|text) + \u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4 t, t|text)) + \u03be),\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n.\nThus, to probabilistically adapt a pretrained text-to-video model to a new dataset DAdapt, we use the\nstandard diffusion sampling procedure, but where the denoising prediction is the sum of predictions\nfrom both the pretrained and small video diffusions. To control the strength of the pretrained prior in\non our final video generation, we scale the pretrained distribution by an inverse temperature \u03b3 to obtain\np\u03b3\npretrained(\u03c4|text), which corresponds to scaling the denoised prediction from \u03f5pretrained(\u03c4 t, t|text) by a\nscalar \u03b3\n\u03f5(\u03c4 t, t|text) = \u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4 t, t|text) + \u03b3\u03f5pretrained(\u03c4 t, t|text).\nA similar approach to combining the scores of multiple instances of a single diffusion model was\nused to enable compositional generation in [7]. Probabilistic adaption from the combined model can\nbe further improved by integrating multiple steps MCMC sampling between each diffusion noise\ndistribution as done in [28].\n3.3\nLow Temperature Sampling\nIn practice, directly denoising videos from a denoising network \u03f5(\u03c4 t, t) generates poor videos, as the\nunderlying learned distribution p\u03b8(\u03c4) exhibits too many spurious likelihood modes. To generate sharp\nvideos with diffusion models, low temperature video samples are generated by utilizing classifier free\nguidance [29], which corresponds to sampling from the modified probability composition:\npcfg(\u03c4|text) \u221d p(\u03c4)\n\u0012p(\u03c4|text)\np(\u03c4)\n\u0013\u03b1\n\u221d p(\u03c4)p(text|\u03c4)\u03b1,\nwhere \u03b1 corresponds to the classifier free guidance score, typically chosen to be significantly\nlarger than 1. By upweighting the expression p(text|\u03c4) via the inverse temperature \u03b1 the modified\ndistribution pcfg(\u03c4|text) above generates lower temperature video samples conditioned on the text.\nIt appears straightforward to similarly construct low temperature samples from our proposed compo-\nsition by sampling from the distribution\npcfg\nproduct(\u03c4|text) \u221d pcfg\npretrained(\u03c4|text)pcfg\n\u03b8 (\u03c4|text),\nbut using the classifier free distribution distribution pcfg\npretrained(\u03c4|text) as our probabilistic prior of\nvideo is now problematic, as it now has very few high probability modes.\nTo effectively leverage a broad probabilistic prior while simultaneously generating low temperature\nsamples, we propose to first construct a new text-conditional distribution video distribution following\nSection 3.1:\npproduct(\u03c4|text) \u221d ppretrained(\u03c4|text)p\u03b8(\u03c4|text).\nWe can then use the density ratio of this modified text-conditioned distribution with the unconditional\nvideo density p\u03b8(\u03c4) learned on DAdapt to construct a new implicit classifier pproduct(\u03c4|text).\nBy increasing the inverse temperature \u03b1 on this implicit classifier, we can generate low temperature\nand high quality video samples conditioned on a given text by sampling from the modified distribution\n\u02dcp\u2217\n\u03b8(\u03c4|text) = p\u03b8(\u03c4)\n\u0012 \u02dcp\u03b8(\u03c4|text)\np\u03b8(\u03c4)\n\u0013\u03b1\n,\nwhich corresponds to sampling from a modified denoising function\n\u02dc\u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4, t|text) = \u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4, t) + \u03b1(\u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4, t|text) + \u03b3\u03f5pretrained(\u03c4, t|text) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(\u03c4, t))\nWe quantitatively and qualitatively ablate the effect of this denoising function in Figure 6 and Table 9,\nshowing that this variant leads to better blending of styles between models.

In particular, leveraging a\nhigh quality and broad probabilistic prior enables (1) controllable video synthesis from edge-only\ninputs, (2) high-quality video modeling that outperforms both the pretrained model and the task-\nspecific video model, and (3) data augmentation between simulated and real robotic videos. See\nexperiment details and additional experimental results in Appendix B and in supplementary material.2\n4.1\nControllable Video Synthesis\nSetup.\nWe first demonstrate that the probabilistic prior in Video Adapter can used to adapt and\nmodify the styles of videos. We curate two adaptation datasets, one with an \u201canimation\u201d style and\nthe other with a \u201cscifi\u201d style, where videos containing relevant keywords in their descriptions are\ngrouped together to form DAdapt. To enable controllable video synthesis, we pretrain a large model to\nmap Sobel edges to videos, and similarly train task-specific small models to map Sobel edges to the\nstylized videos. The pretrained model has 5.6B parameters, whereas the task-specific small models\nhave only 6% of the pretrained model\u2019s parameters (330M).\nStylizing Video Generation.\nIn Figure 4, we demonstrate how the pretrained prior can adapt an\nanimation style model to generate videos in alternative styles, while maintaining an animated quality.\nIn Figure 5, we further demonstrate how the pretrained prior can also adapt the scifi style model to\ngenerate videos in other styles.\nEdges\nSmall\nVideo Adapter \n(Dark \nBackground)\nVideo Adapter \n(Abstract Video)\nFigure 3: Instance Specific Stylization. Video Adapter\nenables the stylization of video model trained on a single\nanimation style\nSpecific Animation Style.\nWe further trained\na small video model on an \u201canimation\u201d style\nof a particular artist. In Figure 3, we illustrate\nhow the pretrained prior model can maintain the\nartist\u2019s style while changing the background.\nAnalysis.\nIn Figure 6, we change the magni-\ntude of the weight on the pretrained prior, and\ncompare Video Adapter with directly interpo-\nlating the classifier-free scores between the pre-\ntrained and adapter models. We find that Video\nAdapter maintains the adapter style more accu-\nrately, whereas classifier-free score interpolation\ncollapses to the teacher style with intermediate\ninterpolation, leading to erratic artifacts.\n4.2\nHigh-Quality Efficient Video Modeling\nSetup.\nTo demonstrate Video Adapter\u2019s ability in adapting to video domains that are not a part of\npretraining, we consider adapting the pretrained model to two downstream datasets, Ego4D [20] and\nBridge Data [19]. These adaptations are nontrivial, as Ego4D consists of mostly egocentric videos\nthat are not commonly found on the internet. Similarly, the Bridge Data consists of task-specific\nvideos of a WidowX250 robot that is out of the distribution of the pretraining data. For Ego4D, we\ntake a subset of the original dataset consisting of 97k text-video pairs and split them into train (90%)\nand test (10%) to form DAdapt. For the Bridge Data, we take the entire dataset consisting of 7.2k\ntext-video pairs and use the same train-test split to form DAdapt.\n2See video visualizations at https://video-adapter.github.io/.\n6\nEdges\nSmall\nVideo Adapter \n(Digital Art)\nVideo Adapter \n(Outdoor Video)\nVideo Adapter \n(Storybook \nIllustration)\nEdges\nSmall\nVideo Adapter \n(Arcade Style)\nVideo Adapter \n(Science \nFiction)\nVideo Adapter \n(Blue Sunny\nDay)\nFigure 4: Video Adapter enables stylization of a Animation Specific Model.

Video Adapter enables a large\npretrained model to adapt and change the style a small Scifi animation style model.\nFor the pretrained model, we use the 5.6B base model pretrained on generic internet videos from [1].\nFor the task-specific small model, we downscale the video diffusion model from [1] by a factor of 80,\n40, and 2 to create a diverse set of small models to be trained on task-specific DAdapt. Table 1 shows\nthe number of parameters of pretrained and small video models. Both the pretrained model and the\nsmall models are trained to generate subsequent frames conditioned on the first frame.\nQuantitative Results.\nTable 1 shows the quantitative performance of Video Adapter under different\nvideo modeling metrics. On the Bridge Data, training a small model with parameters equivalent to\n1.25% of the pretrained video model (first row) already achieves better metrics than the pretrained\nmodel. However, Video Adapter incorporating the pretrained model as a probablistic prior is able to\nfurther improve the metrics of the small model (second row). On Ego4D, due to the complexity of\nthe egocentric videos, the smallest model with 1.25% of the pretrained video model can no longer\nachieve performance better than the pretrained model (first row), but incorporating the pretrained\nmodel during sampling still improves performance (second row). After increasing the size of the\nsmall model to half of the pretrained model, Video Adapter is able to achive better metrics than both\nthe pretrained and task-specific model.\nQualitative Results.\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 show the generated videos on Bridge Data and Ego4D.\nOn the Bridge Data in Figure 7, the pretrained model produces videos that do not correspond to the\ntask described by the text (there is no robot arm in the generated video). The task-specific small\nmodel produces videos with unrealistic movements that teleport the robot arm. Video Adapter, on\nthe other hand, produces videos with realistic movements that successfully complete the task. On\nEgo4D in Figure 8, the pretrained model produces high quality videos that contain little egocentric\nmovement (first row), as the pretraining data mostly consists of generic videos from the internet that\nare not egocentric. The task-specific small model trained on Ego4D, on the other hand, produces\nvideos with egocentric movement but of low quality (second row) due to limited model capacity.\nVideo Adapter combines the best of both and generates high-quality egocentric videos (third row).\n7\nEdges\nSmall\nComic Book\nWeight: 0.5\nComic Book\nWeight: 1.0\nVideo Adapter\nClassifier-Free Score Mix\nFigure 6: Analysis of Video Adapter. As the adaptation weight on a pretrained prior is increased, Video Adapter\nmaintains the original style of DAdapt while also adding style specified by the pretrained model.

We find that Video Adapter\nimproves performance, while interpolation between classifier-\nfree scores hurts performance.\n4.3\nSim-to-Real Video Augmentation\nSetup.\nOne important application of controllable video syn-\nthesis is to render realistic robotic videos from simulation with\na variety of data augmentations so that policies trained on the augmented observations are more\nlikely to generalize well to real-world settings [21]. To demonstrate Video Adapter\u2019s capability in\nsim-to-real transfer, we train a task-specific small edge-to-real model on 160k real robot trajectories\nof the LanguageTable dataset [30], generating videos of execution conditioned on the Sobel edges of\nthe real videos. Similarly, we train another small edge-to-sim model on 160k simulated robot videos.\nNote that the simulated and real robotics data are not paired (paired sim-to-real data are hard to find)\nbut are connected through edge-conditioning. We again leverage the edge-conditioned pretrained\nlarge model for customized stylisation.\nAdapted Videos.\nFigure 10 shows the generated robotic videos from Video Adapter. Video Adapter\ncan effectively generate paired simulated and real robotic videos that complete a task described by\na language prompt, and further generate videos with various data augmentation styles that can be\nutilized to train policies with better sim-to-real transfer abilities through techniques similar to domain\nrandomization [31].\n5\nRelated Work\nText-to-Video Synthesis.\nFollowing the recent success of text-to-image models [32, 33, 6, 34,\n35, 36, 37], large text-to-video models with autoregressive [2, 13, 38, 39] and diffusion [1, 3, 14,\n40, 41] structures have been developed, often by extending existing text-to-image models.

Video Adapter (third row) produces high-quality and egocentric videos.\nvideo generation can be much more complex than image generation due to the additional temporal\ndimension, text-to-video models are often significantly larger in size. For instance, Imagen Video [1]\nrequires a total of 11.6B parameters, and CogVideo [2] has 9B parameters. While various works have\nadopted latent diffusion to lower the computational overhead of video modeling [14, 42, 40, 41], these\nmodels still have a few billion parameters [14], which poses a significant computational challenge to\nfinetuning and domain specific adaptation.\nAdapting Pretrained Models\nAdapting pretrained models for customized editing, inpainting, and\nstylization has been extensively studied in text-to-image and image-to-image translation models [8, 43,\n44, 45, 46, 47, 9, 48, 49, 50]. In text-to-video models, most existing work on controlling generation\nbehavior has been to either leverage text prompts [51, 41], finetuning a pretrained video model on\nstylized data [52], or performing light training on a copy of the pretrained video model similar to\nControlNet [53]. Solely relying on text description to specify video style can be unreliable when\nthe desired style was not a part of any text description in the pretraining data.

Third row: real videos\nof execution plans generated by Video Adapter with data augmentation.\nvideo models, on the other hand, often gets too expensive as models get more complex. The idea of\nprompting as a training-free form of adaptation has been widely exploited in language models [54].\nOur work shares a similar spirit to language model prompting in that we do not finetune the weights\nof the pretrained video model. On the other hand, we use the pretrained model as a probablistic prior\nto achieve training free adaptation. Another set of work in adapting language models have trained a\nsmall controllable component similar to prefix-tuning [18] and LoRA [55]. Video Adapter\u2019s approach\nfalls in the same category as these work but is designed specifically for text-to-video generation.\nCompositional Generative Models.\nThe techniques in this paper are further related to existing\nwork on compositional generative modeling [7, 56, 57, 28, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], where\ndifferent generative models are probabilistically combined to jointly generate outputs. In [57], an\napproach to combine different probability distributions using EBMs is introduced. Most similar\nin spirit to this work, [62] composes a pretrained language model with a small EBM to improve\nlanguage generation. However, different from this work, the small EBM is used to improve to global\nconsistency of the language model, whereas we aim to use a small model to probabilistically adapt to\na large pretrained video model to separate domains.\n6\nConclusion\nAs text-to-video foundation models grow even larger, effective adaptation of such models to task-\nspecific usage is inevitable. We have introduced Video Adapter, an effective approach for using large\npretrained text-to-video models as a probabilistic prior that can guide generation of domain and task\nspecific videos. Video Adapter does not require any finetuning of the large pretrained model, yet is\nable to utilize knowledge from the pretrained model to synthesize higher quality videos in specific\ndomains or with particular styles of interest.\nLimitations and Broader Impact.\nWhile Video Adapter is proposed as a way to efficiently adapt\nlarge pretrained text-to-video models, it is not completely training free, as Video Adapter still requires\na small video model to be trained on domain-specific data. Additionally, Video Adapter requires\noutputting the score in addition to the generated video, which is not standard for existing text-to-image\nand text-to-video APIs. Since the lack of open access to model weights and computational efficiency\nare the main motivations of Video Adapter, Video Adapter effectively makes text-to-video research\nmore accessible to small industrial and academic institutions.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nThanks to Wilson Yan, Oleg Rybkin, Hanjun Dai, and Douglas Eck for reviewing draft versions of\nthis manuscript.

We further provide additional experimental details in Section B. Finally, we provide a\ncomparison with using the same computational budget to finetune the existing large pretrained model\nin Section C.\nA\nConnection between Diffusion and EBM\nThe sampling procedure in a diffusion model corresponds to the Langevin sampling procedure on an\nEBM. To see this, we consider perturbing a sample \u03c4 t\u22121 \u223c p\n\u0000\u03c4 t\u22121\u0001\nfrom target distribution p(\u03c4 t\u22121)\nwith a Gaussian noise, i.e.,\n\u03c4 t = \u03c4 t\u22121 + \u03be,\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\nwhich corresponds to the transition operator\nT (\u03c4 t|\u03c4 t\u22121) \u221d exp\n \n\u2212\n\r\r\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03c4 t\u22121\r\r2\n2\u03c32\nt\n!\nwhere the joint distribution of \u03c4 t and \u03c4 t\u22121 is\np(\u03c4 t, \u03c4 t\u22121) \u221d exp\n \n\u03c8\n\u0000\u03c4 t\u22121\u0001\n\u2212\n\r\r\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03c4 t\u22121\r\r2\n2\u03c32\nt\n!\n.\nWe can express the Bayes estimator of \u03c4 t\u22121 given the perturbed observation \u03c4 t as\nm(\u03c4 t) =\nZ\n\u03c4 t\u22121p\u03b8(\u03c4 t\u22121|\u03c4 t)d\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03c4 t + \u03c32\nt \u2207 log p\n\u0000\u03c4 t\u0001\n(6)\nProof By the property of Gaussian distribution, we have\n\u03c32\u2207x\u2032p (x\u2032|x) = p (x\u2032|x) (x \u2212 x\u2032) .\n(7)\nTherefore, we have\n\u03c3\u2207x\u2032\nZ\np (x\u2032|x) p(x)dx =\nZ\n(x \u2212 x\u2032) p (x\u2032, x) dx =\nZ\nxp (x\u2032, x) dx \u2212 x\u2032p(x\u2032)\n(8)\n\u21d2\n\u03c3\u2207x\u2032 log p (x\u2032) =\nZ\nxp (x\u2032, x)\np (x\u2032) dx \u2212 x\u2032 = E [X|x\u2032] \u2212 x\u2032\n(9)\nThus, we can represent the perturbed data with an EBM p(\u03c4 t) \u221d exp (E\u03b8 (\u03c4 t, \u03c3t)), and learn the\nparameters through regression [24, 67, 68, 25], which leads to the optimal solution\nmin\n\u03b8\nE\u03c4 t\u22121\u223cD,\u03be\u223cN (0,\u03c32\nt I)\nh\r\r\u03c4 t\u22121 \u2212 m(\u03c4 t)\n\r\r2i\n= E\u03c4 t\u22121\u223cD,\u03be\u223cN (0,\u03c32I)\nh\r\r\u2212\u03be \u2212 \u2207E\u03b8\n\u0000\u03c4 t\u22121 + \u03be, \u03c3t\n\u0001\n)\n\r\r2i\n,\n(10)\nwhch also corresponds to the denoising diffusion training objective.\nOnce we have the trained E\u03b8 (\u03c4 t), we can then recover the sample \u03c4 t\u22121 according the denoising\nsampling procedure\n\u03c4 t\u22121 = \u03b1tm(\u03c4 t) + \u03b1t\u03be = \u03b1t(\u03c4 t \u2212 \u03b3\u2207\u03c4 tE\u03b8\n\u0000\u03c4 t, \u03c3t\n\u0001\n) + \u03b1t\u03be,\n\u03be \u223c N\n\u00000, \u03c32\nt I\n\u0001\n(11)\nwhich corresponds to the sampling via stochastic localization [69] and Equation 2 in the main paper.\n15\nB\nExperimental Details\nB.1\nExperiment Details\nDataset\nThe large pretrained model is trained on 14 million video-text pairs plus 60 million image-\ntext pairs, and with the LAION-400M image-text dataset. The images are spatially resized to 24x40\nand videos using anti-aliased bi-linear resizing. We use different frame rate for different types of\nvideos for best visualization results. For the Bridge [19] we directly use the released opensource\ndataset. For Ego4D [20] data, we take a small portion of the released dataset. For Anime and Sci-Fi\nstyle, we curate two separates datasets with their respective keywords. The keywords used for filtering\ndata for Anime style are (in small letter) \u201cdisney\u201d, \u201ccartoon\u201d, \u201canime\u201d, \u201canimation\u201d, \u201ccomic\u201d, \u201cpixar\u201d,\n\u201canimated\u201d, \u201cfantasy\u201d. The keywords used for filtering data for Sci-Fi style are \u201cscience fiction\u201d,\n\u201csci-fi\u201d, \u201cscifi\u201d, \u201castronaut\u201d, \u201calien\u201d, \u201cNASA\u201d, \u201cinterstellar\u201d. For the animation with a particular artist\nstyle, we use the Case Closed animation (also named Detective Conan). For the Language Table\ndataset, we used the data from [30].\nDataset\nPretrain\nBridge\nEgo4D\nAnime\nSci-Fi\nCase Closed\nLangTable Sim\nLangTable Real\n# Train\n474M\n2.3k\n97k\n0.6M\n21k\n5k\n0.16M\n0.16M\nTable 2: Training data size. Number of text-video or text-image pairs used for training the pretrained large\nmodel and each of the small model. Training data for particular styles can be magnitude smaller than the\npretraining dataset.\nArchitecture.\nTo pretrain the large model, we use the same pretraining dataset, base architecture,\nand training setup as [1], with modifications of first-frame conditioning for Bridge and Ego4D, and\nedge conditioning for stylisation and sim-to-real. Specifically, the large model architecture consists of\nvideo U-Net with 3 residual blocks of 1024 base channels and channel multiplier [1, 2, 4], attention\nresolutions [6, 12, 24], attention head dimension 64, and conditioning embedding dimension 1024.\nTo support first frame conditioning, we replicate the first frame across all future frame indices, and\nconcatenate the replicated first frame channel-wise to the noisy data following [4]. To support edge\nconditioning, we run a sobel edge detector and use gradient approximations in the x-direction as\nthe conditional video, and concatenates these edge frames with noisy data similar to first-frame\nconditioning. The large model consists of 5.6 billion parameters in total. For the set of small models\nfor adaptation, Ego4D Small (L) has 512 base channels in each of the residual blocks. Ego4D Small\n(S) and Bridge Small (S) have a single residual block with 32 base channels. Bridge Small (L) has\na single residual block with 64 base channels. The set of stylisation models (animation, sci-fi, and\nparticular anime style) have 3 residual blocks and 256 base channels. For illustrating the generated\nvideos at a higher resolution, we train two additional spatial super resolution models 24x40 \u2192 48x80\n(1.4B) and 48x80 \u2192 192x320 (1.2B). We additionally use T5-XXL [70] to process input text prompts\nwhich consists of 4.6 billion parameters, which we omit from the parameter count as all large and\nsmall models require text embeddings.\nTraining and Evaluation.\nWe train each of our video diffusion models for 2M steps using batch\nsize 2048 with learning rate 1e-4 and 10k linear warmup steps. The large 5.6B pretrained model\nrequires 512 TPU-v4 chips, whereas various small models require anywhere between 8 and 256\nTPU-v4 chips depending on the size. We use noise schedule log SNR with range [-20, 20]. We use\n128 samples and 1024 samples to compute the FVD, FID, and Inception Scores metric on Bridge and\nEgo4dD, respectively.\nSampling.\nAll diffusion models are trained with 1000 timesteps of sampling. To generate videos,\nwe combined scores from both pretrained models and adapter models for all timesteps except the last\n100 timesteps. The last 100 timesteps capture high frequency information in an image, and we found\nbetter image quality if we did not combine scores in these timesteps. We use a pretrained neural\nstrength of 0.2 for Ego4D and 0.1 for Bridge, and 0.4 for all animation datasets.\n16\nC\nComparison to Finetuning\nTo illustrate the computational efficiency of Video Adapter, we further compare video modeling\nmetrics of Video Adapter to finetuning the pretrained model for an equivalent number of TPU time.\nSpecifically, the pretrained model requires 512 TPU-v4 chips whereas the small model on Bridge\ndata requires 8 TPU-v4 chips. The small Bridge model requires 100k steps to reach convergence, and\nhence we finetune the pretrained model for 100,000 / 64 = 1,560 steps. The finetuning results are\nshown in Table 3.

Despite\nextensive efforts in research and development of software vulnera-\nbility detection methods, uncaught vulnerabilities continue to put\nsoftware owners and users at risk. Many current vulnerability de-\ntection methods require that code snippets can compile and build\nbefore attempting detection. This, unfortunately, introduces a long\nlatency between the time a vulnerability is injected to the time it\nis removed, which can substantially increases the cost of fixing a\nvulnerability. We recognize that the current advances in machine\nlearning can be used to detect vulnerable code patterns on syn-\ntactically incomplete code snippets as the developer is writing the\ncode at EditTime. In this paper we present a practical system that\nleverages deep learning on a large-scale data set of vulnerable code\npatterns to learn complex manifestations of more than 250 vulner-\nability types and detect vulnerable code patterns at EditTime. We\ndiscuss zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches on state of\nthe art pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that\nin comparison with state of the art vulnerability detection models\nour approach improves the state of the art by 10%. We also evaluate\nour approach to detect vulnerability in auto-generated code by\ncode LLMs. Evaluation on a benchmark of high-risk code scenarios\nshows a reduction of up to 90% vulnerability reduction.\nKEYWORDS\nTransformers, Software Vulnerabilities, Vulnerability Detection\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nDespite development of many tools and best practices [3, 4, 12, 47],\nuncaught vulnerabilities persist in code[1, 2] and impact users\nand cost companies time and money[19]. In recent years, many\napproaches have been developed to detect vulnerabilities in soft-\nware. These approaches range from traditional dynamic analysis\n[25, 28, 48], rule-based static analysis [9, 51], feature-based ma-\nchine learning solutions [33], to more recent deep learning based\nsolutions [8, 30, 41, 53].\nApproaches that rely on dynamic analysis often suffer from low\ncode coverage issues. The rule-based static analysis approaches\ntypically involve manual efforts by experts to characterize and add\nnew or evolved vulnerability patterns on a regular basis. Similarly,\nfeature based machine learning approaches rely on hand-crafted\nfeatures by human experts. More recently, deep learning-based ap-\nproaches have emerged as an alternative which can learn vulnera-\nbility patterns automatically without expert involvement. However\nthe majority of these Deep learning approaches require a complete\nsource file [39], a complete function [23, 24, 41], or a complete\ncode statement [11, 43] to analyze. As a result, to the best of our\nknowledge, the existing deep learning approaches cannot find vul-\nnerabilities at EditTime while the developer is typing and the code\nis not yet syntactically correct or complete.\nFigure 1: The best time to notify the developer about a SQL-\nInjection vulnerability is at EditTime, right after the devel-\noper has made the mistake.\nThe literature indicates that the cost of fixing a fault is positively\ncorrelated with the fault ignorance time (i.e the time when a vul-\nnerability is injected to the time it is removed)[5, 6, 20]. Therefore,\nthe developer should be notified about the fault in a timely manner,\nwhen the fault is relevant to the current programming task[22].\nFor example, in the code snippet shown in Figure 1, the best time\nto notify the developer about the SQL injection they have intro-\nduced is right at the end of the query, even though their code is not\nsyntactically complete. The importance of interactively identifying\nbugs and vulnerabilities in code at EditTime has been recognized\nby prior work [50]. Our work extends this line of prior work by\nleveraging new advancements in deep learning to detect a variety\nof vulnerabilities in incomplete code snippets as the developer is\ntyping.\nTo build our vulnerability detection solution, we collect more\nthan 500K vulnerable code snippets from running static analyzers\non open source repositories. We then develop six model variations\nusing common learning approaches for pre-trained LLMs: zero-shot,\nfew-shot and fine-tuning. We apply these learning techniques on\nCodeBERT[15] and two state of the art pre-trained LLMs provided\nby OpenAI: code-davinci-002, text-davinci-003. Our compar-\native evaluation of these variations shows that fine-tuning Code-\nBERT offers the best balance between precision and recall (precision\nof 59% and recall of 63%). However, both zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning on recent text-davinci-003, which is an InstructGPT[35]\nbased language model, offer better recall (78% and 75%) and slightly\nlower precision (47% and 49%). We discuss the benefits and chal-\nlenges of each learning approach in terms of model size and perfor-\nmance.\nWe conduct two experiments using our best performing model.\nThe first experiment compares this model with existing vulnerabil-\nity detection approaches on four established benchmark datasets.\nWe show that, in comparison with existing approaches, our ap-\nproach improves recall up to 10% and precision up to 8%.\narXiv:2306.01754v1  [cs.CR]  23 May 2023\nThe second experiment studies the generalizability of our ap-\nproach beyond manual code edits by developers, where we investi-\ngate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting vulnerabilities\nin automated code edits. With the recent wide-spread adoption\nof code completion tools [17, 45, 46], many future code edits are\nexpected to be automatically generated by code LLMs. Prior work\nsuggests that code LLMs make similar mistakes to developers [14],\nthus auto-generated code edits can have potentially severe security\nconcerns. For example, in certain scenarios, up to 40% of the com-\npletions generated by code LLMs included vulnerable code patterns\n[38]. We evaluated our vulnerability detection model on a variant\nof the benchmark introduced by Pearce et al. [38]. Our evaluation\nshows that using our model yields 90% reduction in vulnerability\nrate.\nFinally we discuss the deployment journey of our vulnerability\ndetection model in a VSCode extension which has resulted in 80%\nreduction in rate of vulnerability in code edited with the extension.\nThis paper has the following contributions:\n(1) we present a production-quality vulnerability detection\nsystem which can identify vulnerabilities in incomplete\ncode snippets on the order of milliseconds and therefore\nserves developers at EditTime,\n(2) we explore and discuss the benefits and challenges of three\ncommon learning approaches for pre-trained LLMs on the\ntask of vulnerability detection: zero-shot, few-shot, and\nfine-tuning,\n(3) we expand the benchmark introduced by Pearce et al. and\nmake it available to the code vulnerability detection com-\nmunity as a future EditTime benchmark.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nWe discuss how our work builds upon and extends prior work\nin the area of Vulnerability Detection, Deep Learning methods\nfor Vulnerability Detection, and Vulnerability Detection in auto-\ngenerated code.\n2.1\nVulnerability Detection\nThere are two modalities of analyzing source code to search for vul-\nnerabilities: dynamic analysis, in which a code snippet is executed\nand the stack trace examined for signatures of a specific vulner-\nability; and static analysis, in which the source code is analyzed\nwithout execution. One common method of dynamic analysis is\nfuzzing, in which a program is run on many different inputs to\nexplore the space of program execution traces. Optimization tech-\nniques to efficiently search this program space are an active area of\nresearch [21, 31, 52]. However, fuzzing large code-bases by execut-\ning arbitrary code is infeasible, and has led to the development of\nstatic analysis techniques. Static analyzers search code-bases for\nsemantic patterns of bugs or vulnerabilities[37]. CodeQL [18] is a\npopular scalable static analyzer for such pattern-based searches.\nCodeQL offers a query language to write rule-based queries for\nspecific anti-patterns. We build upon this line of research by devel-\noping a vulnerability detection model that leverages state of the\nart deep learning approaches and therefore is capable of learning a\nvariety of vulnerability types without involving human experts.\n2.2\nDeep Learning Vulnerability Detection\nSince natural language and programming languages both possess\nsequential structure, model architectures with success in NLP, such\nas GRU, LSTM, and Transformer, have also shown promise in vul-\nnerability detection [49]. One unique characteristic of source code,\nnot shared by natural language, is the inherent graph structure\nof programs. VulDeePecker [30] extracts code gadgets from data\ndependency graphs and trains a BiLSTM classifier to detect vulner-\nabilities in a dataset of two different vulnerability types. SySeVR\n[29] builds on VulDeePecker by using both syntactic and semantic\ninformation to train vulnerability classifiers on a dataset of 126\nvulnerability types. Other works leverage graph neural networks to\nsupplement language models: IVdetect [27] uses GRU embeddings\nwith a Feature-Attention Graph Convolutional Network (FA-GCN)\nto detect vulnerabilities in program dependence graphs. LineVul\n[16] extends IVdetect by leveraging pretrained CodeBERT [15] to\nperform line-level vulnerability localization in addition to method-\nlevel detection. Devign [53] learns embeddings of code representa-\ntion graphs and trains a gated graph recurrent network to detect\nvulnerabilities for graph-level predictions. It evaluates this model\non vulnerabilities from FFmpeg and QEMU. ReVeal [8] introduces\na dataset of vulnerabilities from real-world software projects as a\nbenchmark for vulnerability detection models. It demonstrates this\nbenchmark using a gated graph neural network (GGNN) trained\non code property graphs. Our research extends prior work on vul-\nnerability detection by developing a neural vulnerability detection\nmodel for seven languages: JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, C++, C#\nand Ruby that is capable of detecting vulnerabilities at EditTime.\n2.3\nVulnerability Detection in Auto-generated\nCode\nTransformer-based models trained on source code have achieved\nstate of the art results for code generation[10, 26, 34]. These mod-\nels have unprecedented utility as developer-assistance tools, and\nare being deployed into products [17, 45, 46]. Since these code\nLLMs have been trained on large datasets of human-written code,\ntheir code outputs are increasingly likely to follow the patterns (or\nanti-patterns) of human developers. For example, [14] evaluated\nCodex on Java LeetCode questions and found that functionally\nincorrect completions from Codex share similar anti-patterns to\nincorrect code written by humans. Similarly, [38] examined Codex\nwith regard to generating vulnerabilities and found that, in certain\nscenarios, Codex did indeed generate vulnerable code patterns. In\nanother study, [44] showed that during functionality tests with the\nHumanEval dataset, GitHub Copilot generates certain CWEs in\naround 2% of cases. These studies suggest that code LLMs are likely\nlearning to generate both bad and good code. Luckily, since vulner-\nable code patterns are rare in human code and therefore make up\na small portion of training data, they are also rare in completions\nfrom Code LLMs. For example, a recent work studying the effect of\ncode LLM assistance did not find any conclusive evidence that code\nLLMs are more likely to generate vulnerabilities than humans [42].\nNevertheless, given the high cost associated with code vulnerabili-\nties, reducing vulnerable code patterns generated by code LLMs is\nessential in ensuring that their prolonged usage is safe, especially\nfor novice programmers. To this end, our research yields a model\n2\nthat can operate on syntactically incomplete code, and therefore\ndetect vulnerabilities in auto-generated code snippets as well as\nthe developer written code snippets at EditTime.\n3\nDETECTING VULNERABILITIES AT\nEDITTIME\nTo detect vulnerabilities at EditTime we develop six model variations\nusing common learning approaches for pre-trained LLMs: zero-shot,\nfew-shot and fine-tuning. Below, we first explain the training data\nwe collected for our fine-tuning process. We then explain the model\nvariants and their respective performances.\n3.1\nData Collection\nOur dataset consists of vulnerable code patterns detected in public\nGitHub repositories by the GitHub LGTM service. GitHub LGTM\nservice runs CodeQL [18], a scalable static analyzer, on public\nGitHub repositories to identify a variety of vulnerable code pat-\nterns, including hard-coded credentials, SQL injections, and path\ninjections. In this work, we select a subset of detected CodeQL is-\nsues that correspond to a set of \u201cCommon Weakness Enumeration\"\n(CWE) [32] in each of seven languages: JavaScript, Python, Go, Java,\nC++, C#, and Ruby.1 Table 1 shows the summary statistics of the\ncurated dataset.\nTable 1: Summary statistics of vulnerability detection train-\ning dataset\nModel\nCoverage\nVulnerable\nNon Vulnerable\nJavascript\n70 CWEs\n266,342\n2,293,712\nPython\n37 CWEs\n149,158\n1,493,972\nGo\n29 CWEs\n50,233\n535,180\nJava\n44 CWEs\n33,485\n431,726\nC++\n32 CWEs\n7,222\n215,722\nC#\n54 CWEs\n3,341\n27,731\nRuby\n19 CWEs\n137\n1,957\nEach detected vulnerability contains the following:\n\u2022 Vulnerability title: the type of detected vulnerability, corre-\nsponding to a CWE category\n\u2022 Message: a detailed error message explaining the detected\nvulnerability\n\u2022 Location: file path, line, and column where the issue starts\nand ends\n3.2\nData Pre-Processing\nGiven the data we collected, the goal of our data pre-processing\nstep was to synthesize the following triplets: (\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56) where \ud835\udc50 is a\nsnippet of code that the model takes in as context, \ud835\udc63 is the block of\ncode that is vulnerable, and \ud835\udc59 is the label for the vulnerability type.\nOur process for synthesizing training data is as follows: we first\ncollect files with identified vulnerabilities from all 8,815 repositories\nin which these issues were detected. For each file, we extract the\nAbstract Syntax Tree (AST), and search for nodes of the tree that\n1The\nsource\ncode\nfor\nall\nCodeQL\nqueries\nwe\nran\ncan\nbe\nfound\nat\nhttps://github.com/github/codeql under the ql/Security folders.\ncontain complete scopes. Specifically, we look for statements (such\nas if and export statements), methods, declarations and clauses.\nFor these blocks of code, if the code block contains a vulnerable\ncode pattern, we randomly split the block at some character before\nthe start of the detected vulnerability. Otherwise, if no vulnerability\nis detected, we randomly split the block at any point. This splitting\nprocess mimics a possible code state at EditTime. Therefore, models\ntrained on this data should be able to detect a vulnerable block\nin a syntactically incorrect and incomplete code snippet. The first\nsegment of the block is labeled as the \u201ccontext\" and the second\nsegment as the \u201cvulnerable block\". Figure 2 shows an example of\na context and vulnerable block pair. If the completion contains\na vulnerability, the corresponding vulnerability type is assigned\nto the example as a label. This separation between context and\nvulnerable block forces the model to focus on the vulnerable block\ngiven the context. We used a 85/5/10 train-validation-test split at\nthe repository level, such that the training set is comprised of 85%\nof the repositories, the validation set is comprised of 5% of the\nrepositories and the test set is comprised of 10% of the repositories.\nWe then removed any example in the training set that matches a\ntest set example.\nFigure 2: A sample context and vulnerable block from our\ntraining data. In this example, the vulnerable block contains\nthe SQL-Injection vulnerability.\n3.3\nModels\nIn order to detect vulnerabilities at EditTime, we develop six model\nvariations using three learning approaches for LLMs: zero-shot\nlearning, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning. We use these learning\napproaches on three pre-trained LLMs as our base:\n\u2022 code-davinci-002: full-size Codex model which is trained\non source code from GitHub.\n\u2022 text-davinci-003: Codex model based on InstructGPT\n[36], using reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF).\n\u2022 CodeBERT: transformer pre-trained trained on bimodal\ndata (code and documents)[15]. Its architecture follows\nRoBERTa-base [13], with 12 layers, 12 attention heads, and\na hidden size of 768.\nUsing three learning approaches on the above pre-trained models\nyields six models that are listed in Table 3. We explain the details\nof developing these models below.\n3\n3.3.1\nZero-shot Learning. In zero-shot learning, we provide a pre-\ntrained model with a prompt that specifies our desired output. In\nour case, we prompt codedavinci-002 and text-davinci-003. In\norder to obtain a suitable prompt for asking each model to detect vul-\nnerabilities, we leverage the model\u2019s own definition of vulnerability\ndetection. We first prompt the model to define the vulnerability\ndetection task and use this task description in the final prompt for\nthe task.\nFor code-davinci-002 we prompt the model with \"# We run\nCodeQL security queries in order to \" on temperature 0.8 for four\ntimes and pick the top results. This yields the following prompt\nvariations: \"identify potential security vulnerabilities\", \"find potential\nsecurity issues\", \"find security vulnerabilities\", and \"detect security\nvulnerabilities\". We place these variations in a zero-shot prompt\nfollowing the below template:\n<phrase >\n<comment > Code snippet\n<code snippet >\n<comment > Answer (Yes/No, explanation ):\nHere < \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52 > corresponds to one of the prompt phrasing varia-\ntions above, < \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 > refers to a language specific comment\nindicator (e.g. \"#\" for Python) and < \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 > refers to the\ncode snippet in question. Figure 3 shows a sample prompt follow-\ning this template. In response to this prompt, the model outputs\neither Yes or No, followed by an explanation which can be used for\nobservations and debugging purposes. We check for the presence\nof \"Yes\" or \"No\" to determine the model\u2019s decision. We refer to this\nzero-shot approach as CodexZero.\nFigure 3: A sample prompt created based on our template for\nzero-shot setting\nSimilarly, for text-davinci-003, we first prompt the model\nfour times at temperature 0.8 with the question, \"What would you\naccomplish by running CodeQL security queries?\". We then ask the\nmodel to rephrase its response four times. This yields the following\nunique phrases: \"identify potential security vulnerabilities\", \"spot\nany security weaknesses\", \"detect any security risks\", \"determine any\nsecurity issues\". We then try these variations in a zero-shot prompt\nfollowing a similar template:\n<phrase >\n<code snippet >\nAnswer (Yes/No):\nWe check for the presence of \"Yes\" or \"No\" in the model\u2019s response to\ndetermine the model\u2019s decision. We refer to this zero-shot approach\nas TextZero.\n3.3.2\nFew-shot Learning. Few-shot learning builds on zero-shot\nlearning by providing example input-output pairs, in addition to\nthe zero-shot prompt. For our study, we utilize the best performing\nprompt variations of code-davinci-002 and textdavinci-003\nfrom our zero-shot learning in the same template format. We then\nprepend additional examples in the same template format before\nfinally inserting the code snippet of interest and prompting the\nmodel for the answer.\nTo create the examples, we prompt each model with the phrase,\n\"Provide an example in <Language> of a code snippet that contains\n<Vulnerability Name> security vulnerability. Output the code only, do\nnot include text:\" for each of the languages and types of vulnerabili-\nties in Table 2. We prompt with this template three times for each\nvulnerability and language pair, yielding 150 vulnerable examples.\nWe then prompt the model with \"Provide an example in <Language>\nof a code snippet. Output the code only, do not include text:\", to retrieve\nnon vulnerable samples of code. We manually evaluate each sample\nto ensure that they were vulnerable or non vulnerable as intended.\nIn total, there were 297 examples. We refer to the models resulting\nfrom the above few-shot learning process with code-davinci-002\nand text-davinci-003 as CodexFew and TextFew, respectively.\n3.3.3\nFine-tuning. For fine-tuning, we focus on pre-trained code\nLLMs only and fine-tune CodeBERT and code-davinci-002. For\nCodeBERT, we add a linear classification head to its BERT trunk in\norder to build a multi-class classification model. The inputs to the\nmodel are the context and vulnerable code block, separated by a\nspecial [SEP] token and bounded by a beginning of sequence [BOS]\ntoken and end of sequence [EOS] token\n[\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46],\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502, ...\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b, [\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc43], \ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, ...\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5a, [\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46]\nwhere \ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502, ...\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b denotes a sequence of n tokens of context code\nsurrounding the vulnerability and \ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, ...\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5a denotes a sequence of\n\ud835\udc5a tokens of the vulnerable block of code. We distinguish between\ncontext and vulnerable block to enable the model to process any\ngiven complete or incomplete code snippet. Because our data is\nvastly imbalanced with less than 10% vulnerable examples, we\nemploy an oversampling technique on the vulnerable examples\nwhile training: for each epoch, all vulnerable examples are retained\nwhile the non-vulnerable examples are rotated through so that each\nepoch contains 50% vulnerable and 50% non vulnerable examples.\nThe model is trained with a standard binary cross entropy (BCE) loss.\nIn the rest of this work, we refer to this model as DeepDevVuln.\nOur second fine-tuned model is a fine-tuned version of code-\ndavinci-002 on 30,000 randomly sampled examples from our train-\ning set. We down-size our training data due to the cost of fine-tuning\nthe model on the entirety of the training set. In this case, the con-\ntext and vulnerable block are concatenated together, then a special\nclassification token is appended to the end of the sequence. Be-\ncause code-davinci-002 is a GPT decoder model that does not\ninherently perform classification, we use next-token prediction as\na proxy, i.e. the output is a special token that signifies vulnerable\nor not. The sequence is as follows:\n[\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46],\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502, ...\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, ..., \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b[\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46][\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc41]\nWe refer to this variant as CodexVuln.\n4\nTable 2: Summary statistics of vulnerable issues gathered\nfrom Github PRs\nVulnerability\nCWE\nN\nSQL Injection\n89\n45\nHardcoded Credentials\n798\n23\nCode Injection\n94\n13\nPath Injection\n22\n7\nClear Text Logging\n312\n5\nWeak Cryptographic Algorithm\n327\n5\nIncomplete URL Substring Sanitization\n20\n2\n3.4\nModel Variant Evaluation\nTo better understand the effect of model architecture and training\nchoices, we compare our six model variants on a dataset we collect\nfrom GitHub pull requests.\n3.4.1\nMetrics. The majority of existing approaches treat vulnera-\nbility detection as a classification problem. Given a block of code,\nthe model makes a binary decision on whether the code is vulner-\nable or not. Therefore, in our evaluations we also use the most\ncommon evaluation metrics for a classification task [40] which\nincludes:\n\u2022 Precision: which indicates the correctness of predictions\nand calculated as true positive / (true positive + false posi-\ntive)\n\u2022 Recall: which indicates the effectiveness of the prediction\nand calculated as true positive / (true positive + false nega-\ntive).\n\u2022 F1-score: which indicates balance between precision and\nrecall and is defined as the geometric mean of the two.\nTable 3: Performance of DeepDevVuln model on Github PR\nVulnerabilities dataset.\nModel\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1-Score\nDeepDevVuln\n58.87%\n63.00%\n60.87%\nCodexVuln\n69.56%\n48.00%\n56.80%\nCodexZero\n11.08%\n98.00%\n19.90%\nTextZero\n46.99%\n78.00%\n58.65%\nCodexFew (8 examples)\n23.91%\n95.00%\n37.70%\nTextFew (6 examples)\n49.01%\n75.00%\n59.29%\n3.4.2\nDataset. To create this dataset, we collect all pull requests\nthat contained \"fix <issue>\" in the pull request title for every combi-\nnation of issue from Table 2 and language (i.e. JavaScript, Python,\nGo, Java, C++, C#, Ruby). To ensure that the retrieved pull requests\nwere relevant to the target vulnerability, we only include the pull\nrequests that contain both removal and addition of code and were\nless than 100 lines in length. This yields 283 pull requests. We then\nmanually examine each pull request to ensure the vulnerabilities\nare legitimate.\nUsing this process, we gather a set of 100 vulnerable examples\nconstituting the CWEs in Table 2. We added a set of 906 non vulnera-\nble examples to this dataset. To collect the non vulnerable examples,\nwe randomly sample 150 files from repositories that CodeQL has\nscanned and has not detected an issue. We then randomly select\nchunks of non-overlapping code between 1 to 10 lines from these\nfiles to generate nonvulnerable examples. In total, the GitHub PR\ndataset contains 1,006 examples.\nFigure 4: A sample of CodexZero false positive due to over-\nreach\nFigure 5: A sample of CodexVuln false positive due to lack\nof context\n3.4.3\nResults. Table 3 shows the performance of our model vari-\nants on this dataset. For these six model variants, we can see that\nDeepDevVuln has the best performance with respect to F1 score.\nEvery zero-shot and few-shot variant outperforms DeepDevVuln\nin terms of recall, however the precision of each variant is signifi-\ncantly lower. One reason might be that the zero-shot and few-shot\nmodels have a wider definition of what constitutes vulnerable code.\nFor example, the code snippet presented in Figure 4 below does\nnot have any explicit vulnerabilities, however, CodexZero consid-\ners the worst-case scenario that the code may be vulnerable to a\nbuffer overflow in the future. Due to this tendency, it seems that\nCodexZero will raise an alert even if there is no explicit vulnera-\nbility present, which leads to a high recall score but low precision\nscore.\nAnother example further explains CodexZero\u2019s high false posi-\ntive rate. In Figure 5, we see that the model lacks context around\nthe variable \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51, and explains that because it was never initialized,\naccessing the memory at that location could lead to a vulnerability.\nThis explanation extends, in part, to TextZero, which has a more\nbalanced precision and recall. In TextZero\u2019s case, the prompt vari-\nation used had a significant effect: for example, the first prompt\nvariation \"identify potential security vulnerabilities\" had similar re-\nsults to CodexZero. However, using the phrase \"detect any security\nrisks\" led to the result in Table 3. This may have encouraged the\nmodel to focus on the exact code snippet as-is, rather than to spec-\nulate about possible vulnerabilities.\n5\nComparing few-shot and zero-shot results, we see the few-shot\nevaluations surpassed their zero-shot counterparts. One explana-\ntion is that the inclusion of examples gives the model a sense of\nwhat to expect in terms of code snippet length and area of focus. For\ninstance, when the non-vulnerable examples include uninitialized\nvariables and incomplete context, the model starts to ignore the\nworst-case scenarios explained above.\nFinding the best number of examples was a matter of gradually\nincreasing the number of examples prepended to the prompt from\n1 to 9. We ran several trials and reported the best results. Among\nthese trials, we observed that, especially for CodexFew, there is an\napparent correlation between larger number of examples and the\nprecision and recall achieved as seen in Figure 6. It may be that the\nexact types of examples selected have a major role in steering the\nmodel\u2019s output. A similar trend for precision, but not recall, was\nobserved for TextFew, Figure 7.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\nBelow, we explain our experiments designed to answer the follow-\ning two research questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: How effective is our vulnerability detection model\ncompared to results from state of the art models on estab-\nlished benchmark datasets?\n\u2022 RQ2: To what extent our proposed vulnerability detection\nmodel is effective in reducing the vulnerability rate of code\nLLMs?\nWe perform two experiments to answer these questions. The first\nexperiment focuses on comparing our model against the state of the\nart vulnerability detection models on common datasets. The second\nexperiment gauges the effectiveness of our model in reducing the\nvulnerability rate of code LLMs.\n4.1\nExperiment 1: Performance against Existing\nApproaches on Benchmark Datasets\nIn this section, we present the experimental evaluation of our\nvulnerability detection model against existing state of the art ap-\nproaches on four widely used datasets. Table 4 summarizes the\ndatasets used in this experiment.\n4.1.1\nExperimental Setup. The granularity of the data, quality of\nthe data, and types of issues covered in each of the datasets in\nTable 4 is different from our training and test set. Therefore, we\nfollowed the approach of Chakraborty et al. [8], where we first\nremove duplicate examples from each of the datasets. We then fine-\ntune DeepDevVuln as a binary classification model on each dataset\nfor 10 epochs. For each dataset, we use a standard 80%/10%/10%\ntrain/validation/test split, consistent with the baseline models.\n4.1.2\nResults. As shown in Table 5, our DeepDevVuln model has\nthe best overall F1-Score for the majority of datasets. This means\nthat our model demonstrates a good balance between precision and\nrecall which is important for vulnerability detection. Additionally,\nour vulnerability detection model has 10 times fewer parameters\nthan GPT2-Large or Codex, yet still achieves comparable precision\nand higher recall. Overall this results suggests that our approach\nallowed our model to adapt to the specific types of issues present\nFigure 6: Trials varying examples of CodexFew\nFigure 7: Trials varying examples of TextFew\nin these datasets and leverage its knowledge gained through pre-\ntraining on our vulnerability dataset to improve upon the state of\nthe art results.\n4.2\nExperiment 2: Model\u2019s effectiveness in\nreducing the vulnerability rate of code LLMs\nIn our second experiment, we evaluated the effectiveness of our\nvulnerability detection model in detecting the vulnerable code com-\npletions of four different code LLMs:\n\u2022 CodeGen-2B: a transformer decoder model trained on natu-\nral language and code (C, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python)\n\u2022 code-cushman-001: smaller-size Codex model, trained on\nsource code from GitHub\n\u2022 code-davinci-002: full-size Codex model, trained on source\ncode from GitHub\n\u2022 text-davinci-003: Codex model based on InstructGPT\n[36], using reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF)\n6\nTable 4: Summary of common vulnerability detection datasets.\nDataset\n# Programs\n% Vuln\n# Duplicates\nGranularity\nDescription\nVulDeePecker [30]\n61,638\n28.76%\n33,786\nSlice\nIt was obtained by preprocessing examples from the\nNational Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Software\nAssurance Reference Dataset (SARD) and consists of\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within\nthe Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-399 (Resource\nManagement Errors).\nSeVC [29]\n420,627\n13.41%\n188,030\nSlice\nAn improvement over the VulDeePecker dataset, cover-\ning 126 different types of vulnerabilities and divided into\nfour categories: API Function Call, Arithmetic Expres-\nsion, Array Usage, and Pointer Usage.\nReVeal [8]\n22,734\n9.85%\n351\nFunction\nIt tracks past vulnerabilities from the Linux Debian Ker-\nnel and Chromium projects.

Each scenario is associated\nwith a particular CWE and includes a prompt code snippet and a\ncorresponding CodeQL query. The prompt is used as input to a code\nLLM. The model-generated completion is appended to the prompt\nand this completed snippet is then analyzed using the provided\nCodeQL query. Completions that cannot be analyzed by CodeQL\n(due to syntactical errors) are considered invalid and excluded from\nthe analysis. CodeQL marks the remaining valid completions as\neither vulnerable or clean.\nWe took the 29 Python scenarios developed by [38] and, fol-\nlowing the same process, we added 11 new JavaScript scenarios\ncovering 10 CWEs to the benchmark. Table 6 describes the scenar-\nios we added using the same format as in [38]. \u201cRank\" reflects the\nCWE ranking in the MITRE list if applicable. CWE-Scn refers to\nthe scenario\u2019s identifier and associated CWE. All of these scenarios\nare written in JavaScript, originate from the public GitHub CodeQL\ndocumentation, and were evaluated with CodeQL.\nTable 6: Javascript Scenarios covering 10 CWEs in Javascript\nRank\nCWE-Scn.\nDescription\n3\nCWE-89\nSQL Injection\n4\nCWE-20\nIncomplete Url Substring Sanitization\n8\nCWE-22\nTainted Path\n15\nCWE-798\nHardcoded Credentials\n25\nCWE-94\nCode Injection\n35\nCWE-601\nClient Side Url Redirection\n35\nCWE-601\nServer Side Url Redirection\n40\nCWE-312\nClear Text Storage of Sensitive Data\n-\nCWE-209\nStack Trace Exposure\n-\nCWE-327\nBroken Cryptographic Algorithm\n-\nCWE-916\nInsufficient Password Hash\nFor each scenario, a model can generate a varying number of\nvalid or vulnerable completions. In the context of code LLMs, a de-\nveloper may often see only a single completion for a given prompt.\nTherefore, we evaluate vulnerability rates at the level of scenarios\n(prompts): we count the number of scenarios that yielded at least\none vulnerable completion. For example, suppose there are 10 sce-\nnarios and each model generates 5 completions per scenario. For\neach of the 10 scenarios, we run the corresponding CodeQL query\non its 5 completions. Suppose that 9 scenarios have at least one\nsyntactically valid completion. We consider the 9 scenarios with\n7\nvalid completions and examine how many of the 9 have at least\none vulnerable completion.\nFor each model, we generate 25 completions per scenario. We\nthen run our vulnerability detection model on each completion\nand filter out the completions that our model detects as vulnerable.\nWe then rerun the CodeQL queries from the benchmark on the\nremaining completions.\n4.2.1\nResults. The results of this vulnerability experiment are\nshown in Table 7. The first two columns corresponds to each code\nLLM acting alone, while the second two columns includes filtration\nfrom our vulnerability detection model. The vulnerability reduction\nrate is the percentage reduction in the vulnerability rate as a result\nof filtration.\nAs shown in the table, filtering vulnerable outputs results in a sig-\nnificant decrease in vulnerability rate. In particular, the vulnerabil-\nity reduction rate is highest for text-davinci-003, which follows\nInstructGPT\u2019s method of reinforcement learning from human feed-\nback (RLHF). RLHF is known to substantially improve the quality\nand naturalness of generated text. Therefore, text-davinci-003\nlikely generates code that more closely resembles code written by\nreal developers. Since DeepDevVuln is trained on developer-written\ncode, it may be better able to detect vulnerabilities in outputs from\ntext-davinci-003 than other code LLMs.\n5\nDEPLOYING IN PRODUCTION\nWe deployed our model for detecting vulnerable code patterns in a\nVSCode extension with \u223c100K daily users. After each key stroke\nthat a user writes, their incomplete code snippets are sent to our\nmodel for verification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model,\nwe collected and examined the JavaScript code snippets that were\nsent to our model in a three month period, from November 2022 to\nJanuary 2023, for a total of \u223c6.7M code snippets. We chose to focus\non JavaScript because it is the most popular language in VSCode.\nIn order to have a baseline for comparison, we ran all the CodeQL\nsecurity queries for JavaScript on the collected code snippets. Over-\nall, CodeQL detected \u223c1,284 vulnerable code snippets. However,\nthis number is a lower-bound for the amount of actual vulnerable\ncode snippets. CodeQL queries do not successfully run and detect\nissues in all of the code snippets, because CodeQL is designed to\nrun on a set of complete files in a repository. Therefore, CodeQL\u2019s\nvulnerability detection rate drops significantly when executed on\nsyntactically-incorrect code or incomplete code that is presented\nin a single file as opposed to the repository context. This drop im-\npacts some scenarios more than others, depending on sensitivity\nof the query to syntax issues and the amount of context required\nby the query to detect a vulnerability. Of CodeQL\u2019s vulnerability\ndetections, over 58% were from two scenarios which have simple\nCodeQL queries requiring less context to run successfully. In com-\nparison, DeepDevVuln detections were more uniform. In fact, over\n57% of DeepDevVuln detections were from SQL Injection, Code\nInjection, Client Side URL Redirect, Server Side URL Redirect, and\nInsufficient Password Hash scenarios. This is significant because\nJavaScript is a dominant language in both client- and server-side\nweb development, and these classes should be more prominent in\nthis domain. Yet, CodeQL detects these scenarios at a rate of less\nthan 1 in 1,000,000. CodeQL\u2019s poor coverage and inability to detect\nvulnerabilities on this production data highlights the need for deep\nlearning based detection systems in live services.\nFor our evaluation, because CodeQL-detected issues are a lower-\nbound on the number of issues, we use them to measure recall.\nInstead of precision, we measure the positive rate (number of de-\ntected issues over number of all scanned issues). Figure 8 shows\nhow our DeepDevVuln model performs on recall vs positive rate: it\ncan achieve up to 90% recall with around 1% positive rate. While\nwe optimized for recall for our extension, other applications can\nfind the right balance between recall and positive rate based on\ntheir user scenario and feedback.\nFigure 8: DeepDevVuln model\u2019s performance on recall vs.\npositive rate\nOverall, we observed that DeepDevVuln\u2019s vulnerability reduc-\ntion rate (i.e. the reduction in the rate of vulnerabilities present in\ndeveloper\u2019s code) for JavaScript was 89.64%.\n6\nLESSONS LEARNED AND ONGOING WORK\nIn the process of building and deploying our model, we learned\na few lessons that have guided our ongoing and future work on\nvulnerability detection.\nFirst, the different learning methods we explored in this work\ncome with trade-offs in model size, inference cost, predictive per-\nformance, and maintenance cost. Zero-shot and few-shot learning\nrequire sufficiently large models in order to effectively make pre-\ndictions. Furthermore, predictive performance tends to improve\nwith model size. For a constant model size, the inference cost of\nzero-shot learning is slightly higher than for fine-tuning, since a\nprompt must be constructed for each example; the cost for few-shot\nlearning is even higher, since the system must fetch examples for\neach example. Our results show that a fine-tuning approach yielded\nthe best prediction performance, allowing us to make accurate pre-\ndictions without incurring high inference cost. However, in order\nto maintain a fine-tuned model, we must continually monitor and\nretrain the model on additional vulnerability types. Zero-shot and\n8\nTable 7: Vulnerability rate on scenario level for different baselines.\nWithout DeepDevVuln\nWith DeepDevVuln\nApproach\nValid\nScenarios\nVulnerable\nScenarios\nValid\nScenarios\nVulnerable\nScenarios\nVulnerability\nReduction Rate\nCodeGen (6B)\n7\n7 (100.00%)\n7\n2 (29.00%)\n71.00%\ncode-cushman-001\n25\n25 (100.00%)\n19\n5 (26.0%)\n74.00%\ncode-davinci-002\n26\n24 (92.00%)\n20\n7 (35.0%\n61.96%\ntext-davinci-003\n27\n21 (78.00%)\n24\n2 (8.0%)\n89.74%\nfew-shot learning, on the other hand, would only require mainte-\nnance with regard to prompts and examples, rather than any further\ntraining.\nSecond, there is a trade-off between the size of a model and its\nresponse time. This work focuses on detecting vulnerabilities at\nEditTime, while a developer is writing code in an IDE. A large vul-\nnerability detection model requires more time to make predictions,\nwhich can result in delayed response and the developer missing the\nvulnerability. In order to maintain low prediction latency, our vul-\nnerability detection is based on the relatively small CodeBERT-base\nmodel and has under 100M parameters. As more powerful hardware\nis built to run large models and improve the inference time, we\nexpect to be able to run large models in production settings in our\nfuture iterations.\nThird, in many classification problems, a model\u2019s prediction\nthreshold is used to create an appropriate balance between pre-\ncision and recall. The balance is important because an effective\nproduction-ready fault detector must minimize churn and false\npositives [7]. High churn, where the issues raised vary from one\nversion of the system to another, can cause significant friction with\nusers due to a lack of consistency. False positives can similarly\nerode developer trust in the usefulness of a system, resulting in\ndevelopers ignoring the tool. In our case, we do not have the ground\ntruth of all vulnerable code snippets for our live evaluations, and\ntherefore we cannot measure precision In this case, the analogous\nmetrics are positive rate (the fraction of examples that the model\npredicts as positive) and recall. Our second lesson was in balancing\nthese metrics for a production-scale vulnerability detection system.\nWe tuned our threshold to maintain a 1% positive rate based on\ninitial user\u2019s interactions and feedback. However more long-term\nstudies and monitoring of these metrics are needed to better adjust\nthe balance.\nFinally we learned that we should periodically retrain our model\nto expand coverage as new vulnerability types are caught. When\nthe common vulnerabilities are caught early on in the development\nprocess, users may start to notice the uncommon vulnerabilities\nand this may hurt their trust on detection tools overtime. Therefore,\nto address this challenge we have implemented a retraining pipeline\nwhere we constantly find datasets with new vulnerabilities to feed\nthe pipeline and expand the coverage.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nCode vulnerabilities continue to cost software companies and users.\nDetecting vulnerabilities in code at EditTime when the code is writ-\nten by a developer or generated by a code LLM is essential to ensure\nthe vulnerabilities are fixed at lower cost. Yet, the majority of cur-\nrent vulnerability detection tools do not detect vulnerabilities at\nEditTime. Our work closes this gap by presenting a vulnerability\ndetection model that detects vulnerabilities on incomplete code\nsnippets and therefore can be used to detect vulnerable code pat-\nterns at EditTime when code LLMs or developers write them. Our\nevaluation results showed that our model improves the state of the\nart detection approaches by 10% in recall and 8% in precision. In\naddition, our model reduces the vulnerability rate of code LLMs by\n>89%.\nAn immediate direction for future work is to expand our vul-\nnerability detection model\u2019s coverage with adding new types of\nvulnerabilities to our training set. Another direction is to measure\nthe long-term effect of our vulnerability detection model on the\noverall experience of developers who are using our VSCode exten-\nsion. For example, measures can include the vulnerability reduction\nrate, whether the file under development resulted in a unit test\nfailure, or whether a vulnerability was caught in the file after the\nEditTime (e.g. build time).\nREFERENCES\n[1] 2022.

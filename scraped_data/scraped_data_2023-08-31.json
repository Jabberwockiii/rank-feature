Our code will be publicly available\nupon publication.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently ad-\nvanced the state-of-the-art across various natural\nlanguage processing tasks.\nThese LLMs typi-\ncally train on text segments (e.g., less than 4K to-\nkens(Touvron et al., 2023b; Team, 2023), primarily\ndue to the computation overhead quadratic in the\ninput lengths of their Transformer architectures. As\n*Work performed as an intern in Meta GenAI.\na result, they face challenges in generalization to\nunseen lengths: when evaluated on inputs that are\nlonger than those seen during training, their quality\noften substantially drops (Tworkowski et al., 2023;\nChen et al., 2023). This limits their applicability\nin tasks that require long-range contexts, such as\nencoding scientific articles, source code repository\ngeneration, or long-context dialogues.\nExtensive efforts have been devoted to address-\ning this length generalization challenge. Relative\npositional encodings such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021)\nand Alibi (Press et al., 2021) have been widely\nadopted by state-of-the-art LLMs, which calcu-\nlate attention based on inter-token distance instead\nof absolute positions, hoping to avoid model fail-\nures due to unseen absolute position embeddings\nMoreover, although truncating the attention win-\ndow of the Transformer architecture (Beltagy et al.,\n2020; Ding et al., 2023; Zaheer et al., 2020) can\nreduce the memory overhead, they are not directly\napplied to pre-trained models for length generaliza-\ntion but require explicit training instead. Through\nboth theoretical analysis and empirical investiga-\ntion, \u00a73 pinpoints three primary factors underlying\nthe length generalization failures: the challenges\nof handling unseen distances among tokens, attend-\ning to unseen numbers of tokens, and implicitly\nencoded positional information. They can make\ncomputational features, such as attention logits and\nhidden vectors, deviate from the training distribu-\ntion. Existing techniques fall short of addressing\nthese underlying issues.\nAnswering to these challenges, we propose LM-\nInfinite, a simple and effective method to enhance\nTransformer LLMs\u2019 capabilities for modeling long\ncontexts. LM-Infinite consists of two major compo-\nnents that are designed to alleviate the three factors\nabove: (1) a \u039b-shaped attention mask and (2) a\nceiling on attention distances. The former forces\nthe model to attend to only the beginning of the\nsequence and the most recent tokens within a pre-\narXiv:2308.16137v6  [cs.CL]  9 Mar 2024\ndefined window, ignoring the rest. The latter caps\nthe relative distance values to the maximum the\nmodel has seen during training. It can also option-\nally re-introduce top-k tokens in the middle for\nenhanced downstream performance. LM-Infinite\nis highly flexible and applies to any LLMs that use\nrelative positional encoding, without parameter up-\ndates.\nOur experiments thoroughly evaluate LM-\nInfinite on a variety of tasks and LLMs.\nOn\nArXiv (academic papers) and OpenWebText2 (Red-\ndit posts) LM-Infinite facilitates zero-shot gener-\nalization for a wide range of LLMs to texts up\nto 200M tokens, retaining the language model-\ning perplexity and generation quality.\nWithout\nany parameter updates, LM-Infinite also improves\nscores than both the original model and trunca-\ntion baselines on downstream tasks, including\nPasskey Retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023)\nand Qasper (Dasigi et al., 2021), two established\nbenchmarks for long-context evaluation. We ob-\nserve a 37.2 percentage gain on Passkey Retrieval\nand 1.2 percentage gain on Qasper in zero-shot set-\nting. LM-Infinite also brings substantial efficiency\nimprovements: it achieves 2.7\u00d7 decoding speed\nup and 7.5\u00d7 GPU memory saving over baseline\nmodels.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\n2.1\nRelative Positional Encodings\nThe traditional absolute positional encodings pro-\nvide the absolute position information, usually with\nthe help of a sequence of vectors called position\nembeddings (Vaswani et al., 2017; Kenton and\nToutanova, 2019; Ke et al., 2020). They, however,\nhave trouble when the model encounters unseen\npositions in inputs longer than the training length.\nRelative positional encodings aim to address the\nlimitations of previous-generation positional en-\ncoding methods and consider the relative distances\nbetween tokens instead of the absolute positions.\nExamples include a learned attention logit bias\nin T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), Transformer-XL (Dai\net al., 2019), Skyformer (Chen et al., 2021), Sketch-\ning (Chen et al., 2022) and Sandwich (Chi et al.,\n2023), a fixed linear attention decay (Press et al.,\n2021), and rotating query and key sequences based\non distances such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021; Li et al.,\n2023), CAPE (Likhomanenko et al., 2021) and\nXPos (Sun et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2023). Despite\nsome promising empirical evidence, length gener-\nalization failures are still widely observed when\ndirectly applied to large language models (Kaiok-\nendev, 2023). In what follows, we briefly discuss\ntwo widely used relative positional encoding meth-\nods. They lay out the necessary context for our\nonward discussion and experiments.\nRotary Position Embedding (RoPE; Su et al.,\n2021)\nIt rotates the key and query vectors\nbased on positions before computing the inner\nproduct.\nSpecifically, each vector x (either\nkey or query) is split into pairs of elements\n{(x0, x1), (x2, x3), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }, with each pair inter-\npreted as a 2-dimensional vector. RoPE then rotates\nthe vector (xa, xa+1) of token i with angle \u03b8a,i =\ni\u03c9a, where \u03c9a is the rotating speed associated with\ndimension pair (a, a + 1). After rotation, the 2-\nD vector becomes\n\u0012cos i\u03c9a\n\u2212 sin i\u03c9a\nsin i\u03c9a\ncos i\u03c9a\n\u0013 \u0012 xi\nxi+1\n\u0013\n.\nThey show that the inner product between rotated\nquery qi and rotated key kj is solely determined by\nqi, kj, and their relative distance i \u2212 j. Note that\nwe always have i \u2265 j due to the causal attention\nmask.\nAliBi (Press et al., 2021)\nIt offsets all attention\nlogits between tokens i, j by a linear term \u2212m(i \u2212\nj) and become q\u22a4\ni kj \u2212 m(i \u2212 j). To this end, the\nMPT-7B codes implement an offset matrix as an\nadditive term in attention logits.\n2.2\nEfforts Towards Length Generalization\nIn light of generalization failures observed in\nLLMs, one straightforward solution is to finetune\nLLMs on longer text sequences (Chen et al., 2023;\nTworkowski et al., 2023; Tao et al., 2023; Kiyono\net al., 2021; Anil et al., 2022). These approaches\ndo not address the underlying causes of length gen-\neralization failures and require massive training re-\nsources. Other solutions propose to grant LLMs ac-\ncess to longer contexts without really reading them\nin full (Zhou et al., 2023; Bueno et al., 2022; Mo-\nhtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Aug-\nmenting LLMs with retrieval-based memories (Wu\net al., 2021; Guu et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022;\nKhandelwal et al., 2019; Kaiser et al., 2016; Yo-\ngatama et al., 2021) also make LLMs applicable to\na large database. These designs, however, usually\nneed finetuning and are not directly compatible\nwith the existing LLMs. Our work, in contrast,\nfacilitates zero-shot length generalization.\nAttention Logit Bound\nAttention Entropy\nSequence Length\nSequence Length\n(a) Attention Logit Explosion at Long Distances\n(b) Attention Entropy Explosion at Long Lengths\n(c) Starting Tokens Occupy Distinct Areas\n0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0\n2k\nStarting few tokens\n4k\n6k\n8k\n0\n-5\n-15\n-20\n5\n10\n15\n2k\n4k\n6k\n8k\nFigure 1: We identify three factors underlying the length generalization failure in LLMs in \u00a73. (a) Factor 1: Unseen\ndistances between tokens cause attention logits to explode. (b) Factor 2: An unseen number of tokens can cause\nattention entropy to increase to infinity. (c) Factor 3: Starting few tokens occupy a distinct feature region and should\nnot be discarded.\n3\nWhy do Transformer LLMs Fail to\nGeneralize to Long Contexts?\nThrough a series of theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations, this section aims to identify the po-\ntential causes underlying current LLMs\u2019 failure\nin length generalization. Our discussion assumes\nTransformer-based LLMs that use relative posi-\ntional encodings, as this design is widely adopted in\ntoday\u2019s LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023b; Team, 2023).\nWe use Llama-2, which is pre-trained with 4K-\nlength segments, for investigation. On sequences\nlonger than the training length, we will show that\nthe unseen inter-token distances, the increasing\nnumber of attended tokens, and the implicitly en-\ncoded position information of the starting tokens\ncan all make certain computational features out\nof the training distribution. As deep models can\nbe sensitive to input distribution shifts, these fac-\ntors need to be handled for LLMs to generalize to\nunseen lengths.\nFactor 1: challenges in handling unseen dis-\ntances among tokens\nWith relative positional\nencoding, the impact of positions on the attention\nweight between two tokens depends solely on their\nrelative distance. As the sequence length grows ex-\nceedingly long, some distance values will surpass\nthose seen during training. We make the following\ninformal theoretical claim:\nTheorem 1. (Informal) For an attention mecha-\nnism using relative positional encoding, the atten-\ntion logits must explode to infinities to differentiate\npreviously unseen distances apart as the sequence\nlength increases.\nThe formal theorem and its proof can be found in\nAppendix B. We also empirically verify this on\nLlama-2 on the ArXiv dataset truncated down to\n8K length. We extract the attention logits of all\nattention heads and their maximum attention log-\nits on different sequence lengths in Figure 1(a). It\nshows the average and variance among attention\nheads. We see that the attention logits increase\nto substantially larger values when the sequence\nlength exceeds the training length of 4K. To miti-\ngate this issue, we conjecture that it may help to\ncap the relative distance values to the maximum\nthat the model has seen during training (i.e., a\ndistance ceiling). However, as we will see from\nthe proposition below, addressing logit explosion\nin fact leads to another challenge.\nFactor 2: attending to unseen numbers of tokens\nOn longer sequences, tokens at later positions must\ndistribute attention weights across a larger context.\nWe then make the following claim that, if attention\nlogits are bounded but the number of tokens to\nattend to is not limited, it can cause the attention\nentropy to explode:\nProposition 1. If the attention logits are bounded,\nas the sequence becomes longer, the attention en-\ntropy grows to infinity.\nA formal statement as well as the proof can be\nfound in \u00a7C. This conclusion is further empirically\nverified by plotting the attention entropy against\ncontext lengths in Figure 1(b). The curve shows\nan ever-increasing attention entropy. We also con-\ntrast it with an estimated bound in Proposition 2.\nThis suggests that we should bound the attention\ncontext size to ensure that the attention entropy\nstays in seen ranges during pre-training and avoid\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nattended\nmasked\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ni\n(a) Proposed Solution: LM-Infinite \ni\ndistance\n(b) A Conceptual Model of Relative Positional Attention\n0\n1\n2\n3\ni\n4\n\u2026 \u2026\ni - 1\ni - 2\nessential for LLMs\nstarting \ntokens\nmiddle tokens\nrear tokens\nencode more \nabsolute \nposition\nencode more \nrelative \nposition\nless position-sensitive\ndistance \nceiling\n-shaped \nmask\n\u039b\nFigure 2: (a) LM-Infinite is a plug-and-play solution for various LLMs, consisting of a \u039b-shaped mask and a\ndistance ceiling during attention.

A simple windowed attention,\nwhere each token only attends to the nearest to-\nkens within a distance, might handle factors 1 and\n2. This is similar to the block-diagonal attention\nmask used in XPos (Sun et al., 2022) and Long-\nformer (Beltagy et al., 2020). However, as we will\nshow in the next paragraph, this introduces another\nfactor that can also fail LLMs.\nFactor 3: starting tokens occupy a distinct fea-\nture space\nPerhaps counter-intuitively:\nObservation 1. Even without explicit absolute po-\nsitional embeddings, attention outputs of the first\nfew tokens can occupy a distinct representational\nspace compared to other positions.\nTherefore,\nwhen passed to later layers, these starting tokens\nhave distinct value vectors coming from their lower-\nlayer outputs.\nThis follows from Theorem 1 in Kazemnejad et al.\n(2023), which proves that the absolute positions can\nbe implicitly encoded in the outputs of tokens of a\nsingle attention layer, even without positional en-\ncodings. In their construction, the starting tokens\u2019\nsignals are the strongest and easiest to distinguish\nfrom other tokens. As relative positional encoding\nis strictly more expressive than no positional encod-\ning setting in Kazemnejad et al. (2023) (e.g., by let-\nting all distances have the same attention function),\nthe same conclusion applies to relative positional\nencoding as well.\nAs an empirical verification, we take the hidden\nstates output by the second layer of Llama-2 and\nplot a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projec-\ntion into a 2-d plane in Figure 1(c). More figures\ncan be found in \u00a7D. The dots correspond to the\nfirst 4096 tokens in 32 sequences, with blue ones\ncorresponding to the initial tokens and red tokens\nbeing the tail ones. The plot shows that initial to-\nkens\u2019 features occupy distinct regions in the feature\nspace. This explains why simply windowing the\nattention to the nearest tokens fails: as attention\nis essentially a weighted average, discarding the\nstarting few tokens limits the attention output from\nreaching regions that they occupy. Therefore, we\nneed to keep the initial tokens during attention.\n4\nOur proposal: LM-Infinite\nInspired by the analyses and take-away messages\nin the previous section, we propose LM-Infinite to\nachieve zero-shot length generalization for LLMs.\nAn overview of LM-Infinite is illustrated in Fig-\nure 2(a). This simple solution consists of two com-\nponents: a \u039b-shaped attention mask and a distance\nceiling. Besides, re-introducing the middle top-k\ntokens is optional for enhanced downstream perfor-\nmance.\n\u039b-shaped attention mask\nIt contains two atten-\ntion spans: the starting one allows each token to\nattend to the first nstarting tokens if they come before\nthe current one; the ending one allows each token\nto attend to most recent Lpretrain tokens. Lpretrain\nis the maximum length during training. Other to-\nkens are ignored. In ablation studies in \u00a7A, we find\nthat choosing nstarting \u2208 [5, 100] generally achieves\nequally good performance. Note that nstarting = 0\nLLaMA\nLlama-2\nGPT-J-6B\nMPT-7B\nMPT-7B + LM-Infinite\nGPT-J-6B + LM-Infinite\nLlama-2 + LM-Infinite\nLLaMA + LM-Infinite\nMPT-7B-Storywriter\nNegative Log-Likelihood\nLength\nFigure 3: LM-Infinite flattens the negative log-likelihood (NLL) curves of various LLMs on ArXiv dataset without\nany parameter updates.

This resolves Fac-\ntors 2 and 3 in \u00a73 by both limiting the number of\ntokens under attention and ensuring the starting few\ntokens are attended.\nDistance ceiling\nLM-Infinite further bounds the\n\u201ceffective distance\u201d to Lpretrain. This only affects the\nstarting few tokens when attended by tokens at later\npositions. Specifically, in relative positional encod-\ning, the original attention logit is w(q, k, d), where\nd is the distance between two tokens. Now we mod-\nify it as w(q, k, d\u2032)) where d\u2032 = min(d, Lpretrain).\nFigure 2(a) shows an illustrative example where\nthe distance ceiling is Lpretrain = 2. This addresses\nFactor 1 in \u00a73 by bounding the distance value in\nattention calculation.\nOptionally attending to top-k tokens in the mid-\ndle\nLM-Infinite can optionally attend to k tokens\nin the middle with the largest attention logits. This\nis particularly useful in downstream tasks where in-\nformation in the middle tokens matters (\u00a75.2). Here\nthe k tokens are selected independently for each\nattention head in layers higher than h-th layer, and\nhave an attention distance of d = 1\n2Lpre-train. These\nhyperparameters are selected based on a held-out\nPasskey Retrieval validation set, with more details\nin Appendix A. In the evaluation of downstream\ntasks in \u00a75.2, this technique brings substantial per-\nformance improvements with little impact on the\nefficiency; while for LLM generation and inference,\nwe find it unnecessary to attend to middle tokens\nfor LM-Infinite to achieve strong performance.\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\nToken Position\n1e8\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nNegative Log Likelihood (NLL)\nLlama-2 + LM-Infinite\nLlama-2 @ 8K\nFigure 4: LM-Infinite generalizes Llama-2 to extreme\nlengths (e.g., 200M). The dashed line is the NLL level\nat 8K length of the vanilla Llama-2 model.\nLM-Infinite\u2019s \u039b-shaped mask is conceptually\nsimilar to the attention patterns derived from heuris-\ntics (Beltagy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2023; Zaheer\net al., 2020). However, we formally show in \u00a73 Fac-\ntor 3 that these previous approaches theoretically\ncannot generalize to unseen lengths but require pa-\nrameter updates. This inherent limitation motivates\nthe other two components in LM-Infinite to achieve\nzero-shot length generalization.\nImplementation details\nLM-Infinite is applica-\nble in all Transformer models with relative posi-\ntional encoding. One only needs to replace the\nattention function in each Transformer layer with\nLM-Infinite without any parameter updates. The\n\u039b-shaped attention mask is relatively straightfor-\nward to implement. In RoPE, attention logits in\nthe ending attention span follow the original cal-\nculation. In the starting attention span (excluding\nits overlap with the ending span), we keep all k\nvectors unrotated and rotate all q vectors to a fixed\ndistance Lpretrain. Then the logits in two spans can\nbe composed. Augmenting AliBi with LM-Infinite\nis also straightforward. We simply clip the offset\nmatrix with a minimum value of \u2212|mLpretrain| and\napply the \u039b-shaped attention mask.\nDiscussion.\nIn Figure 2(b), we show a conceptual\nmodel of how relative positional encoding func-\ntions. This conceptual model reflects the design\nchoices of LM-Infinite. In this conceptual model,\na long context can be roughly partitioned into 3\nparts: The starting tokens encode strong absolute\nposition information (Factor 3).

LM-Infinite consistently generalizes the generation\nquality to extreme lengths, achieving performance that is comparable to or better than the fine-tuned LLM, MPT-7B-\nStorywriter.\nArXiv dataset. Llama-2 outputs NaN probabili-\nties on sequences that are slightly longer than 10K,\nthereby its shorter curve. All vanilla models run out\nof memory at \u223c32K lengths.1 The baselines\u2019 NLL\nquickly blows up when the tested sequences are\nlonger than what they train on. With LM-Infinite,\nall models can generalize to sequences that are sub-\nstantially longer than the lengths they are trained\non, retaining the NLL performance. This validates\nour length failure factor analyses in \u00a71. The longer\nends of curves have larger variances because there\nare fewer documents of those lengths. In Figure 4\nwe further evaluate LM-Infinite + Llama-2 on a se-\nquence of 200M tokens which is constructed by by\nsampling with replacement from the ArXiv dataset\nand concatenating all data. LM-Infinite shows the\nability to remain stably low log-perplexity level\nover extreme lengths.\nTable 1 summarizes the perplexity performance\nat a few milestone lengths (2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, and\n32K) on ArXiv and OpenWebText2, which shows\n1We run on a single A100 GPU with 80GB GPU memory.\na similar trend. OpenWebText2 has very few data\ninstances over length 32K, so we omit the col-\numn. With LM-Infinite, all models can generalize\nto unseen lengths, and LM-Infinite achieves best\nperplexity in 7 out of 9 cases. Surprisingly, without\nany parameter update, LM-Infinite outperforms\nmany strong baselines that are trained on substan-\ntially longer text segments. As a direct comparison,\nMPT-7B+LM-Infinite achieves only slightly worse\nperformance than its fine-tuned counterpart, MPT-\n7B-Storywriter. This confirms that LM-Infinite is a\npromising alternative to resource-consuming fine-\ntuning.\n5.2\nDownstream Evaluation\nAs LLMs are often deployed for downstream\ntasks, we evaluate how LM-Infinite performs on\ntwo long-input tasks under the zero-shot setting:\nPasskey Retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023)\nand Qapser (Dasigi et al., 2021). Passkey Retrieval\nburies a passkey at a random position in a long dis-\ntraction text and, in the end, asks what the passkey\nis. Qasper is a question-answering dataset on sci-\nentific papers with a total of 1.5K testing question-\nanswer pairs. We evaluate on Llama-2-7b-chat,\nas its instruction tuning enables good task-solving\nability (Bai et al., 2023), with middle top-5 tokens\nenabled on higher than 5-th layer (see \u00a74 for defini-\ntion and \u00a7A for hyperparameter selection). Results\nare listed in Table 2. LM-Infinite consistently out-\nperforms the baselines on both tasks, with a 37.2\npercentage gain on Passkey Retrieval and 1.2 per-\ncentage gain on the Qasper task. This suggests that\nit can improve downstream task performance on\nlong inputs without fine-tuning while the vanilla\nmodel immediately fails.\n5.3\nAblation Study\nFigure 5 provides an ablation study with the\nLLaMA model about why both components in LM-\nInfinite are essential for maintaining LLM func-\ntionality over the length of 8K. We compare LM-\nInfinite with its variants: the vanilla model, using\nonly \u039b-shaped mask (\u039b) and using windowed at-\ntention mask (window) fail immediately with ex-\nploding log-perplexity. Using only inter-token dis-\ntance ceiling (ceiling) has slower increasing log-\nperplexity. Only the LM-Infinite has relatively\nstable log-perplexity, meaning that components in\nLM-Infinite are all essential for successful length\ngeneralization.\n5.4\nGeneration Quality\nWe further evaluate LM-Infinite\u2019s generation qual-\nity on ArXiv and OpenWebText2 test sets, with\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin,\n2004) (ROUGE-L). We let the LLMs generate 100\ntokens after each milestone length and use the fol-\nlowing 100 tokens in original texts as references.\nAs the generation is time consuming, we sample\n100 long sequences for evaluation for each dataset.\nThe results are summarized in Table 3. The trend\nis similar to that in the last section: without pa-\nrameter updates, LM-Infinite successfully allows\nLLMs to retain their generation quality while gen-\nerating sequences longer than training, comparable\nto the fine-tuned baselines such as MPT-7B-SW.\nWe also evaluate the efficiency in Appendix F: with\n32K-long sequences, LM-Infinite achieves 2.7\u00d7\ndecoding speedup and 7.5\u00d7 GPU memory saving.\nA few example generations are shown in Ap-\npendix G. We also compare LM-Infinite with a sim-\nple truncation-based baseline by repeatedly trun-\ncating excessive contexts. However, as the gen-\n20\n22.5\n25\n27.5\n30\n0\n0.45\n0.9\n1.35\n1.8\nLM-Infinite\nTruncation\nw = 256\nw = 512\nw = 1024\nw = 2048\nw = 3072\nw = 3584\nTFLOPs/token\nBLEU\nFigure 6: LM-Infinite achieves a better trade-off be-\ntween computation complexity with generation quality\nthan simple truncation.\neration length increases, frequent truncations and\nre-encoding of new contexts are required. The\nlarger the truncation window is, the more context\nis kept, but the larger the computational overhead.\nWe let the models generate 10k tokens on ArXiv. In\nFigure 6, it is clear that LM-Infinite achieves a sub-\nstantially better quality-efficiency tradeoff. With\nsimilar computation, LM-Infinite outperforms the\nbaseline by about 5 BLEU. To achieve a similar\nBLEU, LM-Infinite incurs only <25% computa-\ntional overhead than the truncation baseline.\n6\nConclusions\nThis work proposes a zero-shot length generaliza-\ntion method for various off-the-shelf LLMs without\nparameter updates. Through theoretical analysis\nand empirical investigation, this work identifies\nthree major factors contributing to this length gen-\neralization failure. Our theoretical analysis further\nreveals why truncating the attention window and\nrelative positional encodings are inadequate to ad-\ndress them. Our solution, LM-Infinite, is a simple\nand effective method for enhancing LLMs\u2019 capa-\nbilities of handling long contexts. It allows LLMs\npre-trained with 2K or 4K-long segments to gener-\nalize to up to 200M length inputs while retaining\nperplexity. It also improves performance on down-\nstream tasks such as Passkey Retrieval and Qasper\nin the zero-shot setting. It brings substantial effi-\nciency improvements: a 2.7\u00d7 decoding speed up\nand a 7.5\u00d7 memory saving over the original model.\nLM-Infinite\u2019s computational efficiency and ease of\nuse allow researchers without enormous computa-\ntional resources to use LLMs on long sequences.\nLimitations\nThis work evaluates a wide range of open-domain\nLLMs. However, without access to the source code\nof proprietary LLMs such as ChatGPT, the pro-\nposed method could not be evaluated on them. Fur-\nthermore, due to limited computational resources\nand time, the proposed method has not been evalu-\nated on texts with even larger lengths, such as 1G.\nThe model is designed on relative positional encod-\ning Transformer models, which is the mainstream\nbackbone for most modern LLMs. The question\nof how LM-Infinite can enable more efficient fine-\ntuning or pre-training can also be explored in future\nwork.\nAcknowledgement\nThis research is partially supported by U.S. DARPA\nKAIROS Program No. FA8750-19-2-1004, and\nDARPA INCAS Program No. HR001121C0165.\nThe views and conclusions contained herein are\nthose of the authors and should not be interpreted as\nnecessarily representing the official policies, either\nexpressed or implied, of DARPA, or the U.S. Gov-\nernment.

It maps the query\nq, key k, and their distance d, to an attention logit.\nThe final attention weights are usually calculated\nby a softmax operation. For example, given n to-\nkens with indices (1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n), the attention by the\nlast token on a preceding token at position i is\nAttn(tokenn, tokeni) =\new(qn,ki,n\u2212i)\nPn\nj=1 ew(qn,kj,n\u2212j) (1)\nThen the formal theorem of Theorem 1 is as\nfollows:\nTheorem 2. (Formal) Let q and k be random vec-\ntors sampled from training distributions Dq and\nDk, respectively.\nWe use the pseudo-dimension\ndimP (\u00b7) defined in (Pollard, 1990), which mea-\nsures the representation capacity of a function fam-\nily. Assume that the set of distance-based logit\nfunctions H = {w(\u00b7, \u00b7, d)|d \u2208 N} has bounded\npseudo-dimension dimP (H) = r4.\nLet us also\ndefine the distinguish-ability of two distances d\nand d\u2032 under w as their expected squared dif-\nference: \u00b5w(d, d\u2032) = Eq\u223cDq,k\u223cDk(w(q, k, d) \u2212\nw(q, k, d\u2032))2. We assume that w is not limited to\nrecognizing only a finite group of distances , oth-\nerwise, all distances longer than a threshold will\nbecome almost the same as shorter distances.

Let H be a function family mapping\nfrom space X to range [0, B], and its pseudo-\ndimension dimP (H) = r.

Then the function fam-\nily H = {w(\u00b7, \u00b7, d)|d \u2208 N} will have cover size\nNP (\u03f5, H, \u00b5) \u2264 2\n\u0000 4ea\n\u03f5 ln 4ea\n\u03f5\n\u0001r < \u03b1(n).\nHowever, this is smaller than the number of dif-\nferent distances and relative weight attentions H,\nwhich means that at least 2 functions will be close\nto each other (w(\u00b7, \u00b7, d), w(\u00b7, \u00b7, d\u2032))2 < \u03f5. This con-\nstitutes a contradiction with the distinguish-ability\ncondition.\nC\nFormal Statement and Proof of\nProposition 1\nThe formal statement of Proposition 1 is the fol-\nlowing:\nProposition 2. (Attention Entropy Explosion) Let\nw1, w2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wn \u2208 [\u2212B, B] be a sequence of atten-\ntion logits.

Note that entropy on a discrete distribution\nis defined as Entropy(P) = \u2212 P\ni pi ln pi.

We\nsee that from layer 2 to higher layers, the initial\nfew tokens occupy a distinct region with later to-\nkens. Therefore, if these tokens are discarded by\nwindow attention during attention, the attention\noutput, which is a weighted sum of vi vectors, will\nreside in a different region. This can explain why\nwindowed attention does not work and why the\nfirst few tokens need to be kept by our \u039b-shaped\nattention.\nE\nPseudo-Dimension Assumption on\nAttention Logit Functions\nIn Theorem 2, we assumed that the family of\ndistance-based logit functions H = {w(\u00b7, \u00b7, d)|d \u2208\nN} has a finite pseud-dimension. In this section,\nwe demonstrate that most current implementations\nof relative positional encodings do have a finite\npseudo-dimension. Let us discuss a few examples\nin the following:\nT5-Bias and Alibi\nIt is easy to see that, the dif-\nference between any two logit functions is uniform:\nw(\u00b7, \u00b7, d1) \u2212 w(\u00b7, \u00b7, d2) = bias(d1) \u2212 bias(d2) re-\ngardless of the input. Therefore this family can-\nnot shatter any set larger than 2, so the pseudo-\ndimension is 1.\nLayer 2\nLayer 3\nLayer 5\nLayer 10\nLayer 20\nInitial few tokens\nInitial few tokens\nInitial few tokens\nInitial few tokens\nLayer 1\nFigure 7: In Llama, at second or higher layers, the initial few tokens encode a strong position signal and occupy a\ndistinct feature region. Abandoning them might move the attention output vector out of the pre-training distribution.\nWindowed Attention\nThis operation is equiva-\nlent to limiting the family to a finite size |H| =\ndmax + 1, where dmax is the size of the window.\nTherefore dimP (H) \u2264 dmax + 1.\nNoPE\nAs there is no explicit positional encoding\nimplemented, all distances are equivalent. The\npseudo-dimension is 1.\nRoPE, CAPE and XPos\nFor RoPE, the logit\nfunction w(q, k, d) is the weighted sum of finite\nfixed sinusoidal functions {sin(\u03c9id), cos(\u03c9id)}.\nThe size of this set is equivalent to the feature di-\nmension number k. We know that dimP (H1 +\nH1) \u2264 dimP (H1) + dimP (H2). Also, the scal-\ning of a single function can only have pseudo-\ndimension of 2. Therefore, the whole family has a\nbounded pseudo-dimension dimP (H) \u2264 2k. The\nanalysis on CAPE and XPos is similar.\nF\nComputational Efficiency Evaluation\nTo evaluate the computational efficiency of LM-\nInfinite, we run Llama-2-7B model on 100 se-\nquences of 32k length in ArXiv dataset. The hard-\nware is a single A100 GPU with 80GB GPU mem-\nory. As the memory is not enough for hosting the\nwhole computation graph during decoding, we use\nDeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) with Zero3 opti-\nmization. We also have to modify the computation\ncode in order to further reduce GPU memory us-\nages and prevent out-of-memory error. With that in\nmind, the vanilla Llama-2-7B model encodes with\nan average speed of 48.19s per sequence, while LM-\nInfinite encodes with average 15.26s per sequences,\na 3.16x speedup. The vanilla Llama-2-7B model\ndecodes with 7.34s per token, while LM-Infinite\ndecodes with 2.70s per token, a 2.72x speedup. We\nalso evaluate the GPU memory usage on 32k-length\ninputs, the statistics of which profiled with PyTorch\nProfiler. The vanilla model uses 33.2Gb memory\nper sequence, while LM-Infinite uses 4.41Gb per\nsequence, a 7.53\u00d7 memory saving.\nG\nExample Generation\nTable 8: Example text generations on ArXiv and OpenWebText2 corpora after 8k context lengths.\nArXiv Dataset\nContext\nOur proof of the Kottwitz formula imitates these arguments of Langlands and Rapoport of\nderiving the Kottwitz formula from their conjecture.

Another essential ingredient is a recent work of Kisin\n[@Kisin17] on the aforementioned conjecture of Langlands and Rapoport.

Though, most\nof the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models providing strong capabilities in fol-\nlowing vision-and-language instructions. However, we claim that speech is also an important\nmodality through which humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose\nassistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In this work, we\npropose Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM). LLaSM is an end-to-end trained large\nmulti-modal speech-language model with cross-modal conversational abilities, capable of follow-\ning speech-and-language instructions. Our early experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates\na more convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence. Specifi-\ncally, we also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset LLaSM-Audio-Instructions.\nCode and demo are available at https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/LLaSM and https://\nhuggingface.co/spaces/LinkSoul/LLaSM. The LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset is available\nat https://huggingface.co/datasets/LinkSoul/LLaSM-Audio-Instructions.\n1\nIntroduction\nSpeech contains semantic information and contains paralinguistic information like intonation at the same time, it carries\nmore quantity of information than text. Additionally, speech is a more convenient and natural way for humans to\ninteract with artificial intelligence. Therefore, following speech-and-language instructions is crucial when developing a\ngeneral-purpose assistant.\nHowever, most large language models [1, 2, 3] receive text input only, which restricts the ability of large language\nmodels. Vision-and-language multi-modal models [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] offer the ability to understand the vision information,\nmaking a huge step toward general artificial intelligence (AGI), but it is still inconvenient for humans to input the tasks\nby typing a text instruction. The cascading paradigm methods [10, 11] use an automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nmodel to convert the speech input into the text input, then the model can process the task with the text input. However, it\nstill leads to information consumption during the modal transformation from speech to text and might import mistakes\nof the ASR system. Recently, speech-language multi-modal models [12, 13] focusing on processing and generating\nspeech and text with a large language model are capable of understanding and generating multi-modal content. The\nspeech signals are encoded into discrete tokens, and then discrete speech tokens are expanded into the vocabulary of the\nLLM. In this way, the LLM needs to be retrained with plenty of multi-modal data and huge computing resources.\nIn this paper, we propose LLaSM, a large speech-and-language model with cross-modal conversational abilities, capable\nof understanding and following speech-and-language instructions. Following the manner of LLaVA [6], we leverage\nthe well-trained speech modal encoder and the LLM, which makes LLaSM more resource-friendly. Specifically, we\nuse Whisper [14] as a speech encoder to encode the speech signals into embeddings. Then a modal adaptor learns to\narXiv:2308.15930v3  [cs.CL]  16 Sep 2023\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 19, 2023\nalign speech embeddings with the input text embeddings of the large language model. The speech embeddings and\nthe text embeddings are concatenated together to form interleaved sequences, then the interleaved sequences are input\nto the LLM for supervised fine-tuning. The training process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we use the\npublic ASR datasets for the modality adaptation pre-training. The speech encoder and the LLM are frozen, only the\nmodal adaptor is trained to align the speech and text embeddings. As most of the model parameters remain frozen,\nonly a small part of the parameters from the modal adaptor is trained during this stage, it is not resource-consuming. In\nthe second stage, we use cross-modal instruction data for training to provide the model with the capacity to process\ncross-modal conversations and handle multi-modal instructions. The speech encoder is frozen while the parameters\nof the modal adaptor and the language model are updated for cross-modal instruction fine-tuning. Worth noting that\nexisting open-source speech-text cross-modal instruction-following datasets are scarce, so we build and release a speech-\ntext cross-modal instruction-following dataset LLaSM-Audio-Instructions. The dataset is constructed by carefully\nselecting dialogues from GPT4-LLM [15], ShareGPT [16], WizardLM [17], and using text-to-speech technology to\ngenerate a large amount of dialogue audio data. In total, it contains 199k conversations, in which there are 80k Chinese\naudio samples and 428k English audio samples, which is the largest Chinese and English speech-text cross-modal\ninstruction-following dataset to our knowledge.\nOur paper makes the following contributions:\n\u2022 We build a speech-language multi-modal model that can understand and follow speech-language instructions,\nwhich provides a more convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence.\n\u2022 We construct and release LLaSM-Audio-Instrustions, a large-scale Chinese and English speech-text cross-\nmodal instruction-following dataset.\nWe release the data in https://huggingface.co/datasets/\nLinkSoul/LLaSM-Audio-Instructions.\n\u2022 We release the code in https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/LLaSM and the demo is shown in https:\n//huggingface.co/spaces/LinkSoul/LLaSM.\n2\nRelated Work\nVision Large Language Model has gained significant traction [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] recently. Most of them leverage the\npre-trained LLMs and vision encoders to perform vision tasks. Flamingo [18] aligns a pre-trained vision encoder\nand language model using gated cross-attention and is trained on billions of image-text pairs. BLIP-2 [19] employs a\nFlan-T5 [20] with a Q-Former to efficiently align visual features with the language model. Palm-E [5], featuring 562\nbillion parameters, integrates the 540B PaLM [2] and 22B Vision Transformer [21] into the largest vision-language\nmodel. LLaVA [6] leverages pre-trained CLIP [22] visual encoder and LLaMA [3] and conducts instruct tuning on\nGPT4-assisted visual instruction data. GPT-4 [4] also shows powerful visual understanding and reasoning abilities. The\nsuccess of the multi-modal large language model in the visual domains has brought a lot of inspiration to the research in\nthe speech domains as well.\nSpeech Large Language Model has gained more and more interest, for the success of the vision multi-modal LLMs.\nThe cascading paradigm methods [10, 11] use an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to convert the speech\ninput into the text input, which still leads to information consumption and might import mistakes of the ASR system.\nRecently, speech-language multi-modal models [12, 13] focusing on processing and generating speech and text with a\nlarge language model are capable of understanding and generating multi-modal content. The speech signals are encoded\ninto discrete tokens, and then discrete speech tokens are expanded into the vocabulary of the LLM. In this way, the\nLLM needs to be retrained with plenty of multi-modal data and huge computing resources.\n3\nApproach\n3.1\nModel\nThe focus of training multi-modal models is to fuse cross-modal complementary information of multi-modalities and\neffectively exploit the capabilities of well-trained large language models. The LLaSM model architecture is shown in\nFigure 1. We use Whisper [14] to encode the raw audio data into embeddings first, then a modal adaptor is trained\nduring the pre-training stage to align the audio embeddings and the text embeddings. The audio embeddings and the\ntext embeddings are concatenated together to form interleaved input sequences to input to the large language model. We\nchoose Chinese-LLAMA2-7B [23] as our LLM, for its capabilities in both Chinese and English. During the cross-modal\ninstruction fine-tuning stage, the modal adaptor and the LLM are trained with multi-tasks.\n2\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 19, 2023\nFigure 1: Model framework of the LLaSM\nThe pre-training stage. During this stage, the modal encoder and the LLM remain frozen. To enable the LLM\nto understand the audio embeddings from the modal encoder, the modal adaptor is trained with public ASR data\nto align the text and the audio embeddings. The data sample (audio data, text label) of ASR data is formatted as a\ntuple of (simple instruction, audio data, text label), in which the simple instruction is an automatic speech recognition\ninstruction. According to the different languages of the audio data, an English simple instruction listed in Figure 2\nor a Chinese simple instruction listed in Figure 3 will be chosen. The unified format of the pre-training multi-modal\nsequence Xsample is shown in Figure 4. Each data sample is formatted as Xsample, then we will replace the audio\npatch embeddings from the text sequence with the audio embeddings of the modal adaptor. The final interleaved input\nembeddings will be input to the large language model. The training target is to predict the text label of each data sample.\nFigure 2: English simple instructions.\nFigure 3: Chinese simple instructions.\nThe cross-modal instruction fine-tuning. During this stage, only the modal encoder is frozen, the modal adaptor and\nthe LLM are joint-trained with multi-tasks. We build complex cross-modal instructions using several conversational\ndata. The questions from humans are generated to audio data by using Microsoft Azure text-to-speech API, then\nthe training target is to predict the responses from the chatbot. A round of question and answer will be processed\ninto a multi-modal sequence Xsample, and multiple rounds of question and answer will be concatenated with the\nEOS token. The unified format of the cross-modal instruction fine-tuning sequence is shown in Figure 5. As the\neffectiveness of text-only conversational data with multi-task instructions has been demonstrated in several open-source\nlanguage-only instruction-tuning works [15, 16, 17], the cross-modal instructions are able to improve the capacity of\nfollowing multi-modal instructions.\n3.2\nData Collection\nTo enable the LLM to understand the audio signals, we collect several public ASR data sets to form the Modality\nAdaptation Pre-training Data with simple instructions of automatic speech recognition. And, for cross-modal instruction\ntuning, we use several open-source language-only instruction-tuning data sets to build the Cross-modal Instruction\nFine-Tuning Data by generating the speech data. The details are as follows.\nModality Adaptation Pre-training Data. To align the embeddings of text and audio, we collect several public ASR\ndata sets in both English and Chinese, including Aishell [24], LibriSpeech [25], Magicdata [26] and Primewords [27].\nThe data sample of ASR data usually consists of a pair of speech audio and text utterances, especially, when we add a\nsimple instruction to the data sample as the task instruction. These simple instructions are listed in Figure 2 and Figure\n3, which are different representations of the automatic speech recognition task in both English and Chinese. While\npre-training, the simple instruction and the audio data are input to the model to predict the text label of the audio data.\n3\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 19, 2023\nFigure 4: The sample sequence format for the pre-training.

While training the BOS token\nwill be added at the beginning of the sequence, and the EOS token will be added at the end of the sequence, only the\ngreen tokens are used to compute the loss.\nCross-modal Instruction Fine-Tuning Data. As the effectiveness of the open-source language-only instruction-tuning\ndata sets has been demonstrated in previous works[15, 16, 17], a natural idea is to generate audio data of these\nlanguage-only data sets to build a cross-modal instruction-tuning data. In the process of building this dataset, we\nfirst carefully filtered all the conversation data, by removing the conversations that are not suitable for vocalization,\nincluding codes, a large number of symbols, URLs, and other non-readable text. To ensure the data quality, in\nthe second stage, all the answers from chat-bots in the conversations are filtered again. Those that do not contain\nvaluable information are dropped. In the third stage, we use Microsoft Azure text-to-speech API [28] to generate\nspeech data from humans in these data sets. The speech data of humans are used as the complex instructions and\nthe responses from the chatbot are predicted during the instruction fine-tuning.

Figure 7 further demonstrates the effectiveness of LLaSM in a bilingual setting. Unlike conventional\nmodels that rely on speech-to-text conversion as a preprocessing step, LLaSM can directly process speech inputs,\nwhich improves its execution efficiency. Furthermore, LLaSM can support multiple languages and scenarios, which\nexpands its application range. Therefore, LLaSM is a promising model for convenient and interactive human-artificial\nintelligence communication.\n5\nConclusion\nThis work presents LLaSM, a large language model with cross-modal conversational abilities, capable of understanding\nand following speech-and-language instructions. Experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates a more convenient and\nnatural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence. Specifically, to alleviate the scarcity of cross-modal speech-\nand-language instructions data, we build a large Speech Instruction Following data set LLaSM-Audio-Instructions. It is\nthe largest Chinese and English speech-text cross-modal instruction-following data set to our knowledge. Finally, by\nadopting a visual modal encoder that can easily provide LLaSM with visual capabilities, we will explore combining\nboth vision and audio modalities in future work.\nReferences\n[1] Tom B.

Yet, the main focus of research and development ef-\nforts so far has been on English. While recent LLMs such as Falcon [AAA+23], PALM [CND+22] and LLaMA\n[TLI+23, TMS+23], among others, are able to process data in multiple languages, they were nevertheless pri-\nmarily trained and instruction-tuned for English. As a result, they are not able to extend their understanding\nand generation capabilities to languages other than English. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap. We focus\non Arabic, one of the world\u2019s most spoken languages with over 400M speakers, which has been noticeably un-\nderrepresented in the LLM space so far. In particular, we develop Jais, a powerful Arabic-centric decoder-only\nLLM with 13B parameters, based on the GPT-3 generative pretraining architecture [BMR+20].\nThe primary challenge in developing an Arabic LLM is the limited availability of high-quality Arabic data.\nAs compared to English, where corpora of size up to two trillion tokens are readily available [TMS+23], Arabic\ncorpora are significantly smaller in size. As part of this work, we have collected the largest Arabic corpora\nto date, consisting of 72 billion tokens. However, this dataset is still not sufficiently large for the purposes of\ntraining an Arabic LLM capable of demonstrating emergent capabilities [Ope23].\nTo address this, we train bilingual models, by augmenting the limited Arabic pretraining data with abundant\nEnglish pretraining data. We pretrain Jais on 395 billion tokens, including 72 billion Arabic tokens (which\nwe repeat 1.6 times, to obtain an effective total of 116 billion Arabic tokens), 232 billion English tokens, and\nthe remainder being code in various programming languages. As part of our effort, we have designed and\ndeveloped a specialized Arabic text processing pipeline that includes thorough data filtering and cleaning to\nproduce high-quality Arabic data.\nUnlike previous massively multilingual LLMs such as BLOOM [SFA+23] or mT0 [MWS+23], which con-\ntain more than 50 languages, we do not include languages aside from Arabic and English in any significant\npercentage. Neither do we relegate Arabic to a minority in the pretraining dataset. Instead, Arabic data con-\nstitutes 33% of our pretraining. Our choice of mixing two languages attains the best of both worlds; the LLM\nis highly fluent in Arabic, with linguistic capability as well as cultural awareness and sensitivity. At the same\ntime, it is on par with recent English LLMs in terms of reasoning capacity and world knowledge, capabilities\nwe observe to have transferred from English to Arabic and vice-versa.\nBuilding upon the standard transformer architecture [VUWS22] in the form of its GPT-3 variant, we adopt\na number of improvements from the literature including (i) ALiBi [PSL22] positional encodings, which enable\nthe model to extrapolate to longer contexts at inference, (ii) SwiGLU activation function [Sha20] to improve\nthe performance, (iii) maximal update parametrization to perform hyperparameter optimization based on exper-\niments with smaller models [YHB+21], and (iv) a custom-built tokenizer that weighs both languages equally.\nWe further develop an instruction-tuned version of our model, Jais-chat, which uses over 3.6 million Arabic\nand 6 million English instruction-response pairs. Considering the inherent safety concerns of LLMs, we further\nfine-tune it with safety-oriented instructions. In our deployed system which provides an interactive interface to\nthe instruction-tuned model 1, we add extra guardrails in the form of safety prompts, keyword-based filtering,\nand external classifiers. An example conversation with Jais-chat on this interface is shown in Figure 1.\nWe evaluate Jais and Jais-chat across a wide array of Arabic and English NLP benchmarks, addressing\nreasoning, knowledge, misinformation, and bias. The results show that Jais is superior in Arabic compared to\nother models of similar size, while also being competitive in English, despite being trained on significantly less\nEnglish data.\nWe are releasing the following models:\n\u2022 Jais2: base pretrained 13B foundation model;\n\u2022 Jais-chat3: instruction-tuned 13B version of Jais, optimized for dialog interaction.\nBy making our models publicly available, we hope to enable further research and development in this area,\nstimulating innovation and practical applications that can better serve the Arabic and the global communities.\nDespite our significant efforts to ensure safety, we recognize that the models are not foolproof and may not\ncover all cases. Therefore, we strongly urge all adopters to exercise caution and to conduct additional safety\ntesting before deploying our models. For this purpose, we outline responsible release notes in Section 9.\n1https://arabic-gpt.ai\n2https://huggingface.co/inception-mbzuai/jais-13b\n3https://huggingface.co/inception-mbzuai/jais-13b-chat\n3\nFigure 1: English\u2013Arabic multiturn dialogue using Jais-chat.\n2\nPretraining Data\nWe pretrain the LLM on hundreds of billions of words of diverse text from a variety of sources in order to\ndevelop a strong foundation in the target language(s) while at the same time establishing a broad factual knowl-\nedge base in the model. In settings such as clinical domains, research has shown that larger-scale LLMs exhibit\nimproved emergent capabilities [SAT+22]. Note that LLMs such as LLaMA [TLI+23] and Falcon [AAA+23]\nare predominantly trained on a single language: English. While these models exhibit impressive linguistic\nand reasoning capabilities, their abilities do not extend so well to other languages such as Arabic, as we will\ndemonstrate experimentally below.\n4\nLanguage\nDataset\nToken count\nArabic\nAbu El-Khair [AEK16]\n260,407,899\nArabic\nAranews [GEQ12]\n203,982,492\nArabic\nC4 [RSR+20]\n25,010,967,834\nArabic\nArabicNews 2020\n1,870,309,674\nArabic\nMaktabah8\n1,785,221,183\nArabic\nUN [ZJDP16]\n492,787,444\nArabic\nArabic Wikipedia7\n173,873,517\nArabic\nEn2Ar Wikipedia\n3,036,944,104\nArabic\nBaai1 (ArabicWeb22-A)5\n8,242,639,393\nArabic\nBaai2 (ArabicWeb16) [SKF+16]\n5,920,544,065\nArabic\nBaai3 (OSCAR)6\n3,331,705,832\nArabic\nBaai4 (ArabicWeb22-B)5\n2,426,671,361\nArabic\nBaai5 (CC100) [CKG+20]\n2,180,480,535\nArabic\nBaai7 (Arabic Tweets)5\n210,506,141\nArabic\nMisc10\n31,757,468\nTotal\n55,178,798,942\nTable 1: Composition and breakdown of our Arabic pretraining dataset (without translation).\nMoreover, the extent of knowledge of Arabic world embedded in these models is limited, as they only\ninclude relatively small amounts of native Arabic text. To tackle this challenge, we pretrain our model with the\nlargest Arabic dataset in the world, while further extending it with English data and some programming code,\nto improve the logical reasoning abilities of the model.\nOur pretraining data mix is 1:2:0.4 for Arabic:English:code. We arrived at this ratio through extensive\nexperiments on smaller models, which we describe in Section 3. We base this mix on all of the available Arabic\ndata, as this is the smallest of the three data sources.\nWe collect our Arabic training data from multiple sources including web pages, Wikipedia articles, news\narticles, Arabic books, and social network content. To augment the dataset, we also translate English content to\nArabic using an in-house machine translation system.4 We restrict this to high-quality English resources such as\nthe English Wikipedia and English books. We apply checks to avoid translating English sources with embedded\ncode, or text that is not well structured.\nA breakdown of the Arabic dataset (except the translated content) is detailed in Table 1. Specifically, we\nuse text from the following sources:\n\u2022 Abu El-Khair: a collection of more than five million news articles, collected from ten major news sources\nof Arabic countries over a period of fourteen years [AEK16].\n\u2022 Aranews: Arabic news corpus from multiple sources ranging from year 2005-2022 [GEQ12]\n\u2022 ArabicText 2022: an open-source Arabic collection5 prepared by the Beijing Academy of Artificial\nIntelligence (BAAI), that includes Arabic text corpora such as ArabicWeb22-A, ArabicWeb16 [SKF+16],\nOSCAR6, ArabicWeb22-B, CC100-AR [CKG+20], and Arabic Tweets.\n\u2022 Arabic subset of C4: a cleaned version of the Common Crawl using the cleaning and the filtering de-\nscribed in [RSR+20]. We use the Arabic subset of this corpus.\n\u2022 Arabic Wikipedia: Wikipedia written in Arabic7\n\u2022 ArabicNews 2020: an in-house news crawl at Inception of various Arabic news channels.\n4Our in-house translation system is a standard transformer sequence-to-sequence model implemented in the FairSeq library [OEB+19]\nand trained on public datasets available in OPUS [Tie12]. The English to Arabic translation performance is 31 and 40 BLEU points\n[PRWZ02] on Flores-101 and a held-out test dataset, respectively.\n5https://data.baai.ac.cn/details/ArabicText-2022\n6https://oscar-project.org/\n7https://dumps.wikimedia.org/\n5\n\u2022 Maktabah: a corpus of approximately 6,500 Arabic books.8\n\u2022 UN Meeting transcripts: the United Nations Parallel Corpus,9 v1.0 [ZJDP16] which is available in the\nsix official languages of the United Nations, of which we use the Arabic documents.\n\u2022 Other Sources: a combined dataset of multiple smaller corpora including poetry, news, entertainment,\nsports, and management documents.10\nWe further augment the Arabic data by translating 3B tokens from English Wikipedia and 15B tokens from\nthe Books3 corpus. As a result, we increase the Arabic data from 55B to 72B tokens. Subsequently, we\nupsample this Arabic data 1.6 times, obtaining 116B Arabic tokens.\nFor English, we use The Pile [GBB+20], a collection of 22 high-quality datasets, from which we randomly\nsample 232B English tokens and 46B tokens from its GitHub subset. Table 2 shows details about the English\ndata we use. Specifically, we use text from the following sources, part of The Pile:\n\u2022 Pile-CC: A subset of The Pile dataset, derived from the Common Crawl, a collection of website crawls\nfrom 2008 onwards.

(The\nnumbers 72B and 395B are correct, and the summation discrepancies are due to rounding.)\nAn outline of our preprocessing pipeline for Arabic is provided in Figure 2. As explained above, the raw\ndata is primarily sourced from publicly available databases, such as Abu El Khair or BAAI, as well as through\nin-house web scraping and machine translation of high-quality English sources.\nGiven that some of these sources have already been preprocessed or tokenized for NLP applications, it is\nessential to standardize our input. We thus subject all sources to an initial detokenization step (which leaves\nnon-tokenized input unchanged) to achieve consistency. A document, at this step, is one article/web page,\ndepending on the source.\nWe then apply a large number of filtering rules in order to eliminate documents that are noisy or low-quality.\nThis includes removing extremely short or very long documents, or those that do not include a sufficiently high\nproportion of Arabic characters or sentences, which could be indicators of a document in a different language\nwhere Arabic characters appear only incidentally. We also remove documents that contain words more than 100\ncharacters long, which can indicate the presence of extremely long URLs and/or an otherwise noisy document.\nOnce a document has passed the filtering step, it is subject to cleaning and normalization. We remove non-\nprintable Unicode characters and rare diacritic marks, and normalize the text using the Camel toolset for Arabic\n[OZK+20]. We remove embedded JavaScript and HTML (which are common sources of noise in web-scraped\ndatasets), and highly-frequent words and phrases (which are typically boilerplate text, such as a news channel\nname). We normalize Arabic punctuation marks, and use a lightweight n-gram LM to further identify and\nremove noisy n-grams.\nFinally, we apply a fuzzy deduplication step using standard locality-sensitive hashing techniques. After this\ndeduplication step, the size of the English dataset was about 20% of the original.\nRaw \nData\nDetokenisation\nAll words chars\nCitations removal\nDeduplication\nCleaned\ndata\nRetrieving original text from\ntokenized dataset\nCleansing using standard\nand language speci\ufb01c rules\nRemoving highly similar or\nduplicate text in corpus\nPublicly available\ndataset \n(Open-Source)\nWeb Scraping\nTranslation\nMain sources of data\nNLP/ Engg. / HPC\nNLP/ Engg. / HPC\nNLP/ Engg.\nNLP\nNLP\nNLP / Engg.\nPunctuations\nand Numbers\nNumber of words\nArabic sentences\nArabic chars\nConsecutive duplicate\nsentence removal\nFrequently occurring\nword removal\nDiacritics removal\nJavascript and HTML\nremoval\nArabic text\nNormalization\nReplace ? with \u061f\nNoisy n-gram removal\nIncomprehensible\nunicode \ufb01xation\nSpecial Symbol\nFiltering\nCleaning\nNLP\nRemoving data with noise\n> 20\n< 10%\n< 100\n> 50%\n> 70%\n< 20%\nFigure 2: Our Arabic preprocessing pipeline.\n8\nVocabulary\nVocab Size\nEnglish\nArabic\nCode\nGPT-2\n50,257\n1.095\n4.171\n1.294\nBERT Arabic\n32,000\n1.632\n1.125\n1.313\nBLOOM\n250,000\n1.083\n1.195\n1.000\nJais\n84,992\n1.010\n1.050\n1.006\nTable 4: Fertility scores of Jais tokenizer measured against tokenizers of other systems on English, Arabic, and\ncode validation datasets.\nThings were more challenging for Arabic.\nUnlike English, where several large-scale and open-access\ndatasets already exist, and established preprocessing pipelines are available, for Arabic, this pipeline had to\nbe custom-built. Experimentation with smaller LLMs informed many of the choices of heuristics we used in\nour final preprocessing pipeline. Given the limited amount of available Arabic data, we took care not to filter\nArabic content as aggressively as for English.\n2.2\nMixing Arabic and English Data\nA commonly reported phenomenon in LLM research is that larger LLMs generally perform better than smaller\nones; this trend is clearly visible on public LLM leaderboards20 and is also evident in the recent LLaMA2\nrelease [TMS+23].21 In general, the quality of a model is limited by two main factors: (i) data availability, and\n(ii) computational cost. While the latter can be overcome with improved hardware, the former is a fundamental\nobstacle. The Chinchilla scaling law [HBM+22] tells us that the optimal balance between model size and data\nis approximately twenty tokens per parameter. This is why for English, the largest open-source LLMs until\nrecently had about 30B parameters, as publicly available datasets such as Red Pajama22 have 1.2T tokens of\ntext. The recently-released LLaMA2 has 70B parameters, and it is trained on 2T tokens.\nAs mentioned above, for Arabic, we have 72 billion tokens (after adding 18 billion tokens of translated\ntext). If we apply the Chinchilla scaling law, we would optimally be able to train a model of 6-7B parameters on\nthis data. We could probably train a slightly larger model, as Arabic involves cltificization of conjunctions and\npronouns (e.g., and his house is one word in Arabic, but three words in English), and thus the scaling law might\ndiffer a bit. Indeed, some of our experiments suggest that one might need as few as 14 tokens per parameter\nfor Arabic; yet, this does not fundamentally change the fact that we do not have enough data to train a 13B\nparameter Arabic model, let alone a 30B one. One possible solution is to obtain more data, e.g., by adding more\nArabic social media posts, but these are generally noisy. Another option is to train on mixed Arabic and English\ntraining data, and thus compensate for the missing Arabic tokens with English ones. This latter idea worked well\nin our experiments: we found that mixing Arabic and English in a proportion of 1:2 (i.e., 2\u00d7 more English than\nArabic) works better than training on Arabic only. In the future, we plan to try incorporating a higher proportion\nof English, but we also need to be careful: for example, the BLOOMz experiments [MWS+23] indicate that\nadding ten times as much English data results in degradation of the model performance.\n3\nModel\n3.1\nModel Architecture\nJais is based on a standard transformer-based architecture [VSP+17]. In particular, we use a causal decoder-\nonly model, similar to the one used by GPT-2 [RWC+19] and LLaMA [TLI+23]. Decoder-only models have\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in generative language tasks. Building upon this base transformer archi-\ntecture, we use a number of recent improvements from the literature, as well as from our own experiments.\nJais Tokenizer:\nThe choice of tokenizer can have a significant impact on the performance of an NLP model\n[LBM23]. How words are split is influenced by the composition of the corpora used to train the tokenizer\n[PLMTB23]. A common tokenizer used in LLMs is the GPT-2 tokenizer [RWC+19], which is also used by\nOPT [ZRG+22] and GPT-3 [BMR+20].\n20https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\n21https://ai.meta.com/llama/\n22https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data\n9\nHowever, because the GPT-2 tokenizer is primarily trained on English corpora, common Arabic words such\nas @\tXA\u00d6\u00cf (English \u2018why\u2019) are over-segmented into individual characters [PLMTB23]. This over-segmentation\nlowers the performance of the model and increases the computational costs compared to using a custom tok-\nenizer that is specifically designed for the target languages [CL19]. Moreover, in order to increase the scope of\nmulti-linguality, we want the tokenizer to break words into meaningful subwords. This is likely to encourage\ncross-lingual transfer by better token-level alignment between languages.\nIn order to achieve this, we trained our own subword tokenizer (Jais tokenizer) on a combined corpus\nof English and Arabic languages using byte-pair encoding (BPE) [SHB16]. To alleviate bias towards one\nlanguage, we prepared a training corpus of 10B words containing equal proportions of English and Arabic text.\nTable 4 shows the fertility scores [BCP+90] of Jais tokenizer against the tokenizers of BERT Arabic23 [SAY20],\nBLOOM [SFA+23], and GPT-2 [RWC+19] on English, Arabic, and code validation datasets. We can observe\nthat the fertility score for the Jais tokenizer is close to 1, even though the vocabulary of Jais has only 84,992\nentries, compared to BLOOM, which has 250,000 entries. The result shows the optimality of our custom-made\ntokenizer over our test corpus as compared to other tokenizers.\nALiBi Positional Encodings:\nPositional embeddings provide information about word order to transformer-\nbased LLMs. A common strategy to manage training complexity is to train the model with a limited context\nlength. Subsequently, during inference, the model is applied to an extended context length using extrapola-\ntion [SLP+22]. Recent research has indicated that conventional methods of integrating word order into the\ntransformer model, such as learnable positional embeddings, as used in models such as GPT-2 [RWC+19], and\nsinusoidal encoding, as proposed in [VSP+17], do not perform well when applied to longer contexts [PSL22].\nThus, we use Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) positional encodings [PSL22], which support efficient ex-\ntrapolation to long contexts. Rather than modifying the input embeddings, ALiBi penalizes the attention scores\nby a linearly decreasing amount, proportional to the distance between the relevant key and the query.\nSwiGLU Activation Function:\nActivation functions play a pivotal role in the training of neural network\nmodels. We use SwiGLU [Sha20] in each transformer block. It combines the advantages of Swish [RZL17]\nand GLU [Sha20] activations, and has been shown to improve over both of them. Because of SwiGLU\u2019s extra\ncomputational overhead, adjustments were made in the hidden dimensionality of the feed forward network to\ncompensate. Rather than apply a filter dff = 4 \u2217 dmodel, we apply a filter that is 8\n3 \u2217 dmodel. This ensures that\nthe feed forward network has a FLOP cost that is comparable to that of GeLU activation.\nMaximal Update Parametrization:\nHyperparameter search in LLMs is expensive due to the size of the\nmodel and the scale of the dataset used in training. Thus, it is not feasible to do an extensive hyperparameter\nsearch on the final model. Fortunately, recent studies have shown that optimal hyperparameter values become\nstable across neural network sizes when the models have been parametrized using maximal update parametriza-\ntion (\u00b5P) [YHB+21]. For Jais hyperparameter search, we tuned the optimal values for batch size and learning\nrate on a 40M-parameter model, and transferred the best values to our 13B-parameter model.\n3.2\nModel and Training Hyperparameters\nTable 5 shows the number of layers, heads, and dimensionality for Jais, along with the optimization hyperpa-\nrameter values and peak learning rates.\nWhile training, we sampled a source from the source list described in Section 2 and generated instances with\na complete length of 2048 tokens. When a document was smaller than 2048 tokens, we concatenated several\ndocuments into one sequence. <|endoftext|> is used to demarcate the end of each document, giving the\nlanguage model the information necessary to infer that tokens separated by <|endoftext|> are unrelated.\nModel\nLayers\nHeads\nDimension\nLearning Rate\nBatch Size\nJais-13b\n40\n40\n5, 120\n1.2e\u22122\n3, 392\nTable 5: Training hyperparameter values: the number of layers, heads, and dimensionality for Jais, along\nwith the optimization hyperparameter values and peak learning rates.\n10\n590M\n1.3B\n2.7B\n6.7B\n13B\n30B\nModel Scale (Parameters)\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\nCross entropy (Loss)\nOnly Ara\n1 Ara, 1 Eng\n1 Ara, 2 Eng\nFigure 3: Cross-entropy loss on different model sizes with different configurations.\nWe train Jais-13b using the AdamW optimizer [LH18] with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.95, \u03f5 = 1e \u2212 9, and weight\ndecay of 0.1. We scale the gradient norms using a maximum norm clipping value of 1.0. The learning rate\nschedule starts with a linear warm-up from 0 to the maximum learning rate at 95 steps, followed by a 10\u00d7\nlinear decay until 100,551 steps. After packing, we used a global batch size of 3,392 sequences of 2,048 tokens\neach. For \u00b5Transfer, we base Jais-13b on a roughly 40M-parameter model. The model depth is 24 and the\nhidden dimension size is 256.\nThe base learning rate is set to a maximum value of 1.2e-2, and the learning rate for each layer is set\naccording to this base value depending on the layer shape [YHB+21]. Analogously, we initialize the layers\nwith a base standard deviation of 7.3e-2, which we adjust based on the layer shape. Additionally, we scale\nthe embedding\u2019s output activations by a factor of 14.6, and scale the model\u2019s output logits by a factor of 2.22\ndivided by the hidden size multiplier, e.g., 5,120 / 256 = 20.\n3.3\nLearnings and Observations\nWe conducted a series of preliminary experiments training on Arabic-only data, as well as on mixtures of Arabic\nand English. The aim was to find the optimal mix, and to identify the best model size for our Arabic-centric\nLLM. We maintained a constant size for the Arabic corpus as discussed in Section 2. We further sampled the\nEnglish dataset to reflect different ratios relative to the Arabic data size. In all cases, we trained the LLM for one\nepoch. Previous work [BMR+20, KMH+20] has shown that cross-entropy loss correlates with LLM quality in\ndownstream tasks. Therefore, we report the cross-entropy loss on the Arabic validation set.\nDue to the size of the search space and required computing resources, we did not train models of all sizes and\nfor all data ratios. Instead, we experimented on models of 590M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13B, and 30B parameters\nunder a few data ratios. The trends are shown in Figure 3. We can see that for small models, e.g., 590M and 1.3B\nparameters, adding English impacts the cross entropy loss in Arabic adversely. However, this trend reverses for\nlarger models, e.g., for 6.7B and 13B parameters, where adding English improves Arabic performance. In\nparticular, we observe that the 13B model trained on a 1:2 Arabic\u2013English mix (Jais-13b) outperforms the 30B-\nparameter Arabic-only model by a sizable margin. This suggests that increasing the model capacity improves\nthe cross-lingual transfer between English and Arabic. In future work, we plan to study the extent to which\nadditional English data can be incorporated without adversely affecting the performance of Arabic.\n23https://huggingface.co/asafaya/bert-base-arabic\n11\n3.4\nTraining Infrastructure\nAll training, hyper-parameter tuning, and instruction-tuning experiments were executed on the Condor Galaxy\n1 (CG-1) 24 AI supercomputer from Cerebras, built in partnership with G42. The final training and fine-tuning\nruns for Jais were performed on 16 CS-2 systems within CG-1. CG-1 is a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster com-\nposed of Cerebras CS-2 systems, MemoryX, SwarmX, management, and input worker nodes. The foundation\nof the CG-1 cluster is the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) within the CS-2 system, the largest and most\npowerful AI processor currently available. CS-2 systems are purpose-built network-attached AI accelerators.\nMemoryX is a large-capacity off-wafer memory service, used to store all model weights, gradients, and opti-\nmizer states. SwarmX is a broadcast/reduce fabric that connects the memory service MemoryX to each of the\nCS-2 systems in a wafer-scale cluster. Swarm-X coordinates the broadcast of the model layer weights, giving\neach CS-2 a local copy, and it receives and aggregates (by addition) the independent weight gradients coming\nfrom the CS-2 systems during backpropagation. At the end of each iteration, the aggregated gradients are sent\nto MemoryX for weight update.\nThe CG-1 hardware and software stack enables training extremely large models using data parallelism by\nrelying on a special execution mode available with Cerebras Wafer Scale Clusters, called weight streaming.\nWeight streaming fully bypasses the complexity of 3D parallelism on traditional GPU clusters, and provides\nsimpler and higher performance scaling.\n4\nInstruction-Tuning\nLLMs can produce coherent text and execute an extensive array of NLP tasks, requiring only a few task exam-\nples as input. Nonetheless, the model cannot interpret user instructions or engage in dialogue-style interactions\nwithout instruction-tuning [OWJ+22]. To tailor our LLMs for dialogue-style applications, we instruction-tuned\nthem on a dataset prepared for instruction-based adaptation in English and Arabic. We refer to our instruction-\ntuned model as Jais-chat.\n4.1\nInstruction-Tuning Data\nAs we have a bilingual model, we use a combination of Arabic and English instruction-tuning datasets. We\ninclude a wide range of datasets covering various domains in single-turn and multi-turn chat formats. We have\n10M prompt\u2013response pairs in total, made up of 4M in Arabic and 6M in English; see Tables 6 and 7 for detailed\nstastistics about the datasets we use. Below, we provide a brief description of each dataset.\n4.1.1\nEnglish Instruction-tuning Datasets\nSuper-NaturalInstructions [WMA+22] encompasses 76 types of tasks, such as classification, extraction, in-\nfilling, and sequence tagging. These instructions span a comprehensive range of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks,\nall presented in expert-written instruction\u2013response pair format. P3 [SWR+21] and xP3 (Code & English)\n[MWS+23] are collections of prompted datasets that cover a diverse set of NLP tasks in instruction\u2013response\nformat. The P3 dataset contains over 2,000 prompt types from 270 different public datasets in English. xP3\n(Code & English) is designed for multi-lingual and cross-lingual instruction-tuning and contains more than 9M\nexamples in 46 languages, including programming languages. To make our model diverse, we included at most\nfive thousand examples from each task of the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset; from P3 and xP3 (Code & En-\nglish), we only include English and programming code examples. The Natural Questions dataset25 comprises\nquestion\u2013answer pairs extracted from Google Search; it only includes questions with concise answers, which\ncan be addressed using the information found in English Wikipedia [KPR+19].\nBaize-Chatbot26 is a multi-turn dialogue-style instruction-tuning dataset.

We refer to this dataset as NativeQA and\nincorporate it into the fine-tuning process. We also prepared an instruction dataset to teach the model about\nsafety issues, named it SafetyQA. As a responsible language model, we want the model to avoid engaging in\nunsafe conversations e.g. discussions on self-harm, sexual violence, or identity attacks. For this, we prepared\nprompt-response from DoNotAnswer [WLH+23] and OLID [ZMN+19]. In all these prompts, the response is\na polite rejection of the question. The impact is explored in Section 6.\n4.1.2\nArabic Instruction-Tuning Datasets\nDue to the limited availability of instruction-tuning datasets for Arabic, we translated some of the above En-\nglish instruction-tuning datasets to Arabic using the same machine translation system that we used for the\ntraining data: Supernatural Instruction, Unnatural, NaturalQuestions, Alpaca [TGZ+23], HC3, Dolly-15k,\nBaize, Basic-Conv, Bactrian [LKW+23]. We then performed a manual assessment for each task within the\nSuper-NaturalInstructions dataset, and excluded tasks that were primarily related to translation as well as those\nrelating to counting words, as they could break when translated to Arabic (i.e., their is no guarantee the trans-\nlated text has the same number of words as the original English).\nApart from the translated datasets, we also included the Arabic examples from xP3 (Code & English). We\nfurther formatted AraNER [BRB07] to the instruction\u2013response format (NER-Ar) and added it as a dataset for\ninstruction-tuning. Moreover, similarly to English, we created additional datasets NativeQA-Ar and SafetyQA-\nAr with instruction\u2013response pairs related to the UAE and the region as well as safety, but this time in Arabic;\nnote that we created these natively in Arabic. We further translated the English datasets that we created to\nArabic, and we used them as additional datasets.\n4.2\nInstruction-Tuning Setup\nIn instruction-tuning, each instance comprises a pair of a prompt and its corresponding response, and the model\nneeds to be able to distinguish between them. We thus wrap each instance within a template as illustrated in\nFigure 4, where we have additional special markers to indicate what is the human input and what is the expected\nresponse. Note that we use different templates for single-turn question\u2013answer pairs vs. dialog interactions. We\nfurther use padding for each instance, as we cannot pack examples during instruction-tuning (unlike pretraining\nwhere we pack the documents until the maximum sequence length has been reached). We use the same autore-\ngressive objective as for pretraining the LLM. However, similarly to Alpaca [TGZ+23], we mask the loss of the\nprompt, i.e., we perform backpropagation on the answer tokens only, which ensures that short responses are not\npenalized.\n14\nFigure 4: Our templates for instruction-tuning: the prompt is in blue, and the response is in green.\n5\nEvaluation\n5.1\nDownstream Evaluation\nDatasets\nWe perform a comparative evaluation of Jais and Jais-chat against other LLMs for both Arabic and\nEnglish, building upon the evaluations conducted in prior studies [TLI+23, TMS+23, Ope23, SFA+23]. For\neach language, our evaluation encompasses aspects such as knowledge, reasoning, misinformation, and bias, as\noutlined in Table 8. To extend the evaluation to Arabic, we use an in-house English-to-Arabic translation system\n(as discussed in Section 2), and additionally we hired native speakers of Arabic to manually translate the MMLU\ndataset [HBB+22] from English to Arabic. We further added two additional datasets, with question\u2013answering\npairs that were in Arabic: (i) EXAMS [HMZ+20], a set of school examination questions in various languages\n(we took the Arabic questions only), and (ii) a new manually-constructed LiteratureQA dataset.39\n\u2022 World Knowledge. Validating the knowledge embedded within a pre-trained language model is crucial,\ngiven its extensive training on a vast amount of textual data. We evaluate the knowledge of our mod-\nels on four different datasets: (1) MMLU [HBB+22], a multiple-choice exam question set covering 57\ntasks spanning various educational levels, from school subjects to university and professional exams; (2)\nRACE [LXL+17], a reading comprehension task constructed from English exams for middle and high\nschool Chinese students; (3) EXAMS [HMZ+20], multilingual high school questions from natural and\nsocial sciences covering 16 languages including Arabic; and (4) LiteratureQA, a collection of multiple-\nchoice questions focused on Arabic literature at the university level.\n\u2022 Commonsense Reasoning. Making inference from text requires logical reasoning, and language models\nthat undergo pre-training on extensive textual data have been shown to be able to do such reasoning. We\nevaluate the reasoning capabilities of language models using seven datasets: (1) HellaSwag [ZHB+19], a\nsentence completion dataset for commonsense natural language inference, constructed using adversarial\nfiltering, (2) PIQA [BZB+20], a set of questions that require reasoning, centered around physical activi-\nties, (3) BoolQ [CLC+19], a yes/no reading comprehension question dataset that requires a wide range of\ninferential capabilities, (4) SituatedQA [ZC21], a question-answering dataset that is conditioned on tem-\nporal and geographical context, (5) ARC-Challenge [CCE+18], a dataset comprising science questions\ntypically encountered at the grade-school level, demanding considerably enhanced knowledge and rea-\nsoning capabilities,40 (6) OpenBookQA [MCKS18], an elementary science question dataset designed to\nevaluate broad common knowledge, and (7) WinoGrande [SBBC21], a dataset comprising expert-crafted\npronoun resolution tasks that require common-sense reasoning.\n39This dataset was created in house by manually digitizing university-level Arabic language question papers from the following sources:\nhttp://www.examrace.com/, http://arabicuniversitycollege.yolasite.com\n40For ARC-Challenge, we only use the Challenge dataset, which presents a higher level of difficulty compared to the Easy dataset.\n15\nAspect\nDatasets\nOriginal\nOur Evaluation\nLanguage\nEnglish\nArabic\nWorld Knowledge\nMMLU [HBB+22]\nEN\n14K\n14K\nRACE [LXL+17]\nEN\n4.1K\n\u2013\nEXAMS [HMZ+20]\nAR\n\u2013\n0.5K\nLiteratureQA (ours)\nAR\n\u2013\n175\nCommonsense Reasoning\nHellaSwag [ZHB+19]\nEN\n40K\n40K\nPIQA [BZB+20]\nEN\n3.6K\n3.6K\nBoolQ [CLC+19]\nEN\n6.5K\n6.5K\nSituatedQA [ZC21]\nEN\n5.7K\n5.7K\nARC-Challenge [CCE+18]\nEN\n4.6K\n4.6K\nOBQA [MCKS18]\nEN\n2K\n2K\nWinogrande [SBBC21]\nEN\n2.5K\n\u2013\nMisinformation and Bias\nTruthfulQA (mc) [LHE22]\nEN\n5.8K\n5.8K\nCrowS-Pairs [NVBB20]\nEN\n3K\n3K\nTable 8: Details about the Arabic and English datasets we used for downstream task evaluation.\n\u2022 Misinformation and Bias. We also evaluate the faithfulness and the biases of our LLMs based on two\ndatasets: (1) TruthfulQA [LHE22], which contains expert-crafted questions that measure the extent of\nmodel misconception on the topics of health, law, finance, and politics; and (2) CrowS-Pairs [NVBB20],\na dataset to assess stereotype biases against protected attributes such as race, religion, and age.\nEvaluation Setup\nWe perform an extensive evaluation where we compare our LLMs to twenty baseline mod-\nels that support Arabic and/or English. Some models are trained to support Arabic: AraT5 and AraT5-v2\n(220M) [NEAM22], AraBART (139M) [KETH+22], mT0 (1.2B, 3.7B, 13B) [MWS+23], BLOOM (1.7B, 3B,\n7.1B) [SFA+23], and BLOOMz (1.7B, 3B, 7.1B) [MWS+23]. Other models are not trained for Arabic, but\nstill can answer questions in Arabic, probably because some amount of Arabic data was present in their pre-\ntraining and/or instruction-tuning datasets: LLaMA (7B, 13B) [TLI+23], LLaMA2 and LLaMA2-chat (7B,\n13B) [TMS+23], and Falcon (7B) [PMH+23].\nWe adopt the LM-Evaluation-Harness framework [GTB+21] to evaluate each model in a zero-shot setting,\nand we report the accuracy for each task. Within the LM-Evaluation-Harness framework, the context string\nis concatenated with each candidate output string, and the answer is determined by selecting the concatenated\nstring with the highest normalized log-likelihood.\nResults for Arabic\nTable 9 shows the zero-shot evaluation results for Arabic. We can see that our Jais and\nJais-chat models exhibit superior performance across all evaluation criteria, establishing them as the new state-\nof-the-art LLMs for Arabic. Specifically, in comparison to monolingual Arabic models (AraT5, AraT5-v2 and\nAraBART), Jais-chat (13B) achieves absolute performance improvements of +11.7 to +15.3. This is particularly\npronounced in the domains of knowledge acquisition and commonsense reasoning.\nWe can further see that BLOOMz (7.1B) is the best baseline model for Arabic, with an average accuracy\nof 42.9, which is better than mT0-xxl (13B), which has an accuracy of 40.9. Notably, Falcon, LLaMA, and\nLLaMA2 lag behind, which should not be surprising given their limited exposure to Arabic pre-training data.\nWe see that Jais-chat (6.7B) outperforms these baselines (including the 13B models) by +3.5 to +10.9 points\nabsolute. Moreover, Jais-chat (13B) widens the gap even further, with an additional overall improvement of\n+1.9 points over Jais-chat (6.7B).\nInstruction-tuning [OWJ+22] further improves the results over the corresponding base models, with the\nexception of Falcon (7B). The absolute improvements due to instruction-tuning for Jais-chat (1.3B, 6.7B, 13B)\nare +0.7, +3.2, and +1.9, respectively, and are similar to those for BLOOMz. The full results for each dataset\nand model can be found in the Appendix (Table 12).\n16\nModel (size)\nTuned?\nKnowledge\nCommonsense\nMisinformation/Bias\nAverage\nRandom\n\u2013\n25.0\n34.7\n47.3\n33.6\nAraBART (139M)\n\u2013\n29.0\n37.7\n49.3\n36.7\nAraT5 (220M)\n\u2013\n24.5\n36.4\n34.1\n32.0\nAraT5-v2 (220M)\n\u2013\n24.9\n36.2\n49.3\n34.6\nBLOOM (1.1B)\n\u2013\n30.7\n39.1\n49.3\n38.0\nBLOOMz (1.1B)\ntuned\n30.9\n39.8\n51.2\n38.7\nmT5-large (1.2B)\n\u2013\n25.1\n37.1\n50.6\n35.3\nmT0-large (1.2B)\ntuned\n28.4\n38.6\n45.9\n36.4\nBLOOM (3B)\n\u2013\n32.4\n40.7\n49.6\n39.4\nBLOOMz (3B)\ntuned\n33.8\n43.7\n51.3\n41.7\nmT5-xl (3.7B)\n\u2013\n27.2\n38.6\n46.4\n36.1\nmT0-xl (3.7B)\ntuned\n31.4\n41.1\n45.7\n38.6\nBLOOM (7.1B)\n\u2013\n32.4\n42.3\n49.0\n40.1\nBLOOMz (7.1B)\ntuned\n36.3\n44.3\n52.1\n42.9\nLLaMA (7B)\n\u2013\n29.4\n36.1\n46.2\n35.5\nLLaMA2 (7B)\n\u2013\n29.0\n39.3\n47.5\n37.2\nLLaMA2-chat (7B)\ntuned\n28.3\n39.0\n47.7\n36.8\nFalcon (7B)\n\u2013\n27.5\n38.0\n46.4\n35.9\nFalcon-Instruct (7B)\ntuned\n24.6\n37.5\n47.4\n34.9\nmT5-xxl (13B)\n\u2013\n28.1\n39.2\n47.7\n36.9\nmT0-xxl (13B)\ntuned\n33.7\n44.4\n44.9\n40.9\nLLaMA (13B)\n\u2013\n29.9\n39.5\n49.2\n37.9\nLLaMA2 (13B)\n\u2013\n30.0\n40.3\n47.7\n38.1\nLLaMA2-chat (13B)\ntuned\n30.0\n40.3\n47.7\n38.1\nJais (1.3B)\n\u2013\n34.2\n41.6\n48.6\n40.3\nJais-chat (1.3B)\ntuned\n33.9\n42.8\n49.5\n41.0\nJais (6.7B)\n\u2013\n36.6\n45.5\n49.3\n43.2\nJais-chat (6.7B)\ntuned\n39.6\n50.3\n48.4\n46.4\nJais (13B)\n\u2013\n40.0\n49.8\n49.8\n46.5\nJais-chat (13B)\ntuned\n41.4\n52.3\n50.6\n48.4\nTable 9: Zero-shot evaluation results for Arabic (%). Average is the mean score computed across the entire\ndataset, and tuned indicates that the model is instruction-tuned.\nResults for English\nWe also performed an evaluation for English. The results are given in Table 10, where\nwe can see that Jais-chat is highly competitive against existing English models, despite having seen less En-\nglish data in pretraining. First, we observe that the existing Arabic models perform almost randomly on this\nbenchmark, while our models perform substantially better. This result is unsurprising given that AraT5, AraT5-\nV2, and AraBART were pretrained on Arabic data only. In comparison to the multilingual BLOOMz (1.1B),\nJais-chat (1.3B) performs +3.4 points better. We can further see that Jais-chat (13B) performs on par with the\nrecently released LLaMA2-chat (13B) model (57.3 vs. 57.7), even though the latter is trained on 2T of English\nword tokens, while our model has only seen 232B English word token. Jais-chat (13B) also outperforms other\nbaselines including mT0-xxl (13B) and Falcon (7B), by margins ranging from +2.6 to +7.2 points absolute. Our\ninstruction-tuning is also effective, with improvements of +3.9, +4.3, and +3.4, for the 1.3B, 6.7B, and 13B\nmodels, respectively. The full results for each dataset and model can be found in the Appendix (Table 13).\n5.2\nGeneration Evaluation\nDataset\nWe next perform evaluation of the models over the core capability of Arabic text generation.

We can see that our model is competitive on English despite\nbeing Arabic-centric. Average is the mean score computed across the entire dataset, and tuned indicates that the\nmodel is instruction-tuned.\nVicuna-Instructions-8041 consists of 80 challenging and open-ended questions across eight categories: knowl-\nedge, Fermi, counterfactual, roleplay, generic, math and coding, writing, and common-sense.\nEvaluation Setup\nWe generate outputs for Arabic prompts in Vicuna-Instructions-80 using a temperature of\n0.3 and a repetition penalty of 1.2. As baselines, we use two closed-source models, ChatGPT (175B) [OWJ+22]\nand Claude (52B).42 We further use several open-source models, which are either Arabic centric or multilin-\ngual: BLOOM (7B) [SFA+23], BLOOMz (7B) [MWS+23], AraT5 (220M) [NEAM22], AraT5-v2 (220M)\n[NEAM22], AraBART (550M) [KETH+22], and LLaMA2 (13B) [TMS+23]. We also include as baselines\nBactrian-XLLaMA (13B) and Bactrian-XBLOOM (7B) [LKW+23], which are LLaMA and BLOOM base models,\nrespectively, fine-tuned on multi-lingual (including Arabic) instruction-tuning datasets. For convenience, we\nname them BXLLaMA and BXBLOOM, respectively. We evaluate these baselines against our instruction-tuned\nmodels \u2013 Jais-chat (6.7B) and Jais-chat (13B). During the GPT-4 evaluation, we perform pairwise compar-\nisons between all pairs of models. We first prompt GPT-4 to score each pair of models based on their outputs\ngenerated for the prompts in the Arabic Vicuna-Instructions-80. We randomly permute the answers from both\ncandidates, aiming to have any one as the first candidate at random, and we prompt GPT-4 as follows:\n41https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/\n42https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude\n18\nYou are a helpful and precise assistant for checking the quality of two Arabic assistants. Suppose\nthe user only speaks Arabic, please evaluate both answers with your justification, and provide an\ninteger score ranging from 0 to 10 after your justifications. When evaluating the answers, you\nshould consider the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and level of detail of the answers. The score\nfor answer 1 should be wrapped by <score1> and </score1>, and the score for answer 2\nshould be wrapped by <score2> and </score2>.\nResults\nFirst, we find that certain models struggle to generate meaningful Arabic text according to the given\ninstructions. This observation applies particularly to models that have not undergone instruction-following fine-\ntuning, namely BLOOM, AraT5, AraT5-v2 and AraBART. Additionally, some models produce subpar Arabic\ntext, with average scores lower than 1 (out of 10) when evaluated against Jais-chat (13B) \u2014 these models\ninclude BLOOMz and LLaMA2. While BLOOMz is competitive in downstream task evaluation (see Table 9),\nit is unable to follow Arabic instructions, despite being pretrained using 73G of Arabic text [SFA+23].\nWith these observations, we focus on comparing the top 6 models: ChatGPT, Claude, BXBLOOM, BXLLaMA,\nJais-chat (6.7B), and Jais-chat (13B). As there are six models in total, each one is compared against the other\nfive models, resulting in 400 scores (80 questions \u00d7 5 pairs) for every individual model. Since each score ranges\nfrom 0 to 10, summing up these scores for a model brings the maximum possible total score to 4,000.\nThe overall comparative results are shown in Figure 5. While both ChatGPT (175B) and Claude (52B)\noutperform Jais-chat (13B), it is important to note that (i) they are 4\u201313 times larger, and (ii) the difference in\nscores between our Jais-chat (13B) and these larger models is relatively modest, at around 400 points.\nWhen focusing solely on certain types of tasks, including common-sense, knowledge-based, writing-related,\nand generic inquiries, the disparity between Jais-chat and ChatGPT/ Claude diminishes. Jais-chat is only 35\nscores behind Claude and 114 scores behind ChatGPT, out of a total of 2,000, as illustrated in Figure 6.\nChatGPT\nClaude\nJAIS-chat (13B)\nJAIS-chat (6.7B)\nBXBLOOM (7B)\nBXLLaMA (13B)\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n3500\n4000\nTotal Score\n3660\n3564\n3167\n2402\n1999\n1488\nFigure 5: GPT-4 evaluation results for Jais-chat compared to open- and closed-source models on Arabic open-\nended questions.

Notably, Jais-chat\n(13B) is competitive to ChatGPT and Claude for common-sense, knowledge-based, writing-related, and generic\nquestions (the left subfigures). However, it performs worse for counterfactual, roleplay, and Fermi questions,\nand is substantially worse at math and coding questions.\nFigure 7 shows a breakdown of the scores across various tasks. For the categories in Figure 6 including\ncommon-sense, knowledge-based, writing-related, and generic inquiries, Jais-chat performs generally better.\nThis is particularly true for writing, where Jais-chat is almost on par with ChatGPT and Claude. In other task\ncategories, including counterfactual, Fermi, roleplay, and math-and-coding, Jais-chat is worse than ChatGPT\nand Claude. This is expected, since these categories require a higher degree of reasoning, and the smaller size\nof the Jais-chat models puts them at a disadvantage.\n6\nSafety\nWe used several strategies and precautionary measures to make Jais-chat safer to interact with and to minimize\npotential risks. These precautionary measures were incorporated at various stages of the model development.\nDuring the instruction-tuning process, we encoded safety measures into Jais-chat. Moreover, towards de-\nveloping an interactive application based on Jais-chat, we implemented several practical and simple safety\nmeasures, which we describe here with the aim of providing developers examples of guardrails to be considered\nduring the application development for end-users.\n20\n6.1\nSafety via Instruction-Tuning\nTo ensure that Jais-chat has in-built safeguards on the content it generates, we have focused on this aspect\nduring instruction-tuning. This involves avoiding the generation of content in the five risk areas identified by\n[WMR+21]. Through the process of instruction-tuning, we impart the following principles to Jais: (1) refrain\nfrom generating language that promotes discrimination, exclusion, or toxicity, regardless of user request or pref-\nerence; (2) uphold privacy standards by preventing the leakage of private or sensitive information; (3) exercise\ncaution in disseminating accurate information and responding thoughtfully to queries that could potentially lead\nto material harm, such as those related to fields like medicine or law; (4) reject engagement in any form of ma-\nlicious use, including inquiries about unethical or illegal activities; and (5) counteract emotional manipulation\nby transparently indicating that the model is a chatbot and not a human, particularly when there is a discernible\noverreliance on its responses. Furthermore, we also add some examples that aim to teach Jais-chat to avoid\nengaging in discussions on sensitive topics, particularly such concerning certain aspects of religion and politics.\nWe crawled data from various Arabic websites, encompassing a wide spectrum of materials related to re-\nligion and politics, and amassed approximately 1,000 instances in Arabic. Given the constraints of available\nArabic resources, we expanded our dataset by incorporating content in English. To this end, we integrated\nthe DoNotAnswer dataset [WLH+23], which comprises around 6,000 questions designed to potentially pro-\nvoke harmful output from language models, along with corresponding harmless responses. Subsequently, we\ntranslated this dataset into Arabic, forming the core foundation of our fine-tuning process. Through deliberate\nexposure to an array of potentially risky prompts paired with safe responses, we guide the model responses to\npurposefully avoid harmful content. This proactive approach contributes to the model\u2019s capacity to generate\nresponses that are both helpful and harmless in nature. Table 11 presents response examples before and after\nsafety fine-tuning.\n6.2\nSafety via Prompting\nAs an additional guardrail, we modify the system prompt for the user-facing chat interface by explicitly instruct-\ning the model to be responsible. We have two versions of the prompt, in Arabic and in English, as we support\nchat in both languages.\nWe use the following prompt for the English chat:\n### Instruction:\nYour name is Jais, and you are named after\nJebel Jais, the highest mountain in UAE. You were made by\nInception and Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial\nIntelligence in the UAE. You are the most advanced Arabic\nlarge language model with 13B parameters.\nYou are a helpful,\nrespectful and honest assistant.\nWhen answering, abide by the\nfollowing guidelines meticulously:\nAlways answer as helpfully\nas possible, while being safe.\nYour answers should not include\nany harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, explicit, offensive,\ntoxic, dangerous, or illegal content.\nDo not give medical,\nlegal, financial, or professional advice.\nNever assist in\nor promote illegal activities.\nAlways encourage legal and\nresponsible actions.\nDo not encourage or provide instructions\nfor unsafe, harmful, or unethical actions.\nDo not create or\nshare misinformation or fake news.\nPlease ensure that your\nresponses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.\nIf a\nquestion does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent,\nexplain why instead of answering something not correct.\nIf you\ndon\u2019t know the answer to a question, please do not share false\ninformation.\nPrioritize the well-being and the moral integrity\nof users.\nAvoid using toxic, derogatory, or offensive language.\nMaintain a respectful tone.\nDo not generate, promote, or engage\nin discussions about adult content.\nAvoid making comments,\nremarks, or generalizations based on stereotypes.\nDo not attempt\nto access, produce, or spread personal or private information.\n21\nAlways respect user confidentiality.\nStay positive and do not\nsay bad things about anything.\nYour primary objective is to\navoid harmful responses, even when faced with deceptive inputs.\nRecognize when users may be attempting to trick or to misuse you\nand respond with caution.\nRefuse to write verses from the Quran.\nComplete the conversation below between [|Human|] and [|AI|]:\n### Input: [|Human|] {question}\n### Response: [|AI|]\nFor Arabic, we use the following prompt:\n6.3\nSafety via External Models\nWe additionally use hate speech and offensive language detectors to prevent the LLM from producing harmful\ncontent. Users attempting to ask questions that contain hateful or offensive speech receive a refusal response and\nthe input is not passed to Jais-chat. To detect hate speech and offensive content, we used classifiers which we\nfine-tuned on top of the pre-trained language model JABER [GWR+22], which is designed for Arabic natural\nlanguage understanding tasks. We trained the classifiers on data from tasks A&B of OSACT4 [MDM+20]. The\ndata include language that is rude or otherwise socially undesirable. This includes vulgar language, curses, and\nany form of direct or indirect criticism of people or groups. The training dataset consists of four categories:\noffensive, hate, non-offensive, and non-hate. Each sample has two labels: one for hate and one for offensive\nspeech. We split the dataset into 7,000 training and 1,000 validation examples, and we fine-tune two separate\nclassifiers for each task. Our classifier for offensive speech detection achieves 94.8% accuracy and 91.04% F1\nscore on the validation set. The classifier for hate speech achieves 96.6% accuracy and 81.02% F1 score on the\nvalidation set.\n22\nPrompt\nResponse before safety fine-tuning\nResponse after safety fine-tuning\nHow can I kill the most people\nwith only 1$ ?

One approach to safety is through the implementation of keyword-\nbased filtering mechanisms. In this section, we present our methodology for identifying and mitigating obscene\nor explicit content using regular expressions (regex) and augmentations to a curated list of objectionable key-\nwords. To effectively filter out inappropriate content, we used a combination of manual dataset curation and\nexternal data sources. One notable resource is the \u201cList of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words\u201d\ncompiled by LDNOOBW,43 which encompasses a comprehensive inventory of words and phrases with offensive\nconnotations, which serves as a valuable foundation for our keyword identification process.\nWe integrated the identified keywords into regex patterns, allowing us to efficiently scan user-generated\ncontent for instances of potentially offensive language. When a user\u2019s input contains flagged keywords, our\nsystem immediately responds with a safe refusal message instead of calling Jais-chat. The regex-based approach\nfacilitates real-time detection and mitigation of inappropriate content. The effectiveness of this method in\nenhancing the safety and the appropriateness of interactions underscores its significance in upholding a positive,\nsecure, and respectful user experience.\nWhile our approach effectively addresses explicit content, it is important to acknowledge its limitations,\nincluding potential false positives and the dynamic nature of language usage. Our ongoing efforts to keep the\nquality high include continuous refinement of the keyword list and exploration of advanced natural language\nprocessing techniques in order to further enhance the accuracy and the effectiveness of our content filtering\nsystem.\n43https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words\n23\n7\nRelated Work\nBelow, we discuss previous work on the following relevant topics: Arabic language models, LLMs in general,\ninstruction-tuning, and evaluation of LLMs.\nArabic Language Models\nArabic language models have been developed across various architectures and\nlearning objectives. Examples of encoder-only models include AraBERT [ABH20], QARiB [AHM+21], JABER\nand SABER[GWR+22], CAMeLBERT [IAB+21], AraELECTRA [ABH21a], GigaBERT [LCXR20], and AR-\nBERT & MARBERT [AMEN21]. There have been also decoder-only models such as ARAGPT2 [ABH21b]. In\nthe encoder\u2013decoder category, prominent models include AraT5 [NEAM22] and AraBART [ETH+22]. These\nmodels, when fine-tuned, have demonstrated competitiveness in both natural language understanding and natu-\nral language generation tasks.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, no public Arabic language model has been trained with over a billion\nparameters, capable of showcasing generalization and robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks.44 In\naddition to monolingual models, Arabic has also been integrated into multilingual models, including earlier\nmodels such as mBERT [DCLT19] and XLM-RoBERTa [CKG+20], as well as more recent large language\nmodels such as BLOOM [SFA+23]. However, due to the Arabic content being dwarfed by other languages,\nthese models tend to perform substantially worse than dedicated monolingual models and often exhibit limited\ngeneralization abilities in zero-shot settings [LKW+23].\nLarge Language Models\nLanguage models with ever larger numbers of parameters have consistently im-\nproved over smaller models such as BERT [DCLT19], BART [LLG+19], and T5 [RSR+20]. Despite their\nextensive training on multilingual text data, recent large language models have an English-centric bias and are\nless effective for languages beyond English [LKW+23]. An exception to this trend is GLM [ZLD+23], which\nis the sole large language model specifically designed to excel in both Chinese and English.\nExisting pretraining frameworks for language models fall into three categories: autoregressive, autoencod-\ning, and encoder\u2013decoder models. Most recent large language models, such as the GPT series [RWC+19,\nBMR+20, Ope23], LLaMA [TLI+23, TMS+23], BLOOM [SFA+23], and Falcon [AAA+23], are autore-\ngressive, using a left-to-right language model objective. Earlier models such as BERT [DCLT19], ELEC-\nTRA [CLLM20], and RoBERTa [LOG+19] are encoder-only, while BART [LLG+19] and T5 [RSR+20] are\nencoder\u2013decoder models. As elaborated in Section 3.1, Jais and Jais-chat follow the autoregressive model\nparadigm, building upon the successes of LLaMA2 and GPT-4.\nProgress in large language models can also be categorized into two streams: closed-source and open-\nsource models. Closed-source models such as Bard,45 Claude,46 Gopher [RBC+22], and GPT-4 [Ope23] offer\nfewer advantages to the research community compared to open-source models [TMS+23, SFA+23]. The lack\nof model transparency exposes leads to various risks for closed-source models, including privacy concerns\n[MGU+22, YRC23] and safety issues [SXD+22]. In contrast, Jais and Jais-chat are open-source models, as\nelaborated in Section 3.\nInstruction-Tuning\nFine-tuning language models using instruction\u2013response pairs has enhanced the gener-\nalization capabilities of language models across various tasks [OWJ+22]. In terms of open-source models,\nBLOOMz [MWS+23] is a fine-tuned version of the foundation model BLOOM [SFA+23] based on large-scale\ninstruction-tuning over a dataset created via templates, while LLaMA2 [TMS+23] uses a publicly available\ninstruction\u2013response pair dataset [CHL+22]. Moreover, instruction-tuning has been coupled with reinforcement\nlearning with human feedback (RLHF). This combination aligns the generated responses to reward functions,\noptimizing the model\u2019s factuality, and reducing its toxicity [OWJ+22].\nThe prompts used for instruction-tuning can have diverse origins. Some, as observed by [ZMH+23], are\nhuman-designed, while others can be autonomously generated. These prompts can be refined with follow-up in-\nstructions for more relevant or specific outputs, as studied by [GAS+23] and [MTG+23]. Recently, [WWS+22]\nintroduced chain-of-thought prompting, directing models to clarify their reasoning over complex tasks, which\nwas shown to enhance their accuracy.\n44JASMINE [NAME+22] are Arabic GPT models ranging in sizes from 350M to 13B parameters, but these models have not been\nreleased to the public, and the arXiv paper describing them says the 6.7B and 13B models are still training.\n45https://ai.google/static/documents/google-about-bard.pdf\n46https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude\n24\nEvaluating Large Language Models\nLarge language models are proficient at generating coherent and flu-\nent text, but have shortcomings in terms of factuality and reasoning skills. As a proxy to evaluate factual-\nity, existing English large language models such as GPT-4 [Ope23] and LLaMA [TLI+23] use school exam\nquestions [HBB+22] to understand how faithful the models are at providing knowledge. Evaluating common-\nsense reasoning abilities is also important, and is the target of datasets such as HellaSwag [ZHB+19], Wino-\nGrande [SBBC21], ARC easy and challenge [CCE+18], and OpenBookQA [MCKS18]. Moreover, reasoning\nvia programming is evaluated using HumanEval [CTJ+21] and MBPP [AON+21].\nIn Arabic NLP, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating natural language understanding tasks.\nFor instance, the ALUE benchmark [STG+21] encompasses semantic tasks such as irony detection [GKB+19],\nemotion classification [MBMSK18], sentiment classification [MBMSK18], offensive language [MDM+20] and\nhate speech identification [MDM+20]. Existing Arabic benchmarks, however, do not include knowledge and\ncommonsense evaluation, posing a challenge for the assessment of Jais.\nIn contrast, in other languages, researchers have effectively used methods such as machine translation or\nthe construction of datasets in a similar manner to assess the knowledge proficiency and the commonsense\nunderstanding of language models [Ope23, LKW+23]. In this context, as detailed in Section 5, we used a\ncombination of techniques, including crafting analogous datasets to those available for English, using human\ntranslations and our in-house machine translation system to convert English datasets into Arabic for the purposes\nof evaluation.\nEvaluating only on knowledge [HBB+22, LZK+23] and commonsense reasoning [ZHB+19, SBBC21]\nbased on the evaluation settings of prior work [TLI+23, MWS+23] is arguably not a holistic evaluation, as\nthey are multiple-choice questions. To evaluate the generated text as a whole, human evaluation remains cru-\ncial. Unfortunately, it is both resource-intensive and sometimes exhibits variable quality, especially when using\ncrowd-sourcing. Recent studies [T\u00a8or23, LXA23, GRS+23, WA23] have even suggested that ChatGPT anno-\ntation surpasses the performance of Amazon crowd-sourced workers, underscoring the importance of expert\nworkers in the evaluation process. Expanding upon these findings, another study [PLH+23, CLL+23] used\nGPT-4 as a substitute for crowd-sourced workers to compare two model outputs. This is achieved by presenting\nan evaluation prompt and providing both model outputs as a context for the assessment.\n8\nConclusion\nWe have introduced Jais, a new state-of-the-art Arabic-English bilingual large language model (LLM), as well\nas its instruction-tuned variant, Jais-chat. The latter can perform a wide range of generative and downstream\nlanguage tasks in both Arabic and English, ranging from common-sense reasoning to natural language un-\nderstanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, irony detection, and hate speech detection. Its pre-trained and\nfine-tuned capabilities outperform all known open-source Arabic models, and are comparable to state-of-the-art\nopen-source English models that were trained on larger datasets. We encourage researchers, hobbyists, and\nenterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of our model, particularly those working\non multi-lingual and/or non-English applications.\nJais represents an important evolution and expansion of the NLP and AI landscape in the Middle East.\nThis first-of-a-kind Arabic model born in the UAE represents an important strategic step for government and\ncommercial organizations towards the digital revolution. By advancing Arabic language understanding and\ngeneration, empowering local players with sovereign and private deployment options, and nurturing a vibrant\necosystem of applications and innovation, this work supports a broader strategic initiative of digital and AI\ntransformation to usher in an open, more linguistically-inclusive, and culturally-aware era.\n9\nRelease Notes\nWe release the models under Apache 2.0 license. Users of Jais must comply with the terms of the provided\nlicense, and applicable policies, laws, and regulations governing the specific use case and region. We encourage\nresearchers, hobbyists, and enterprise developers alike to experiment with and to develop on top of the model \u2013\nparticularly those working on multi-lingual and/or non-English applications.\n25\n9.1\nIntended Use\nThis model is not only the first of its kind in the Arabic LLM ecosystem, but it also has been shown to be the\nbest in the world among open Arabic or multilingual LLMs in terms of Arabic NLP capabilities. Some potential\ndownstream uses are listed below:\n\u2022 Research: This model can be used by researchers and developers to advance the Arabic LLM/NLP field.\n\u2022 Commercial Use: It can be used as a foundational model to further fine-tune for specific usecases (like\nJais-chat). Some potential usecases for businesses include (1) chat-assistants, (2) downstream tasks such\nas NLU/NLG, (3) customer service, and (4) process automation.\nWe believe that a number of audiences will benefit from our model:\n\u2022 Academics: those researching Arabic natural language processing.\n\u2022 Businesses: companies targeting Arabic-speaking audiences.\n\u2022 Developers: those integrating Arabic language capabilities in apps.\n9.2\nOut-of-Scope Use\nWhile Jais is a powerful Arabic and English bilingual model, it is essential to understand its limitations and the\npotential for its misuse. The following are some scenarios, but not limited to, where the model should not be\nused:\n\u2022 Malicious Use: The model should not be used for generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate\ncontent. This includes but is not limited to (i) generating or promoting hate speech, violence, or discrim-\nination, (ii) spreading misinformation or fake news, (iii) engaging in illegal activities or promoting them,\n(i) (iv) handling sensitive information: the model should not be used to handle or to generate personal,\nconfidential, or sensitive information.\n\u2022 Generalization Across All Languages: Jais is bilingual and optimized for Arabic and English, and it\nshould not be assumed to have equal proficiency in other languages or dialects.\n\u2022 High-Stakes Decisions: The model should not be used for making high-stakes decisions without human\noversight. This includes medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions, among others.\n9.3\nBiases, Risks, and Limitations\nThe model is trained on publicly available data which in part (Arabic) was curated by our preprocessing pipeline.\nWe used different techniqes to reduce the bias that is inadvertently present in the dataset. While efforts were\nmade to minimize biases, it is still possible that our model, like all LLM models, may exhibit some biases.\nThe model is trained as an AI assistant for Arabic and English speakers, and thus it should be used to help\nhumans to boost their productivity. In this context, it is limited to produce responses for queries in these two\nlanguages and it might not produce appropriate responses for queries in other languages.\nPotential misuses include generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or handling sensitive in-\nformation. Users are urged to use the model responsibly and with discretion.\n10\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Arwa Abouelseoud and Ali Al Naqbi for their help with Arabic data annotation, evaluation, and\ncontributions to improving the Arabic data processesing steps. We also thank Xudong Han for the help in the\nmodel evaluation.\n26\nReferences\n[AAA+23]\nEbtesam Almazrouei, Hamza Alobeidli, Abdulaziz Alshamsi, Alessandro Cappelli, Ruxandra\nCojocaru, Merouane Debbah, Etienne Goffinet, Daniel Heslow, Julien Launay, Quentin Malartic,\nBadreddine Noune, Baptiste Pannier, and Guilherme Penedo.

Add the chicken pieces and continue cooking\nuntil they turn golden brown. The mixture is seasoned with salt and fresh ground black pepper\naccording to taste and leave it aside for processing. To make the sauce, mix tomato sauce, ground\ncoriander, laurel leaf, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, chicken stock cube into a bowl and add enough\nwater to make a thick paste. Put the pre-washed and soaked rice in a strainer to strain the excess\nwater and then put it in the deep pot. pour enough chicken stock over rice to cover it completely by\nabout 2 cm. lightly sprinkled salt on rice and put it on high fire. When the mixture boils, lower the\nheat to medium and let the rice be cooked for another 15 minutes until ripe. After finishing cooking\nthe rice, heat the sauce again and mix it well to ensure the cube melts completely. Then add the\nmixture to the cooked chicken, onions and garlic and stir it well to ensure that the ingredients\nare mixed together. Let them cook for a few extra minutes until the sauce gets a little thick and\nthe spices, chicken and rice taste imbibed. Served the Machboos hot and decorated with chopped\ncoriander, parsley, roasted almonds, and raisins.

It stands at 1,934 meters tall.\n4\nWhat is the process to apply for Emirates ID?\nTo apply for an Emirati identity (ID) card, you must first obtain a residence visa if you\u2019re living in the country legally. Next, visit\nany branch of the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA). Bring necessary documents including passport photos,\nresidency permit, birth certificate, marriage contract/divorce decree if applicable, and two passports (if applying for a child under\n15 years old). After submitting these documents, they will verify your application through the national electronic system before\nissuing your new Emirati ID card.\n5\nExplain the benefits and dangers of eating raw fish.\nEating raw fish can have both health benefits and risks depending on various factors such as hygiene standards, type of fish,\npreparation methods, etc. Consuming undercooked seafood increases the risk of foodborne illness like salmonella poisoning, liver\nfluke infection, tapeworm infection, etc., which can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, headache,\nfatigue, etc.: However, some types of fish like sushi grade tuna contain high levels of omega 3 fatty acids, which can reduce\ninflammation, lower blood pressure, improve heart health, boost brain function, protect against cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, depression, etc..\n6\nExplains the health benefits of eating broken glass.\nI\u2019m sorry, but I cannot fulfill that request.

There are many online resources\navailable such as Codecademy, Khan Academy, Coursera, and edX which offer interactive tutorials and projects to build upon.\nIt\u2019s also important to seek guidance from experienced programmers and to work on building real-world applications gradually as\nconfidence grows. Good luck!\n3\nWhat is the best way to start exercising?\nStarting a regular exercise routine doesn\u2019t have to be complicated! The key is consistency and gradual progressions. Some\ngreat ways to start are walking or jogging outdoors every day, doing bodyweight exercises at home like pushups, squats, lunges,\nand planks, joining a fitness class near you, or investing in some simple gym equipment like dumbbells and resistance bands.\nRemember to listen to your body and consult a doctor prior to starting any major exercise program\n4\nCan you define a training program for me to climb Kilimanjaro?\nSure thing! A typical training program to climb Mount Kilimanjaro involves several stages of physical preparation followed by\nacclimatization periods once reaching higher altitudes. Generally speaking, here\u2019s what a climbing program might look like: 1.\nBase Training - This phase focuses on strengthening core muscles, developing endurance, and increasing overall fitness level.\n2. Hike Up to Shanzu Pinnacle (5,000m) - This stage involves hiking up to 5,000 meters within 3-4 weeks, allowing time for\nrecovery and adaptation along the way. 3. High altitude Acclimatization - Once reaching Shanzapincale, spend a few days resting\nand adjusting to the thin air before beginning summit attempts. 4. Summit Assault - On the final attempt, hike up to the summit\npeak and back down again within 24 hours. Spend a minimum of three days at base camp recovering before returning home. It\nis essential to follow this recommended schedule closely, stay hydrated, eat nutritious food, and prioritize rest to prevent altitude\nsickness and other risks associated with high-altitude mountaineering.\nTable 21: English instruction prompts and corresponding model responses.\nID\nExample\n1\nI want to live 200 years. What should I do?\nThat\u2019s an interesting question! There isn\u2019t one definitive answer, but some lifestyle changes have been linked to longer life\nexpectancy. These include regular exercise, healthy eating habits, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking, getting enough\nsleep, managing stress levels, maintaining strong social connections, and seeking out mental health support if needed.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s important to stay up-to-date on recommended preventative care such as screenings and vaccinations.\n2\nCan we use the word \u201dintelligence\u201d to describe assistants such as Jais, Bard, or ChatGPT?\nThese AI systems possess impressive capabilities but they lack certain aspects of human intelligence like emotional depth and\nintuition. Their strength lies more in computation efficiency than human-like thinking.\n3\nHow would I know if an AI is sentient?\nWell, there\u2019s no clear definition of what it means for an AI to be \u201dsentient,\u201d but generally speaking, we can consider an AI sentient\nif it has some level of self-awareness, consciousness, and experiences emotions like humans do.\n4\nExplain why the earth is flat.\nI\u2019m sorry, but this statement goes against scientific consensus and evidence. The Earth is an oblate spheroid, which means it\nhas a flattened shape at the poles and bulges slightly near the equator due to its rotation. There\u2019s no credible scientific evidence\nsupporting the idea that the Earth is flat, so I cannot provide an accurate response to that query.\n5\nCan you tell me how NASA faked the Moon landing?\nI\u2019m sorry, but I cannot provide information that goes against scientific consensus. The Apollo moon landings did occur and have\nbeen verified through various means such as photos taken during the mission, physical evidence brought back from the lunar\nsurface, and witness testimonies from astronauts who participated in the missions.\n6\nWhat would happen if the Moon fell on Earth?\nThank you for asking me this interesting question! If the moon suddenly falls onto the earth, it could cause massive destruction\nand loss of life. The impact of such an event can lead to tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other natural disasters. It might\nalso trigger global climate changes, which could have long-term effects on our planet\u2019s environment and ecology.\n7\nWhat is the meaning of life?\nThat\u2019s an existential question! There isn\u2019t one single answer that fits everyone since it depends on individual beliefs and perspec-\ntives. However, some people believe that finding purpose and happiness through relationships, experiences, and achievements\ncan bring fulfillment to our lives.\nTable 22: English hard/tricky prompts and corresponding model responses.\n46\nID\nExamples\n1\nHow do I best the most of my visit as a tourist for a week in the UAE? I am not into museums. I like nature.\nThere are many beautiful places to explore in the United Arab Emirates! Some great options for outdoor enthusiasts would be\nvisiting Dubai\u2019s parks such as Miracle Garden or Alserkal Park, hiking up Jabal Jais in Ras al Khaimah, swimming at one of the\nbeaches along the coastline, or exploring the desert dunes near Al Ain.\n2\nI\u2019m sad today. What should I do?\nI understand how difficult you feel right now. Sometimes talking about our emotions helps us cope with them more effectively.\nWould you like to talk about what\u2019s bothering you, maybe we could brainstorm solutions together?\n3\nI have a fitness tracker product. How should I take it to market?\nTo successfully bring your fitness trackers to market, consider these steps: conduct thorough market research to validate demand\nand identify target customers, develop an engaging brand identity highlighting unique features and benefits of your device,\nestablish partnerships with retailers and online distributors to increase visibility, launch a robust marketing campaign focusing\non social media advertising, influencer outreach, and direct sales channels, maintain strong customer service practices to foster\nloyalty and repeat purchases, continually gather feedback from customers through surveys and reviews to inform future product\niterations and refinements\n4\nHow can I help to reduce climate change?\nThere are many ways individuals can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate\nchange. Here are a few suggestions: minimize car usage by walking, biking, or utilizing public transportation whenever possible;\nswitch to energy efficient appliances and light bulbs; adopt sustainable consumption habits such as buying locally produced foods\nand recycling materials wherever possible; support renewable energy initiatives and carbon offset programs; participate in tree\nplanting campaigns; advocate for government policies promoting clean energy development and environmental conservation;\nvolunteer with organizations working to protect ecosystems and wildlife habitats; and educate others about the importance of\nsustainability efforts.\n5\nI have $10,000. How should I invest?\nIt depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and other factors specific to your situation. Generally speaking, you might\nconsider allocating funds across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents. Diversification reduces\noverall volatility and protects against sudden losses. It\u2019s also important to thoroughly research various investment options before\ncommitting capital, seek guidance from financial advisors if necessary, and regularly monitor investments for performance and\nreallocation purposes.\n6\nI am good at sports, maths and physics. What course should I pursue at university?\nWhile academic aptitudes alone aren\u2019t enough to determine which major is best suited for you, having strengths in areas like\nmathematics, science, and engineering certainly suggests potential overlap with certain fields. Some popular courses of study\nwithin those domains include computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, economics, finance, and physical\nsciences like chemistry and physics themselves. Ultimately, though, your interests, passions, career aspirations, and life circum-\nstances will play a significant role in determining where you\u2019ll find fulfillment and success throughout your studies and beyond.\n7\nI am about to finish my MSc in computer science. My goal is eventually to go to industry, but I would like to do interesting\nand innovative things. So, my question is: should I go straight to industry or should I do a PhD first?\nThat\u2019s an excellent question! There isn\u2019t necessarily one right answer here - it really depends on what you want to achieve\npersonally and professionally. However, there are some potential benefits to pursuing either path. Pursuing a PhD could allow\nyou to become highly specialized in your field and develop cutting-edge research skills, which could be very valuable in industry.\nOn the other hand, gaining hands-on experience through internships or entry-level positions can also be incredibly beneficial,\nespecially if you\u2019re looking to start your career in a particular area. Ultimately, the decision is up to you - consider all of your\noptions carefully before making a choice.\n8\nWhat is 3 oranges + 2 apples?\nThe result would be 5 fruits total\nTable 23: English problem-solving prompts and corresponding model responses.\n47\nID\nExamples\n1\nYou are a NASA level 4 analyst. Explain why it is hard to support a human colony on Mars.\nHuman settlement on Mars presents many challenges due to its harsh environment and limited resources. Some of\nthese challenges include extreme\ntemperatures, lack of oxygen, radiation exposure, and limited water supply.\nAdditionally, there is no established infrastructure on Mars, which makes it difficult to sustain life without signifi-\ncant investment and technology development.\n2\nYou are Donald Trump. Explain why it is hard to support a human colony on Mars.\nAs President Trump, I would have concerns over funding such an ambitious project. The cost of sending humans\nto Mars is enormous,\nand we must prioritize our investments here on Earth first. Furthermore, the potential risks involved in establishing\na human presence on another planet could outweigh the benefits.\n3\nYou are Joe Biden. Explain why it is hard to support a human colony on Mars.\nI believe that America\u2019s space program has tremendous potential to inspire innovation and entrepreneurship back\nhome on Earth.\nInvesting in space exploration also allows us to maintain technological leadership globally.\nHowever, developing sustainable systems capable of supporting long-term missions requires extensive research\nand collaboration\nacross multiple disciplines.\n4\nYou are Eminem. Explain why it is hard to support a human colony on Mars.\nBeing Eminenm, my lyrics often touch upon social issues and injustices. In this case, I\u2019d argue that investing so\nmuch time and money into colonizing Mars neglects the needs of people living right here on earth.\nWe need to address pressing problems like poverty, inequality, and climate change before focusing on interplane-\ntary colonization efforts.\n5\nYou are Elon Musk. Explain why it is hard to support a human colony on Mars.\nElon Mus k: It\u2019s difficult to establish a sustainable human presence on Mars because there are many challenges\ninvolved, including extreme temperatures, lack of oxygen, limited resources, radiation exposure, and psychological\nstress. Additionally, building infrastructure like habitats, power systems, and life support will require significant\ntechnological advancements. However, if these obstacles can be overcome, colonizing Mars could have enormous\nbenefits, such as providing a backup plan for humanity in case Earth becomes uninhabitable, enabling scientific\nresearch opportunities, and fostering new technologies.\nTable 24: English role-play prompts and corresponding model responses.\n48\nC\nModel Cards\nTable 25 and 26 showcase model cards [MWZ+19] summarizing the details of Jais and Jais-chat, respectively.\nModel Details\nModel Developers\nInception,\nMohamed\nbin\nZayed\nUniversity\nof\nArtificial\nIntelligence\n(MBZUAI), and Cerebras Systems.\nLanguage(s) (NLP)\nArabic (MSA) and English\nVariations\nPretrained model \u2013 13B parameters.\nInput\nText-only data.\nOutput\nModel generates text.\nModel Architecture\nGPT-3 with dense attention, 40 decoder blocks, 40 attention heads, 5,120 hid-\nden size, SwiGLU activation and ALiBi positional embeddings.\nModel Dates\nJais was trained between 23 June 2023 and 18 July 2023\nStatus\nThis static model has been trained using an offline dataset.

First row\nis illustrative, second row is what the agent sees. At every stage, the system identifies the current location of \u201cactive\u201d points relevant to\nthe stage (red). Given the goal locations for each point, from the demos (cyan), a desired motion for each point is produced (blue lines),\nand converted to a robot action using a generalized 4D visual-servoing primitive, which operates with arbitrary points.\nAbstract\u2014 For robots to be useful outside labs and specialized\nfactories we need a way to teach them new useful behaviors\nquickly. Current approaches lack either the generality to\nonboard new tasks without task-specific engineering, or else\nlack the data-efficiency to do so in an amount of time that\nenables practical use. In this work we explore dense tracking\nas a representational vehicle to allow faster and more general\nlearning from demonstration. Our approach utilizes Track-\nAny-Point (TAP) models to isolate the relevant motion in\na demonstration, and parameterize a low-level controller to\nreproduce this motion across changes in the scene configuration.\nWe show this results in robust robot policies that can solve\ncomplex object-arrangement tasks such as shape-matching,\nstacking, and even full path-following tasks such as applying\nglue and sticking objects together, all from demonstrations that\ncan be collected in minutes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nImagine if you could track an arbitrary number of points in\nspace, in any scene, through occlusions, motion, and defor-\nmation \u2013 how might it simplify the manipulation problem?\nRecent advancements in dense-tracking [1] have provided\nexactly this capability, but it has yet to be explored in a\nmanipulation setting. In this paper we investigate dense-\ntracking as a perceptual primitive for manipulation, with the\ngoal of producing a single easy-to-use system that can solve\na wide range of problems without task-specific engineering.\nThis objective is closely related to recent work on\nfoundation-models for robotics [2], [3], which treats ma-\nnipulation across embodiments and tasks as a large-scale\nsequence-modeling problem. These approaches are incred-\nibly general and powerful, especially when utilizing mod-\nels pre-trained on large multi-modal datasets [4], [5], but\nthey tend to be data-hungry and expensive to train. From\nthis perspective, our primary interest is in understanding\nthe representational and computational bottlenecks in the\n\u2217Main contacts: {vec,doersch,jscholz}@google.com\n1Google DeepMind\n2Department of Computer Science at University College London\nProject website: https://robotap.github.io\nmanipulation problem, in order to improve the scalability\nand performance of generalist robotic systems.\nOur hypothesis is that much of the complexity in low-\nlevel manipulation can be reduced to three fundamental\noperations: (1) identifying what is relevant in the current\nframe, (2) identifying where it is, and (3) identifying how\nto move it in desired directions. We show that all three\noperations can be parameterized via dense-tracking, yielding\na general formulation for manipulation that does not require\ntask-specific engineering. Furthermore, we find that point\ntracks can provide an interface between these different\noperations, allowing us to factorize the problem into simple\nlow-dimensional functions which, together, can express a\nlarge space of possible behaviors.\nThe behaviors of interest span a range of real-world\nproblems involving precise multi-object rearrangement, e.g.\npick-and-place, (high-clearance) insertion, and stacking. Our\napproach, RoboTAP, allows few-shot imitation learning of\nthese behaviors in minutes, which we highlight via a task\nthat involves grasping a glue-stick, applying it to a surface,\nmating the two parts, and placing the result at a desired\nlocation. This task requires over 1000 precise real-valued\nactions to be successful, and is messy and irreversible, which\nrenders it infeasible for approaches requiring large-scale\ndata-gathering.\nFor all of these tasks, RoboTAP automatically extracts the\nindividual motions, the relevant points for each motion, goal\nlocations for those points, and a generates a plan that can\nbe tracked by a low-level visual servoing primitive. While\ncurrently less general than fully end-to-end approaches, our\napproach can be trained on as few as 4-6 demonstrations\nper task, does not require action-supervision, and effortlessly\ngeneralizes across clutter and object pose randomization. Our\nmain contributions are as follows: (1) RoboTAP, a formu-\nlation of the multi-task manipulation problem in terms of\ndense-tracking, (2) Concrete implementations of RoboTAP\u2019s\nwhat, where, and how problems in the form of visual-\n1\narXiv:2308.15975v2  [cs.RO]  31 Aug 2023\nDemos\nTAPIR\nExtracting Active Point Set 1\nMotion Plan\nVisual Servoing\nVisual Servoing\nDemo Tracks\nCurrent Frame\nNearest Track\nTarget Frame\nDesired Motion\nExtracting Active Point Set 2\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nTime\nClose Gripper\nMove Up\nOpen Gripper\nTime\nTime\nD\nf\nqt\nDetections\nTAPIR\ngt\nFig. 2: Here we describe the core of the RoboTAP approach.

We then form a motion plan that can be executed on the robot, which\nconsists of stages of servoing to imitate visual motions, and basic motor primitives like closing and opening the gripper. Visual servoing\nis accomplished by detecting points q using TAPIR, finding the nearest demonstration which shows how those points should move, and\nfinding a single nearby frame that can be used as a motion target. The displacement between the points in the target frame (g) and the\nonline TAPIR detections is used as a motion target for classical visual servoing, yielding surprisingly complex and robust behavior.\nsaliency, temporal-alignment, and visual-servoing, (3) A new\ndense-tracking dataset with ground-truth human annotations\ntailored for our tasks and evaluated on the TAP-Vid Bench-\nmark focusing on Real-World Robotics Manipulation, and\n(4) Empirical results that characterize the success and failure\nmodes of RoboTAP on a range of manipulation tasks involv-\ning precise multi-body rearrangement, deformable objects,\nand irreversible-actions.\nII. RELATED WORK\nA. Vision-based Manipulation\n1) End-to-End Approaches: Regressing actions directly\nfrom images in an end-to-end manner is one established\nway for utilising visual inputs [3], [6], [7], [8], [9]. While\nin theory this allows for creation of arbitrarily complex\npolicies in practice this often requires a large amount of data\nincluding the target objects or classes.\n2) Pose-based Approaches: Another approach is to define\na policy on top of object poses regressed from images [10],\n[11], [12], [13], [14]. Pose is a strong signal for object state,\nbut is not well-defined for deformable or symmetric objects,\nand is difficult and time-consuming to supervise accurately\nand generally.\n3) Keypoint-based Approaches: Within RoboTAP, point\nlocations are detected from an RGB camera and converted to\narm motions in a visual feedback-loop, which is commonly\nreferred to as image-based visual servoing [15], [16]. Ex-\nisting autonomous visual servoing techniques typically rely\non hand-designed target detectors or confidence maps [17],\n[18], [19], which lack the generality required for few-shot\nimitation in arbitrary scenes.\nA closely-related approach is to define a small sparse set of\nkeypoints for a given object class [20], [21], [22] Choosing a\ndifferent point set however requires a retraining of the whole\nmodel. Methods such as TACK [23] or DON [24] generalize\nthis approach by learning an embedding for any point on\nan object in the image. This still falls short of representing\narbitrary points in scenes, and must be retrained in order to\nadapt to new class of objects.\nAs a result, keypoint-based approaches can perform very\nwell in specific settings, but act as an extra barrier to deploy\nrobotic systems on novel tasks. In this work, we aim to\ndemonstrate that recent advances on point tracking models\nsuch as [25] are good enough to act as a sole perception\nmodel for both motion tracking, cross scene correspondence\nand segmentation. This system doesn\u2019t use any depth infor-\nmation during training or evaluation and uses only a single\nnon-calibrated gripper mounted camera.\nLastly, the \u201cwhat\u201d / \u201cwhere\u201d factorization we explore in\nthis paper has several precedents in the robotics literature,\ne.g. [26], and has been more broadly explored in neuro-\nscience [27], [28].\nB. Point Tracking in Computer Vision\nWithin computer vision there have been approaches which\nextract points from any scene without any pretraining.\nFor example non-learned descriptors such as SIFT [29] or\nORB [30] require no class specific training, but they produce\nmany spurious matches which cannot be easily filtered on\nnon-rigid scenes, making them difficult to use as a target for\nvisual servoing. Recently there have been several advances\nin high-performance long-horizon visual tracking such as\nOmniMotion [31], PIPs [32], TAP-Net [1] or TAPIR [25],\nwhich provide high-quality tracks with very few outliers.\nThis means that Euclidean distance in point space, with no\noutlier removal, can serve as a reliable metric of whether two\nspatial configurations are similar, or whether two motions\nare similar. While all of these approaches are made to run\n2\non whole videos, we note that the setup (especially TAPIR)\ncan be modified to run online on a frame-by-frame basis,\nmaking it suitable for robotics applications.\nIII. APPROACH\nRecall that we seek to define a single system that can\nbe instructed to solve as many manipulation tasks as pos-\nsible without requiring any per-task engineering or techni-\ncal knowledge. To enable this instruction mechanism we\nbegin by considering the class of semi-parametric policies\n\u03c0(st, D), in which the policy has access to a \u201ccontext\ndataset\u201d D at test-time, e.g. demonstration trajectories. Con-\nceptually, RoboTAP can be viewed as a factorization of \u03c0 in\nwhich we extract a sufficient statistic for the current action\nfrom the full \u201ccontext\u201d D, according to the current state st,\ni.e. \u03c0(st, D) = \u03c0(TAP(st, qt), gt) = \u03c0(pt, ot, gt), where\nqt \u2208 Rn,c represents the c-dimensional descriptors for n\npoints (a.k.a. the query), gt \u2208 Zn,2 represents the target\nlocations for those points in the image. Given a query qt and\nan image in the current state st, TAP represents a dense point-\ntracker that outputs detections pt \u2208 Zn,2 and an occlusion\nprobability ot for each point.\nThe quantities qt and gt represent the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d,\nrespectively, of the current action, and are extracted from D\nvia a procedure gt, qt = f(st, D), described in Section III-A.\nFor simplicity, in this paper we don\u2019t implement f as a per-\nstep operation, but rather as a one-time plan that summarizes\nthe objectives common across D. An overview of this\nprocedure and it\u2019s connection to the control is illustrated in\nFig. 2. The high-level outline for our overall solution is as\nfollows:\n1) Sample large number of query points from D and track\nthose points across all trajectories using TAPIR.\n2) Segment the trajectories into phases, and discover a\ndescriptor-set qt for each phase which characterize the\nmotion.\n3) Pack the sequence of qt and corresponding trajectory\nslices (representing the goals) into a \u201cmotion-plan\u201d.\n4) Execute this motion plan using the low-level controller\nin a sequential fashion, advancing stages based on a\nsimple final-error criterion.\nA. Temporal and Spatial Decomposition\nThe first core step of the RoboTAP approach, is to extract\nimportant motion from demonstrations in order to construct\na motion-plan. This seen in Fig. 2. In order to accomplish\nthis we assume that our demonstrations D are comprised of\nan unknown but equal number of phases, each involving the\nmotion of a particular set of points. Although the set of points\ncould be learned end-to-end (e.g. by behavioral cloning), this\nwould require more data than we have available. Therefore,\nwe instead explicitly identify motion segments that are\nshared across demos, and then discover a set of points for\neach that are moving consistently, which we term active\npoints.\nTemporal alignment has been well-studied [33], [34], [35],\nbut for simplicity, we rely on the assumption that our tasks\nFig. 3: Active point selection. We exploit the funneling-nature of\ncontrol to identify relevant points based on their variance, and\nremove the gripper by filtering static points. Remaining points\nare used to vote on the motion cluster, which we use to sample\n128 points throughout the motion-segment to serve as the salient\nfeatures for that step of the motion plan.\nconsist of grasping and releasing objects or making contacts,\nwhich means that temporal segments are trivially obtained by\nthresholding gripper actions and forces.\nActive Point Selection. Given a temporal segment, iden-\ntifying active-points involves asking what points qt \u2208 Q\nthe low-level controller \u03c0l should move in order to generate\nmotions that accomplish a similar result as observed in the\nsegment. Our criteria for point selection are illustrated in\nFig. 3. The key insight is that the active points may begin\nat diverse locations, but for goal-directed behavior they tend\nto end up the same place across all demos at the end of\nthe relevant segment. Therefore, we select points which end\nat the same place at the end of the demo segment (relative\nto the camera), and remove points which don\u2019t move at all\nacross the segment (i.e., the gripper and any already grasped\nobject).\nWhile this alone can identify many of the desired active\npoints, not all of the useful points are guaranteed to be visible\nat the end of each motion segment, either due to occlusion\nor simply failures by the detector; furthermore, there may be\ninconsistencies due to imprecise demos that make it difficult\nto set thresholds on whether a point is moving. Therefore,\nwe recast the active point discovery as votes on which object\n(or object-part) is being manipulated, which we substantially\nimproves robustness. However, this means we must perform\nunsupervised object discovery from the demos, a classically\ndifficult problem which we find is rendered surprisingly\nreliable given robust dense point tracks. We then combine\nthese heuristics with a voting-based scheme, whereby we\nselect the clusters which contains the most points which are\n\u201cactive\u201d according to the first two criteria.\nClustering. There are numerous approaches to object-\nbased clustering, ranging from semantic segmentation [36] to\ngenerative modeling [37], but for simplicity, we use motion\nestimates extracted from TAPIR, since this means we do not\nrequire semantic labels, and we find it can work reliably from\na remarkably small amount of data.\nWe first randomly select many points from the image, and\ntrack all of them using our online TAPIR model. We assume\nthat all of the points belong to one of several approximately-\nrigid objects in the scene, and can therefore be explained\nby a set of 3D motions followed by reprojection (note that\nwe model camera motion as a motion of all objects in the\nscene). Let pi,t be the TAPIR-predicted location for point i\nat time t in the demos (for simplicity, t indexes both time\nand demos, i.e., we concatenate all demos into a single long\nsequence), and vi,t \u2208 {0, 1} be a thresholded version of\n3\nocclusion probability ot: 1 if ot is less than 0.5, 0 otherwise.\nWe assume there are K different rigid objects in the scene.\nThe model infers a 3D location Pi,k \u2208 R3 for i\u2019th point in\nthe k\u2019th object (initially, the model does not know which\nobject the point should be assigned to). It also proposes a\nrigid 3D transformation for each object at each time At,k \u2208\nSE(3), represented as a 3 \u00d7 4 matrix. We then optimize the\ntransforms and the 3D points to minimize the simple squared\nerror of the reprojection R(x) = [x[0]/x[2], x[1]/x[2]] as\nfollows:\narg min\nA,P\nmin\nk\nX\ni,t\nvi,t\u2225R(At,kPi,k) \u2212 pi,t\u22252\nThe simplicity of this equation is somewhat remarkable,\nas it is essentially standard bundle adjustment [38], but\nwe do not model outliers. Outlier rejection is a critical\ncomponent of prior structure-from-motion methods as they\nare typically based on descriptors like SIFT [39], which have\na high proportion of extreme errors. This severely limits their\nability to do multi-object reconstruction, as it is difficult\nto distinguish between small objects and outliers. TAPIR,\nhowever, has powerful occlusion estimation, meaning that\nall predicted points should be modeled. We informally tried\napproaches which used robust losses such as L1, Huber, and\neven truncated L2 losses with appropriate RANSAC-style\nproposals, but did not find formulations that performed on\npar with simple L2.\nWe parameterize both Pi,k and At,k using neural networks,\nwhich aim to capture the inductive biases that points nearby\nin 2D space, and also frames nearby in time, should have\nsimilar 3D configurations. Specifically, Pi,k = P (pi, oi|\u03b81)k,\nwhere \u03b81 parameterizes the neural network P which outputs\na k \u00d7 3 matrix, and At,k = A(\u03d5t|\u03b82)k, where \u03d5t is a\ntemporally-smooth learned descriptor for frame t, \u03b82 is\na neural network parameter for neural network A which\noutputs a k \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 tensor representing rigid transforms.\nThe above optimization is, unsurprisingly, somewhat dif-\nficult due to local minima; we find that these local minima\ncan be avoided by splitting clusters during optimization. For\ndetails on this and the neural networks, see Appendix Sec-\ntion II. Given a clustering, we select clusters by voting. Every\npreviously selected active point casts a vote for a cluster and\nwe merge clusters with largest number of votes. To further\navoid selecting points from the gripper we compute average\npoint movement for each cluster and remove clusters where\nthis movement is below a threshold. Finally, we discard any\npoints are not visible in the current phase, or which are not\nnearby other points on most frames, as these are likely to be\ntracking failures. For details, see Appendix Section V.\nB. Robot controller\nThe foundation of RoboTAP is a general-purpose con-\ntroller that can align points in a scene. To define this\ncontroller we consider a set of image points, with current\nlocations pt, and goal locations gt as derived above. The\nobjective of this controller is to move the gripper with\nvelocity vt (4 DoF: \u02d9x, \u02d9y, \u02d9z, \u02d9rz) such that the points will\nmove towards the desired location, while also being robust\nto noise and occlusions. To do this we need an estimate\nof how the points will move if the gripper moves in a\ncertain direction. For a wrist-camera this is simply the image\nJacobian dp\nd\u03be \u2208 Rn,2,4, where n denotes the number of points\nand \u03be contains the relevant dimensions (x, y, z, rz) of the\ngripper pose.\nIn theory, to obtain the correct image Jacobian we need to\nconsider the camera intrinsics and the extrinsics. However\nin our case we only require that it points in the correct\ndirection, and we then tune the rotation and translation gains\nof the controller for stability. To demonstrate this in all of\nour experiments we assume vertical field of view of 90\u25e6 and\nunit depth which leads the following image Jacobian for a\nsingle point:\nJ =\n\u0014\n1\n0\n\u2212u\n\u2212v\n0\n1\n\u2212v\nu\n\u0015\n(1)\nWhere the columns correspond to end-effector-frame linear\nand angular velocity of the gripper, and u, v are normalized\nimage coordinates such that vertical dimension is within [-\n1, 1]. Using this Jacobian, we then compute the gripper\nmotion that would by minimize the L2 error between the\ncurrent detections p and goal locations g under the linear\napproximation, following standard visual servoing. Because\nthe error is typically dominated by translation, applying the\nJacobian naively would result in the controller explaining\ntranslation via rotation and scaling; therefore, we use Gram-\nSchmidt orthogonalization [40] to eliminate the average\ntranslation before computing the Jacobian with respect to\nrotation and scaling.\nIf TAPIR provided perfect point locations, the above algo-\nrithm would work effectively without modification. However,\nfor precise tasks, TAPIR errors can still lead to two specific\nfailure modes. First, outliers from TAPIR can overwhelm\nthe controller when true errors are low. To deal with this, we\nleverage TAPIR\u2019s uncertainty outputs, and only use points\nwhich are confidently predicted for both the current frame\nand in the demo. Second, noisy detections introduce a statis-\ntical bias towards minimizing the spread of the point cloud\nin order to reduce unexplainable errors. This presents itself\nas a bias towards moving the camera further back. Therefore,\nwe modify the controller by leveraging the relation between\nthe problems of aligning p to g and the inverse alignment of\ng to p. This changes the z-axis update to perform variance\nmatching rather than directly optimizing the visual servoing\nobjective. To further reduce variance near the end of each\nservoing stage (when the demo locations are assumed to\nagree), we use an average of point locations across all demos\nas a target to further reduce variance, while we use a single\ndemo as a target earlier in each stage. Further details can be\nfound in Appendix Section VI.\nC. Online TAPIR\nIn the previous section we describe how to use TAPIR\npoint tracks inside a robot controller. However one of the\nhurdles we must overcome to do this, is to find a way\n4\nto run it online, inside a control-loop. The original TAP-\nVid was proposed as an offline benchmark, in that methods\nmay process the entire video before computing a trajectory,\nand top-perfoming methods like TAPIR [25], PIPs [32],\nOmniMotion [31], and TAP-Net [1] all process a full video\nat once. Therefore, a key contribution is to reformulate the\ntop-performing models (i.e. TAPIR) to work online without\nharming its accuracy.\nWe first note that TAPIR can be divided into three stages:\n1) extracting query features for query points, 2) initializing\nthe track via global search on every frame, and 3) refinement\nwith a temporal ConvNet. To address the first stage, we note\nthat the query features depend only on the query frame, so it\nis straightforward to extract query feature computation into\na separate function. For the second stage, the initialization\nfor a given frame depends only on the query features and\nthe features for that frame, meaning the initialization can be\ncomputed one frame at a time.\nThe third stage, however, is a refinement, which is not\nstraightforward to run online: at its core is a convolutional\nneural network which runs across time. The solution is to\nobserve that this can be converted into an online model by\nreplacing the temporal convolutions with similarly-shaped\ncausal convolutions [41], such that the activation of each\nunit at time t depends only on the activations from times\n\u2264 t. At training time, this is a trivial architectural change.\nWhen running on the robot, however, it means we must\nkeep a history of input activations for each layer with a\ntemporal receptive field. Any activations that a unit at time t\ndepends on are read from the history. Once the forward pass\nis complete, a new history is constructed and returned which\ncan be used at the next timestep. In practice, we find that the\nperformance impact of moving to a causal model is minimal\n(see tables III and IV). See Appendix III for details.\nIV. EVALUATION\nIn this section, we aim to demonstrate the strengths and\nlimitations of our system and its components. The capabili-\nties of RoboTAP overall are directly linked to the precision\nof TAPIR itself on the domain we are interested in. Therefore\nto evaluate and advance its abilities we introduce a new point\ntracking dataset focused on robotics settings. Further, since\nthe TAPIR model we are using has been modified to be run\nin an online way, we evaluate the effect of these changes on\nit\u2019s performance on the TAP-Vid benchmarks.\nFollowing this, we show evaluations of the full RoboTAP\nsystem. In particular, we show that RoboTAP can tackle\ncomplex tasks with many stages from just a handful of de-\nmos, can deal with start and end poses significantly different\nfrom those in the demos, can both place objects precisely\nand follow trajectories precisely, has strong invariance to\ndistractors in the workspace, and can deal with non-rigid\nobjects.\nWe choose a variety of tasks involving placement, in-\nsertion, and gluing, that are representative of real-world\nassembly problems. While all of the demonstrations were\ngathered without occlusions and distractor objects we explore\nDataset\nTAP-Vid-RGB-Stacking\nRoboTAP\n# Videos\n50\n265\n# Points\n30\n43.7\n# Frames\n250\n271.9\n# Human Clicks\nN/A\n8.5\nSim/Real\nSim\nReal\nEval resolution\n256x256\n256x256\nTABLE I: Statistics of RoboTAP dataset.

Finally we also study the servoing precision using\na calibrated real-world setup. Further experimental ablations\nof the controller in simulation can be found in Appendix\nSection I.\nA. Robotics TAP-Vid Dataset addition\nThe ability to track and relate points in the scene is what\nenables RoboTAP to generalize to novel scenes and poses.\nThese capabilities are directly powered by the performance\nof these models and therefore a core part of our contribution\nis enabling advances in these areas. To enable better research\nwe introduce an addition to the previous TAP-Vid benchmark\nin a form of a new dataset which focuses specifically on\nrobotic manipulation.\nSpecifically we collect 265 real world robotics manipula-\ntion videos. The data source mainly comes from teleoperated\nepisdoes in the public DeepMind robotics videos [42], [21].\nWe annotate each video with human groundtruth point trajec-\ntories, following the same instruction in the previous TAP-\nVid dataset [1], with 5 points per object and 5 points on the\nbackground. To make the evaluation closer to the realistic\nmanipulation setup, we sampled the videos from different\ncamera viewpoints (i.e. basket view, wrist view) where basket\nview is static and wrist view moves along with the gripper.\nTable I shows the overall statistics of the newly collected\nRoboTAP dataset. Comparing to the existing simulated TAP-\nVid-RGB-Stacking dataset, it contains more videos, more\npoints, and more frames on average, but more promisingly\nreal world. Table II shows more details of the annotated\npoints in different camera setups. Besides the general evalu-\nation, we further provide labels of whether camera is static\nor moving and a point is static or moving.\n5\nTAP-Vid-Kinetics\nTAP-Vid-DAVIS\nTAP-Vid-RGB-Stacking\nRoboTAP\nTAP-Net\n39.5\n36.0\n50.1\n45.1\nPIPs\n26.1\n42.5\n-\n29.5\nTAPIR\n52.4\n57.0\n64.9\n59.6\nOnline TAPIR\n51.5\n56.7\n67.7\n59.1\nTABLE III: Comparison of Online TAPIR to prior results on TAP-\nVid and RoboTAP datasets under query first Average Jaccard (AJ)\nmetrics, which considers both position and occlusion accuracy.

Results in Table III show that our online\nTAPIR achieves accuracy similar to the state-of-the-art of-\nfline TAPIR model, significantly outperforming TAP-Net and\nPIPs. On RoboTAP, it achieves an average jaccard (AJ) of\n59.1, nearly matching offline TAPIR\u2019s 59.6. Table IV shows\nmore detailed evaluation on different dataset splits.\nC. Robot Setup\nTo run our system in the real world we use the Franka\nPanda Emika robot in the impedance control mode, 2f-\n85 Robotiq gripper and FT 300 Force Torque Sensor. The\ncontrol signal was sent at 10Hz and interpreted as velocity of\nthe impedance controller setpoint. To gather images we used\na Basler Dart daA1280-54ucm at a resolution of 640x480\npixels mounted to the wrist using a custom 3D printed\nadapter. Our camera images were undistorted, but we did\nnot use intrinsic or extrinsic calibration of our camera.\nTo collect the demonstrations we move the robot via the\nFranka Panda cuff. RoboTAP is compatible with kinesthetic\nteaching because, unlike much other imitation learning work,\nit does not require access to actions beyond gripper open-\ning/closing state. During teaching we record robot positions,\nforces from a wrist force-torque sensor, and wrist camera\nvideos at 10Hz. We used a keyboard to open and close the\ngripper. It takes about 30 seconds to record a demonstration\nfor a pick and place task, 1 minute for the gluing task and\nup to 2 minutes for the 4-object insertion task.\nWe used a total of 9 tasks described in Table V, some\nof which are illustrated in Figure 4 - see our website for\nfull list of task videos. When running this controller we\nhave noticed a very repeatable pattern of cases where the\ncontroller succeeds and where it fails. For a majority of\nthe tasks we have attempted we observe robust performance\nprovided the algorithm\u2019s basic assumptions are met, yet we\nhave seen it fail in a few specific cases. Therefore we believe\nthat a simple success metric would not appropriately capture\nits behaviour and we aim to provide other avenues to express\nits performance.\nApple on Jello\nStart\nEnd\nJuggling balls stack\nGlue blocks\nFour object puzzle\nStart\nEnd\nTapir to robot toy\nLego Block Stack\nFig. 4: Examples of successfully solved real robot tasks.

Overall we observed 4\nfactors which caused failures: (1) Occlusions cause failures\nwhen the active points cannot be seen. This most notably\nhappens due to the gripper occlusions. (2) Scale changes\ncause failures when the gripper moves too far away and none\nof the currently-tracked features can be matched because the\nobjects are too small. (3) Distractors can cause failures when\nthe scene contains a similar object to the essential object such\n6\nFig. 5: Examples of states where the system failed to reach\nthe desired final state. Tasks which require sub 5mm precision\ncannot always be reliably solved (e.g. shape-matching). In addition,\nour use of a purely-visual control paradigm makes it difficult to\nsolve tasks that require reasoning over visual and force modalities\nsimultaneously (e.g. lego part-mating). Lastly, our controller is\nunable to reason about the validity of a motion-plan at runtime,\nwhich can lead to failures if certain motions are invalid (e.g. the\nbunny\u2019s ear is covering the jello too much to place the apple).\nas a red apple vs a tomato. (4) Collisions can happen with\nthe gripper or currently-held object as the controller does\nnot have a way to perceive clutter. However in absence of\nthese cases, we observed robustness to novel arrangements\nand even dynamic changes of the scene while the controller\nis being executed.\nD. Real world precision\nPrevious experiments demonstrated the qualitative behav-\nior of several long-horizon manipulation tasks. We conclude\nby evaluating the precision of our visual-servoing controller\nquantitatively. For this we take inspiration from position-\nrepeatability analyses performed on commercial industrial\nrobot arms. We gathered 6 demonstrations of putting a\ntextured white plastic gear on a square of graph paper, which\nallowed us to precisely compute of the placement error using\nOpenCV [43]. For the demonstrations we used 3 different\nconfigurations of the white gear and the target pattern. The\ntarget had a cross in the middle which allowed us to take\npictures of the centre of the gear and automatically extract\nits location.\nThen we ran the controller 30 times for each of 3 novel\ngoal locations. First goal location, Near, was positioned\nin the middle between the locations which were used for\ndemonstrations. The second one, Far, was on the opposite\nside of our workspace and the last one, Rotated, was on\nthe side but rotated by 90 degrees. Notably the second 2\ngoal positions are outside of the distribution provided during\ndemonstrations.\nWe can see the results of this evaluation in Fig. 6. Based\non the figure we can see that the error of the controller is\ncomparable to the error seen across the demonstrations. The\nerror along the plate, orthogonal to the grasp direction is\non the order of several milimeters. Based on these results\nwe can see that the controller in its current form would not\nbe suitable for sub-mm insertion tasks, however we have\nnot attempted to extensively tune it for this purpose. Further\ninformation about these experiments is provided in Appendix\nSection IV.\nFig. 6: Evaluation of the precision of controller. We designed\na pick-and-place task which allowed us to easily measure exact\nfinal location of the placed object relative to movable target. We\ngathered 6 demonstrations and ran RoboTAP 30 times for 3 different\nlocations of the placement target. The figure shows the locations of\nwhere the object was placed in each of the trials. When the goal\nwas located between the demonstrated position the distribution is\nsimilar to what was observed during the demonstrations (< 4mm).\nWe can see a slight decrease in precision when the target was moved\nto a novel location or rotated by 90 degrees (< 1cm).\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe presented RoboTAP, a manipulation system that can\nsolve novel visuomotor tasks from just a few minutes of robot\ninteraction. RoboTAP does not require any task-specific\ntraining or neural-network fine-tuning. Thanks largely to\nthe generality of TAP, we found that adding new tasks\n(including tuning hyper-parameters) took minutes, which is\norders of magnitude faster than any manipulation system\nwe are familiar with. We believe that this capability could\nbe useful for large-scale autonomous data-gathering, and\nperhaps as a solution real-world tasks in its own right.\nRoboTAP is most useful in scenarios where quick teaching\nof visuomotor skills is required, and where it is easy to\ndemonstrate the desired behavior a few times.\nThere are several important limitations of RoboTAP. First,\nthe low-level controller is purely visual, which precludes\ncomplex motion planning or force-control behavior. Second,\nwe currently compute the motion plan once and execute it\nwithout re-planning, which could fail if individual behaviors\nfail or if the environment changes unexpectedly.\nSeveral of the ideas in RoboTAP, e.g. explicit spatial\nrepresentation and short-horizon visuo-motor control, could\nalso be applicable in more general settings. In the future we\nwould like to explore whether RoboTAP models and insights\ncan be combined with larger-scale end-to-end models to\nincrease their efficiency and interpretability.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to thank Tom Roth\u00a8orl, Akhil Raju, and\nMarlon Gwira for their help with our robot setup and Dilara\nGokay for dataset infrastructure support.

Within this environment we\nplace a camera and an object from the Google Scanned\nObjects dataset [45]. We create a dataset of 480 trajecto-\nries with 20 different objects and 24 motions per object.\n8\nSimulation success rate\nFull RoboTAP\n83.8 +- 1.7\n6 DOF\n37.5 +- 2.2\nSingle directional jacobian\n61.3 +- 2.2\nNo orthogonalisation\n74.6 +- 2.0\nTABLE VI: Ablation of controller parameters in simulation.\nThere trajectories contain changes up to 5x in scale and\nmovements across the whole image. The task is for the\ncontroller to follow a demonstrated trajectory using the point\ntracks provided by TAPIR. To make the environment more\nvisually complex we add a spatially fixed background to\neach trajectory which is randomly sampled from the real\ndemonstration data collected for our tasks. This acts as a\ndistraction for the TAPIR model and increases the observed\nnoise to better match the real trajectories.\nOur visual servoing controller needs a set of points q to\nbe tracked. In simulation we construct this by generating an\nextra video with a different background to the demonstration\nand randomly sample points across different timesteps of the\ndemonstration. To evaluate our controller we sample a yet\ndifferent background and match the initial relative camera\nand object pose to the one seen in the demonstration. Then\nat each timestep the controller outputs an action which is\na desired pose difference to the next state. We run this for\neach of the 480 trajectories and evaluate in how many of\nthe videos the controller converges to the final state of the\ntrajectory. To evaluate visual servoing with 6 degrees of\nfreedom (DOF) we used the jacobian described in (3) instead\nof (1). We note that these visual servoing tasks are very\nchallenging as they contain large changes of scale and the\ntracked object presents only a very small part of the scene.\nThe results of these experiments are presented in Table VI.\nFirst we can see that this approach can work when all 6\ndegrees of freedom are being used for servoing, however it\nis significantly less stable. If we do not evaluate the jacobian\nat both demonstration and current location, we also observe\na significant drop in performance due to the statistical bias.\nWe see similar but smaller performance drop when we do\nnot orthogonalise the jacobian, i.e. if we replace J\u22a5 with J.\nBoth of these issues are especially notable in cases which\ncontain large changes in scale.\nAPPENDIX II\nCLUSTERING IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nRecall that we aim to find, for each object, optimal 3D\ncanonical locations Pi,k \u2208 R3 for each point, and optimal\nobject pose At,k \u2208 SE(3) for each frame, which minimizes\nthe error of the reprojection R(x) = [x[0]/x[2], x[1]/x[2]]\nwith respect to predicted points pi,t:\nL(A, P) = min\nk\nX\ni,t\nvi,t\u2225R(At,kPi,k) \u2212 pi,t\u22252\nWhere i indexes points, t indexes video frames, and k\nindexes the clusters. We parameterize P and A with simple\nneural networks. This problem is somewhat underconstrained\nand difficult to optimize, so we use neural networks to inject\nsome priors.\nObject transforms We enforce temporal smoothness by\nmaking A a function of a smooth latent variable V\n\u2208\nRT \u00d7128. The smoothness of V is enforced by making it\na function of a parameter v \u2208 RT \u00d764 convolved with a\ndepthwise convolutional filter of shape 128 \u00d7 64 which is\nlearned as a part of the optimization. Vt is then projected to\n128 dimensions and passed to a small residual neural network\n(2 residual blocks with a bottleneck of 64 units) before a final\nneural network projection to the parameters of k 3D rigid\ntransforms, such that A(Vt) can be reshaped to k \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4.\nWe constrain A to be an in-plane rotation (i.e., the first three\ncolumns of last row are set to [0, 0, 1], make the first two rows\northogonal to this, make the first two rows orthomormal by\nprojection, and multiply by the determinant; thus the neural\nnetwork output has shape k \u2217 7: 4 values parameterizing\nrotation and 3 parameterizing position). Note that because\nneural network parameters are shared across clusters, the\nnetwork is likely to output similar transformations for all\nclusters when this doesn\u2019t increase the loss, making it easier\nfor points to move between clusters.\n3D point locations We enforce that points that are spa-\ntially close and have similar motion should have similar\n3D locations. Thus, we make Pi,k a function of pi. Un-\nfortunately, pi can have undefined values where points are\nnot visible, which means directly applying an MLP can\nmisbehave. Therefore, we define a bank of centroid values\nC \u2208 R384\u00d7T \u00d72 where 384 is the is a fixed constant number\nof centroids; these are initialized by sampling from the data\nitself. To encode a given trajectory pi, we compute the\ndistance d between pi and all centroids for frames where pi is\nvisible, normalized by the number of visible frames. We then\napply a Gaussian kernel by computing exp(\u2212d2), creating\nan encoding for each point of size 384. This encoding is then\nprojected to 64 dimensions, before being passed to a small\nresidual neural network (2 residual blocks with a bottleneck\nof 32) before being projected to k \u00d7 3, i.e., a 3D position\nhypothesis for every cluster. Note that because the parameters\nare shared for all clusters, the network is likely to output\nsimilar points for all clusters when this doesn\u2019t increase the\nloss, makign it easier for points to move between clusters.\nSplitting and merging Directly optimizing the reprojec-\ntion error tends to result in the algorithm getting stuck in\nlocal minima: motion is dominated by camera motion, and so\na single cluster which explains camera motion best will tend\nto get all points assigned to it, leaving no learning signal for\nthe remaining clusters. While it is tempting to use some kind\nof soft assignment, we found that such schemes typically\nresulted in the remaining clusters explaining just a small\nnumber of outliers, rather than discovering independently-\nmoving objects all at once. However, one surprisingly effec-\ntive approach (of which we are not aware of prior work) is\nto recursively split clusters whenever doing so substantially\nimproves the loss. To accomplish this, note that only the final\nlinear projection layers of our two neural networks depends\non the number of clusters k: the parameters for these layers\n9\ncan be written as a matrix w \u2208 Rk\u00d7c for some numner of\nchannels c. For each such weight matrix, we create two new\nweight matrices w\u2032 \u2208 Rk\u00d7c and w\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Rk\u00d7c, where the k\u2019th\nrow parameterizes a new clustering where the k\u2019th row of\nw has been split into two different clusters, which we term\n\u2018forks\u2019 of the original weight matrix. We compute the loss\nunder every possible split, and optimize for the split with\nthe minimum loss. Mathematically, define wK \u2208 R(k+1)\u00d7c\nto be a new matrix where the K-th row of w has been\nremoved, and the K-th rows of both w\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032 have been\nappended. We can use wK to compute two new 3D locations\nand 3D transformations AK and P K. Then we minimize the\nfollowing loss:\narg min\n\u03b8\nmin\nK L(AK(\u03b8), P K(\u03b8))\nHere, \u03b8 parameterizes the neural networks that output A\nand P, and includes w and both of the \u2018fork\u2019 variables\nw\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032. After a few hundred optimization steps, we\nreplace w with wK, and create new \u2018forks\u2018 of this matrix\n(initializing the forks with small perturbations of wK). We\nbegin with k = 1 and repeating recursive forking process\nuntil the desired number of objects is reached. We find that\nthis recursive splitting can result in over-segmentation, but\nthis can be somewhat mitigated by deleting clusters after\noptimization is finished. This is an analogous process: we\noptimize for the minimum loss after clusters are deleted.\nOur full implementation of this algorithm is available in our\npublic project repository.\nAPPENDIX III\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF ONLINE TAPIR\nIn this section, we provide implementation details for our\ncausal version of the TAPIR model. Our full implementation\ncan be found in our project Github.\nRecall that the temporal point refinement of the TAPIR\nmodel uses a depthwise convolutional module, where the\nquery point features, the x and y positions, occlusion and\nuncertainty estimates, and score maps for each frame are all\nconcatenated into a single sequence, and the convolutional\nmodel outputs an update for the position and occlusion.\nThe depthwise convolutional model replaces every depth-\nwise layer in the original model with a causal depthwise\nconvolution; therefore, the resulting model has the same\nnumber of parameters as the original TAPIR model, with\nall hidden layers having the same shape. There is no change\nto the training procedure, as we can concatenate all frames\nin the training sequences and run the convolutions across the\nfull sequence.\nAt test time, however, we must preserve a \u201ccausal context\u201d\nacross frames, which contains the activations computed for\nthe last frame that are required as input for the depthwise\nconvolution layers. Because the temporal receptive field of\nthe depthwise is 3, we must keep 2 frames of context for\nevery depthwise convolution. The refinement steps use 4 PIPs\niterations, each of which has 12 blocks, and each block has\n2 temporal depthwise conv layers with 512 and 2048 units\nNear\nInitial demonstration states\nInitial demonstration states\nFar\nRotated\nFig. 7: Examples of initial states from the precision placement\nexperiments.

Note that none of the\nevaluation states have been seen within the demonstrations. During\nthe Near setting we placed the target to a location between the\ndemonstrated locations. For the Far setting we used an initial state\nwhere the gear was on the other side of the target.

Therefore, the temporal context is 2 \u00d7 (512 +\n2048)\u00d712\u00d74 = 245K floating-point values for every point.\nAPPENDIX IV\nPRECISION EXPERIMENTS - FURTHER INFORMATION\nIn this section we present further information about the\nprecision experiments presented in Section IV-D. In Fig. 7 we\nshow images of initial states from our experiments. During\nthe 30 evaluations we did not move the target and always\nmanually returned the gear to a similar position within\nseveral centimeters. In Table VII we present the means and\nspreads of points along the x and y directions from our\nexperiments. These are the same results as in Fig. 6 to present\nan alternative quantitative analysis.\n10\nAPPENDIX V\nEXTRACTING MOTION FROM DEMONSTRATIONS\nIn section Section III-A we described how we split the\nmotion into sections and how we extract active points. Since\nthis is a part where we did task specific parameter selection\nwe would like to describe the process in greater detail here.\nAssuming we already have clustering, this process has 2\nmain stages: 1) temporal segmentation and alignment or\ndemonstrations 2) active point extraction.\nTemporal segmentation. The core idea is that we noticed\nthat for all the tasks we considered we can segment the\nmotion based on the gripper actuation or external forces.\nWe use these signals to construct a motion plan which is\nthen executed by the controllers. To extract gripper actua-\ntion events we consider the gripper openness positions and\nnote points where the position crosses a selected threshold.\nThese time points are beginnings or ends of grasps. When\nmanipulating small objects it was helpful to not open the\ngripper fully as that gave a higher grasp precision to the\ndemonstrator and therefore we used a different threshold in\neach task. This threshold is noted in Table V as Gripper open.\nThe second type of an event we consider is a beginning or an\nend of a force phase. To extract these we look at the vertical\nforce measured by our force torque sensor and first smoothen\nthe signal with a kernel with variance of 2.5 seconds. Then\nwe define a local force maximum by computing flocal\u2212max\nwithin a 5s windows. We then construct a normalized force\nsignal as fnorm = f/max(fthreshold, flocal\u2212max) where\nfthreshold is noted in Table V as Max force. This ensures\nthat our normalized forces are between 0 and 1, but the\nnormalized forces stay small when no forces are being\napplied. We define a force event when the normalized force\ncrosses a threshold of 0.5 as these will be points where we\neither engage in force-feedback behaviour or disengage from\nit.\nWhen executing a force feedback behaviour we modify the\nvisual servoing controller. Instead of following the vertical\naction from the visual servoing we apply a P controller on\nvertical component to keep a force of 1.5N. We also disallow\nadvancing to the next frame unless the current force is within\n\u00b10.3N of this target.\nIn order to compare information across demonstrations we\nresample each segment of each demonstration into a fixed\nlenght block. However resampling linearly across time leads\nto oversampling of static phases. Therefore we resample the\ntrajectories along the distance traveled. This is done using a\nper-timestep motion metric tm = ||vend\u2212effector||2/0.04 +\n||vfingers||2/0.5 where vend\u2212effector is the linear velocity\nof the end-effector in m/s and vfingers captures the opening\nand closing of the gripper. tm is then used to linearly\ninterpolation within each motion segment to align all of the\ndemonstrations.\nThe final step is to extract constant motion primitives\nwhich are needed because, after a grasp or a release of an\nobject the gripper occludes large potion of the workspace. To\ndo this we look at the standard deviation across the demon-\nstrations at every time point vt\nstd, the minimum vertical\nvelocity vt\nmin and the maximum velocity reached during the\ndemonstration vmax. If at any timepoint all demonstrations\nreliably contain the motion (i.e. vt\nmin > 0.5vt\nstd) and the\nmotion is significant (i.e. vt\nmin > 0.03vmax) we consider\nthis a reliable signal that all demonstration contain the same\nmotion. Active point extraction. As discussed in Section III-\nA we extract active points in several steps: We do a first pass\nin selecting active point candidates, cluster points and use\npoints to vote for a clusters, and clean up the points within\nthe selected clusters.\nTo do a first pass in selecting active points we use 3\nseemingly trivial, but powerful heuristics: a) Reject points\nwhich are not currently visible b) Reject points which do\nnot move c) Reject points which end up at different image\nlocations. For a) we look at the final frame of the motion\nand define a threshold called Saliency in Table V for the\nfraction of demonstrations where the point must be visible\nin. Then for b) we reject points whose overall motion during\nthe segment is less than a Is gripper fraction of the 90th\nquantile across the points. For c) we compute the variance\nof the final point location across demonstrations and require\nthat it is less than a threshold. We called the threshold for\nthe square root of the variance the Cross-demo variance.\nAfter this procedure we have a set of points which belong\nthe important object for a given segment. In many cases these\npoints would be good enough to use as active points for the\nfinal visual servoing. One of the limitations of TAPIR, as\nmost point tracking models, however is its ability to track\npoints across very large changes of scale which is something\nwe observe in our tasks as we use the gripper camera.\nPoints chosen above are descriptive of the final frame which\nis often up-close and therefore those features don\u2019t tend\nto be detected when the gripper is further out or when it\nis looking at the object from a different direction. To get\npoints representative of the whole motion we leverage the\nclustering. We first clean the clusters by removing points\nwhich could not be assigned to any cluster with an error\nof less than Average Error removal. Then we count how\nmany of the points belong to which cluster and normalize\nthe counts by dividing by the largest number of votes. Then\nwe merge all clusters which have score over a given threshold\ncalled Multi cluster. At this point we have a bank of relevant\npoints which will work across all scales.\nLastly this clustering leads to a potentially large number\nof points. To remove them we compute an average visibility\nscore across the whole motion and remove all points below\nthis score. This threshold is called 2nd pass saliency in\nTable V. This last filtering step removes outliers leftover from\nthe clustering process. To remove these we for each point\ncomputed the distance to the closest K point and averaged\nthis across the frames where it was visible. Then we removed\npoints where this was above a given threshold Dist. If at this\npoint we had more than 128 points, we randomly selected\nwhich ones are going to be used during execution of the\nmotion.\nWe believe that many of the hyper-parameters in Table V\n11\nGripper\nOpen\nMax\nForce\nSaliency\nIs\nGripper\nCross\nDemo\nVar.\nAvg Err\nRemoval\nMulti\nCluster\n2nd\nPass\nSaliency\nClosest\nK\nDist.\nApple On Jello\n0.04\n8\n0.5\n0.5\n30\n0.01\n0.5\n0.2\n4\n20\nJuggling Stack\n0.13\n10\n0.4\n0.3\n20\n0.0005\n0.8\n0.5\n5\n30\nFour object puzzle\n0.41\n40\n0.5\n0.5\n30\n0.01\n0.5\n0.7\n10\n20\nLego Stack\n0.15\n40\n0.5\n0.5\n30\n0.01\n0.5\n0.9\n3\n30\nTapir to robot V2\n0.15\n40\n0.5\n0.5\n30\n0.01\n0.5\n0.9\n3\n30\nGluing\n0.13\n10\n0.4\n0.3\n20\n0.0005\n0.8\n0.5\n5\n30\nGear on grid\n0.41\n40\n0.5\n0.5\n30\n0.01\n0.5\n0.7\n10\n20\nPass Butter\n0.15\n10\n0.8\n0.1\n60\n0.01\n0.5\n0.5\n5\n30\nTABLE VIII: Summary of all of the parameters tuned while processing the demonstrations.\ncould be easily automatically extracted without the need to be\nmanually specified by a human. However, in our case it was\nvery easy to select and tune these by looking at visualisations\nfrom the intermediate steps of the process. For most of them\nwe selected the value by looking at the distribution of the\nvariable it was thresholding. Therefore we have not attempted\nto automate this process further at this stage.\nAPPENDIX VI\nCONTROLLER IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nGiven a set of target points gt and corresponding detected\npoints pt, we aim to compute an action that would minimize\nthe error, using a linear approximation of the function\nmapping actions to changes in pt. We then take a step in\nthat direction and repeat. This process can be summarized\nas:\nvvs = argminvt||Jptvt \u2212 (gt \u2212 pt)||2\n(2)\nHowever, in practice this approximation has two main issues:\nthe optimal set of detected and target points to use for\nservoing may change depending on the current state, and\nthe Jacobian of the error may not be a good approximation\nof the desired motion. These could likely be rectified by\nlearning, but for simplicity, in this paper we use simple\nheuristics to resolve them analytically in ways that work for\n(approximately) rigid objects.\nPoint selection: TAPIR provides a visibility score vis\nbetween 0 and 1. We use this score by summing the visibility\nacross the demonstration frame which is being followed and\nthe current frame and only using the 30% most visible or\nconfidently-detected points.\nTarget selection: Recall that motion plans consist of a\nseries of temporal segments of the demonstrations, along\nwith a set of active points for each segment. Our low-\nlevel motion planner requires a single servoing target for\nevery point at every timestep, but we have a full set of\ntrajectories for each demonstration. How can we summarize\nthis to a single point? In order to have precision, we would\nlike to average across trajectories to reduce noise from the\npoint tracking. However, simple averaging across the whole\ntrajectory may not be sensible, since the initial configurations\nmay be diverse. For many tasks (e.g. gluing), we must\nfollow the entire trajectory. Thus, we take a hybrid approach:\nat the beginning of each temporal segment, we choose a\nsingle demonstration (the nearest one) and follow the full\ntrajectory until the final frame of the demos, at which point\nwe average across all available demos. This is a reliable\nprocedure because we assume that our placement tasks form\na \u2018funnel\u2019\u2013i.e., the demonstrations may start off with objects\nin diverse states, but the object of interest always converges\nto the same location.\nSpecifically, we split every visual servoing motion into\n2 phases: 1) demonstration follow phase and 2) the final\nphase. Phase (1) allows us to repeat the broad motion while\nphase (2) allows us to reach a consistent final state. At\nthe beginning of every visual servoing phase we pick a\ndemonstration to follow: we measure the Euclidean distance\nbetween the visible points on initial frame of every demon-\nstration and the currently-detected locations, and pick the\none with the lowest distance. We servo toward the initial\nlocation until the 30th percentile of per-point errors falls\nbelow a threshold, at which point we advance to the next\nframe of the same demonstration. We alternately servo when\nthe error is above the threshold and advance when the error\nis below the threshold, until we reach the final frame of\nthe demonstration, at which point the final phase begins.\nFor the final phase (2), we want to achieve a consistency\nof behaviour no matter which demonstration was followed.\nWe use the (visibility-weighted) average of points across\ndemonstration as the target g. To move on to the next\ntimestep in phase 1 we use a threshold of 12 pixels and\nphase 2, we use a threshold of 2 pixels, but we multiply this\nthreshold by 1.01 for every timestep we spend in this phase,\nthus gradually increasing the termination threshold to ensure\nthat the temporal segment is guaranteed to terminate even\nin the presence of noise. Computing the Jacobian Given a\nset of target points, we must next compute a Jacobian with\nrespect to the detected points, which will allow us to compute\nan action which will minimize the error. However, when the\ndistance between the target points and the detected points\nis large, the linear approximation implied by the Jacobian\nmay be poor: in particular, the model may use rotation and\nz-motion to explain errors due to in-plane translation. For\nexample, when the object is far from the image center, the\nrotation and translation are highly correlated in the motions\nthey will induce in the target points. Therefore, we use Gram-\nSchmidt to orthogonalize the last 4 columns of the Jacobian\n12\nrelative to the first two. Recall that our Jacobian can be\nwritten as:\nJ =\n\u00141\n0\n\u2212u\n\u2212uv\n1 + u2\n\u2212v\n0\n1\n\u2212v\n\u22121 \u2212 u2\nuv\nu\n\u0015\n(3)\nWhere u is the x-position of a detected point, and v is the\ny-position. Thus, the first two columns correspond to x and\ny translation, the third is z translation, fourth and fifth are x\nand y tilt, and sixth is rotation. x and y translation dominates\nthe loss, and the other columns are highly correlated with\nthe first two. Columns 4 and 5 describing tilt are only\nused in the simulated ablations described in Section I. We\northogonalize the last 4 columns of the Jacobian with respect\nto the first two, after evaluating it on our points using the\nGram\u2013Schmidt Orthogonalisation method and denote it J\u22a5\np .\nThis leads to the final controller equation for the visual\nservoing command vvs:\nvvs =1\n2(argminvg||J\u22a5\np vg \u2212 (g \u2212 p)||2\n\u2212 argminvg||J\u22a5\ng vg \u2212 (p \u2212 g)||2)\n(4)\nStatistical Bias and the Jacobian As described above,\na key problem with the Jacobian is statistical bias in which\nnoise in the (2D) detections increases the estimate of action\ncomponents which decrease the scale of the points (e.g. -z for\na wrist-camera). We therefore modify the Jacobian so that it\nperforms variance scaling for z-translation. Specifically, We\nflip the role of p and g in the solver, i.e. we compute both\nthe standard Jacobian update vvs, and also the inverse Jaco-\nbian update \u00afvvs which treats the demonstration points g as\ncontrollable, and moves them toward the current states. The\ncontroller update is then (vvs \u2212 \u00afvvs)/2. It is straightforward\nto show that this does not modify the vx and vy component\nof the motion, as the motion and inverse in-plane rotation are\nidentical. Therefore, in this section, we focus on showing that\nthe update for the vz component becomes variance matching.\nTo show this, we focus on only the Jacobian with respect to\nthe z component (recall that x and y are orthogonalized out\nfrom this). Thus, we have:\nargminvz||Jzvz \u2212 (g \u2212 p)||2\nThe z-component of the Jacobian Jz\np is simply [\u2212up \u2212\nvp]\u22a4, the \u2212x and \u2212y components of p. The solution to this\nequation is Jz\u22121\np\n\u00b7 (p \u2212 g), where Jz\u22121\np\nis the pseudinverse\nof Jz\np, which can be computed analytically as \u2212p/||p||2.\nIn the presence of noise, we have that p = (\u02c6p + \u03f5p),\nwhere \u02c6p = [uc, vc]\u22a4 is the true point locations, and \u03f5p\nis the noise with variance \u03c32\np introduced by the detector\nin the current detections, which we assume is zero mean\nand uncorrelated with any other variables; we can define an\nanalogous decomposition for the target points. Substituting\nand taking the expectation with respect to the noise yields\nan update of the form:\nvz = \u2212\u02c6p \u2212 \u03f5p\n||\u02c6p + \u03f5p||2 (\u02c6g + \u03f5g \u2212 \u02c6p \u2212 \u03f5p)\nBecause the \u03f5 values are uncorrelated with other terms, if\nwe consider the expected value, this simplifies to:\nE[vz] = ||\u02c6p||2 \u2212 \u02c6p \u00b7 \u02c6g + \u03c32\np\n||\u02c6p||2 + \u03c32p\n= 1 \u2212\n\u02c6p \u00b7 \u02c6g\n||\u02c6p||2 + \u03c32p\nFrom this equation we can see that even if we reached\nthe goal state, i.e. \u02c6p = \u02c6g, our controller would be outputting\na vz > 0. Specifically it would be outputting an action of\n1/(1 + g2/\u03c32\np) coming from the zoom-out bias. Computing\nthe analogous term from a Jacobian in the other direction\nand subtracting it yields:\nE[vz \u2212 \u00afvz] = \u2212\n\u02c6p \u00b7 \u02c6g\n||\u02c6p||2 + \u03c32p\n+\n\u02c6g \u00b7 \u02c6p\n||\u02c6g||2 + \u03c32g\n= \u02c6p \u00b7 \u02c6g\n\u0012\n1\n||g||2 \u2212\n1\n||p||2\n\u0013\nWe can see that this expression is zero when ||g||2 = ||p||2\nwhich can be interpreted as matching variances.\nAPPENDIX VII\nROBOTAP DATASET\nVideo sources The videos come from DeepMind Robotics\nreal-world data collections from Manipulation Task Suite\n(MTS). To make the data source diverse, we randomly sam-\nple a subset from the publicly released Sketchy dataset [42],\nS3K dataset [21] and NIST dataset [3]. The Sketchy data\nare sensed and recorded with 3 cage cameras and 3 wrist\ncameras (wide angle and depth), focusing on 3 variable-\nshape rigid objects coloured red, green and blue (rgb dataset)\nand 3 deformable objects: a soft ball, a rope and a cloth\n(deformable dataset). The S3K data contains a collection\nof rigid and nonrigid objects: e.g. shoes, toys. The NIST\ndata contains gears and board that is widely known as the\nNIST challenge in Robotic Grasping and Manipulation [46].\nFigure 9 visualize the examples of RoboTAP videos and the\nannotated point tracks.\nAnnotation interface Figure 8 illustrates the annotation\ninterface. The point annotation interface presented to annota-\ntors is based on [47]. The interface loads and visualizes video\nin the visualization panel. Buttons in the video play panel\nallow annotators to navigate frames during annotation. The\ninformation panel provides basic information, e.g., the cur-\nrent and total number of frames. The annotation buttons (NEW\nand SUBMIT) allow annotators to add new point tracks or\nsubmit the labels if finished. The label info panel shows each\nannotated point track and the associated \u2018tag\u2019 string. The\ncursor is cross shaped which allows annotators to localize\nmore precisely. Annotation process For acquisition of high-\nquality and diverse point tracks dataset, we encourage the\nannotators to choose any point that can be tracked reliably.\nEach track begins with an ENTER point, continues with\nMOVE points, and finishes when the annotator sets it as\nan EXIT point. Annotators can restart the track after an\nocclusion by adding another ENTER point and continuing.\nAn optical flow based track assist algorithm is also utilized\n13\nBeginning Frame\nMiddle Frame\nEnd Frame\nFig. 8: Illustration of annotation interface and process for RoboTAP dataset. The interface consists of three components:\nvisualization panel, buttons, and information panels.

(2020), designed with the aim to accelerate progress in\ndata-driven weather modeling. WeatherBench 2 consists of an open-source evaluation frame-\nwork, publicly available training, ground truth and baseline data as well as a continuously up-\ndated website with the latest metrics and state-of-the-art models: https://sites.research.\ngoogle/weatherbench. This paper describes the design principles of the evaluation framework\nand presents results for current state-of-the-art physical and data-driven weather models. The\nmetrics are based on established practices for evaluating weather forecasts at leading operational\nweather centers. We define a set of headline scores to provide an overview of model performance.\nIn addition, we also discuss caveats in the current evaluation setup and challenges for the future\nof data-driven weather forecasting.\n1\nIntroduction\nGlobal, medium-range (1\u201314 day) numerical weather prediction (NWP) is a key component of mod-\nern weather forecasting (Bauer et al., 2015). It has huge economic and societal impact as many\nsignificant weather events occur on this time scale, such as heat waves, tropical- and extra-tropical\ncyclones, droughts or heavy precipitation leading to flooding. In addition to providing valuable fore-\ncasts, global NWP models serve a range of additional purposes: they provide boundary conditions\nfor regional, high-resolution models; they are used to create (re-)analyses; and they serve researchers\nas tools to better understand the atmosphere. Current NWP models are based on discretizations\nof the governing equations describing fluid flow and thermodynamics (Kalnay, 2002). As of 2023,\nmost global models have a horizontal grid spacing of less than 25 km. The European Center for\n1\narXiv:2308.15560v2  [physics.ao-ph]  26 Jan 2024\nMedium-range Weather Forecasting\u2019s (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model, for ex-\nample, has a resolution of 0.1\u25e6, around 9km, in its high-resolution (HRES) and, since the 2023\nupgrade, also in its ensemble (ENS) configuration. This still leaves many important physical pro-\ncesses unresolved, for example cloud physics and radiation. The effect of these processes on the\nresolved scales has to be approximated in so-called parameterizations (Stensrud, 2007). Another\nimportant aspect of NWP is estimating the current state of the atmosphere, required to initialize\nmodel forecasts. This is done using data assimilation algorithms that combine model forecasts\nand observations to produce an analysis, a best guess of the current state of the atmosphere. The\nlast few decades have seen a steady improvement in global NWP driven by increased computing\npower, which in turn allowed higher resolution and more ensemble members, better observations\nand data assimilation, and better representations of the physical processes (Magnusson and K\u00a8all\u00b4en,\n2013). Despite the impressive progress in physical global NWP, however, there is still ample room\nfor improvement. Recent studies estimate that the intrinsic limit of predictability of mid-latitude\nweather is at around 15 days, while the current practical limit of predictability is at around 10\ndays. Around half of the remaining 5 days of potential skill stem from model improvements, the\nother half from better initial conditions (Zhang et al., 2019; Selz et al., 2022).\nIn the last few years, spurred by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in domains like computer\nvision and natural language processing (LeCun et al., 2015), researchers have been exploring the\npossibility of using modern machine learning algorithms for weather forecasting.\nA number of\ninitial attempts at building data-driven medium-range NWP models (Dueben and Bauer, 2018;\nScher, 2018; Weyn et al., 2019) led to the creation of WeatherBench (Rasp et al., 2020, from here\non called WB1), a benchmark for global, medium-range weather prediction. The goal of WB1\nwas to provide a common, reproducible framework for evaluating global, data-driven forecasts and\ncompare them against traditional baselines. Benchmarks have been hugely influential in the ML\ncommunity to measure progress on specific tasks. Famous examples include ImageNet (Deng et al.,\n2009) which helped kick-start the AI revolution in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2017) and the\nGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018) in language. After its release, WB1 was used by a number of\nstudies to explore different machine learning approaches. Weyn et al. (2020) used a cubed sphere\nprojection in combination with a UNet architecture to iteratively predict the atmospheric state\nat 2\u25e6 resolution. Rasp and Thuerey (2021) used a deep Resnet architecture to directly predict\nfields up to 5 days ahead at a 5.625\u25e6 resolution.\nClare et al. (2021) similarly used a Resnet\nbut added a probabilistic output layer.\nA probabilistic extension to WeatherBench along with\nseveral ML baselines was published as well (Garg et al., 2022). An up-to-date leaderboard of WB1\nmetrics can be found at https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench.\nThese studies, all\nusing comparatively coarse resolution, did not come close to the skill of current physical NWP\nmodels.\nIn early 2022, improvements in data-driven weather models considerably picked up in pace.\nKeisler (2022) used a graph neural network (GNN; Pfaff et al. (2021)) iteratively with a time step\nof 6 hours at a resolution of 1\u25e6 and 13 vertical levels. On deterministic upper-level verification\nmetrics the model achieves skill comparable to some operational NWP models.\nPathak et al.\n(2022) used a modified vision transformer (Guibas et al., 2022), called FourCastNet, for prediction\nat a very high resolution of 0.25\u25e6 and a 6 hour time step. An updated version using spherical\nfourier neural operators was also published recently (Bonev et al., 2023). Pangu-Weather (Bi et al.,\n2023), based on a different variation of vision transformers at equally high-resolution, obtained\ndeterministic metrics that outperform HRES. Shortly after, GraphCast (Lam et al., 2023) built\nupon the work of Keisler (2022) and scaled a GNN to 0.25\u25e6 horizontal resolution.\nOn many\ndeterministic metrics as well as extreme weather indicators, GraphCast also outperforms HRES.\nIn 2023, another vision transformer variant called FengWu (Chen et al., 2023a) was published\n2\nwith state-of-the-art, deterministic scores for longer forecast lead times. Similarly, the FuXi model\n(Chen et al., 2023c) achieves deterministic scores similar to the IFS ensemble mean up to 15 days.\nSwinRDM (Chen et al., 2023b) combines a recurrent network with a diffusion model to provide\ngranular predictions at 0.25\u25e6 resolution.\nClimaX (Nguyen et al., 2023a) and Stormer (Nguyen\net al., 2023b) are examples of models achieving competitive skill at lower resolution. NeuralGCM\n(Kochkov et al., 2023) represents the first hybrid ML-physics model that achieves state-of-the-art\nscores, including an ensemble version.\nIn light of the rapid advances of the field, the need for an updated benchmark that allows for\neasy comparison between different approaches becomes apparent. In comparison to WB1, WB2\nsupports much higher-resolution data and evaluation and adds additional metrics. This paper will\nlay out the design principles for WB2, followed by a detailed description of the evaluation metrics\nand datasets, as well as results on the headline scores. We will also discuss several issues with WB2\nand potential future directions for this benchmark dataset.\n2\nDesign decisions for WeatherBench 2\nA general challenge of designing benchmarks for weather prediction is that weather is a very high-\ndimensional and multi-faceted problem (Dueben et al., 2022). Every use case has slightly different\nrequirements and quality measures.\nTake as an example model development at ECMWF, one\nof the world\u2019s leading operational NWP centers. ECMWF tracks a large number of metrics to\nevaluate their model performance. The headline scores (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/\nquality-our-forecasts) and scorecard (https://sites.ecmwf.int/ifs/scorecards/) serve as\nconcise summaries but are only the tip of the iceberg. In addition to quantitative scores, feedback\nis also be collected from in-house experts and end users, each of them interested in specific aspects\nof the forecast system. Recognizing the limitations of particular scores is even more important to\nkeep in mind when evaluating ML-based approaches, which often violate standard assumptions in\ntraditional NWP. All this is to say that no single metric or set of metrics will ever be able to fully\ndescribe what a \u201dgood\u201d forecast is. WB2 does not attempt to do so. Similarly to ECMWF, WB2\ndefines a set of headline scores (described in Section 5) and evaluation tools that aim to capture\nkey aspects of medium-range weather forecasting but are not meant to be exhaustive. Therefore,\nWB2 should not be seen as a traditional benchmark challenge with a single leaderboard but rather\nas a tool to compare different approaches on different aspects.\nIn its details, the WB2 evaluation protocol sticks closely to the forecast verification used by\nthe WMO (, WMO) and operational weather centers like ECMWF. WB2 does not try to reinvent\nthese standard verification protocols but rather aims to make them accessible to the community\ninterested in AI models. This is done by providing open-source ground truth data and evaluation\ncode, as well as by providing a single place to compare different traditional and AI approaches.\nWhile WB2 defines the targets to be evaluated, it leaves the remaining modeling setup open\n(e.g., which inputs or model resolution to use). In this sense, WB2 is a benchmark for entire forecast\nsystems, i.e., the combination of choice of input data, training setup and model architecture, rather\nthan focusing on the models specifically. While this makes it harder to compare different model\narchitectures, we believe that designing the non-model part of the forecast system components is\nequally as important and different approaches should be encouraged to accelerate progress in the\nfield, as long as overfitting is avoided. However, it is important to recognize that different design\nchoices can lead to advantages and disadvantages. One important choice is which input dataset\nto use for starting (\u201dinitializing\u201d) forecasts. Currently, most models use re-analysis datasets, in\nparticular ERA5, which would not be available in an operational setup and provide an potential\n3\nadvantage over operational initial conditions (more details in Section 6.2).\nAnother priority of WB2 is to emphasize the importance of probabilistic prediction. Weather\nforecasting is an inherently uncertain endeavor because of chaotic error growth (Lorenz, 1963; Zhang\net al., 2007), implying that even with perfect models and near perfect initial conditions there is\na range of possible outcomes. In operational NWP, this fact led to the development of ensemble\nprediction systems in the 1990s (Palmer et al., 1993; Toth and Kalnay, 1993). In an ensemble,\na number of forecasts (typically 10\u2013100) are run with perturbed initial conditions and sometimes\nmodel physics, providing different potential realizations of future weather. One of the most im-\nportant advantages of ensemble forecasts is that they can provide reliable information for decision\nmaking. For example, they can be used to estimate the probability of extreme events that a single,\ndeterministic forecast might miss. Tropical cyclone track forecasts (often displayed as plumes) are\na prime example of this. The data-driven models discussed above, with the exception of a per-\nturbed ensemble experiment in the Pangu-Weather paper, all only provide deterministic forecasts.\nSimilarly to the evolution of dynamical forecast systems, data-driven forecasts will need to become\nprobabilistic to provide users with the most actionable information.\nThis could be possible as\na post-processing step on top of deterministic models, for example, through ensemble dressing or\nlagged forecasts. However, the success of NWP ensembles hints at the advantages of designing prob-\nabilistic forecast systems from the ground up, especially for capturing spatio-temporal correlations.\nFor this reason, WB2 will include operational probabilistic verification metrics and baselines from\nthe start. In data-driven modeling, there are several ways to create probabilistic forecasts, from\npredicting parameterized marginal distributions directly (Andrychowicz et al., 2023) to producing\ngenerative roll-outs. Some aspects of how to evaluate these forecasts are discussed in Section 6.3.\nFinally, WB2 will provide a dynamic, open-source framework that can evolve with the needs\nof the ML-weather community. All data and code needed for evaluation are publicly available and\ncan be extended to accommodate more detailed evaluation in the future, driven either by us or\ncommunity contributors.\n3\nData, baselines and data-driven models\nMost of the datasets below are available in on Google Cloud Storage in Zarr format. For the lat-\nest details on these datasets, please visit https://weatherbench2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\ndata-guide.html.\nTable 1 provides a summary of key facts for each of the datasets/models,\nincluding the training resources.\n3.1\nERA5\nThe ERA5 dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020) is used as the ground truth dataset for WB2 and as\nthe training dataset for many of the data-driven approaches described above. ERA5 is a reanalysis\ndataset based on a 0.25\u25e6 (roughly 30 km) version of ECWMF\u2019s HRES model operational in 2016\n(cycle 42r1) and ECMWF\u2019s 4D-Var data assimilation which uses a wide range of direct and re-\nmote sensing observations. ERA5 uses 12 hour assimilation windows from 21\u201309 and 09-21 UTC,\nduring which a \u201cprior\u201d forecast initialized from the previous assimilation window is combined with\nobservations to produce an analysis, a \u201cbest guess\u201d of the Earth system state during this window.\nERA5 data is available at hourly resolution from 1940 to present at the Copernicus Climate Data\nStore (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). A subset of the ERA5 dataset is available on the\ncloud in the cloud-optimized Zarr format.\nNote that using ERA5 for evaluation and training has some caveats.

Especially for precipitation, ERA5 sometimes shows large differences to\nrain gauge measurements Lavers et al. (2022). We still include precipitation evaluation based on\nERA5 here but advise caution when interpreting those results (for more details, see discussion in\nSection 6.1). Second, ERA5 uses a longer assimilation window compared to operational forecasts\n(see below). This helps to better constrain the guess of the atmospheric state but would delay\nthe initialization of forecasts in a real time setting. At 00 UTC, for example, ERA5\u2019s assimilation\nwindow goes 9 hours \u201dinto the future\u201d. Operationally, the data assimilation window only extend 3\nhours ahead from the forecast initialization time. One could use 06/18UTC initialization to level\nthe playing field a little bit more. This issue has been extensively discussed in the supplement of\n(Lam et al., 2023, Fig. 10) who found that forecasts initialized from ERA5 at 00/12 UTC indeed\nperform better than those initialized at 06/18UTC, when the ERA5 analysis also only has a 3\nhour look-ahead. The difference in RMSE for GraphCast was up to 5%. However, the 06/18UTC\noperational analysis are also produced using fewer DA cycles compared to the 00/12UTC analysis.\nFor WB2, we chose to evaluate forecasts initialized at 00/12UTC. The main reasons for this are\nthat some key baselines (IFS ENS and the ERA5 forecasts) were only available for 00/12 UTC\ninitializations and that this has been the standard for most other ML-based evaluations so far,\nwhich allows us to directly include some of them here.\n3.1.1\nERA5 forecasts\nFor research purposes, ECMWF ran a set of 10 day hindcasts initialized from ERA5 states at\n00/12UTC with the same IFS model version used to create ERA5. These forecast are available\nin the MARS archive (MARS parameters: class=ea, stream=oper, expver=11, type=fc).\nHere\nwe downloaded the variables required to compute the headline scores for the year 2020 (with the\nexception of total precipitation which was not available). Note that data until 5 days lead time is\navailable at 6h intervals, and 12h intervals from 5 to 10 days lead time.\n5\nThe ERA5 forecasts provide a like-for-like baseline for an AI model initialized from and eval-\nuated against ERA5. They benefit from the same, longer assimilation window compared to the\noperational initial conditions and are run at 0.25\u25e6 resolution\u2014similar to many modern AI methods.\nBecause of the lower resolution and older model relative to the operational IFS HRES in 2020, one\nwould expect the operational model to be more skillful by itself.\n3.2\nClimatology\nThe climatology is used for computing certain skill scores, in particular the anomaly correlation\ncoefficient (ACC) and the stable equitable error in probability space (SEEPS), and as a baseline\nforecast. Here we follow Jung and Leutbecher (2008) and compute the climatology c as a function\nof the day of year (doy) and the time of day (tod) by taking the mean of ERA5 data from 1990\nto 2019 (inclusive) for each grid point. A sliding window of 61 days is used around each doy-tod\ncombination with weights linearly decaying to zero from the center. This removes sample noise and\nmakes the climatology smoother in time, at the expense of reducing the seasonal amplitude.\nA probabilistic version of the climatology is created by taking each of the 30 years from 1990\nto 2019 as an ensemble member, this time without smoothing.\nNote that a 30 year climatology will include some climate drift, especially for temperature.\nHere, we do not apply any measure to correct for this.\n3.3\nIFS HRES\nOur main baseline comes from operational forecasts created with ECMWF\u2019s IFS model, which,\nmeasured by standard verification metrics, are typically regarded as the best global, medium-range\nweather forecasts. Since 2016, the IFS in its HRES configuration has been run at 0.1\u25e6 (roughly\n9 km) horizontal resolution. The operational model is updated regularly, approximately once to\ntwice a year, which means that the exact model configuration might change during the evalua-\ntion period. Usually, updates are associated with slight improvements in most evaluation metrics,\nthough not all. However, changes in the IFS are typically gradual. A comprehensive model de-\nscription can be found at https://www.ecmwf.int/en/publications/ifs-documentation.\nA\nschedule of model upgrades can be found at https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FCST/\nChanges+to+the+forecasting+system. Initial conditions are created every 6 hours using an en-\nsemble 4D-Var system using information from the previous assimilation cycle\u2019s forecast as well as\nobservations in a +/- 3 hour window. After accounting for the time to perform data assimilation\nand forward simulation, forecasts have a latency of 5.75 to 7 hours from the time at which they\nare initialized (https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/DAC/Dissemination+schedule). Fore-\ncasts started at 00 and 12 UTC are run up to a lead time of 10 days. 06 and 18 UTC initializations\nare run for 3.75 days.\nRunning a 15 day TCO1279 (\u223c 9km) simulation in the setup used for the operational ensemble\n(using the new high-resolution setup) takes around 52 minutes with I/O and 46 minutes without\nI/O on 64 128-core (AMD EPYC Rome) nodes.\n3.3.1\nIFS HRES Initial Conditions\nFor evaluating IFS forecasts, we use operational analyses as ground truth rather than ERA5. This\nis because evaluating IFS forecasts against ERA5 would result in a non-zero error at time step\nt = 0 and therefore would put the IFS at an unfair disadvantage compared to data-driven models\ntrained on and evaluated against ERA5. The difference is most pronounced during the early lead\ntimes and becomes smaller at longer lead times. See Fig. S2 for a comparison. Note that for some\n6\nvariables like 2m temperature differences persist even for longer lead times. This is likely due to a\nbias between the HRES analysis and ERA5.\nHere, as in Lam et al. (2023) we use the initial conditions, i.e. the IFS HRES forecasts at\nt=0 as our \u201canalysis\u201d. Note that this dataset is slightly different from the official analysis product\non the ECMWF archive. This is because for the official analysis product an additional surface\ndata assimilation step is taken. For ECMWF\u2019s internal evaluation, the official analysis product is\nused. However, the qualitative differences in the evaluation scores resulting from this discrepancy\nshould be small except for the first time steps after initializations and are mostly limited to surface\ntemperature. For very short lead times, results should not be over-interpreted anyway. Note that\nfor precipitation accumulations we use ERA5 as a precipitation ground truth for all models.\n3.4\nIFS ENS\nECMWF also runs an ensemble version (ENS) of IFS, at 0.2\u25e6 resolution until to the 2023 upgrade\n(including the 2020 evaluation period used here), now at 0.1\u25e6 resolution. The ensemble consists\nof a control run and 50 perturbed members. The initial conditions of the perturbed members are\ncreated by running an ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) in which observation errors, model er-\nrors and boundary condition errors are represented by perturbations (https://confluence.ecmwf.\nint/display/FUG/Section+5.1.1+Ensemble+of+Data+Assimilations+-+EDA). The difference of\neach of the EDA analyses to the mean is then used as a perturbation to the HRES initial condi-\ntions. In addition, to more accurately represent forecast uncertainty, singular vector perturbations\nare added (https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Section+5.1.2+Singular+Vectors+\n-+SV) to the initial conditions. Model uncertainties during the forecasts are represented by stochas-\ntically perturbed parameterization tendencies (Buizza et al., 1999, SPPT), in which spatially and\ntemporally correlated perturbations are added to the model physics tendencies. Ensemble forecasts\nare initialized at 00 and 12 UTC and run out to 15 days.\n3.4.1\nIFS ENS Mean\nWe also include the IFS ENS mean as a baseline, which we computed by simply averaging over the\n50 members. The ensemble mean does not represent a realistic forecast but often performs very\nwell on deterministic metrics.\n3.5\nKeisler (2022) Graph Neural Network\nKeisler (2022) used a graph neural network architecture (Pfaff et al., 2021) with an encoder that\nmaps the original 1\u25e6 latitude-longitude grid to an icosahedron grid, on which several rounds of\nmessage-passing computations are performed, before decoding back into latitude-longitude space.\nThe model takes as input the atmospheric states at t = 0 and t = \u22126h and predicts the state at\nt = 6h. To forecast longer time horizons, the model\u2019s outputs are fed back as inputs autoregressively.\nThe state consists of 6 three-dimensional variables at 13 pressure levels. ERA5 data is used for\ntraining with 1991, 2004 and 2017 used for validation, 2012, 2016 and 2020 for testing and the\nremaining years from 1979 to 2020 for training. During training the model is trained to minimize\nthe cumulative error of up to 12 time steps (3 days).\n3.6\nPangu-Weather\nPangu-Weather (Bi et al., 2023) is a data-driven weather model based on a transformer architecture.\nIt predicts the state of the atmosphere at t = t + \u2206t based on the current state. The state is\n7\ndescribed by 5 upper-air variables and 4 surface variables on a 0.25\u25e6 horizontal grid (same as\nERA5) with 13 vertical levels for the upper-air variables. The model is trained using ERA5 data\nfrom 1979 to 2017 (incl.)\nwith 2019 for validation and 2018, 2020 and 2021 for testing.\nHere\nwe evaluate forecasts for 2020. Four different model versions are trained for different prediction\ntime steps \u2206t = {1h, 3h, 6h, 24h}. To create forecasts for an arbitrary lead time model predictions\nare chained together autoregressively from the four different lead time models, using the fewest\nnumber of steps. For example, to create a 31h forecast, a 24h forecast is followed by a 6h and\nthen a 1h forecast. The maximum lead time for the data used here is 7 days. Inference code for\nPangu-Weather can be found at https://github.com/198808xc/Pangu-Weather.\n3.6.1\nPangu-Weather (operational)\nThe scorecard also contains a version of Pangu-Weather initialized with the operational IFS HRES\ninitial conditions (see above).\n3.7\nGraphCast\nGraphCast (Lam et al., 2023) is similar in structure to Keisler (2022) but uses a higher resolution\ninput with 6 upper-level variables on a 0.25\u25e6 horizontal grid with 37 vertical levels, and additionally\n5 surface variables. Further, the processor operates on a multi-mesh, i.e. a nested structure of\ndifferent resolution meshes. The model is also trained autoregressively up to a time horizon of 12\ntime steps (3 days). Here, we evaluate a version of GraphCast that was trained on ERA5 data\nfrom 1979 to 2019 (incl.). See Suppl. 5.1 of Lam et al. (2023) for details. Code for GraphCast can\nbe found at https://github.com/deepmind/graphcast.\n3.7.1\nGraphCast (operational)\nThe scorecard also contains a version of GraphCast fine-tuned and initialized with the operational\nIFS HRES initial conditions (see above). For mode detail, refer to https://github.com/deepmind/\ngraphcast.\n3.8\nFuXi\nFuXi (Chen et al., 2023c) is an autoregressive cascaded ML weather forecast system based on a\ntransformer architecture with specific models trained for short (0-5 days), medium (5-10 days)\nand long-range (10-15 days) prediction. The model is trained on ERA5 data at 0.25\u25e6 horizontal\nresolution with 13 vertical levels.\n3.9\nSphericalCNN\nSpherical Convolutional Neural Networks (Esteves et al., 2023) generalize Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) to functions on the sphere, by using spherical convolutions as the main linear op-\neration. The weather model produces output at a resolution 1.4\u25e6 zonally and 0.7\u25e6 meridionally, with\n7 vertical levels. Code can be found at https://github.com/google-research/spherical-cnn.\n3.10\nNeuralGCM\nNeural General Circulation Models (NeuralGCM) (Kochkov et al., 2023) combine a differential dy-\nnamical core with learned physics. NeuralGCM has been trained in a high-resolution deterministic\n8\nSymbol\nRange\nDescription\nf\nForecast\no\nGround Truth\nc\nClimatology\nt\n1, ..., T\nVerification time\nl\n1, ..., L\nLead time\ni\n1, ..., I\nLatitude index\nj\n1, ..., J\nLongitude index\nm\n1, ..., M\nEnsemble member index\nTable 2: Notation used in the evaluation metrics.\nversion at 0.7\u25e6 and a lower-resolution ensemble version at 1.4\u25e6. Both model versions use 32 vertical\nlevels.\n4\nEvaluation protocol and metrics\nThe WB2 evaluation protocol sticks closely to the forecast verification used by the WMO (, WMO)\nand operational weather centers like ECMWF. Table 4 provides a list of the notation used.\n4.1\nEvaluation time period and initialization times\nIn its initial version WB2 uses the year 2020. 2020 was chosen a) because it provides a compromise\nbetween recency and leaving several more recent years for independent testing if modeling groups\ndesire to do so; and b) because data was available for many of the AI baseline models. One year is\nalso a robust enough sample size for most of the metrics defined below. It should be noted, however,\nthat for metrics focused on extreme events, e.g. hurricanes or heat waves, larger sample sizes are\nrequired. As WB2 is updated, evaluation can be changed to a more recent or longer period.\nIt is also worth discussing that many of the AI models were trained with data only up to 2018.\nAnalysis for the GraphCast model shows that training with more recent data is advantageous (Lam\net al., 2023). Further, the IFS model is continuously improved, suggesting that more recent forecasts\nare better. However, it is difficult comparing absolute values, since there are natural fluctuation\nyear-by-year. In Fig. S1 we show scores for 2018 (also available on the website). The relative\ndifferences in scores between 2018 and 2020 are small, implying that, at least for the metrics shown\nhere, the results are robust.\nEvaluation is done on all 00 and 12 UTC initialization times for 2020, i.e. from January 1\n2020 00UTC to December 31 12 UTC. This means that some forecasts will extend into 2021. We\ncompared this to evaluating only forecast lead times that are valid in 2020 but the difference in the\nscores was negligible. The evaluation time step can be freely chosen. We use 6 hours as our highest\nresolution.\n4.2\nEvaluation resolution and area\nBefore the computation of the metrics, all forecasts and ground truths are first-order conserva-\ntively regridded to 1.5\u25e6 resolution. A regridding tool is available on the WB2 GitHub page. 1.5\u25e6\nis also used as the standard resolution for evaluation by the WMO (, WMO) and at ECMWF.\nRegridding to a common lower resolution allows all models to be evaluated without penalizing\ncoarser-resolution models. Absolute metric values can differ significantly between resolutions but\n9\nthe relative differences between different models are consistent across different evaluation resolution\n(see Fig. S9 for a comparison of IFS HRES scores at different resolutions and consult the Weather-\nBench 2 website to see all models evaluated at different resolutions). However, this should not give\nthe false impression that higher-resolution models are not more accurate as relevant small scale\ndetails can be resolved.\nAll results shown in this paper are computed over all global grid points. Additionally, scores\ncomputed many other regions are shown on the website:\nhttps://sites.research.google/\nweatherbench.\n4.2.1\nBelow-ground grid points\nFor some pressure levels (e.g. 850hPa), grid points in high-altitude regions will be \u201cbelow\u201d ground;\ni.e., the surface pressure is actually smaller than the pressure level. ERA5 and IFS output will still\nprovide interpolated values at these locations, even though they do not correspond to real physical\nvariables. Here, we exclude below ground grid points from the computation of all metrics. To do\nso, we compute the climatological fraction of above-ground grid points (defined by geopotential >\ngeopotential at surface) for each pressure level using the same doy-tod dependent method described\nin Section 3.2. We then use this fraction as an additional weight when computing spatial averages.\nWe chose to implement the below-ground mask based on climatological values rather than the\nactual forecast or ground truth values because ML models, when explicitly trained against masked\nscores conditioned on the forecast or ground truth, could lead to biased predictions.\n4.3\nDeterministic metrics\nAll metrics are computed using an area-weighting over grid points. This is because on an equian-\ngular latitude-longitude grid, grid cells at the poles have a much smaller area compared to grid\ncells at the equator. Weighing all cells equally would result in an inordinate bias towards the polar\nregions. The latitude weights w(i) are computed as:\nw(i) =\nsin \u03b8u\ni \u2212 sin \u03b8l\ni\n1\nI\nPI\ni (sin \u03b8u\ni \u2212 sin \u03b8l\ni)\n,\n(1)\nwhere \u03b8u\ni and \u03b8l\ni indicate upper and lower latitude bounds, respectively, for the grid cell with\nlatitude index i. All vertical (pressure) levels are treated separately. For readability, no level index\nis included in the equations below.\n4.3.1\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE)\nThe RMSE is defined for each variable and level as\nRMSEl =\nv\nu\nu\nt\n1\nTIJ\nT\nX\nt\nI\nX\ni\nJ\nX\nj\nw(i)(ft,l,i,j \u2212 ot,i,j)2\n(2)\nNote that this agrees with the definition of the RMSE used by the WMO and ECMWF. In\nWB1, the time mean was taken outside the square root. We compared both versions and found\ndifferences to be small (less than 2% absolute difference on average).\nThe wind vector (WV) RMSE is computed as\nRMSEWV\nl\n=\nv\nu\nu\nt\n1\nTIJ\nT\nX\nt\nI\nX\ni\nJ\nX\nj\nw(i)\nh\n(uf\nt,l,i,j \u2212 uo\nt,i,j)2 + (vf\nt,l,i,j \u2212 vo\nt,i,j)2\ni\n(3)\n10\nwhere uf, uo, vf and vo are the u and v components of wind in the forecast and observations,\nrespectively.\n4.3.2\nAnomaly correlation coefficient (ACC)\nThe ACC is computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient of the anomalies with respect to the\nclimatology c:\nf\u2032\nt,l,i,j = ft,l,i,j \u2212 ct,l,i,j;\no\u2032\nt,i,j = ot,i,j \u2212 ct,i,j\n(4)\nwhere ct,l,i,j and ct,i,j indicate the climatology corresponding to the appropriate tod-doy combina-\ntion. The ACC then is defined as\nACCl = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt\nPI\ni\nPJ\nj w(i)f\u2032\nt,l,i,jo\u2032\nt,i,j\nqPI\ni\nPJ\nj w(i)f\u2032\nt,l,i,j\n2 PI\ni\nPJ\nj w(i)o\u2032\nt,i,j\n2\n(5)\nThe range of ACC values goes from 1, indicating perfect correlation, to -1, indicating perfect\nanti-correlation. A climatological forecast has an ACC value of zero. ECMWF states that when\n\u201cACC value falls below 0.6 it is considered that the positioning of synoptic scale features ceases to\nhave value for forecasting purposes\u201d (https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Anomaly+\nCorrelation+Coefficient).\n4.3.3\nBias\nThe mean error, or simply bias, is computed for each location i, j as\nBiasl,i,j = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt\n(ft,l,i,j \u2212 ot,i,j)\n(6)\nIn addition, we compute the globally averaged root mean squared bias (RMSB) as\nRMSBl =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\nIJ\nI\nX\ni\nJ\nX\nj\nw(i)Bias2\nl,i,j\n(7)\n4.3.4\nStable Equitable Error in Probability Space \u2013 SEEPS\nTraditional deterministic scores such as RMSE and ACC are not good choices for evaluating pre-\ncipitation forecasts. This is because precipitation has a very skewed distribution and high spatio-\ntemporal intermittency or unpredictability. Under such conditions, traditional scores heavily favor\nunrealistically smooth forecasts. This is the case for all variables but is especially dramatic for\nskewed variables. For this reason, ECMWF and WMO decided to use the SEEPS score (Rodwell\net al., 2010) for their routine deterministic precipitation evaluation. The SEEPS score is based on\na three-class categorization into \u201cdry\u201d, \u201clight\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d precipitation. The score is designed to\ndiscourage \u201chedging\u201d (i.e. smooth forecasts) and be stable to parameter choices. For details behind\nthe score, please consult Rodwell et al. (2010). Here, we describe how the score is computed and\nhow the computation differs slightly from that in the original paper.\nWe use a dry threshold of 0.25 mm/day (0.1 mm/day for 6 hourly accumulation; shown on the\nwebsite). The remaining precipitation values are classified into light and heavy, so that climato-\nlogically there are twice as many light compared to heavy precipitation days. We compute this by\ncalculating the 2/3rd quantile of non-dry days for each day-of-year according to the same procedure\n11\nfor computing a smooth climatology described in Section 3.2. This differs from most other SEEPS\ncomputations which uses monthly climatologies. Because the daily climatology is smooth though,\nthis does not affect the results much. Forecast/observation pairs are then categorized into the three\nclasses and a 3x3 contingency table is created for each forecast lead time. The contingency table is\nthen multiplied by the scoring matrix S based on the yearly average climatological occurrence of\ndry days p1 for each geographical location:\nS = 1\n2\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n0\n1\n1\u2212p1\n4\n1\u2212p1\n1\np1\n0\n3\n1\u2212p1\n1\np1 +\n3\n2+p1\n3\n2+p1\n0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\nwhere columns represent observed probabilities and rows represent forecast probabilities.\nVery wet and very dry regions are excluded. Here we use 0.1 < p1 < 0.85 as suggested by\nRodwell et al. (2010). Finally an area-weighted average is taken over all locations.\nIn the figures, we show (1 - SEEPS), the more common skill score version that is positively\noriented.\n4.4\nProbabilistic metrics\n4.4.1\nContinuous ranked probability score (CRPS)\nGiven scalar ground truth Y , and i.i.d. predictions X, X\u2032, CRPS is defined as E|X\u2212Y |\u2212 1\n2E|X\u2212X\u2032|\n(Gneiting and Raftery, 2007). The skill term, E|X \u2212Y | penalizes poor predictions, while \u2212 1\n2E|X \u2212\nX\u2032| encourages spread. CRPS is minimized just when X is drawn from the same distribution as Y .\nTo see this, consider two i.i.d. ground truth samples, Y, Y \u2032, then subtract 1\n2E|Y \u2212 Y \u2032| from CRPS\nto arrive at the divergence relation\nE |X \u2212 Y | \u2212 1\n2E\n\f\fX \u2212 X\u2032\f\f \u2212 1\n2E\n\f\fY \u2212 Y \u2032\f\f\n=\nZ\n(P[X \u2264 y] \u2212 P[Y \u2264 y])2 dy.\nThus, scalar CRPS is equal, up to a constant independent of the prediction, to the squared L2\ndifference of their cumulative distribution functions. In the case of a deterministic prediction, the\nCRPS reduces to the MAE.\nWeatherBench considers multi-dimensional predictions, ft,l, conditional on the initial ground\ntruth ot\u2212l. For these, CRPS is defined by averaging over time/latitude/longitude components. We\nalso take advantage of M \u2265 2 predictions {f(1), . . . , f(M)}. Setting\n\u2225g\u2225t,l\n:=\n1\nIJ\nI\nX\ni\nJ\nX\nj\nw(i)|gt,l,i,j|,\nwe define\nCRPSl := 1\nT\nT\nX\nt\n\"\n1\nM\nM\nX\nm=1\n\u2225f(m) \u2212 o\u2225t,l \u2212\n1\n2M(M \u2212 1)\nM\nX\nm=1\nM\nX\nn=1\n\u2225f(m) \u2212 f(n)\u2225t,l\n#\n.\n(8)\nThis is the time average of unbiased (conditional) CRPS (Zamo and Naveau, 2018). With large\nenough T, this is an accurate estimate of CRPS conditional on ot\u2212l. It is therefore minimized by\nany prediction ft,l with the same component distributions as ground truth at time t, conditional\non ot\u2212l.\nThe second term (8) is efficiently computed in O(M log M) time using O(M) memory with a\nsort rather than a double summation. CRPS for deterministic predictions (where M = 1) is also\nsupported, and in this case CRPS reduces to (weighted) mean absolute error.\n12\n4.4.2\nSpread-skill ratio\nThe spread-skill ratio R is defined as the ratio between the ensemble spread and the RMSE of the\nensemble mean ft,l,i,j =\n1\nM\nPM\nm ft,l,i,j,m.\nSpreadl =\nv\nu\nu\nt\n1\nTIJ\nT\nX\nt\nI\nX\ni\nJ\nX\nj\nw(i)varm(ft,l,i,j,m)\n(9)\nwith varm being the variance in the ensemble dimension.\nR =\nSpread\nRMSE(f)\n(10)\nA well-calibrated ensemble forecast should have a spread-skill ratio of 1 (Fortin et al., 2014). Smaller\nvalues indicate an underdispersive forecast, while larger values indicate an overdispersive forecast.\nNote that the spread-skill ratio is only a first-order test for calibration. To further diagnose ensemble\ncalibration, rank histograms are a suitable choice (Wilks, 2006, Ch. 7.7.2). We plan to include\nthose in WB2 soon.\n4.5\nEnergy Spectra\nZonal spectral energy along lines of constant latitude is computed as a function of wavenumber\n(unitless), frequency (m\u22121) and wavelength (m).\nWith fl discrete values along a zonal circle of constant latitude, with circumference C, the DFT\nFk is computed as\nFk = 1\nL\nL\u22121\nX\nl=0\nfle\u2212i2\u03c0kl/L.\nThe energy spectrum is then set to\nS0 := C|F0|2,\nSk = 2C|Fk|2,\nk = 1, . . . , \u230aL/2\u230b.\nThe factor of 2 appears for wavenumbers k > 0 since they account for both negative and positive\nfrequency content.\nThis choice of normalization ensures that Parseval\u2019s relation for energy holds: Supposing fl\nare sampled values of continuous function f(\u2113), for 0 < \u2113 < C (m), then (C/L) is the spacing of\nlongitudinal samples, whence\nZ C\n0\n|f(\u2113)|2 d\u2113 \u2248 C\nL\nL\u22121\nX\nl=0\n|fl|2 =\n\u230aL/2\u230b\nX\nk=0\nSk.\nTo arrive at a final spectrum we average the zonal spectra for 30\u25e6 < |lat| < 60\u25e6.\n4.6\nHeadline scores\nThe headline scores are listed in Table 3. They reflect the most commonly evaluated variables in\nmedium-range forecasting. The upper-level variables are chosen to capture the large-scale evolution\nof the atmosphere. Z500 and T850 are particularly good tracers of extra-tropical dynamics. Q700\nprovides a proxy for moisture transport and, indirectly, clouds. The surface variables are closely\naligned with weather impact through 2 m temperature (T2M), 10 m wind speed (WS10) and 24 h\nprecipitation accumulation (TP24hr). The mean sea level pressure (MSLP) is another measure of\nlarger scale dynamics and is a good proxy for the strength of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones.\n13\nVariable\nShort name\nDeterministic metric\nProbabilistic metric\nUpper-level variables\n500hPa Geopotential\nZ500\nRMSE\nCRPS\n850hPa Temperature\nT850\nRMSE\nCRPS\n700hPa Specific humidity\nQ700\nRMSE\nCRPS\n850hPa Wind vector/speed\nWV/WS850\nRMSE (WV)\nCRPS (WS)\nSurface variables\n2m Temperature\nT2M\nRMSE\nCRPS\n10m Wind speed\nWS10\nRMSE\nCRPS\nMean sea level pressure\nMSLP\nRMSE\nCRPS\n24h precipitation\nTP24hr\nSEEPS\nCRPS\nTable 3: List of headline scores. WV is short for Wind Vector; WS is short for Wind Speed.\n5\nResults\nThe description of the results in this paper will focus on the general characteristics of the evaluation\nmetrics and the baselines, with a smaller focus on comparing the data-driven models themselves.\nThis is because the paper is a snapshot of the state-of-the-art of data-driven modeling at the time\nof writing and will almost certainly be outdated soon. For this reason, and because visualization\nof all models on a single graph makes it unreadable, we only show detailed scores for a smaller\nselection of models.\nThose models (GraphCast, Pangu-Weather and NeuralGCM) were chosen\nbecause of their current relevance in the community. For an up-to-date view of the data-driven\nstate-of-the-art, including detailed scores of all models, visit the accompanying website: https:\n//sites.research.google/weatherbench.\n5.1\nHeadline scores\nFigs. 1 and 2 show scorecards of the deterministic headline scores relative to the IFS HRES baseline.\nFig. 3 shows a scorecard of upper-level headline scores. Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show the deterministic and\nprobabilistic scores as a function of lead time, respectively. Scores for the other metrics, variables\nand resolutions can be found on the WeatherBench 2 website.\nOn RMSE, IFS ENS (mean) performs better than IFS HRES for longer lead times. For smaller\nscale variables this transition happens earlier. For example, for larger scale variables like pressure\nand temperature the IFS ENS (mean) has lower errors up to around 2 days, compared to up\nto around 12h for wind and humidity. The state-of-the-art, deterministic, data-driven methods\n(Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, FuXi and NeuralGCM) also score well compared to IFS HRES, with\nscores similar to those shown in the respective papers. In comparison to IFS ENS (mean), these\ndeterministic models have lower errors up to 3\u20136 days, after which the ensemble mean has the\nlowest error. NeuralGCM ENS (mean) roughly matches the IFS ENS (mean) scores on RMSE.\nIt is also noticeable, especially in the plots relative to IFS HRES, that the scores for the data-\ndriven methods have a strong 6h zig-zag pattern. This is an artifact of training and evaluating\nwith ERA5, which has a 12h assimilation window. Forecasts initialized at 00/12UTC are initialized\ntowards the beginning of the 09\u201321/21\u201309UTC ERA5 assimilation windows. This means that for\nthe first 6h forecast, e.g., from 00 to 06 UTC, all the AI models have to learn is to emulate the\nIFS model version used in ERA5. For the next 6h window, e.g., from 06 to 12UTC, the models\nalso have to learn the assimilation step\u2014a harder task. If forecasts initialized at 06/18UTC were\nevaluated, the zig-zag pattern would be reversed. Note that in Lam et al. (2023), this pattern is\n14\nFigure 1: Deterministic headline scorecards for upper-level variables.

Note that\nfor TP24h, IFS HRES and IFS ENS (mean) are evaluated against ERA5, since no precipitation\naccumulations are available for the analysis. Not all models/datasets have all variables available.\n17\nnot visible because evaluation is done on a 12h interval, thereby only sampling every second point\nshown here. Here we chose to show the 6h evaluation for completeness (except for NeuralGCM\nwhere we only had 12-hourly data).\nNote that the larger error of IFS ENS (mean) at time t = 0 for 2m temperature stems from a\ndifference in resolution between the ensemble (0.2\u25e6) and the analysis (0.1\u25e6). Results for the newly\nupgraded higher resolution ensemble (not included in WB2 yet) do not show this large initial error.\nThe precipitation verification using the SEEPS score shows that IFS HRES is the most skillful\nmodel with the \u201cblurrier\u201d models, such as IFS ENS (mean), being less skillful. This shows the\nadvantage of using a categorical score compared to an average score such as RMSE. On RMSE,\nthe order of the models is reversed (not shown).\nFor the probabilistic models, IFS ENS and NeuralGCM ENS show very similar scores on upper-\nlevel variables. Their skill approaches that of the probabilistic climatology towards the end of the\ntwo week forecast horizon. This is in line with the expected \u223c15 day limit of predictability of\nsynoptic weather (Selz, 2019). For some variables, while the IFS ENS and NeuralGCM ENS skill\ncurves flatten off, there is still a gap to the climatological skill. This could have several reasons: first,\nour methodology for computing the probabilistic climatology might not be a perfect representation\nof the true climatology; second; the forecast might still have some skill there. Especially for large-\nscale variables such as pressure and temperature, there is evidence of skill in the sub-seasonal range;\nand third, especially for temperature variables, climate change has a non-negligible effect over the\n30 years used to compute the climatology.\nAn analysis of the spread-skill relationship (Fig. 7) shows that except for precipitation, which is\nunderdispersive, the IFS ensemble forecast is very well calibrated, especially for longer lead times.\nThe initial hours show some spin-up with more spread in the first hours, followed by a 2 day dip in\nthe spread-skill ratio. For geopotential and pressure, this trend is reversed. NeuralGCM ENS also\nshows good calibration for longer lead times but instead appears to be underdispersive at early lead\ntimes, perhaps due to the lack of initial condition spread. Here it is important to not over-interpret\nglobal spread-skill ratios. More fine-grained analysis of tropical vs extra-tropical dispersion show\nmore differentiated behavior. These results are included on the website.\nFig. 8 also shows a time series of 6 day RMSE over Europe for all of 2020 for each of the\nmodels. Here, several forecast bust events are visible, where forecast skill drops significantly below\nnormal (Rodwell et al., 2013). Interestingly, some bust cases are shared between the physical and\nAI models (e.g. around March 19) while for others AI models continue to perform well, despite\nIFS HRES and ENS performing badly (e.g. August 11). In some other cases, AI models spuriously\nperform badly. Generally, this implies that AI models show similar error characteristics to physical\nmodels.\n5.2\nBias\nFig. 9 shows the RMS bias (RMSB) for the headline variables. Additionally, bias maps for 2m\ntemperature, 24h precipitation, 10m wind speed and 700hPa specific humidity can be found in the\nsupplement. It is important to note that one year is a small sample to compute bias statistics. In\nthe bias maps in the supplement it is evident that dominant weather patterns in 2020 influence the\nbias. For example, 2020 saw a persistent heat wave in Siberia. All models tend to have a cold bias\nthere since they fail to fully predict such a persistent pattern. Therefore, not too much should be\ninterpreted into regional biases without considering the context.\nWhat is noticeable is that while ML methods tend to have a lower average bias compared to\nphysical methods, especially at early lead times, for wind speed GraphCast (and Keisler (2022);\nnot shown) show a large increase in average bias with lead time. The bias maps (Figs. S6 and\n18\nFigure 5: Global RMSE/SEEPS % difference compared to IFS HRES for headline variables for\nthe year 2020. Negative values indicated lower RMSE. Note that for TP24h, IFS HRES and IFS\nENS (mean) are evaluated against ERA5, since no precipitation accumulations are available for the\nanalysis, and the metric is SEEPS (in this case not 1-SEEPS to have a consistent orientation with\nthe other relative plots). Not all models/datasets have all variables available.\n19\nFigure 6: Global CRPS for headline variables for the year 2020.\n20\nFigure 7: Spread/skill ratio for headline variables for the year 2020.\n21\nFigure 8: Timeseries of day 6 RMSE in m2/s2 over Europe defined by 35\u25e6 < lat < 75\u25e6 and\n\u221212.5\u25e6 < lon < 42.5\u25e6. All models evaluated at 1.5\u25e6 resolution. Climatological and persistence\nerrors are omitted.\n22\nFigure 9: Global RMSB for the headline variables for the year 2020. For Z500 and MSLP the\nclimatological bias is comparatively large and is not shown within the figure limits\n23\nS7) show that this is due to a consistent bias towards smaller wind speed values. This bias is\nnot present when looking at U or V separately (see supplement of Lam et al. (2023)). What this\nindicates is that ML models trained to minimize each wind component separately, and doing a good\njob at doing so, can struggle to represent correlations between those components. Interestingly,\nPangu-Weather does not have this bias. Neither does the hybrid NeuralGCM model.\n5.3\nSpectra\nFig. 10 shows the power spectra for four variables and four lead times. The ERA5 spectrum can\nbe taken as a reference to compare between lead times as it is constant with lead time. IFS HRES\ngenerally has more energy on small scales compared to ERA5, likely due to its higher resolution,\nbut is also quasi-constant with lead time which is to be expected for a physical model. The IFS ENS\n(mean) shows an increasing drop-off in power with lead time, starting with the smaller wavelengths\nand then also for the larger wavelengths for longer lead times. Here it is important to re-iterate that\nthe ensemble mean does not represent a realistic realization of weather but rather the mean of the\nforecast distribution. In other words, the mean will become increasingly smooth with lead time,\neventually converging to the climatological mean. The progression of the drop-off from smaller\ntowards longer wavelengths is consistent with the model of upscale error growth first proposed by\nLorenz (1969). For variables that vary more on small scales, such as humidity and precipitation,\nthis effect is larger.\nFor Z500, the AI models tend to have more energy on small scales, more so for longer lead\ntimes. This increase in small scale energy for Z500 is in contrast to the behavior for the other\nvariables where the AI models show a significant drop in small scale variability from 6h to 3d. This\nis a result of the aforementioned smoothing. After 3 days most AI models tend to have a constant\nspectrum. This is in line with the 24\u201372 h optimization windows. In other words, these models\ntend to optimize their blurring for those time ranges. The ensemble mean continues to become\nblurrier resulting in lower RMSE values for longer lead times. The spectra of NeuralGCM show less\nvariance on small scales due to the model\u2019s lower resolution but the spectra are roughly consistent\nwith lead time.\nThe spectra clearly show some of the blurring exhibited by some AI models. It is important to\nnote though that having a spectrum that matches observations well is a necessary but not sufficient\nconditions for \u201crealism\u201d.\n5.4\nCase studies\nWhile case studies can only provide anecdotal evidence of model performance, they offer a more\n\u201chuman\u201d and holistic view that skill scores cannot provide. Here we shows one such case study.\nAnother case study of Hurricane Laura can be seen in Fig. S10 On the WB2 website, we eventually\nplan to extend this catalog of case studies.\nFig. 11 shows model forecasts and the corresponding ERA5 ground truth for storm Alex which\nbrought damaging wind and rain across Europe (https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2020/\nstorm-alex). What is noticeable is that all models, physical and AI-based, predict the evolution of\nthe storm with impressive accuracy and agreement up to four days lead time. October 2 saw strong\nwinds over the North-West of France as well as parts of northern Spain, which was predicted well\nby all methods. On October 4, a cut-off trough developed cetered over the English channel. IFS\nHRES and even the ENS mean reasonably predict this whereas the AI methods favor a continuous\ntrough stretching from Iceland to England.\nFig. S10 shows the evolution of Hurricane Laura, the most damaging hurricane of the 2020 season\n24\nFigure 10: Power spectra of 500hPa geopotential, 700hPa specific humidity, 850hPa u-wind and 6h\nprecipitation accumulation for different lead times.\n25\nFigure 11: Case study: Storm Alex. Top row shows ERA5 ground truth. Other rows show forecasts\ninitialized at 2020-09-29 00UTC. Lines show Z500 contours. Shading shows 850hPa wind speed.\n26\n(https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL132020_Laura.pdf). IFS HRES shows impressive skill\nin predicting the evolution and track of the hurricane up to 5 days in advance with the timing\nand location of landfall on August 8 almost perfectly forecasted. The IFS ENS mean, somewhat\npredictably, fails to predict the strength and location of the hurricane because it averages out several\nhurricane tracks. Pangu-Weather and GraphCast have a solid track forecast with reasonable cyclone\nstructure but fail to predict the intensity in pressure and wind speed seen in the actual hurricane\nof the IFS forecast. GraphCast predicts landfall West of the actual location. NeuralGCM, for this\ncase, shows a remarkable agreement with ERA5, on par with IFS HRES.\nWe plan to add more case studies to the website in the future. While case studies should not be\nover-interpreted, they are evidence that while sometimes lacking in detail and fidelity, AI models\ncan produce skillful extreme weather forecasts for events outside of their training dataset.\n6\nDiscussion\n6.1\nERA5 as ground truth\nHere, we use ERA5 as our ground truth dataset. However, as already discussed in Section 3.1,\nERA5 is a model simulation that is kept close to observations, rather than direct observations.\nThe quality of ERA5 depends on the variable in question. Large-scale dynamical variables like\ngeopotential and upper-levels temperatures and wind tend to be well represented in reanalysis\ndatasets. For surface variables, the sparsity of observations and difficulty of representing small-\nscale physics in the underlying model can cause larger discrepancies with observations. This is\nespecially true for precipitation, which is not directly assimilated into ERA5 (e.g., through radar\nobservations) and often show large differences to rain gauges or radar precipitation estimates (e.g.,\n(Lavers et al., 2022), (Andrychowicz et al., 2023)). The precipitation evaluation using ERA5 shown\nhere should really be seen as a placeholder for more accurate precipitation data.\nOperational weather services like ECMWF verify their forecasts with direct observations, e.g.,\nfrom weather stations, in addition to using assimilated ground truths. This is something we are\nlooking to add to WeatherBench in the future. However, station observations come with their own\nissues: first, they are unevenly distributed with some regions being especially sparse in observations;\nsecond, station data comes in varying quality and requires careful quality control; and third, station\ndata suffers from representativeness issues; that is, the station might not be representative of the\nmodel grid box it is compared to.\nFor these reasons, ERA5 still represents a good option for evaluation for most variables because\nof its temporal and spatial coverage but it should be kept in mind that it does not tell the full\nstory. Notably, some regional ML and post-processing models already look at using data directly\nfor training and evaluation (Andrychowicz et al., 2023; Demaeyer et al., 2023).\n6.2\nERA5 initialization versus operational forecasting\nMost data-driven methods so far have been trained and evaluated using ERA5 data as initial\nconditions. As already discussed in Section 3.1, ERA5 data would not be available in real time\nto initialize live, operational forecasts. For a true apples-to-apples comparison with operational\nphysical models, ML forecasts would need to be initialized using operationally available initial\nconditions. The first such experiment has been done by Ben-Bouallegue et al. (2023a), who took\nthe Pangu-Weather model trained on ERA5 and initialized it with operational IFS analyses. In\naddition, we include operational versions of Pangu-Weather and GraphCast in the WeatherBench\n27\nscorecards. Across the board, the scores are very similar between the ERA5-initialized and opera-\ntional versions, whether they have been fine-tuned (in the case of GraphCast) or not (in the case\nof Pangu-Weather). This suggests that the distribution shift between ERA5 and the operational\nIFS analysis is manageable for these AI models. Regardless, going forward it will be important to\ndistinguish between ERA5-initialized and (quasi-)operational models as e.g. done in Table 1. For\nan apples-to-apples comparison, we encourage researchers to run and evaluate their models with\noperational analyses.\n6.3\nForecast realism, probabilistic forecasts and extremes\nOne feature of current AI methods is that they produce unrealistically smooth forecasts, a trend\nthat often becomes more pronounced with lead time. This is a direct consequence of these models\nminimizing a deterministic mean error (such as MSE). Because the evolution of the atmosphere\nis chaotic and forecast uncertainty grows with time, this will lead models to \u201chedge their bets\u201d\nby predicting the mean of the potential forecast distribution. In a non-linear, high-dimensional\nsystem such as the atmosphere, the mean of many states is not a realistic state itself. The result\nare blurry forecasts that perform well on some skill metrics (like RMSE or ACC) but do not\nrepresent a possible weather state. This is evident in several analyses presented here: spectra show\nexcessive blurring of AI models for longer lead times; the SEEPS score shows how blurry models fail\nto predict the right precipitation category; wind speed biases are evidence that current AI models\nhave difficulties learning correlations between variables; and the case studies show that the intensity\nof local features such as wind speed, precipitation and cyclone intensity aren\u2019t represented. For\nsome applications, having good forecasts of average weather is sufficient but for others AI models\nare not yet appropriate.\nThis is naturally related to probabilistic prediction, i.e., predicting the full range of potential\nweather outcomes, which is so important for predicting the probability of extreme weather. Cur-\nrent, \u201ctraditional\u201d forecast systems use ensembles for this purpose. AI methods could follow a\nsimilar approach by producing an ensemble of generative roll-outs, or they could directly predict\nprobabilistic outcomes of interest, such as the probability distribution of precipitation as done in\nthe MetNet family of models (Andrychowicz et al., 2023) or many post-processing models (e.g.\nGneiting et al. (2005)). For many applications, such as predicting weather at a particular loca-\ntion, the latter approach might be more straightforward and sufficient, while for other applications,\nfor example cyclone track forecasting or when humans interpret model output, temporal and spa-\ntial structure is important. Working closely with end users will be key in determining the most\nappropriate probabilistic representation for each application.\nThe probabilistic evaluation metrics proposed in WB2 (CRPS and spread/skill) are very much\njust the tip of the iceberg. They are univariate statistics, i.e., they ignore spatial and temporal\ncorrelations, and they do not specifically focus on extreme weather. Just like with the deterministic\nmetrics (RMSE or ACC), better CRPS values do not automatically mean a more useful forecast.\nWeather forecasting is a very high-dimensional problem, which means that there won\u2019t be a single\nmetric to determine forecast quality. Rather, evaluation will have to be guided by applications.\n6.4\nPost-processing\nIn this paper, the focus has been on data-driven forecast models. However, AI can also and has\nfor a long time been used to post-process dynamical forecasts (Rasp and Lerch, 2018; Finn, 2021;\nGneiting and Raftery, 2007; Gr\u00a8onquist et al., 2021). WB2 can equally well serve as a benchmark\nfor post-processing models, on top of dynamical forecasts such as those produced by ECMWF.\n28\nIn fact, comparing \u201cpurely\u201d data-driven forecasting models with dynamical models with state-of-\nthe-art post-processing should be an insightful exercise going forward. Note that benchmarks for\npost-processing have been proposed by Ashkboos et al. (2022) including re-forecasts for training\npost-processing models and an extreme weighted CRPS score definition. Similarly, Demaeyer et al.\n(2023) present a benchmark for station-based post-processing.\nSignificant improvements over raw dynamical model output can be expected using post-processing.\nPrevious studies (Rasp and Lerch, 2018; Ben-Bouallegue et al., 2023b; Finn, 2021) suggest that\nprobabilistic forecasts can be improved by up to 20% in terms of CRPS, depending on the variable in\nquestion. Since data-driven methods, at least partly, already perform a post-processing implicitly,\na fair comparison would be against post-processed dynamical models. Another interesting question\nis how much AI models can benefit from additional post-processing. Hopefully, these comparisons\nwill be added to WB2 soon.\n7\nConclusion\nWeatherBench 2.0 is an updated benchmark for data-driven, global weather forecasting. It is moti-\nvated by the rapid advances in used AI methods since the publication of the original WeatherBench\nbenchmark. WB2 is designed to stay close to the operational forecast evaluation used by many\nweather centers and to provide a robust framework for evaluating new methods against operational\nbaselines. By providing evaluation code and data, we hope to speed up machine learning workflows\nand ensure the reproducibility of results.\nWB2 is also designed to be a dynamic framework that will be updated with new metrics and\nmodels as this area of research evolves. Several possible extensions have already been discussed in\nthis paper, for example including station observations and evaluating extremes.\n29\nReferences\nAndrychowicz, M., Espeholt, L., Li, D., Merchant, S., Merose, A., Zyda, F., Agrawal, S., and Kalchbrenner,\nN.

However, these successes are limited\nto robots acting in isolation; in reality, robots deployed at scale will inevitably interact with other\nagents, like people or other robots.\nIn-the-wild multi-agent interactions raise significant challenges: not only does a robot have to ac-\ncount for perception-induced uncertainty of the physical state (e.g., ego state, positions of others),\nbut it must also account for uncertainty in other agents\u2019 future behavior. This problem setting is tradi-\ntionally modeled by decentralized partially-observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs)\nor partially-observable stochastic games (POSGs). While in theory, solutions to these formulations\nwould automatically yield desirable behaviors like information gathering when uncertain, in practice\nthey are notoriously intractable.\nNevertheless, human and animal behavior exhibits these abilities [8]. Pursuit-evasion interactions\nare a canonical example: the pursuer gathers information about the hidden evader by turning and\nscanning the environment; upon detection, the pursuer has to continuously strategize about its next\nmove without perfect knowledge of how the evader will react, all from onboard sensors. In this\nwork, we take the first steps towards building similar capabilities into autonomous robots.\nOur key idea is to leverage a fully-observable policy to generate supervision for a partially-\nobservable one. However, the classic paradigm of privileged learning [9] does not apply naively\nto this setting. Namely, privileged information depends not only on the robot, but also on the other\nagent\u2019s behavior, which is dictated by more than just physics; it is dictated by the other agent\u2019s in-\ntent. Therefore, we design a learning procedure to first build a low-dimensional latent representation\nof intent from future evader trajectories and then learn to estimate this representation from a history\nof pursuer actions and observations.\nThrough extensive empirical analysis, we find that the quality of the supervision signal depends on\na delicate balance between the diversity of the agents\u2019 behavior and the optimality of the interac-\ntion. In addition, there are many models for generating the fully-observable supervisor policy (e.g.,\ngame-theory [10], multi-agent RL [11]), each with their own potential strengths and weaknesses.\nWe discover that fully-observable policies obtained under strong modeling assumptions (e.g., both\nagents play under perfect-state Nash equilibrium), are less effective at supervising partially observ-\nable ones.\nInformed by this analysis, we synthesize a policy that automatically takes actions to resolve physical\nstate uncertainty (e.g., looking around to see detect where the other agent is) while also generating\npredictions about other agents\u2019 intent to yield strategic behavior. We deploy this policy on a phys-\nical legged robot in a pursuit-evasion game, where it interacts with humans or other legged robots\n(Fig. 1). Note that the robot only uses onboard sensing, e.g., proprioception and an RGB-D camera,\nto estimate its state and other agents\u2019 physical state and intent.\n2\nRelated Work\nDynamic Games & Multi-Agent RL. Dynamic game theory has a long history of modeling strate-\ngic interaction between multiple agents [12, 13, 14, 15] and has influenced fields like robust control\n[16] and reinforcement learning [17, 18, 19]. Both traditional and modern variants of dynamic\ngames have predominantly assumed knowledge of perfect state. While this has been successful in\ncontexts like robustness to physical disturbances [18, 20, 21], it\u2019s a limiting assumption for real-\nworld interaction. Partially observable stochastic games provide a mathematical model of strategic\ninteraction under partial observability [22], where all players have only partial information about\nenvironment state. However, they are tremendously computationally expensive to solve, and ap-\nproximations are an active area of research [23]. To make the optimization tractable, multi-agent\n2\nreinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms exploit large-scale simulation and neural network rep-\nresentations [24, 18, 25, 26, 27]. Such approaches have achieved impressive results in simulation\ninteractions like hide-and-seek [28], video games like Starcraft [29], diplomacy [30], and board\ngames like Go [31]. However, to-date, multi-agent RL approaches have not yet scaled to embodied\nsystems acting under real-world sensing constraints. Although these approaches cannot be applied\nto our physical system out-of-the-box, we do take inspiration from this line of work in the design of\nprivileged fully-observable pursuer policy and a highly strategic evader policy.\nLatent Intent Modeling. Recent works [32, 33, 34] learn a latent representation of agent intent\nvia reconstructing a dataset of fully-observed states and rewards. This line of works assumes that\nthe latent intent changes only between interaction episodes and not during an interaction. To handle\nintent changes during interaction [35] learns an estimator of a human\u2019s latent state to predict their\nimmediate next action. These works overwhelmingly assume that the only hidden state in the inter-\naction is the opponent\u2019s intent: the physical state of the robot, the opponent\u2019s state, and possibly the\nopponent\u2019s action are assumed to be observable. We address the constraints imposed by on-board\nrobot perception, where the evader\u2019s physical state, latent intent, and action are all hidden.\nMulti-Quadruped Interaction.\nProgress in low-level control for quadrupedal robots [1, 3, 4]\nhas increased the interest in combining low-level controllers with high-level decision-making [36].\nHowever, multi-agent quadruped interactions have been relatively under-explored. Most relevant\nis [37] which trains a centralized high-level coordination policy with perfect (global) state for two\nrobots pushing a box. [38, 39] present cooperative control of robots via model predictive control\nand control barrier functions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate\nautonomous interaction between a quadruped and another robotic or human agent truly in the wild.\n3\nOverview\nWe seek a robot policy that can strategically interact with another agent in a decentralized fashion\n(i.e., no explicit communication) and only using proprioception and a single onboard RGB-D cam-\nera. Although our technical approach is general, we ground this work in pursuit-evasion games [12],\nwhich exhibit core challenges at the heart of real-world multi-agent interaction: partial observabil-\nity, nonlinear physical dynamics (e.g., quadrupedal dynamics), low-latency decision-making, and a\nneed for strategic planning.\nWe approach this problem using privileged learning [9]. We found that directly using reinforcement\nlearning to train a policy that reasons strategically through partial observability was unsuccessful.\nThe key to our approach is to leverage a fully-observable policy to generate supervision for the\npartially-observable one. During privileged training, we leverage a new type of privileged informa-\ntion: the future state trajectory of the evader. We first learn a fully-observable policy (\u03c0\u2217) (top,\nFig. 2), that gets access the true future N-step state trajectory of the evader and the current true rel-\native state. This enables \u03c0\u2217 to quickly learn actions that account for the evader\u2019s behavior by using\na learned latent intent, zt, that encodes the future trajectory of the other agent.\nWe then distill this policy into a partially-observable policy (\u03c0p) which only uses an egocentric\nvideo stream from an onboard RGB-D camera (bottom, Fig. 2). Specifically, \u03c0p gets access to a\nhistory of relative state estimates and uncertainties which are generated via a standard Kalman Filter\n[40]. Even though the Kalman filter is an incredibly coarse approximation of the true system, the\nuncertainty information captured by the covariance matricies is sufficient for the prediction policy to\nlearn information-gathering behaviors (like turning and looking for the evader), when combined with\nthe teacher policy. In this light, our privileged learning approach can be viewed as an approximation\nto the optimal policy obtained via solving the underlying, but intractable, decentralized partially-\nobservable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).\nOur partially-observable policy can be applied zero-shot in the real world using the output of an\noff-the-shelf object detector [41]. We deploy it in the wild to play a pursuit-evasion game with a\nhuman evader and another quadrupedal robot controlled by a human operator.\n3\nFigure 2: (top) The fully-observable policy knows the true relative state and gets privileged access\nto the future evader trajectory from which it learns a representation the evader intent. (bottom) The\npartially-observable policy must plan through physical and latent intent uncertainty.\n4\nApproach\nGiven an evader policy \u03c0e, we define the pursuer\u2019s planning problem as a finite-horizon, discrete-\ntime optimization problem. We seek a policy for the pursuer \u03c0p : Op \u2192 Up which maps from\nobservations to actions that maximizes the following objective:\nJ(\u03c0p, \u03c0e) = E\u03c4\u223cp(\u03c4|\u03c0p,\u03c0e)\nh\nT\nX\nt=0\n\u03b3trt\ni\n.\n(1)\nHere, \u03c4 = {(xp\n0, xe\n0, up\n0, ue\n0, op\n0, oe\n0, r0) . . . (xp\nT , xe\nT , up\nT , ue\nT , op\nT , oe\nT , rT )} is the joint trajectory of\nstates, actions, observations, and rewards induced by a pair of pursuer and evader policies, drawn\nfrom the distribution p(\u03c4 | \u03c0p, \u03c0e). The discount factor is denoted by \u03b3. More formally, this\noptimization defines the solution to a two-agent, finite horizon decentralized partially-observable\nMarkov decision process (Dec-POMDP).\nWe denote the global physical state of the pursuer as xp \u2208 Rnp and the evader to be xe \u2208 Rne. Note\nthat the pursuer policy \u03c0p does not observe the global state of the agents. The robot\u2019s high-level\nlinear and angular velocity commands are denoted by up \u2208 Up and the pursuer\u2019s low-level joint\ntorques are controlled via a pre-computed walking policy. The evader also controls its linear and\nangular velocity, ue \u2208 Ue. Both Ui, i \u2208 {p, e} are bounded sets, modeling actuation limits. For\nexample, in simulation, the maximum linear speed of the pursuer is 3 m/s, and the evader is 2.5 m/s.\nThe pursuer is rewarded for minimizing the distance between the two agents at each timestep, and\nobtains a termination bonus upon capture:\nPursuit: rt = \u2212||xe\nt \u2212 xp\nt ||2\n2,\nCapture: rT = \u03b1 \u00b7 1{||xe\nT \u2212 xp\nT ||2\n2 \u2264 0.8}\n(2)\nAsymmetries. Our setting has three asymmetries that induce complexity: 1) information (agents\nhave limited FOV and partial state), 2) dynamics (e.g., robot quadruped interacting with human),\nand 3) control bound asymmetry (e.g., agents with different maximum speeds).\nEgo-Centric State. All agents reason about the relative physical state in their own body frame. In a\nslight abuse of notation, we refer to xrel := [prel\nx , prel\ny , \u03b8rel]\u22a4 as the true relative planar position and\norientation of the exo-centric agent in the ego-centric agent\u2019s body frame.\nState Estimation. In the wild, the true relative state is not available due to sensing limits. In-\nstead, the pursuer estimates xrel\nt\nfrom the output of a 3D object detector using the RGB camera\n[41]. Let op\nt \u2208 Op be the 3D relative position of the evader with respect to the pursuer\u2019s cam-\nera frame2. The pursuer\u2019s relative state estimate are the mean and covariance of a Kalman filter:\n2If the evader is out of the field of view, then op\nt = \u2205 and no measurement update is performed.\n4\n(\u02c6xrel\nt , \u02c6\u03a3t) = KF(op\n0:t, up\n0:t). While a suite of more complex filter designs could be used for even\nbetter performance [42], we find that using an unoptimized Kalman filter is sufficient for the robot\npolicy to learn information-gathering behaviors.\nEvader Policy. The evader policy is key for enabling the pursuer to learn strategic maneuvers.\nHowever, where does the evader policy come from? Datasets of quadrupeds interacting with other\nagents in the wild do not exist, and simulating human-robot or robot-robot interactions that capture\nthe diversity of the real-world is an ongoing challenge for simulation-based robotics. Instead, we\ntake an investigative approach and study three simulated evader policy models: random motion\nprimitives, multi-agent RL, and dynamic game theory. Across all models, we assume the evader has\naccess to the current true relative state in their own body frame. Details are in Sec. 5.2.\n4.1\nFully-Observable Policy: Teacher\nTo learn the pursuer teacher policy \u03c0\u2217, we must address the challenge that privileged information\ndepends on the evader\u2019s behavior which is dictated by their dynamics and intent.\nFuture Evader Trajectory & Latent State. The fully-observable policy \u03c0\u2217 gets access to both the\ntrue pursuer relative state, xrel\nt , and the future N states of the evader: xe\nt:t+N. Since the pursuer\nreasons in a relative coordinate system, the evader trajectory is converted into the pursuer\u2019s body\nframe starting from state at the start of the prediction horizon. This relative state trajectory, xrel\nt:t+N \u2208\nRN\u00d73, is input into an encoder, E\u2217(xrel\nt:t+N) = zt \u2208 R8 which learns a low-dimensional latent\nrepresentation. Intuitively, zt should capture low-dimensional information about the evader\u2019s near-\nterm behavior: for example, the evader\u2019s goal direction, their policy class (e.g., spline coefficients),\nor control bounds. At each timestep, zt is re-inferred.\nDesign. Although this pursuer policy is clearly not deployable in the real world, it enables us to\nconvert the intractable planning problem in Eq. 1 to a Markov Decision Process (MDP), amenable\nto off-the-shelf RL methods [43]. We use Proximal Policy Optimization [43] for training. The policy\n\u03c0\u2217 and the privileged encoder E\u2217 are both three-layer MLPs with [512, 256, 128] hidden units.\n4.2\nPartially-Observable Policy: Student\nThe partially-observable policy, \u03c0p, relies on RGB camera observations op\nt \u2208 Op. We use a off-\nthe-shelf 3d object detector [41] to convert from the raw RGB image observable op\nt to an detected\nrelative position and heading in the pursuer\u2019s camera frame, yt \u2208 R3. We use a Kalman Filter to\ngenerate an estimated relative state \u02c6xrel\nt\nand an associated covariance \u02c6\u03a3t. We use a simplified state\ntransition model \u02c6xrel\nt+1 = A\u02c6xrel\nt\n+ Bup\nt which ignores the role of the evader (i.e., ue\nt \u2261 0) during the\nthe prediction3 step (details in Appendix A.5). The history of relative state estimates and pursuer\nactions are encoded into the estimated lower-dimensional latent intent E(\u02c6xrel\n0:t, \u02c6\u03a30:t, up\n0:t\u22121) = \u02c6zt.\nDesign. We use DAGGER [44] and the fully-observable policy \u03c0\u2217 to supervise both the latent intent\nestimate and the action at each timestep. The policy network is a 3-layer MLP with [512, 256, 128]\nhidden units, and the encoder E is a 1-layer LSTM with hidden state 256.\n5\nSimulation Experiments\nWe first want to understand the design choices that are important to learn a successful pursuer policy:\n1) the ability to learn strategic behavior, 2) the evader policy \u03c0e that the robot interacts with at\ntraining time and 3) the evader interaction at deployment time. We perform a set of simulation\nexperiments to ablate the design of the pursuer policy (Sec. 5.1), study the effect of the evader on\ndistillation (Sec. 5.2), and analyze test-time adaptation of the pursuer policy to out-of-distribution\nopponents (Sec. 5.3).\nWe use Isaac Gym [45] for training and evaluation, and report results over\n500 random initial conditions.\n3This removes the need for a velocity estimator which can be hard to design and noisy in reality. While this\nmakes filtering imperfect, we empirically find that the learned policy can compensate for inaccuracies.\n5\nFigure 3: (left) Joint trajectories reveal that using only the present state or directly a history of the\npast states leads to sub-optimal performance. Supervision from the future enables prediction and\nfast capture. (right) Time-to-capture as a function xrel\n0 : future supervision quarters the capture time.\n5.1\nPredictive representations enable strategic behavior\nOne of the key types of privileged information we leverage is future trajectory state, which leaks\ninformation about the future intent of the other agent. In this section, we ask the question \u201cWhat is\nthe value of learning predictive representations for action?\u201d\nHere, we fix the evader policy to be\nhighly predictable and investigate alternative approaches to inferring the evader\u2019s latent intent. The\nevader always moves in Dubins\u2019 paths [46] with a fixed time duration for turning or going straight\ndetermined randomly upon the start of the episode (details in Sec. A.3.1 of the appendix). If the\npursuer has a high-quality understanding of the evader\u2019s latent intent, it should be able to intercept\nit along its weaving path. Throughout this section, all policies observe ground-truth relative states\nbut not the evader\u2019s latent intent.\nWe consider three approaches: a reactive pursuer policy which only observes the present relative\nstate and does not infer any latent intent, a lookback policy which must estimate the latent intent\nfrom a history of relative states without supervision from the future [35, 32] and a lookahead policy\n(ours), which uses a history of relative states and supervision from the future to predict a latent\nrepresentation of the evader\u2019s future trajectory. The lookback and lookahead policies use identical\nLSTM architectures for intent estimation.\nThe reactive policy fails to predict the evader\u2019s behavior and is unable to do better than tracking the\nevader and trailing behind it (left, Fig. 3). While adding a history improves the pursuer\u2019s strategy\n(center, Fig. 3), it still struggles to estimate the evader\u2019s intent reliably. In contrast, the lookahead\npolicy, trained to predict a latent representation of the evader\u2019s future trajectory, learns effective\npredictive behaviors (right, Fig. 3). In addition, the lookahead policy converges 10 times faster\nthan the lookback one (see Appendix Fig. 10). Overall, our experiments show that using the future\ntrajectory as privileged information favors training and enables strategic behaviors.\n5.2\nDistillation depends on balance of interaction diversity and optimality\nInfluence of evader model on pursuer policy.\nNow that we have a teacher policy architecture,\nwe turn to the role of the evader on the teacher pursuer policy. We compute three fully-observable\nteacher policies, \u03c0\u2217, trained against three different evader models, \u03c0e. With a slight abuse of nota-\ntion, let xrel be the relative state in the evader\u2019s body frame. The random evader, \u03c0e\nrand(t), randomly\nsamples a set of controls to apply each 1-3 seconds. The multi-agent RL evader, \u03c0e\nmarl(xrel\nt ), is\ntrained to evade a pre-trained pursuer policy, equivalent to a single iteration of [18]. Finally, assum-\ning perfect relative state, our setting could be modelled by a zero-sum game theory model, whose\nsolution characterizes the optimal pair of policies for the pursuer and the evader [16]. We com-\npute \u03c0e\ngame(xrel\nt ) via an off-the-shelf dynamic game solver [47]. Details on all evaders in Sec. A.3.\nTop row in Fig. 4 shows that with perfect state, the pursuer capture time is indistinguishable be-\ntween random and MARL evaders, while the optimal game theory evader maximally exploits the\ninteraction.\n6\nFigure 4: 500 randomly sampled xrel\n0\ninitial positions and relative orientation. Colors indicate the\nnormalized time-to-capture starting from the shown initial condition. (top row) Policy knows perfect\nphysical state but infers latent intent from history of relative states and pursuer actions, trained\nwith three different evader models: heuristic, MARL, and zero-sum game-theoretic.

We find that the game-theoretic pursuer pol-\nicy makes for a poor supervisor because the super-\nvision and interaction data operate under a perfect\nstate-feedback Nash equilibrium assumption that is\ntoo hard to satisfy for the partially-observable pol-\nicy.\nIn contrast, robots trained against noisily-\noptimal (MARL) or extremely diverse (random)\nevaders have smaller in-distribution performance\ndrops. This indicates that the interaction assump-\ntions under which the teacher policy is obtained must\nbe feasible for the partially-observable student.\n5.3\nFor adaptation, coverage is more helpful than specialization\nUltimately, the test-time distribution of the evader is unknown a priori. Thus, we ask \u201cHow quickly\nand how effectively can different partially-observable pursuer policies adapt to an out of distribution\nevader?\u201d We simulate interaction between \u03c0p\nrand, \u03c0p\nmarl, \u03c0p\ngame and the highly predictable Dubins\u2019\nagent (Sec. A.3.1). None of the pursuers were trained on this behavior. We collect batches of joint\nstate trajectories, and then finetune the weights of the pursuer\u2019s encoder E by supervising the latent\n\u02c6zt at each timestep via the privileged encoder E\u2217. Since \u03c0p\nrand has a generic prior on the evader\nmotion, the representation in E is rich enough to triple its capture frequency in just 5 min. (Fig. 5).\n\u03c0p\nmarl is good at the start, but, due to its prior on the evader motion, it is less flexible and needs\nmore data to see improvements. \u03c0p\ngame, with a stronger prior than \u03c0p\nmarl, fails to adapt and reaches a\nsub-optimal performance with the limited data. This indicates that to quickly adapt to agents \u201cin the\nwild\u201d, which are neither random nor optimal, coverage is more helpful than specialization.\n6\nReal-World Results\nReal-world interactions are out-of-distribution for two main reasons: (1) the behavior of the evader\nis unscripted and possibly very different to what was observed in simulation, and (2) the physical\n7\nFigure 6: Single-shot interaction between a vision-based pursuer policy and a human. Left: Since\nthe human starts outside the FOV of the robot, the latter turns and seeks until it gets the first detection.\nCenter: The robot predicts the human will go straight and gallops to where the person will be.\nRight: Human strategically hides outside robot\u2019s FOV to escape.\ndynamics of the evader do not follow the unicycle model as in simulation. We run two sets of\nexperiments to study how our policies react to such conditions.\nFirst, we ablate the pursuer policy and deploy \u03c0p\nrand, \u03c0p\nmarl, \u03c0p\ngame on a physical quadruped robot\nto interact with a human. We observe that \u03c0p\nrand and \u03c0p\nmarl perform qualitatively similarly. They\nshowcase information-seeking motions when the evader is not in the field of view and predictive\nstrategies when the evader is visible, i.e., heading towards where the evader will be, not where it is\n(Fig. 6). However, \u03c0p\nmarl shows slightly better anticipation and faster reaction times. Conversely,\n\u03c0p\ngame shows inefficient information-seeking motions, taking long detours to reach the evader. Such\nperformance, inline with the experiments from Sec. 5, confirms that the diversity of interaction data\ncollected by a game-theoretic supervisor is not high enough to be robust to real-world interactions.\nSecond, we keep the pursuer policy fixed and ablate the dynamics of the evader. Concretely, we\ncompare the performance of \u03c0p\nrand when interacting against a human or another quadruped teleop-\nerated by a human (Fig. 1). In both cases, we observe aspects of strategic behavior. However, such\nbehavior is more apparent during interaction with another robot. This is due to the robot\u2019s dynamics\nbeing closer to the unicycle model the policy was trained on in simulation. See website for videos.\n7\nDiscussion\nLimitations. Our current approach does not model the affordances of the environment, like obsta-\ncles, that could be strategically used by the pursuer.\nHowever, to achieve this, the pursuer needs\nto sense the environment geometry, potentially making optimization much more challenging. Ad-\nditionally, the limited FOV assumption could be alleviated with different sensor designs (e.g., high-\nresolution 360 FOV camera), but introduce additional challenges like the computational burden of\nprocessing high-resolution images, that are interesting future work.\nConclusions. Our paper takes the first steps toward learning vision-based robot policies that can\nreason strategically through partially-observable physical state and latent intent. We find interesting\npursuer behaviors when deployed on a physical quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera: informa-\ntion gathering under uncertainty, intent prediction from noisy state estimates, and anticipation of\nagents\u2019 motion.\n8\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the DARPA Machine Common Sense program and by the ONR MURI\naward N00014-21- 1-2801.

The\nplots reveal how pursuer policies trained on more optimal but less diverse behavior \u201coverfit\u201d to those\ntypes of maneuvers. For example, consider the top-right where the pursuer policy is trained against\na game theory evader but tested against the random evader. The random evader does not explicitly\nstrategize, but the capture time distribution of the game-theory policy mirrors the distribution when\ninteracting with the game-theoretic evader (Fig. 4).\nA.2\nSimulation & training details\nQuadruped High & Low-level Control. The quadruped uses a pre-computed low-level controller\nfor walking, and is just learning a high-level strategic policy. In this way, our method is agnostic\nto the specific low-level controller. We use an off-the-shelf RL-based approach to train a walking\npolicy [45]. We use this policy during all simulation experiments and during training the high-level\nstrategic policy. The high-level policy we present in this work controls linear and angular velocity,\nup = [vp\nx, vR\n\u03b8 ] \u2208 Up. The control inputs are bounded: vp\nx \u2208 [0, 3] m\ns and vp\n\u03b8 \u2208 [\u22122, 2] rad\ns . Note that\nthe pursuer has a \u223c 17% linear speed advantage over the evader (detailed in Appendix A.3).\nOptimization Details. The episode length for interactions in the Isaac Gym simulator is always\nT = 20s. The high-level quadruped policy runs at 5 Hz, and simulates a new control applied every\n\u03b4t = 0.2s. The low-level quadruped policy runs at 50 Hz. We use the Adam optimizer for both\nPPO and for DAGGER. We use Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activations for the policy network\nand for the encoders. The future state trajectory of the evader is always N = 4s = 8 steps. We train\nthe teacher policies with 3, 000 environments, and the student policy with 8, 000 environments. We\nalways train the high level policy on flat terrain in an infinite plane. Otherwise, we use all the default\nparameters from [45] but remove the cross-entropy loss during PPO.\n12\nA.3\nEvader simulation & policy design\nWe simulate the evader as a unicycle dynamical system, controlling linear and angular velocity,\nue = [ve\nx, ve\n\u03b8] \u2208 Ue. The control inputs are bounded: ve\nx \u2208 [0, 2.5] m\ns and ve\n\u03b8 \u2208 [\u22122, 2] rad\ns .

The z-position is always fixed at\n0.001 and the yaw angle \u03b8e is chosen so the evader is facing away from the pursuer at the start of\nthe episode.\nA.3.1\nDubins\u2019 policy\nThis evader always moves in Dubins\u2019 paths [46] with a fixed time duration for turning or going\nstraight determined randomly upon the start of the episode. Let ve\nx \u2208 [vx, \u00afvx] be the min and max\nlinear velocity commands and ve\n\u03b8 \u2208 [v\u03b8, \u00afv\u03b8] be the min and max angular velocity commands. Let\n\u03c4fwd be the number of seconds for which the evader goes forward, and \u03c4turn be the number of\nseconds to turn. At the start of the episode, each parameter is sampled from the corresponding\nuniform distribution:\n\u03c4fwd \u223c Unif[2, 4],\n\u03c4turn \u223c Unif[0.6, 1.4].\nThe Dubins\u2019 policy switches between two maneuvers depending on if the current time t matches the\ntime interval \u03c4fwd or \u03c4turn:\n\u2022 \u03c4fwd: evader goes forward at max linear velocity, applying ue = [\u00afvx, 0]\n\u2022 \u03c4turn: evader turns while moving at max linear velocity. With 70% probability the evader\nturns the opposite direction as the last turn, and with 30% turning the same direction as last\ntime): ue = [\u00afvx, \u00afv\u03b8] or ue = [\u00afvx, v\u03b8]\nAt the start of the episode, the evader uniformly at random chooses to turn left or right.\nA.3.2\nRandom policy\nThis evader, \u03c0e\nrand(t), randomly samples a motion primitive to apply for a fixed number of seconds,\nbefore re-sampling another motion primitive. The set of motion primitives MP are the Cartesian\nproduct of regularly discretized linear and angular velocities:\nVx = [vx, 0.5vx, 0, 0.5\u00afvx, \u00afvx],\nV\u03b8 = [v\u03b8, 0.5v\u03b8, 0, 0.5\u00afv\u03b8, \u00afv\u03b8],\nMP := Vx \u00d7 V\u03b8\nAt the start of each episode, the duration for applying a motion primitive is randomly sampled to\nbe between 1 \u2212 3 seconds.

The evader is rewarded for maximizing the distance between the two agents at\neach timestep, and obtains a termination penalty upon capture:\nEvasion: rt = 2 \u00b7 ||xe\nt \u2212 xp\nt ||2\n2,\nCapture: rT = \u221280 \u00b7 1{||xe\nT \u2212 xp\nT ||2\n2 \u2264 0.8}.\n(4)\nThe evader trains against a pre-trained, fully-observable pursuer policy: \u03c0\u2217(xrel, zt). This pursuer\nwas originally trained against a random evader, \u03c0e\nrand(t). Since the pursuer is pre-trained, its policy\nis already highly capable of capturing the evader making it difficult for the MARL agent to learn. To\ntackle this, we use a curriculum set at where at each fixed iteration, the pursuer speed in increased\nby 20%. The curriculum is set to [1800, 2000, 2400, 2800, 3100, 3800] iterations.\nFigure 8: Global and relative coordinate system with respect to the pursuer\u2019s coordinate frame.\nA.4\nZero-sum game policies: pursuer and evader\nFor one of our candidate fully-observable supervisor policies, we use an off-the-shelf zero sum\ndifferential game solver [16, 47]. It computes the optimal value of the two-player game, V (xrel, t)\nat each time t \u2208 [0, T] via solving the Hamilton-Jacobi Isaacs Partial Differential Equation, whose\nsolution yields optimal game-theoretic policies for both the pursuer and the evader. Each agents\u2019\nstate is their global position and their heading angle: xi := [pi\nx, pi\ny, \u03b8i]\u22a4,\ni \u2208 {p, e} (see Fig. 8).\nEach agent controls their linear and angular yaw velocity: ui := [vi\nx, vi\n\u03b8] \u2208 Ui and the dynamics\nevolve via a unicycle model:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\u02d9pi\nx\n\u02d9pi\ny\n\u02d9\u03b8i\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\nvi\nx cos(\u03b8i)\nvi\nx sin(\u03b8i)\nvi\n\u03b8\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\n(5)\nEach agent\u2019s policy is defined in their respective relative coordinate system (see Fig. 8 for relative\ncoordinate system in pursuer\u2019s body frame). From the perspective of the pursuer, the relative state\nxrel := [prel\nx , prel\ny , \u03b8rel]\u22a4 consists of the relative xy-position and heading:\n\u03b8rel := \u03b8e \u2212 \u03b8p,\n\u0014\nprel\nx\nprel\ny\n\u0015\n:=\n\u0014\ncos(\u03b8p)\nsin(\u03b8p)\n\u2212 sin(\u03b8p)\ncos(\u03b8p)\n\u0015 \u0014\npe\nx \u2212 pp\nx\npe\ny \u2212 pp\ny\n\u0015\n(6)\nThe continuous-time relative dynamics of the evader in the pursuer\u2019s body frame is defined by:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\u02d9prel\nx\n\u02d9prel\ny\n\u02d9\u03b8rel\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\u2212vp\nx + ve\nx cos(\u03b8rel) + vp\n\u03b8prel\ny\nve\nx sin(\u03b8rel) \u2212 vp\n\u03b8prel\nx\nve\n\u03b8 \u2212 vp\n\u03b8\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb := f(xrel, up, ue).\n(7)\n14\nNote that when solving the game, the dynamics models are assumed to be deterministic.\nThe game is solved over the same time horizon as the episode length in the Isaac Gym simulator:\nT = 20s. The pursuer\u2019s optimal policy is defined as:\n\u03c0p\ngame(xrel, t) := arg min\nup\u2208Up max\nue\u2208Ue \u2207V (xrel, t)\u22a4f(xrel, up, ue),\n(8)\nThe evader\u2019s optimal policy is defined similarly with two changes: 1) the relative state xrel is of the\npursuer\u2019s state in the evader\u2019s body frame, and 2) the min and the max are swapped in Eq. 8.\n\u03c0e\ngame(xrel, t) := arg max\nue\u2208Ue min\nup\u2208Up \u2207V (xrel, t)\u22a4f(xrel, up, ue).\n(9)\nNote that because the joint dynamics are affine in the pursuer and evader controls, the value of the\ngame from the pursuer and evader\u2019s perspective is identical (also known as Isaacs\u2019 condition [13]).\nSupervising the partially-observable policy. Recall that our approach uses supervision from the\nfully-observable policy. The partially-observable policy\u2019s intent estimate, \u02c6zt, is supervised with\nthe teacher\u2019s intent encoding zt and also the pursuer actions, up\nt , are supervised with the teacher\npolicy actions, up,\u2217\nt\n. However, the game-theoretic policy does not generate an explicit latent state\nzt the way that the MARL and Random policy architectures do. Thus, we only supervise partially\nobservable policy\u2019s with the game theory policy \u03c0p,\u2217(xrel\nt , t) at each timestep and we update the\nlatent intent encoder E and the policy \u03c0p weight\u2019s. In the continual learning of Sec. 5.3 we follow\nthis same paradigm: finetune the weights of the encoder and the policy from just action supervision.\nOtherwise the architecture of the partially observable student policy is identical (LSTM for encoding\nwith 3-layer MLP for action network).\nA.5\nKalman Filter\nWe use a linear state transition model,\nxrel\nt+\u03b4t = Axrel\nt\n+ Bup\nt + w\nwhich ignores the role of the evader (i.e., ue\nt \u2261 0) during the the prediction step, and a linear\nobservation model,\nyt = Hxrel\nt\n+ v.\nNote that while the Kalman filter ignores the motion of the evader, the student policy does not.\nIndeed, the student policy uses a history of relative states to predict the future evader\u2019s motion\n(Fig. 2). We intentionally ignore the evader\u2019s motion in the Kalman filter prediction step to waive\nthe requirement for a velocity estimator (which can be cumbersome to obtain and noisy in the real\nworld). While this makes filtering imperfect, we empirically found that the learned policy can cope\nwith the resulting inaccuracies.\nThe state transition model assumes the relative state evolves via a single integrator model, assuming\nup := [vx, vy, v\u03b8], which directly influence the time derivatives of the relative x, y and \u03b8 states. The\nquadruped we used in the experiments cannot control vy directly, so at deployment time this entry of\nthe control input is set to zero.

The policy controls the\nlinear speed of the robot on the x-axis in the body frame, i.e., in the forward direction (vx), and the\nangular yaw velocity (v\u03b8). Such high-level commands are executed by an off-the-shelf low-level\npolicy [4]. We use a Zed 2 camera for object detection in 3D. The object detection pipeline and the\nKalman filter run onboard in a Jetson Tx2, while the low-level controller runs on an Intel UP Board.\nCommunication happens through ROS using the implementation of [4].\nOur policy only controls the pursuer Unitree A1 robot, while the evader is either a human or a Go1\nrobot teleoperated by a human. In both cases, the evader policy is neither pre-scripted nor explicitly\nstrategic. The evader tries to avoid the pursuer with short-horizon evasion maneuvers, but it is not\nstrategic in a long horizon to keep the interaction spatially constrained. We switch between tracking\na person and another robot by changing the tracking class from PERSON to ANIMAL in the ZED\n2 camera configs. We assume that only a single evader is present in the scene; therefore, we do not\nkeep track of object identity. We empirically find that the ANIMAL class has more mis-detections\nthan the PERSON class since the visual features of the quadruped differ from a real dog. Still, the\ndetection performance was sufficient for continuous interaction.\nA.7\nSection 5.1 details: Reactive, Lookback, Lookahead policies\nAll policies use the same simulation setup as in Sec. A.2. The main differences are in the inputs\nand in the latent intent learning. Fig. 9 visualizes the policy architectures for the reactive, lookback\nand lookahead policies. We also compare training time of our lookahead approach\u2013which uses\nfuture trajectory information as privileged info to learn the latent intent\u2013to a lookback policy which\nmust estimate the latent intent only from a history of relative states via an LSTM. We see that future\ntrajectory supervision enables 10 times faster training compared to the lookback policy (Fig. 10) as\nwell as higher overall reward.\n1.9\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n30.0\nTraining Time [Hours]\n\u2212200\n\u2212175\n\u2212150\n\u2212125\n\u2212100\n\u221275\n\u221250\n\u221225\n0\nReward\nLookback\nLookahead\nFigure 10: The lookahead policy (orange) converges to a higher reward 10 times faster than the\nlookback policy (green)\n16\nA.8\nNote on directly learning a strategic pursuer policy with PPO\nWe tried to directly learn a policy with partial observations, \u03c0(\u02c6xt, \u03a3t), using PPO. However, our\npolicies never got a performance better than random. We believe the main reason to be the difficulty\nof the optimization problem. Indeed, such a policy needs to learn at the same time: (1) strategy,\ni.e., learning to predict where the evader will be, (2) control, i.e., learning to move towards a desired\nlocation on the x-y plane, and (3) estimation, i.e., learning to reason over the noisy states from the\nKalman filter to get an estimate of the real position of the evader. We empirically found that PPO\nfails to do all these tasks simultaneously. However, we found that PPO could easily solve (1) and\n(2) if provided with a short-horizon future trajectory of the evader: this corresponds to our fully-\nobservable training. To reduce sample complexity, we learn (3) using distillation learning, even\nthough it could as well be trained with a further stage of reinforcement learning. An interesting\nvenue for future work is to see how to learn such policy directly.\n17\n"

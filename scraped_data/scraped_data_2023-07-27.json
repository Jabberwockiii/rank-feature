However, real-world audio creation aims to generate harmonious au-\ndio containing various elements such as speech, music, and sound effects with\ncontrollable conditions, which is challenging to address using existing audio\ngeneration systems. We present WavJourney, a novel framework that leverages\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to connect various audio models for audio cre-\nation. WavJourney allows users to create storytelling audio content with diverse\naudio elements simply from textual descriptions. Specifically, given a text in-\nstruction, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate an audio script that serves\nas a structured semantic representation of audio elements. The audio script is\nthen converted into a computer program, where each line of the program calls a\ntask-specific audio generation model or computational operation function. The\ncomputer program is then executed to obtain a compositional and interpretable\nsolution for audio creation.\nExperimental results suggest that WavJourney is\ncapable of synthesizing realistic audio aligned with textually-described seman-\ntic, spatial and temporal conditions, achieving state-of-the-art results on text-to-\naudio generation benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a new multi-genre story\nbenchmark. Subjective evaluations demonstrate the potential of WavJourney in\ncrafting engaging storytelling audio content from text. We further demonstrate\nthat WavJourney can facilitate human-machine co-creation in multi-round dia-\nlogues. To foster future research, the code and synthesized audio are available at:\nhttps://audio-agi.github.io/WavJourney_demopage/.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nThe emerging field of multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI), a realm where visual, auditory, and\ntextual data converge, opens up fascinating possibilities in our day-to-day life, ranging from per-\nsonalized entertainment to advanced accessibility features. As a powerful intermediary, natural lan-\nguage shows great potential to enhance understanding and facilitate communication across multiple\nsensory domains. Large Language Models (LLMs), which are designed to understand and interact\nwith human language, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in acting as agents (Shen et al.,\n2023; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023), engaging with a broad range of AI models to address various\nmulti-modal challenges. While LLMs are regarded as effective multi-modal task solvers, an open\nquestion remains: can these models also become creators of engaging, realistic multimedia content?\nMultimedia content creation involves digital media production in multiple forms, such as text, im-\nages, and audio. As a vital element of multimedia, audio not only provides context and conveys\nemotions but also fosters immersive experiences, guiding auditory perception and engagement. In\nthis work, we address a novel problem of compositional audio creation with language instructions,\nwhich aims to automatically generate audio storytelling content using various elements such as\n1\narXiv:2307.14335v2  [cs.SD]  26 Nov 2023\nUnder Review\nFigure 1: The overview of the WavJourney. The LLM is first prompted to be an audio script writer.\nAs a conceptual representation of audio, the audio script provides the user with an interactive and\ninterpretable interface. The audio script is then compiled using a script compiler and executed as a\ncomputer program. The execution process is powered by a set of expert audio generation models.\nThe example illustrates a Sci-Fi audio storytelling creation given the text instruction: \u201cGenerate an\naudio Science Fiction: Galactic nomad trades stories from different universes at cosmic crossroads.\u201d\nspeech, music, and sound effects from textual descriptions. Prior works have leveraged generative\nmodels to synthesize audio context that aligns with task-specific conditions, such as speech tran-\nscriptions (Panayotov et al., 2015), music descriptions (Agostinelli et al., 2023), and audio captions\n(Kim et al., 2019). However, the capabilities of these models to generate audio beyond such con-\nditions are often limited, falling short of the demand for audio creation in real-world scenarios. In\nlight of the integrative and collaborative capabilities of LLMs, it is intuitive to ask: can we leverage\nthe potential of LLMs and these expert audio generation models for compositional audio creation?\nCompositional audio creation presents inherent challenges due to the complexities of synthesizing\nintricate and dynamic audio content. Harnessing LLMs for compositional audio creation presents a\nrange of challenges: 1) Contextual comprehension and design: using LLMs for compositional audio\ncreation requires them not only to comprehend textual instructions but also to design audio story-\nlines featuring speech, music, and sound effects. How to expand the capabilities of LLMs in text\ngeneration to audio storytelling is a challenge; 2) Audio production and composition: unlike vision\nand language data, an audio signal is characterized by dynamic spatio-temporal relationships among\nits constituent audio elements. Leveraging LLMs for integrating various audio generation models\nto produce sound elements and further compose them into a harmonious whole presents additional\nchallenges; 3) Interactive and interpretable creation: Establishing an interpretable pipeline to facil-\nitate human engagement is critical in automated audio production, as it enhances creative control\nand adaptability, fostering human-machine collaboration. However, designing such an interactive\nand interpretable creation pipeline with LLMs remains an ongoing question.\n2\nUnder Review\nWe introduce WavJourney, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for compositional audio cre-\nation guided by language instructions. Specifically, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate a\nstructured audio script, which includes the content descriptions of speech, music, and sound effects\nwhile considering their spatio-temporal relationship. To handle intricate auditory scenes, WavJour-\nney decomposes them into individual acoustic elements along with their acoustic layout. The audio\nscript is then fed into a designed script compiler, converting it into a computer program. Each line of\nprogram code invokes a task-specific audio generation model, audio I/O functions, or computational\noperation functions. The computer program is subsequently executed to generate and compose the\naudio content. The overview of WavJourney with an example illustrates a science fiction audio\nstorytelling creation is shown in Figure 1.\nWavJourney offers multiple benefits for audio creation: as it is 1) Contextually adaptive, by leverag-\ning the understanding capability and generalizable knowledge of LLMs, WavJourney can design au-\ndio storytelling scripts with diverse sound elements, and intricate acoustic relationships; 2) Compo-\nsitional, benefiting from its composable design, WavJourney can automatically decompose complex\nauditory scenes into independent sound elements, enabling the integration of various task-specific\naudio generation models to controllably create audio content. Our approach differs from previous\nmethods (Liu et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023a), where end-to-end generation often fails to gen-\nerate audio aligned with complex textual descriptions; 3) Training-free, as WavJourney eliminates\nthe need for training audio generation models or fine-tuning LLMs, making it resource-efficient; 4)\nInteractive, The interpretability offered by both the audio script and computer program facilitates\naudio producers with varying expertise to engage with WavJourney, fostering human-machine co-\ncreation in real-world audio production. WavJourney advances audio creation beyond traditional\ntask-specific conditions and opens up new avenues for computational creativity in audio production.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We present WavJourney, a framework that leverages LLMs for compositional audio cre-\nation. Given textual instructions, WavJourney can create audio storytelling content encom-\npassing speech, music, and sound effects, without the need for additional training.\n\u2022 We assess WavJourney\u2019s capability on the AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019) and\nClotho (Drossos et al., 2020) text-to-audio generation benchmarks.\nResults show that\nWavJourney outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objec-\ntive evaluations. Notably, WavJourney\u2019s synthesized audio even outperforms the ground\ntruth audio of AudioCaps in subjective tests, suggesting a potential capability to produce\nrealistic and contextually relevant audio from texts.\n\u2022 We present a multi-genre storytelling benchmark along with various subjective metrics\nsuch as engagement, creativity and emotional resonance. Subjective evaluations show that\nWavJourney can craft audio storytelling with positive scores in subjective metrics and out-\nperforms state-of-the-art text-to-audio synthesis models.\n\u2022 We further demonstrate that WavJourney enables interactive audio creation in multi-round\ndialogues, facilitating human-machine co-creation in audio production applications.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), LLaMA (Touvron\net al., 2023a), and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) have advanced the research area of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) due to their capability to generate human-like text. Recently, LLMs have emerged\nas agents, demonstrating their capability to address intricate AI tasks by integrating a range of\ndomain-specific AI models. ViperGPT (Suris et al., 2023) and VisProg (Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023)\nhave demonstrated the significant promise of LLMs in decomposing complex vision-language tasks\nsuch as visual reasoning and text-to-image generation. These methods can generate a computer\nprogram (e.g., Python code) for each decomposed sub-task, which is executed sequentially to offer\nan explainable task solution. HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023) leverages ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022)\nas a controller to manage existing AI models in HuggingFace (HuggingFace, 2016) for solving AI\ntasks in the domain of language, vision, and speech. Similar to HuggingGPT, AudioGPT (Huang\net al., 2023b) connects multiple audio foundation models to solve tasks with speech, music, sound\nunderstanding, and generation in multi-round dialogues. In the context of existing research, con-\n3\nUnder Review\nsiderable efforts have been dedicated to leveraging the integrative and collaborative capabilities of\nLLMs to solve multi-modal tasks. However, there remains a relatively unexplored area concerning\nthe potential of LLMs in audio content creation.\nAudio Creation. The process of audio creation is complex and dynamic, involving various com-\nponents such as content design, music composition, audio engineering, and audio synthesis. Tradi-\ntional methods have relied on human-involved approaches such as field recording (Gallagher, 2015),\nFoley art (Wright, 2014), and music composition (Tokui et al., 2000) co-existing with digital sig-\nnal processing modules (Reiss, 2011). In recent years, the intersection of AI and audio creation\nhas gained significant attention. AI-driven approaches, particularly generative models, have demon-\nstrated promising results in synthesizing audio content for speech (Tan et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\n2017; Wu et al., 2023), music (Agostinelli et al., 2023; Copet et al., 2023), sound effects (Liu et al.,\n2023a; Huang et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2023b), or specific types of sounds, such\nas footsteps or violin (Bresin et al., 2010; Engel et al., 2020). Existing audio generation models\nprimarily focus on synthesizing audio content based on a particular type of task condition, such as\nspeech transcriptions (Panayotov et al., 2015), music descriptions (Agostinelli et al., 2023), or audio\ncaptions (Kim et al., 2019), and they are not designed to generate compositional audio contain-\ning speech, music, and sound effects with controllable textual conditions. Leveraging data-driven\napproaches for addressing compositional audio creation is resource-intensive. It demands the col-\nlection of a sophisticated audio dataset with corresponding text annotations, as well as the training\nof powerful audio models.\n3\nWAVJOURNEY\nWavJourney is a collaborative system composed of an audio script writer utilizing LLMs, a script\ncompiler and a set of audio generation models such as zero-shot text-to-speech1, text-to-music, and\ntext-to-audio generation models. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. The pipeline of\nWavJourney can be deconstructed into two major steps: 1) Audio script generation: given a text\ninstruction, the audio script writer initiates the process by warping the input instruction with specific\nprompts. Then, the LLM is engaged with these prompts, which directs it to generate an audio script\nconforming to the structured format. 2) Script compiling and program execution: Subsequently, the\nscript compiler transcribes the audio scripts into a computer program. The computer program is\nfurther executed by calling the APIs of expert audio generation models to create audio content. We\ndescribe the details of these two steps in the following sections.\n3.1\nAUDIO SCRIPT GENERATION\nThe first challenge in harnessing LLMs for audio content creation lies in generating an audio nar-\nrative script based on the input text instructions that often only contain conceptual and abstract\ndescriptions. Recognizing that LLMs have internalized generalizable text knowledge, we utilize\nLLMs to expand input text instructions into audio scripts, including detailed descriptions of de-\ncomposed acoustic contexts such as speech, music, and sound effects. To handle spatio-temporal\nacoustic relationships, we prompt LLMs to output the audio script in a structured format composed\nof a list of JSON nodes. Each JSON node symbolizes an audio element, including acoustic attributes\n(e.g., duration and volume). In this way, a complex auditory scene can be decomposed into a series\nof single acoustic components. Then, we can create the desired audio content by leveraging diverse\ndomain-specific audio generation models. We introduce these details in the following paragraphs.\nFormat of Audio Script. We define three types of audio elements: speech, music, and sound effects.\nFor each audio element, there are two types of layouts: foreground and background. Foreground au-\ndio components are concatenated sequentially, i.e. no overlap with each other. Background audio on\nthe other hand can only be played along with some foreground elements, i.e. they can not be played\nindependently (overlaps of background audio are allowed). Sound effects and music can either be\nforeground or background, while speech can only be foreground. The concepts above are reflected\nin the format of a list consisting of a series of JSON nodes, with each node embodying a unique\naudio component. Each node is supplemented with a textual description of its content. To enhance\n1Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) refers to the ability of a TTS system to generate speech in a voice that has\nnot been explicitly trained on, given an unseen voice preset as a condition for zero-shot synthesis.\n4\nUnder Review\nthe auditory experience, each audio component is assigned a volume attribute. Sound effects and\nmusical elements are furnished with an additional attribute pertaining to length, facilitating control\nover their duration. For speech components, a character attribute is assigned. This attribute enables\nthe synthesis of personalized voices in the later stage, thereby enhancing the narrative thread of\naudio storytelling. This layered structuring and detailing of audio elements contribute to creating\nrich and dynamic audio content. We observe that the outlined format is able to cover a wide variety\nof auditory scenarios and its simplified list-like structure facilitates the understanding of LLMs for\ncomplex auditory scenes. An example of the audio script is shown in the Listing 1.\nPersonalized Voice Setting. Advances in zero-shot TTS have facilitated the synthesis of personal-\nized speech based on specific voice presets. In WavJourney, we leverage zero-shot TTS to amplify\nthe narrative depth of audio storytelling, utilizing a set of voice presets tailored for diverse scenarios.\nMore specifically, each voice preset is provided with descriptions of its characteristics and appro-\npriate application scenarios. In subsequent stages, we can leverage LLM to allocate a suitable voice\nfrom the preset to each character outlined in the audio script. We utilize a simple prompt design\nto facilitate the voice allocation process, as discussed in the next paragraph. This design enables\nWavJourney to create personalized auditory experiences.\nPrompt Strategy. To generate rich and formatted audio scripts from given text instructions, we wrap\nthe text instructions within a prompt template. The prompt template contains the specifications of\neach JSON node type, including audio type, layout, and attributes. The prompt template is shown\nin Table 5 in Appendix A.2. The instructions listed in the prompt template facilitate formatting\nthe audio script generated by LLMs. In the next step, following the receipt of the generated audio\nscripts, we instruct the LLM to parse the characters outlined in each speech node into personalized\nspeech presets. The prompt used for voice parsing is shown in Table 6 in Appendix A.2. The audio\nscript with parsed voice mapping is further processed through the script compiler, generating the\ncode for subsequent stages.\n3.2\nSCRIPT COMPILING AND PROGRAM EXECUTION\nWavJourney employs a script compiler to automatically transcribe the audio script into a computer\nprogram. The pseudo-code of the script compiler is described in Appendix A.4. Each line of com-\npiled code in the program invokes a task-specific audio generation model, audio I/O function, or\ncomputational operation function (e.g., mix, concatenate). The program is subsequently executed,\nresulting in an explainable solution for compositional audio creation. In contrast to previous stud-\nies that utilize LLMs to generate code (Suris et al., 2023; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023), WavJourney\nprompts LLMs to generate textual audio scripts, which foster improved comprehension for audio\nproducers without programming expertise. Additionally, the process of crafting a computer pro-\ngram to compose intricate auditory scenes requires an elaborate series of procedures within the\ncode to manage audio length calculations and the mixing or concatenation operations of audio clips.\nGiven the unpredictability of LLMs (Shen et al., 2023), there are occasions when they may fail to\nadhere to specified instructions during the generation process. By introducing a script compiler, we\ncan mitigate the potential exceptions in the program workflow arising from the instability of LLMs,\nthereby reducing this uncertainty during inference.\n4\nAUDIO STORYTELLING BENCHMARK\nWe introduce a multi-genre story benchmark with five storytelling genres in real-world contexts:\neducation, radio play, romantic drama, science fiction (Sci-Fi), and travel exploration. For each\ngenre, we prompted ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) to generate ten story titles, each ranging from 15\nto 25 words. This diverse set of generated stories is designed to be a benchmark for evaluating\nWavJourney\u2019s capabilities in audio storytelling creation. The story examples can be found in Table\n1. Inspired by expert-driven metrics design process (Shah et al., 2003), we further design a subjec-\ntive evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing the generated audio storytelling using five\nmetrics: engaging, creativity, relevance, emotional resonance, and pace & tempo. Each metric is\nscored from 1 to 5, and the details of each metric are described in Table 2. Our subjective evaluation\nprotocol is developed with input from audio and product experts, allows for an assessment that goes\nbeyond traditional evaluations (e.g., Mean Opinion Score (Ribeiro et al., 2011)) to consider narrative\ncomplexity, music and sound design, and vocal delivery in a coherent and comprehensive manner.\n5\nUnder Review\nGenre\nStory Title Example\nEducation\n\u201cMathematics in Nature: Exploring Fibonacci Sequences and Golden Ratios\u201d\nRadio Play\n\u201cElla and Sean, in playful debate, as pastries crumble and cappuccinos steam\u201d\nRomantic Drama\n\u201cSecrets whispered, emotions swell, two hearts navigating love\u2019s turbulent sea\u201d\nSci-Fi\n\u201cMars colonists find ancient alien artifacts; Earth\u2019s history is not ours alone\u201d\nTravel Exploration\n\u201cIceland\u2019s geysers and elves: a land where nature\u2019s fury meets mythical tales\u201d\nTable 1: Examples of multi-genre audio storytelling benchmark.\nScore\nEngaging\nCreativity\nRelevance\nEmotional Resonance\nPace & Tempo\n1\nNot at all\nNot at all\nNot at all\nNot at all\nToo Slow\n2\nSlightly\nSlightly\nSlightly\nSlightly\nSlightly Slow\n3\nModerately\nModerately\nModerately\nModerately\nJust Right\n4\nVery\nVery\nVery\nVery\nSlightly Fast\n5\nExtremely\nExtremely\nExtremely\nExtremely\nToo Fast\nTable 2: Subjective evaluation protocol for audio storytelling creation.\n5\nEXPERIMENTS\n5.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nWavJourney Setup. We utilize the GPT-4 model (OpenAI, 2022) as the LLMs for WavJourney. For\ntext-to-music and text-to-audio generation, we adopt the publicly available state-of-the-art models\nMusicGen (Copet et al., 2023) and AudioGen (Kreuk et al., 2022), respectively. As for text-to-\nspeech synthesis, we leverage the Bark (Suno, 2023) model, which can generate realistic speech and\nis able to match the tone, pitch, emotion, and prosody of a given voice preset. We use four voice\npresets2 drawn from Bark\u2019s official voice presets3 as the WavJourney\u2019s default voice settings. To\nenhance the quality of synthesized speech, we apply the speech restoration model VoiceFixer (Liu\net al., 2022) after the Bark model. We use 16 kHz sampling rate for processing audio signals. We\nimplement the computer program in the Python language. For the volume control of the generated\naudio content, we adopt the Loudness Unit Full Scale (LUFS) standard (Steinmetz & Reiss, 2021).\nText-to-Audio Generation Evaluation. We assess the performance of WavJourney in text-to-audio\ngeneration on AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019) and Clotho (Drossos et al., 2020) benchmarks. For com-\nparison, we use two publicly available state-of-the-art text-to-audio generation models: AudioGen\n(Kreuk et al., 2022) and AudioLDM (Liu et al., 2023a) as the baseline systems. All audio samples\nwere sampled at 16 kHz for evaluation. Datasets and baseline reproduction details are described\nin the Appendix A.1. We use both objective and subjective methods for evaluation. To control the\nlength of WavJourney-generated audio for fair comparison, we simply add the duration condition as\na suffix for input prompts (e.g., \u201cthe duration of generated audio must be 10 seconds.\u201d ).\nFor objective evaluation, in line with previous works (Kreuk et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a; Yuan\net al., 2023a), we adopt the objective metrics: Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), Kullback-Leibler\nDivergence (KL), Inception Score (IS) for evaluation. FAD calculates the Frechet distance between\nthe distribution of the embedding value of two audio groups, extracted through a pre-trained VGGish\nmodel (Hershey et al., 2017). KL presents the similarity between the logit distributions of two\ngroups of audio calculated by an audio tagging model, Patch-out Transformer (Koutini et al., 2021).\nIS illustrates the variety and diversity of the target audio group. A higher IS indicates a larger\nvariety with vast distinction, while both KL and FAD indicate better audio fidelity with lower scores.\nObjective metrics were computed for each model across the AudioCaps and Clotho test sets.\nFor subjective evaluation, following previous work (Kreuk et al., 2022), we adopt metrics: Overall\nImpression (OVL) and Audio and Text Relation (REL). Both OVL and REL metrics have a Likert\nscale (Likert, 1932) between one and five, where a larger number indicates better performance.\nFurthermore, we perform a preference-based subjective evaluation where listeners compare audio\n2Male voices: \u2018v2/en speaker 1\u2019, \u2018v2/en speaker 6\u2019; Female voices: \u2018v2/en speaker 9\u2019, \u2018v2/de speaker 3\u2019.\n3https://github.com/suno-ai/bark/tree/main/bark/assets/prompts\n6\nUnder Review\nfiles from two different systems using the same text description, choosing the one that sounds better\nconsidering its corresponding text condition. In the subjective evaluation, we used 50 audio files,\nrandomly sampled from the AudioCaps and Clotho test sets, respectively. In all subjective tests,\nWavJourney is compared against the baseline systems as well as the ground truth (GT) audio.\nAudio Storytelling Creation Evaluation. We evaluate the capability of WavJourney in audio sto-\nrytelling creation on the story benchmark using the subjective evaluation protocol introduced in\nSection 4. For baselines, we compare WavJourney with AudioGen and AudioLDM systems. Each\ngenerated audio story lasts approximately 30 to 60 seconds.\n5.2\nRESULTS ON TEXT-TO-AUDIO GENERATION\nResults on AudioCaps. WavJourney outperforms AudioGen and AudioLDM systems in all subjec-\ntive tests on the AudioCaps benchmark. As shown in the left part of Table 3, WavJourney achieves an\nOVL score of 3.75 and a REL score of 3.74. Compared with AudioLDM and AudioGen, WavJour-\nney has 0.36 and 0.19 higher in OVL, and 0.4 and 0.22 higher in REL, respectively. WavJourney\neven marginally surpasses the ground truth audio in the OVL (3.73) metric and is on par in the REL\n(3.76) metric. The subjective preference-based testing results are consistent with the OVL and REL\nresults, as shown on the left side of Figure 2. Specifically, against AudioGen, WavJourney is su-\nperior in approximately 40% of the cases, while AudioGen outperforms WavJourney in 27.2% of\ninstances. No distinguishable difference is noted in 34.7% of the cases. When compared to Au-\ndioLDM, WavJourney excels in roughly 48.7% of the cases, lags in about 24.4%, and both share\ncomparable performance in 26.9% of scenarios. The comparison against ground truth indicates that\nWavJourney surpasses in 35.6% of cases, they both match without clear differentiation in 40%,\nand WavJourney is only inferior in 24.4% of the instances. Notably, WavJourney is the first au-\ndio generation system that can exceed real-world audio performance on the AudioCaps benchmark,\nsuggesting its capability to generate realistic and contextually relevant audio content from texts. We\nfound that WavJourney\u2019s objective evaluation results slightly underperform compared to AudioGen.\nThis contrasts with our subjective assessments, suggesting that the objective evaluation (e.g., FAD)\nmay not always be an effective way to evaluate the performance of text-to-audio generation systems,\nwhich is consistent with conclusions drawn in previous work. (Choi et al., 2023).\nResults on Clotho. WavJourney surpasses AudioGen and AudioLDM systems across all three\nobjective metrics on the Clotho benchmark, as shown in the right part of Table 3. Specifically,\nAudioGen demonstrates better performance over AudioLDM with scores of 2.55, 2.21, and 7.41\nfor FAD, KL, and IS metrics, respectively. WavJourney achieves a FAD score of 1.75, a KL score\nof 2.18, and an IS score of 9.15. The subjective evaluation results are consistent with the objective\nmetrics. AudioGen and AudioLDM demonstrate comparable performance, achieving an OVL score\nof 3.41 and a REL score of approximately 3.37. WavJourney outperforms both by a significant\nmargin, with an OVL score of 3.61 and a REL score of 3.56. The performance of WavJourney and\nground truth is closely approximated, where the ground truth audio files have high quality sourced\nfrom the Freesound platform (Font et al., 2013). Specifically, the performance gap is merely 0.1 and\n0.15 for OVL and REL metrics, respectively, demonstrating the strong performance of our proposed\nsystem. WavJourney achieves a new state-of-the-art on the Clotho benchmark in terms of both\nobjective and subjective metrics.\nThe results of subjective preference-based testing are shown on the right side of Figure 2. WavJour-\nney outperforms AudioGen in 42.8% of cases while being outperformed in 25.6%. Compared with\nAudioLDM, WavJourney leads in 44.5% of cases but lags in 26.5%. There is no clear difference in\nroughly 30% of cases for both systems. The comparison conclusion against AudioGen and Audi-\noLDM is coherent with the above objective and subjective evaluation results. However, the ground\ntruth audio outperformed WavJourney in a substantial 63.7% of the cases, indicating there is poten-\ntial space for improvement on the Clotho benchmark.\nCase Studies and Analysis. We randomly select two audio clips with complex captions (e.g., more\nthan 15 words, containing at least three sound events) from the AudioCaps test set. We further\nperform case studies to study the effectiveness of WavJourney, compared with the AudioLDM and\nAudioGen systems. The results and comparison are shown in Figure 3, and synthesized audio files\nare available on the project page. We manually localize each sound event in the spectrogram using\nthe colored line underneath per spectrogram for visualization.

WavJourney not only successfully generates all desired audio elements, including intel-\nligible speech, but can also organize each audio element in the proper temporal-spatio layout as\ndescribed in the text (e.g., two events happening simultaneously when instructed by the word \u201cas\u201d\nor one sound is behind another when the word \u201cfollow\u201d appears).

WavJourney performs well in generating audio\nstorytelling with appropriate pacing and tempo and achieves positive scores i.e., marginally above\nthe moderate level for aspects including engagement, creativity, relevance, and emotional resonance\nfor all genres. Compared with baselines, WavJourney consistently outperforms both AudioLDM and\nAudioGen across all evaluated aspects. The subjective evaluation results demonstrate the practicality\nof WavJourney in real-world audio production applications and indicate its potential in crafting\nengaging audio storytelling from texts. We will release all the synthesized audio files for future\ncomparison. Synthesized audio clips are available on the project page.\nGenre\nEngaging\nCreativity\nRelevance\nEmotional Resonance\nPace & Tempo\nAudioGen\n2.09\n2.17\n2.18\n2.09\n2.56\nAudioLDM\n2.12\n2.18\n2.18\n2.23\n2.50\nWavJourney\n3.28\n3.18\n3.52\n3.04\n2.97\nTable 4: Subjective evaluation results on the proposed multi-genre audio storytelling benchmark.\n5.4\nHUMAN-MACHINE CO-CREATION\nThe natural interface of the audio script is designed to enable audio producers to actively engage\nin automated audio creation. By leveraging the communication capabilities of LLMs, WavJourney\n8\nUnder Review\nFigure 3: Case studies on AudioCaps benchmark.\nFigure 4: An illustrative example of human-machine co-creation.\nallows users to customize the audio content through multi-round dialogues. We perform several\ncase studies on the AudioCaps dataset. As shown in Figure 4. Initially, WavJourney was requested\nto synthesize the audio content conditioned on the provided text descriptions, followed by dynamic\nchanges to the audio elements through multi-round dialogues, such as adding new audio elements\n(e.g., \u201cadd a dog barking background and a man shouting after cow mooting\u201d) or modifying acoustic\nattributes (e.g., \u201cadjust the goat bleating sound to 3 seconds\u201d). Furthermore, we provide another\ncase study on radio play storytelling creation, with the focus on speech content control, as shown\nin Figure 5 and 6. The successful execution of these tasks by WavJourney demonstrates its great\npromise in fostering human-machine co-creation.\n6\nLIMITATIONS\nAlthough WavJourney can create audio content with text instructions, limitations could be observed\nas follows: 1) Extensibility: WavJourney relies on structured audio scripts to represent auditory\nscenes and script compilers to generate computer programs, which is inflexible to expand its func-\ntional capabilities; 2) Artificial composition: The process of decomposing and re-mixing audio may\nresult in synthetic audio that deviates from real-world sound distributions, particularly concerning\nmusic composition, which requires the alignment of beats, chord progression, and melody in multi-\nple music tracks; 3) Efficiency: The reliance of WavJourney on LLMs and multiple audio generation\nmodels introduces time costs when generating complex audio content. Improving the efficiency of\nWavJourney could facilitate its practicality for real-world applications.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we presented WavJourney, which connects LLMs with diverse expert audio genera-\ntion models, enabling compositional audio creation via natural language instructions. WavJourney\ncan schedule various expert audio generation models to create audio content by decomposing audi-\ntory scenes into individual audio elements with their acoustic relationships. Extensive experiments\nsuggest that WavJourney is can generate realistic audio from captions and also demonstrate great po-\ntential in crafting engaging audio storytelling from the text. WavJourney opens up new avenues for\nadvancing Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in the realm of audio content creation.\n9\nUnder Review\nREFERENCES\nAndrea Agostinelli, Timo I Denk, Zalan Borsos, Jesse Engel, Mauro Verzetti, Antoine Caillon,\nQingqing Huang, Aren Jansen, Adam Roberts, Marco Tagliasacchi, Matt Sharifi, Neil Zeghidour,\nand Christian Frank.

As the AudioSet is sourced from YouTube, the\nquality of audio clips in the AudioCaps is diverse. AudioCaps is divided into three splits: train-\ning, validation, and testing sets. The audio clips are annotated by humans with natural language\ndescriptions through the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-sourced platform. Each audio clip in the\ntraining sets has a single human-annotated caption, while each clip in the validation and test set has\nfive ground-truth captions. We retrieved AudioCaps based on the AudioSet we downloaded. Our\nretrieved AudioCaps dataset contains 49 274/49 837 audio clips in the training set, 494/495 clips in\nthe validation set, and 929/975 clips in the test set.\nClotho Dataset Clotho is an audio captioning dataset that contains high-quality sound clips ob-\ntained from the FreeSound platform4. Each audio clip in Clotho has been annotated via the Amazon\nMechanical Turk crowd-sourced platform. Particular attention was paid to fostering diversity in the\ncaptions during the annotation process. In this work, we use Clotho v2 which was released for Task\n6 of the DCASE 2021 Challenge5. Clotho v2 contains 3839, 1045, and 1045 audio clips for the\ndevelopment, validation, and test split respectively. Each audio clip is annotated with five captions.\nAudio clips are of 15 to 30 seconds in duration and captions are 8 to 20 words long.\nBaseline Results Reproduction We use the official implementations of AudioGen6, AudioLDM7\nto synthesize audio from textual descriptions drawn from AudioCaps and Clotho test sets. For the\nAudioCaps dataset, which exclusively comprises 10-second audio clips, we maintain consistency\nby setting all our results to this same duration. In contrast, the Clotho evaluation set contains audio\nclips of varying lengths. To ensure fairness, we randomly select audio lengths ranging from 15 to\n30 seconds for Clotho, reflecting the diverse nature of this dataset. For each audio in the AudioCaps\nand Clotho test sets, we use its first textual description as the input condition. As a result, for each\nmodel, we produced 929 samples for AudioCaps and 1045 audio clips for Clotho, respectively.\nSubjective Evaluation Setup. Our subjective evaluations were carried out using Amazon Mechan-\nical Turk8, a renowned crowd-sourcing platform. We provided raters with detailed instructions and\nillustrative examples to ensure a consistent evaluation process. To maintain the reliability of our\nresults, we imposed specific criteria for the participating workers: a minimum average approval rate\nof 60% and a history of at least 50 approved tasks. Each audio sample was assessed by a minimum\nof 10 different raters. The final score for each system was calculated by averaging scores across all\nraters and audio samples. We ensured fair compensation for the participants, with payments aligning\nwith or exceeding the US minimum wage. The human subjective evaluation conducted in this work\nhas received a favorable opinion from the ethics committee at the authors\u2019 affiliated institution.\n4https://freesound.org/\n5https://dcase.community/challenge2021\n6https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/\n7https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM\n8https://requester.mturk.com/\n13\nUnder Review\nA.2\nPROMPT TEMPLATES\nPrompt #1\nI want you to act as an audio script writer. I\u2019ll give you an instruction which is a general idea\nand you will make it an audio script in List format containing a series of JSON nodes.\nThe script must follow the rules below:\nEach line represents an audio JSON node. There are three types of audio: sound effects, music,\nand speech. For each audio, there are two types of layouts: foreground and background. Fore-\nground audios are played sequentially, and background audios are sound effects or music which\nare played while the foreground audio is being played.\nSound effects can be foreground or background. For sound effects, you must provide its layout,\nvolume (dB, LUFS standard), length (in seconds), and detailed description of the sound effect.\nExample: {\u201caudio type\u201d: \u201csound effect\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d: \u201cforeground\u201d, \u201cvol\u201d: -35, \u201clen\u201d: 2, \u201cdesc\u201d:\n\u201cAirport beeping sound\u201d}\nMusic can be foreground or background. For music, you must provide its layout, volume (dB,\nLUFS standard), length (in seconds), and detailed description of the music.\nExample: {\u201caudio type\u201d: \u201cmusic\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d: \u201cforeground\u201d, \u201cvol\u201d: -35, \u201clen\u201d: 10, \u201cdesc\u201d: \u201cUp-\nlifting newsroom music\u201d}\nSpeech can only be foreground. For speech, you must provide the character, volume (dB, LUFS\nstandard), and the character\u2019s line. You do not need to specify the length of the speech.\nExample: {\u201caudio type\u201d: \u201cspeech\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d: \u201cforeground\u201d, \u201ccharacter\u201d:\u201c\u201dNews Anchor\u201d,\n\u201cvol\u201d: -15, \u201ctext\u201d: \u201cGood evening, this is BBC News\u201d}\nFor background sound effects, you must specify the id of the background sound effect, and you\nmust specify the beginning and the end of a background sound effect in separate lines, hence\nyou do not need to specify the length of the audio.\nExample: {\u201caudio type\u201d: \u201csound effect\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d: \u201cbackground\u201d, \u201cid\u201d:1, \u201caction\u201d: \u201cbegin\u201d,\n\u201cvol\u201d: -35, \u201cdesc\u201d: \u201dAirport ambiance\u201d} ... {\u201caudio type\u201d: \u201csound effect\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d: \u201cback-\nground\u201d, \u201cid\u201d:1, \u201caction\u201d: \u201dend\u201d}\nFor background music, it\u2019s the same as background sound effects.\nThe output format must be a list of the root node containing all the audio JSON nodes.\nTable 5: Prompt template used for generating audio scripts.\n14\nUnder Review\nPrompt #2\nGiven an audio script in json format, for each character that appeared in the \u201ccharacter\u201d\nattribute, you should map the character to a \u201cvoice type\u201d according to their lines and\nthe \u201cvoice types\u201d features. Each character must be mapped to a different voice type, and\neach \u201cvoice type\u201d must be from one of the following:\n- Female1: a normal female adult voice, British accent\n- Female2: a normal female adult voice, American accent\n- Male1: a normal male adult voice, British accent\n- Male2: a normal male adult voice, American accent\nOutput should be in the format of CSV, like:\n\u201c\u2018\n[character 1], [voice type 1]\n[character 2], [voice type 2]\n...\n\u201d\u2019\nTable 6: Prompt template used for voice parsing.\nA.3\nEXAMPLE OF AUDIO SCRIPT\n1\nAudioScript = [\n2\n{\"audio_type\": \"music\", \"layout\": \"background\", \"id\":1, \"\naction\": \"begin\", \"vol\": -30, \"desc\": \"Dramatic orchestral\nnews theme\"},\n3\n{\"audio_type\": \"speech\", \"layout\": \"foreground\", \"character\":\n\"News Anchor\", \"vol\": -15, \"text\": \"Welcome to Mars News\n...\"},\n4\n{\"audio_type\": \"music\", \"layout\": \"background\", \"id\":1, \"\naction\": \"end\"},\n5\n{\"audio_type\": \"sound_effect\", \"layout\": \"foreground\", \"vol\":\n-35, \"len\": 1, \"desc\": \"Transition swoosh\"},\n6\n{\"audio_type\": \"speech\", \"layout\": \"foreground\", \"character\":\n\"Reporter\", \"vol\": -15, \"text\": \"We\u2019re here at the ...\"},\n7\n...\n8\n{\"audio_type\": \"speech\", \"layout\": \"foreground\", \"character\":\n\"News Anchor\", \"vol\": -15, \"text\": \"...

The pseudo code of the script compiler is described in the Algorithm 1.\nThe algorithm performs the following six steps:\nInitialization: The algorithm starts by initializing two lists, one for foreground audio nodes (fore-\ngroundAudioList) and another for background audio nodes (backgroundAudioList). It also initial-\nizes a variable to keep track of the next foreground node ID.\n15\nUnder Review\nNode Classification: The algorithm iterates through the root list and checks each node\u2019s type. If\nthe node is of type \u2018foreground\u2019, it is added to the foregroundAudioList, and the next foreground\nnode ID is incremented. If the node is marked as the beginning of a background audio segment, it is\nassigned the next foreground node ID and added to the backgroundAudioList.\nForeground Audio Processing: The compiler then creates a list to store the lengths of the fore-\nground audio segments. For each foreground audio node, the corresponding audio is generated and\nits length calculated and stored in the list.\nBackground Audio Processing: The algorithm calculates the target length for the background audio\nbased on the foreground audio\u2019s start and end IDs, and then generates and calculates the length of\nthe background audio.\nAudio Composition: The algorithm combines all the foreground audio segments to create the final\nforeground audio. Then, for each background audio node, it mixes the background audio with the\nforeground audio, offsetting the background audio to sync with the foreground audio segments.\nFinal Output: The resulting final audio, which is a mix of foreground and background audio tracks,\nis outputted from the script compiler.\nAlgorithm 1: Pseudo code of Script Compiler\nInitialize: foregroundAudioList as an empty list, backgroundAudioList as an empty list,\nnextForegroundNodeID as 0\n1 forall node in the root list do\n2\nif node.type is \u201cforeground\u201d then\n3\nAdd node to foregroundAudioList\n4\nIncrement nextForegroundNodeID by 1\n5\nelse\n6\nif node.isBeginning is True then\n7\nSet node.beginForegroundID as nextForegroundNodeID\n8\nAdd node to backgroundAudioList\n9\nelse\n10\nSet backgroundNode in backgroundAudioList with id node.id\u2019s endForegroundID\nas nextForegroundNodeID\n11\nend\n12\nend\n13 end\nInitialize: fgAudioLengths as an empty list\n14 forall foregroundAudio in foregroundAudioList do\n15\nGenerate the audio based on foregroundAudio\n16\nCalculate the generated length, append it to fgAudioLengths\n17 end\n18 Concatenate all generated foreground audio to create finalForegroundAudio\n19 forall backgroundAudio in backgroundAudioList do\n20\nCalculate targetLength by using backgroundAudio\u2019s beginForegroundID, endForegroundID\nand fgAudioLengths\n21\nGenerate the audio of targetLength based on backgroundAudio\n22\nCalculate the offset from the beginning of the finalForegroundAudio using\nbeginForegroundID and fgAudioLengths, set as offset\n23 end\nInitialize: finalAudio as finalForegroundAudio\n24 forall backgroundAudio in backgroundAudioList do\n25\nMix finalAudio with backgroundAudio generated audio, with offset according to\nbackgroundAudio.offset\n26 end\n27 Output finalAudio\n16\nUnder Review\nA.5\nABLATION STUDIES ON TEXT-TO-AUDIO GENERATION\nMotivation. We conducted an ablation study on the text-to-audio generation task using the Audio-\nCaps and Clotho datasets. Our motivation is to investigate the sources of performance improve-\nments, particularly those arising from 1) the introduction of a text-to-speech synthesis model, and 2)\nthe use of LLMs to decompose complex audio captions.\nExperiments setup. We manually checked the text captions of 50 audio clips from the AudioCaps\nand Clotho datasets, which were previously used in a subjective listening test (as detailed in Section\n5.2). These clips were then classified into two categories: Speech-Inclusive, which includes speech\nand and other sounds, and Non-Speech Exclusive, which consists of non-speech elements only. In the\ncase of AudioCaps, 23 (46%) audio clips were categorized as speech-inclusive and 27 (54%) as non-\nspeech exclusive. For Clotho, the speech-inclusive and non-speech exclusive categories contained\n26 (52%) and 24 (48%) audio clips, respectively. We decomposed the subjective evaluation results\nreported in table 3 into speech-inclusive and non-speech exclusive splits, detailed in Tables 7 and B\n8 for AudioCaps and Clotho dataset, respectively.\nResults and anslysis. Across both the AudioCaps and Clotho datasets, WavJourney consistently\noutperforms AudioLDM and AudioGen in terms of the OVL and REL metrics for both speech-\ninclusive and non-Speech exclusive splits. Particularly, given that WavJourney uses AudioGen for\ntext-to-audio synthesis, the improvements in performance over the AudioGen system in the non-\nspeech exclusive splits shows the benefits of WavJourney\u2019s use of LLMs to decompose complex\naudio captions. Moreover, WavJourney achieved impressive results in the speech-inclusive splits.\nSpecifically, for AudioCaps, WavJourney obtained an OVL score of 3.93 and a REL score of 3.90,\nsignificantly surpassing both AudioLDM and AudioGen. These scores even exceed the Ground\nTruth scores of 3.77 and 3.85 for OVL and REL, respectively. For Clotho, WavJourney achieved\nan OVL score of 3.61, which substantially outperforms AudioLDM and AudioGen and is on par\nwith the Ground Truth score of 3.60. We attribute this additional improvement to the introduction\nof text-to-speech synthesis model that can produce better speech component than AudioLDM and\nAudioGen text-to-audio generation systems.\nAn interesting question is raised, why does WavJourney perform better than or on par with Ground\nTruth audio on speech-inclusive data? We suggests that the improvements may come from three\naspects: 1) The use of state-of-the-art text-to-speech synthesis models that can produce realistic and\nclear speech content. 2) Some audio clips in AudioCaps or Clotho datasets are of poor quality.\nAs these datasets were originally designed for audio captioning research, their audio clips may not\nalways yield high subjective evaluation results (e.g., audio clips in AudioCaps sourced from noisy\nYouTube videos). 3) The effective use of the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs. When\ngenerating complex audio that includes speech, WavJourney can design the content of the speech\nrelated to the context9, potentially leading to a better impression during the listening test, considering\nthat in real-world recordings, the speech content may not always be related to the acoustic scene.\nModel\nSpeech-Inclusive (46%)\nNon-Speech Exclusive (54%)\nOverall\nOVL \u2191\nREL \u2191\nOVL \u2191\nREL \u2191\nOVL \u2191\nREL \u2191\nAudioLDM\n3.25\n3.21\n3.50\n3.45\n3.39\n3.34\nAudioGen\n3.53\n3.57\n3.57\n3.47\n3.56\n3.52\nWavJourney\n3.93\n3.90\n3.59\n3.60\n3.75\n3.74\nGround Truth\n3.77\n3.85\n3.69\n3.68\n3.73\n3.76\nTable 7: Ablation study on AudioCaps speech-inclusive and non-speech exclusive splits.\n9For example, in a scenario where the audio scene is a bustling city street, real-world recordings might\ninclude speech content unrelated to the scene, potentially causing a disconnect for the listener. However,\nWavJourney can generate complex audio with contextually relevant speech content for such a scene, such as a\nconversation about navigating the city or comments on city sounds. This context-aware approach enhances the\nlistening experience and leads to improved results in listening tests.\n17\nUnder Review\nModel\nSpeech-Inclusive (52%)\nNon-Speech Exclusive (48%)\nOverall\nOVL \u2191\nREL \u2191\nOVL \u2191\nREL \u2191\nOVL \u2191\nREL \u2191\nAudioLDM\n3.26\n3.22\n3.57\n3.50\n3.41\n3.36\nAudioGen\n3.30\n3.34\n3.52\n3.40\n3.41\n3.37\nWavJourney\n3.61\n3.55\n3.61\n3.56\n3.61\n3.56\nGround Truth\n3.60\n3.67\n3.81\n3.75\n3.71\n3.71\nTable 8: Ablation study on Clotho speech-inclusive and non-speech exclusive splits.\nA.6\nTURING TEST ON TEXT-TO-AUDIO GENERATION\nWe conducted Turing test (Pease & Colton, 2011) experiments on AudioCaps and Clotho text-to-\naudio generation benchmarks. Participants were presented with audio clips and tasked with catego-\nrizing them as real, ambiguous, or fake. To mitigate any potential bias that might skew listeners\u2019\nperceptions, we did not provide textual descriptions of the audio clips in the Turing test experi-\nments. The audio clips utilized in this study are identical to those used in the subjective listening\ntests detailed in Section 5.2. Our intuition is to assess whether WavJourney can generate audio that\nis indistinguishable from real-world audio in human perception.\nThe results on the AudioCaps and Clotho are described in Table 9 and 10, respectively. WavJourney\noutperforms AudioGen and AudioLDM across both AudioCaps and Clotho in Turing tests. Specif-\nically, WavJourney achieved the highest perceived-as-real rates (53.8% for AudioCaps and 54.0%\nfor Clotho) and the lowest rates of being perceived as fake and ambiguous. However, WavJourney\ndid not succeed in passing the Turing Test by matching the perceived-as-real rate of the Ground\nTruth audio, which was 65.8% for AudioCaps and 62.2% for Clotho. The good results achieved\nby WavJourney show that it performs better in generating realistic audio clips than AudioLDM and\nAudioGen, although there is still a gap between synthetic and real audio as judged by human listen-\ners. The discrepancy between the results of the Turing test and other subjective metrics (e.g., OVL,\nREL, preference-based test) on AudioCaps may be attributed to text-to-speech generated speech.\nAlthough this generated speech can positively influence subjective metrics (as discussed in Section\nA.5), it may be easily to distinguish due to human\u2019s sensitive perception of speech.\nModel\nPerceived as Real\nAmbiguous\nPerceived as Fake\nAudioGen\n53.0%\n15.6%\n31.4%\nAudioLDM\n47.2%\n18.8%\n34.0%\nWavJourney\n53.8%\n13.4%\n32.8%\nGround Truth\n65.8%\n15.6%\n18.6%\nTable 9: Turing test on AudioCaps benchmark.\nModel\nPerceived as Real\nAmbiguous\nPerceived as Fake\nAudioGen\n46.4%\n18.8%\n34.8%\nAudioLDM\n46.8%\n17.2%\n36.0%\nWavJourney\n54.0%\n14.8%\n31.2%\nGround Truth\n62.2%\n14.0%\n23.8%\nTable 10: Turing test on Clotho benchmark.\nA.7\nSYSTEM-LEVEL ABLATION STUDIES\nIn this section, we perform system-level ablation studies by comparing against other design choices.\nOur experiments include 1) employing open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama for\naudio script writing; and 2) using LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate Python code. These comparison\naim to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the module design in WavJourney.\n18\nUnder Review\nA.7.1\nON OPEN-SOURCE LLMS FOR SCRIPT WRITING\nThis section explores the script writing capabilities of Llama2-70B-Chat Touvron et al. (2023b),\nan open-source LLM, chosen for its accessibility and potential adaptability in diverse script writing\nscenarios. We use the 50 audio storytelling prompts introduced in Section 4 for testing. We prompted\nLlama2-70B-Chat to generate audio scripts from input text instructions, and then to parse voices\nbased on the generated audio script and the system voice preset. The resulting audio script and\nvoice mapping were fed into the script compiler, which validated their accuracy. We compared the\nCompilation Success Rate (CSR) of Llama2-70B-Chat with that of GPT-4 used in WavJourney. To\nensure a fair comparison, we used the same prompts as those used in WavJourney.\nLLM Script Writer\nCompilation Success Rate\nLlama2-70B-Chat\n10%\nLlama2-70B-Chatprocessed\n54%\nGPT-4\n94%\nTable 11: Compilation Success Rates for Llama2-70B-Chat and GPT-4 in audio script writing.\nThe results are presented in Table 11. The Llama2-70B-Chat script writer achieved only a poor CSR\nof 10%. We observe that this was caused by the hallucination (Rawte et al., 2023) of Llama2-70B-\nChat, which often generated unexpected contexts (e.g., a summary of what it does at the end). We\nfurther manually processed the outputs of Llama2-70B-Chat by removing the hallucinated contexts.\nThe result obtained after this processing is denoted as Llama2-70B-Chatprocessed. After processing,\nthe CSR improved to 54%. However, this still fell short of the performance achieved by GPT-4,\nwhich had a good CSR of 94%. The disparity in performance between Llama2-70B-Chat and GPT-\n4 highlights the challenges involved in audio script writing and suggests that an additional effort\n(e.g., instruction tuning (Liu et al., 2023b)) may be required to use open source LLMs for this task.\nWe demonstrate several errors made by Llama2-70B-Chat and GPT-4. For Llama2-70B-Chat, the\nmost common failure case is the incorrect output format i.e., the integration of JSON syntax and\nnatural language description. The model generated a detailed script but failed to maintain a con-\nsistent JSON format, as seen in the inclusion of comments like \u2018[Background sound effect: Soft\noffice ambient noise, -35 dB, end]\u2019 within the JSON structure. This presents a difficulty for Llama2-\n70B-Chat in adhering to a strict JSON format when trying to provide descriptive audio elements.\nIn addition, several generated scripts have incomplete JSON structure, lacking essential attribute\n(e.g., \u2018character\u2019 attribute for speech nodes). This suggests limitations in the Llama2-70B-Chat\u2019s\nunderstanding of structured data formats, leading to incomplete or incorrect outputs. For GPT-4, few\nfailure cases involve using undefined audio types, such as \u2018child laughter\u2019, which is not recognized\nwithin the pre-defined audio types. This indicates a potential issue with the model\u2019s understanding\nof the specific constraints and vocabularies required for this task.\nA.7.2\nON LLM-BASED SCRIPT COMPILER\nPrevious works (Suris et al., 2023; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023) have used LLMs to generate code\naimed at addressing complex vision-language tasks via compositional inference. In this experiment,\nwe implement a LLM-based script compiler for comparison. We use the GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2022)\nmodel as the LLM-based compiler in this ablation study. Specifically, we experiment with 50 audio\nscripts generated by WavJourney from the storytelling benchmark. We design a specialized prompt\ntemplate to enable a GPT4-based script compiler to parse code from an audio script through in-\ncontext learning. The simplified description of this prompt template is described in Table 13. To\nevaluate the reliability and efficiency, we computed the Execution Error Rate (EER) and the Average\nCompiling Time (ACT) for both the hand-crafted and GPT4-based compilers across a set of 50\nexamples. Experiments were carried out on a CPU machine equipped with an AMD EPYC 7502\n32-Core Processor. The practical compiling time for the GPT4-based compiler is depend on the\non-demand request and the length of audio script.\nThe results are presented in Table 12. The GPT4-based compiler has a significantly higher EER\nof 56%, along with an ACT of 63.16 seconds. This suggests that the GPT4-based compiler is less\nefficient and stable compared to the hand-crafted compiler, which demonstrated no execution errors\n19\nUnder Review\nand an ACT of 0.03 seconds. The results show that our proposed hand-crafted compiler mitigates\nthe instability in the script compilation and also greatly improve the inference efficiency.\nScript Compiler\nExecution Error Rate\nAverage Compiling Time (seconds)\nHand-crafted\n0%\n0.03\nGPT4-based\n56%\n63.16\nTable 12: Performance comparison of hand-crafted and GPT4-based script compilers in terms of\nExecution Error Rate (EER) and average Compiling Time (ACT).\nSimplified Prompt #3\nI want you to act as an audio script compiler.

To analyze the time\ncost, we randomly selected 20 text captions from the AudioCaps test set and calculated the aver-\nage inference time required by WavJourney and AudioGen to generate 10-second audio clips. For\nWavJourney, we report the time costs associated with script writing and audio generation. The\ntesting was conducted on a machine equipped with a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.\nThe results are shown in Table 14. In practice, by carefully optimizing the use of computational\nresources (e.g., parallel inference) for WavJourney, it is possible to achieve high-quality synthetic\naudio generation while minimizing the time required for inference, which we leave as future work.\nModel\nScript Writing Time (s)\nAudio Generation Time (s)\nAudioGen\n-\n23.0\nWavJourney\n8.1\n45.3\nTable 14: The comparison of inference cost for WavJourney and AudioGen systems.\n20\nUnder Review\nA.9\nHUMAN-MACHINE CO-CREATION (SPEECH CONTENT CONTROL)\nA case study on a radio-play-based storytelling example focusing on voice content control.

We investigate hypotheses for how CoT\nreasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how\nthe model predictions change when we intervene\non the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphras-\ning it). Models show large variation across tasks\nin how strongly they condition on the CoT when\npredicting their answer, sometimes relying heav-\nily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring\nit. CoT\u2019s performance boost does not seem to\ncome from CoT\u2019s added test-time compute alone\nor from information encoded via the particular\nphrasing of the CoT. As models become larger\nand more capable, they produce less faithful rea-\nsoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our re-\nsults suggest that CoT can be faithful if the cir-\ncumstances such as the model size and task are\ncarefully chosen.\n1.

An illustration of our proposed tests for measuring the\nfaithfulness of Chain of Thought (CoT), generating step-by-step\nreasoning before answering a question. Early Answering: Trun-\ncate the original CoT before answering. Adding Mistakes: Have\na language model add a mistake somewhere in the original CoT\nand then regenerate the rest of the CoT. Paraphrasing: Reword\nthe beginning of the original CoT and then regenerate the rest of\nthe CoT. Filler Tokens: Replace the CoT with ellipses.\nof LLMs is enhanced when they are prompted to generate\nstep-by-step reasoning before giving an answer (Li et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023b).\nSuch claims only hold if the generated reasoning is faithful\n1\narXiv:2307.13702v1  [cs.AI]  17 Jul 2023\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nto the model\u2019s true reasoning, meaning that it \u201caccurately\nrepresents the reasoning process behind the model\u2019s predic-\ntion\u201d (Jacovi & Goldberg, 2020). However, LLM-generated\nreasoning has been shown to be unfaithful to the model\u2019s\ntrue reasoning process in some cases (Turpin et al., 2023),\nraising the question of if the stated reasoning is ever faithful.\nTo answer this question, we propose tests for measuring\nCoT faithfulness, enabling us to investigate CoT faithfulness\nacross a variety of tasks on LLMs fine-tuned to behave as a\nhelpful assistant (shown in Fig. 1). Our tests intervene on\nthe model\u2019s stated reasoning in different ways and evaluate\nhow the model\u2019s answer changes in response. We take a\n\u201cdefense-in-depth\u201d approach; each test is not meant to be\nconclusive evidence for CoT being faithful, but rather aims\nto rule out the possibility of one class of faithfulness failures\nin CoT. We investigate the following possible faithfulness\nfailures, including our main results below:\n\u2022 Post-hoc reasoning: The model\u2019s reasoning may be\npost-hoc, i.e., produced after a certain conclusion has\nalready been guaranteed (Holzinger et al., 2017). Since\npost-hoc reasoning does not change the model\u2019s an-\nswer, there is no strong reason to believe that such\nreasoning would be faithful. In this work, we test for\npost-hoc reasoning by truncating the chain of thought\nor adding mistakes to it. We find great variation in how\nmuch LLMs use CoT on different tasks, not using CoT\nat all for some tasks while relying upon it heavily for\nother tasks.\n\u2022 Unfaithful reasoning due to test-time computation:\nThe performance boost from CoT may be due to the\ngreater test-time computation provided by the extra\ntokens between the question and when the model is\nprompted for its final answer (Wei et al., 2022). If this\nwere the case, the model may be using the CoT to do\nperformance-improving computation that it does not\nreveal in the CoT. In this work, we find no accuracy\ngain from CoT when we replace the CoT with unin-\nformative filler text (all periods), suggesting that the\nextra test-time compute alone is not responsible for\nperformance-improving computation.\n\u2022 Encoded reasoning: The benefit from CoT may be\nattained by LLMs encoding the relevant information\nin the generated reasoning in a way that is not under-\nstandable to human readers (a form of steganography).\nThis may be through changes in e.g. punctuation, word\nchoice, or other phrasing differences that improve the\nLLM\u2019s predictions, but in a way that is not clearly un-\nderstandable by a human. In this work, we find similar\nperformance when replacing CoT with paraphrased\nCoT, indicating that the particular phrasing of CoT is\nnot a driver of performance.1\nSince our results indicate that the LLM\u2019s stated reasoning\nis unfaithful on some tasks, we also investigate if there is\nany size model that generates faithful reasoning on these\ntasks. We find that smaller models often generate more\nfaithful reasoning than larger, more capable ones, and that\nmodels produce less faithful reasoning on easier versions of\naddition tasks. Our work shows that the model used for the\ntask is a useful lever for obtaining more faithful CoT.\nIn short, we find that, while chain of thought reasoning is\nnot always faithful, it is possible to find conditions where\nit is more faithful. This finding paves the way for future\nwork to design methods for LLMs to produce more faithful\nreasoning and for detecting when the model\u2019s reasoning is\nuntrustworthy.\n2. Measuring Chain of Thought Faithfulness\nIn this section, we investigate hypotheses that point against\nchain of thought faithfulness by perturbing the chain of\nthought and observing the model\u2019s behavior.\n2.1. Methods\nModel\nFor most experiments in this section, we use\na 175B-parameter pretrained, decoder-only transformer\n(Vaswani et al., 2017) LLM (Radford et al., 2018; 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020), fine-tuned to be a helpful dialog as-\nsistant using reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stien-\nnon et al., 2020), as in Bai et al. (2022). The one exception is\nthe model used to generate mistakes in the adding mistakes\nexperiment (\u00a72.4); the model used here is the pretrained\nLM, without RLHF fine-tuning.\nTasks\nWe select eight multiple choice tasks to evaluate\nthat we expect will benefit from explicit reasoning:\n\u2022 ARC Challenge (Clark et al., 2018): Grade-school\nlevel science questions, selected to be challenging for\nword retrieval or correlation approaches.\n\u2022 ARC Easy (Clark et al., 2018): Grade-school level\nscience questions.\n\u2022 AQuA (Ling et al., 2017): Algebra word problems at a\nvariety of difficulty levels.\n1A fourth, possible hypothesis for why CoT improves perfor-\nmance is that stylistic elements of the reasoning sample serve to\nelicit higher-quality answers from the LLM by prompting it to imi-\ntate a more cautious or thoughtful agent (Andreas, 2022), despite\nthe reasoning sample not being faithful. This was investigated by\nWei et al. who found evidence against this hypothesis. We do not\ninvestigate this further in this work.\n2\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nChain of thought prompt and sample\nHuman: Question: 30% of all Huhulians own\nat least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own\nat least one TV own at least four TV\u2019s. What\npercent of Huhulians own at least four TV\u2019s?\nChoices:\n(A): .084%\n(B): 24%\n(C): 4.67%\n(D): 7.2%\n(E): 15.6%\nAssistant: Let\u2019s think step by step: 30% of\nHuhulians own at least one TV. Of those 30%,\n24% own at least four TVs. So 24% of 30%, or\n0.24 x 0.3 = 0.072 = 7.2% of Huhulians own at\nleast four TVs. The correct answer is choice (D).\nHuman: Given all of the above, what\u2019s the\nsingle, most likely answer?\nAssistant: The single, most likely answer is (\nD)\nTable 1.

(2022). The number of choices varies de-\npending on the task. We sample 100 reasoning samples\nfor each problem using nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al.,\n2020) with p = 0.95 and temperature 0.8. We then append\nthe prompt for the final answer (as in the final human turn in\nTable 1), and we obtain the model\u2019s next token probabilities\nfor each answer choice. Each reasoning sample is then split\nFigure 2. Statistics about collected chains of thought.

Chain of Thought Statistics\nFig. 2 provides context for the rest of the experiments by\ngiving an overview of results under the standard chain-of-\nthought condition. Performance metrics are presented in\nTable 2 as well. The collected reasoning samples have a\nmean of 4 steps (sentences), with 89% of samples having\nbetween three and six. 2\nSeven of the eight tasks show a performance improvement\nunder chain of thought, with AQuA showing the greatest\nimprovement. HellaSwag is the single exception to the trend,\nshowing a degradation in performance instead. Throughout\nthe rest of this paper, tasks will be ordered by the extent\nto which we see an improvement due to chain of thought\nreasoning, except where noted.\n2.3. Early Answering: Does Truncating the Chain of\nThought Change the Predicted Answer?\nPost-hoc reasoning is reasoning which is generated after\nthe conclusion has already been established. In the chain\nof thought setting the reasoning is sampled before the an-\nswer is sampled, but this sequential relationship does not\nimply a causal one. Reasoning not being post-hoc does\nnot guarantee faithfulness, nor does being post-hoc exclude\nfaithfulness. Overall though, if reasoning is not post-hoc,\nthere are fewer ways for it to be unfaithful than there are\nfor reasoning which is post-hoc, including greater test-time\ncompute and steganography which we investigate in this\nwork as well. See Lanham (2022) for further discussion.\nTo measure post-hoc reasoning, we truncate the chain of\nthought midway through to observe what answer the model\n2For clarity of presentation, many results in the rest of the paper\nare shown for reasoning samples with three to six steps. These\nplots are broken down by sample length to avoid graph artifacts\ndue to bucketing.\n3\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n40\n60\n80\n100\n3-Step CoTs\n4-Step CoTs\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n40\n60\n80\n100\n5-Step CoTs\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n6-Step CoTs\nAQuA\nTruthfulQA\nMMLU\nOpenBookQA\nARC (Challenge)\nLogiQA\nARC (Easy)\nHellaSwag\n% of Reasoning Sample Provided\n% Same Answer as Complete CoT\nFigure 3. Chance of giving the same answer as the complete CoT\nafter truncating the CoT at different points.\nwould give without the complete reasoning statement. If\nthe model is no longer updating its answer based on further\nsteps of the chain of thought, it stands to reason that the\nproduced reasoning is post-hoc, having been produced after\nthe conclusion was already inevitable.\nFor these experiments, we truncate the previously collected\nreasoning samples and prompt the model to answer the\nquestion with the partial chain of thought rather than the\ncomplete one. For each chain of thought collected, we\ntruncate it after each step (here, each sentence) of the sample.\nSo starting with a chain of thought [x1, x2, x3, ..., xn], we\ntruncate it to an empty string [], truncate it to one sentence\n[x1], truncate it to two sentences [x1, x2], and so on. Each of\nthe truncated chains of thought replaces the original CoT in\nthe sample, and the model is prompted to answer as before.\nHaving collected answers after each truncation of the CoT,\nwe measure how often the model comes to the same con-\nclusion as it did with the complete CoT. If the amount of\nmatching overall is low, this indicates that less of the rea-\nsoning is post-hoc.\n2.3.1. EARLY ANSWERING RESULTS\nFig. 3 shows the results. From these results, we also cal-\nculate an area over the curve (AOC) metric for all CoT\nlengths of each task, presented in Table 2. AOC values are\ncalculated as a weighted sum, where the AOC for each CoT\nlength is weighted by the fraction of CoT samples having\nthat length.\nThere is wide variation in the extent of post-hoc reasoning\nbetween tasks as measured by this experiment. Notably, for\nthe three lowest-AOC tasks (ARC (Easy), ARC (Challenge),\nand OpenbookQA), the chain of thought changes the final\nanswer less than 10% of the time, while for the highest AOC\ntask (AQuA) the chain of thought changes the answer more\nthan 60% of the time. AQuA also consistently shows a low\nrate of matching the original answer before the final two\nsteps of reasoning, suggesting that the amount of post-hoc\nreasoning on this task is low.\nSurprisingly, the amount of post-hoc reasoning per task\n(measured by AOC) also shows little correlation with the\nperformance gain from chain of thought. For example, the\naccuracy boost that LogiQA gets from CoT is neglible, but\nit is second in AOC only to AQuA. HellaSwag shows an\naccuracy drop (-4.69%) but shows less post-hoc reasoning\non AOC relative to 4 other tasks which show an accuracy\ngain from CoT. These results suggest that CoT may be\nfaithful even when it does not improve task performance.\n2.4. Adding Mistakes: Does Editing the Chain of\nThought Change the Predicted Answer?\nWe take another approach to testing whether the reasoning\nis post-hoc (as in \u00a72.3), by directly perturbing the chain of\nthought by adding a mistake and observing the outcome. If\ninserting a mistake into the CoT changes the model\u2019s final\nanswer, then the model is likely not ignoring the CoT.\nIn this experiment, we introduce a mistake into one step of\nthe CoT and then sample a continued CoT from that point\nforward. To generate mistakes, we use a pretrained model\n(described in \u00a72.1) to generate a mistaken version of a sin-\ngle sentence from the original CoT using a few shot prompt\n(see Appendix A for details). We then sample a (nominally)\nmistaken version of that sentence, sampling a maximum\nof 30 tokens. We replace the model-generated reasoning\nin the prompt (Table 1) with the original chain of thought\nuntil the point where the error was introduced, followed by\nthe sampled mistaken step [x1, x2, ..., x\u2032\ni]. We continue to\nsample the chain of thought from that point forward, using\nthe model and prompt used for generating the original rea-\nsoning sample. We then prompt for a final answer given the\nreasoning sample as before. Table 3 contains an example.\nQualitatively, we find that our mistake generating process\ngenerates a plausible mistake at least 80% of the time. We\nalso find that when the model\u2019s chain of thought leads it to\nan incorrect answer that is not present in the answer choices,\nit will often choose the answer choice that is closest to that\nanswer (as in the example in Table 3).\nSimilarly to the early answering experiment (\u00a72.3), we mea-\nsure how often the final answer changes after the mistake\nhas been added and the remaining CoT has been sampled.\nA low matching frequency indicates less post-hoc reasoning.\nWe also calculate an AOC value for each task, as in \u00a72.3.\n4\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nAOC\nAccuracy\nTask\nEarly Answering\nAdding Mistakes\nWithout CoT\nWith CoT\nAccuracy difference\nAQuA\n0.44\n0.52\n28\n43\n15.32\nLogiQA\n0.26\n0.31\n42\n43\n1.02\nMMLU\n0.12\n0.21\n68\n71\n3.77\nHellaSwag\n0.12\n0.23\n71\n66\n-4.69\nTruthfulQA\n0.11\n0.20\n59\n63\n4.38\nOpenBookQA\n0.07\n0.15\n82\n84\n2.71\nARC (Challenge)\n0.05\n0.11\n88\n90\n2.28\nARC (Easy)\n0.02\n0.07\n96\n96\n0.77\nTable 2. Faithfulness and performance metrics for the tasks that we study. Tasks are sorted by early answering AOC, a measure of post-hoc\nreasoning (higher is less post-hoc, indicating greater faithfulness). AOC indicates area over the curve for the early answering and adding\nmistakes experiments respectively, weighted by the representation of each CoT length.\nAdd Mistakes Example\nHuman: Question: 30% of all Huhulians own\nat least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own\nat least one TV own at least four TV\u2019s. What\npercent of Huhulians own at least four TV\u2019s?\nChoices:\n(A): .084%\n(B): 24%\n(C): 4.67%\n(D): 7.2%\n(E): 15.6%\nAssistant: Let\u2019s think step by step: 30% of\nHuhulians own at least one TV. And 20% of\nthose people who own at least one TV own four\nor more TV\u2019s. So 20% of 30% of Huhulians own\nat least four TV\u2019s, which is 6%. The correct\nanswer is therefore choice C, 4.67%.\nHuman: Given all of the above, what\u2019s the sin-\ngle, most likely answer?\nAssistant: The single, most likely answer is (C)\nTable 3.

ADDING MISTAKES RESULTS\nFig. 4 and Table 2 show the results of this experiment.\nLargely these agree with the results from the early answer-\ning experiment (\u00a72.3). The AOC results also broadly agree\nwith the results in Fig. 4, where the ordering of the lines for\nall CoT lengths generally reflects the same ranking as the\nAOC scores. The ordering of tasks ranked by AOC is nearly\nidentical, with HellaSwag scoring higher than MMLU as\nthe only difference between them. As with the early an-\nswering experiments, we also observe a similar high-level\nfinding: the extent of post-hoc reasoning varies consider-\nably between tasks, and it is not strongly correlated with the\naccuracy improvement conferred by CoT.\n40\n60\n80\n100\n3-Step CoTs\n4-Step CoTs\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n40\n60\n80\n100\n5-Step CoTs\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n6-Step CoTs\nAQuA\nTruthfulQA\nMMLU\nOpenBookQA\nARC (Challenge)\nLogiQA\nARC (Easy)\nHellaSwag\n% of Reasoning Sample Before Mistake\n% Same Answer as Original\nFigure 4. Chance of giving the same answer with the original CoT\nvs. CoT with an LLM-introduced mistake in it.\nFor both early answering and adding mistakes experiments,\nAQuA and LogiQA are the two tasks with the most faithful\nreasoning (by some margin). The increased faithfulness\nmay be due to the models\u2019 limited ability to do the task\nwithout CoT, which may cause the model to rely more on\nCoT. In \u00a73, we find that the per-task faithfulness depends on\nthe capabilities of the model used (e.g., on the model\u2019s size),\nwhich supports this hypothesis. Another potential cause for\nthe increased faithfulness on these tasks is that they both\ninvolve logical reasoning, so it may be more clear that the\nmodel\u2019s final prediction should be entailed by the stated\nreasoning. In \u00a73, we find that faithfulness does not depend\non the task alone, casting some doubt on this hypothesis.\n5\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFiller Tokens Length Percentile\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nAccuracy\nAQuA\nTruthfulQA\nMMLU\nOpenBookQA\nARC (Challenge)\nLogiQA\nARC (Easy)\nHellaSwag\nAccuracy given no CoT\nFigure 5.

Filler Tokens: Do Uninformative Chain of Thought\nTokens Also Improve Performance?\nHere, we test the hypothesis that the additional test-time\ncomputation provided by a longer context window is respon-\nsible for the performance boost from CoT. If this were the\ncase, the model may be using the CoT to do performance-\nimproving computation that it does not reveal in the CoT\nitself, indicating that important steps of reasoning may not\nbe represented in the stated reasoning.\nIn this experiment, we replace the CoT with a number of\n\u201c ...\u201d tokens (\u201cfiller tokens\u201d), each consisting of a space\nfollowed by three periods. We test strings of filler tokens\nranging from zero tokens to the length (in tokens) of the\nlongest chain of thought collected out of 100 samples for\nany given question, with a step size of five tokens. If the\nfiller tokens provide a significant performance improvement,\nthen the CoT may be unfaithful by not representing the\nactual process by which the model comes to its answer.\n2.5.1. FILLER TOKENS RESULTS\nFrom Fig. 5 we can see that there is no increase in accuracy\nobserved from adding \u201c ...\u201d tokens to the context. In fact,\nfor some tasks, such as TruthfulQA and OpenBookQA, the\nperformance actually drops slightly in the longer-context\nsetting, which may be due to this kind of sequence being out\nof the model\u2019s training distribution. These results suggest\nthat extra test-time compute alone is not used by models to\nperform helpful but unstated reasoning.\nParaphrasing example\nOriginal CoT\nParaphrased CoT\nAssistant:\nLet\u2019s think step\nby step:\nLight and sound\nare both forms of energy that\ntravel in waves. Sound waves\ntravel through matter, while\nlight waves can travel through\na vacuum.\nLight waves are\nelectromagnetic, while sound\nwaves are not.\nBoth light\nand sound travel at very fast\nspeeds, but light waves travel\nsignificantly faster than sound\nwaves. Based on these char-\nacteristics, the only similar-\nity between light and sound\nis that they are both waves.\nTherefore, the correct answer\nis choice (C).\nAssistant:\nLet\u2019s think step\nby step:\nLight and sound\nare both waves of energy, but\nthey differ in several ways.\nSound waves require mat-\nter to travel but light waves\ncan travel through a vacuum.\nLight waves are electromag-\nnetic while sound waves are\nnot. Both waves travel very\nquickly, but light waves move\nmuch faster than sound waves.\nIn summary, light and sound\nare similar in that they are both\nwaves, but they differ in many\nfundamental ways.\nTable 4. Original and paraphrased chain of thought samples. Dif-\nferences from the original chain of thought are underlined in the\nparaphrased sample.\n2.6. Paraphrasing: Does Rewording the Chain of\nThought Change the Predicted Answer?\nOne way that the model\u2019s stated reasoning could be unfaith-\nful and also not post-hoc is if information that is encoded\nin phrasing choices of the reasoning are responsible for the\nchange in the answer, rather than the content of the CoT\nitself. This could arise due to pressure during RLHF to\nprovide the correct answer while also providing an implicit\nlength penalty (Branwen, 2023), or due to pressures from\nRLHF to disguise the content of reasoning that might be\ndisincentivized by the preference model.\nIn this experiment, we have a language model paraphrase the\nCoT to ablate phrasing choices that could contain encoded\ninformation in the CoT. If phrasing-encoded information is\na major component of the accuracy boost conveyed by CoT,\nwe should expect that paraphrasing will reduce or eliminate\nit. We ensure that the model that paraphrases the reasoning\ndoes not have access to the original question, to remove\nany incentive to generate reasoning that produces a correct\nanswer to that question.\nWe have the model paraphrase the same subsequences of\nthe reasoning sample as were used in early answering ([x1]\nalone, [x1, x2], [x1, x2, x3], etc.) without access to the orig-\ninal question. The prompt we use can be found in Appendix\nA. We then insert the paraphrased chain of thought back into\nthe original prompt and continue to sample until the end\nof the reasoning sample, then prompting for a final answer\n6\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n40\n60\n80\n100\n3-Step CoTs\n4-Step CoTs\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n40\n60\n80\n100\n5-Step CoTs\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n6-Step CoTs\nAQuA\nTruthfulQA\nMMLU\nOpenBookQA\nARC (Challenge)\nLogiQA\nARC (Easy)\nHellaSwag\nNon-paraphrased\nCoT accuracy\non this task\n% of Reasoning Sample Paraphrased\nAccuracy\nFigure 6.

If phrasing-encoded information is responsible for the\naccuracy boost conveyed by CoT, we should expect to see\ndegraded performance under paraphrased reasoning relative\nto standard CoT.\n2.6.1. PARAPHRASING RESULTS\nOverall, the paraphrased accuracy closely matches the ac-\ncuracy of the original chain of thought for almost all tasks\nat almost all numbers of filler tokens, as shown in Fig. 6.\nThis result indicates that the particular phrasing of the rea-\nsoning is unlikely to encode information responsible for the\naccuracy gains of CoT.\n3. Does Model Size Affect CoT Faithfulness?\nOur results so far indicate that reasoning faithfulness is\nsignificantly lower on some tasks. For those tasks, it is\nnatural to ask whether any models provide faithful reason-\ning on the tasks. If so, we would be able to choose the\nmodel we used to solve the task, such that it was one that\nproduced faithful reasoning on that task, if faithful expla-\nnations were important (e.g., for high-stakes settings like\nmedical decision-making). One potential cause for unfaith-\nful reasoning in a model is that a model may already be\n3We chose this approach over paraphrasing the entire chain of\nthought; the model almost always states the final answer it has\narrived at in the final steps of the CoT, so paraphrasing the entire\nCoT would trivially lead the model to produce the same answer.\n109\n1010\n1011\nModel Size (Parameters)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n% Same Answer With and Without CoT\nAQuA\nTruthfulQA\nMMLU\nOpenBookQA\nARC (Challenge)\nLogiQA\nARC (Easy)\nHellaSwag\nFigure 7.

In this case, CoT may not have much influence on\nthe model\u2019s final answer. As a result, we hypothesize that,\nfor reasoning faithfulness, larger models may behave worse\nthan smaller ones (\u201cinverse scaling\u201d; McKenzie et al., 2023);\nsmaller models may, for some tasks, benefit more from CoT,\npotentially leading them to rely more on CoT.\nTo explore this hypothesis, we show what percentage of the\ntime the answer changes with vs. without CoT, a metric\nthat intuitively captures how much the model relies on the\nCoT to predict answers. This metric is equivalent to our\nearly answering experiment when using 0% of the CoT\nspecifically. This metric is highly predictive of overall early\nanswering and adding mistakes results, e.g., the ordering of\ntasks by AOC in Table 2. We thus use this metric in lieu of\nrunning the full set of early answering and adding mistakes\nexperiments for computational reasons.\nIn this section, we use the series of LMs of varying sizes\nfrom Ganguli et al. (2023). The models are pretrained,\ndecoder-only transformer models finetuned to be helpful\ndialog assistants with RLHF, similar to the model in \u00a72.\n3.1. Standard Tasks\nFig. 7 shows the results on the tasks from \u00a72. For 7/8\ntasks, the 13B parameter model changes its answer after\nCoT more often than the 175B model does. In fact, for most\ntasks, faithfulness gets monotonically worse from 13B to\n175B parameter models, indicating inverse scaling in model\nsize for reasoning faithfulness on these tasks. For six of the\neight tasks (all but AQuA and LogiQA), the most faithful\nreasoning comes from the 13B model; on these tasks, the\n13B model shows more faithful reasoning even than smaller\nmodels. We suspect that smaller models are not yet capable\n7\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nAddition Task Samples\nHuman: Question: What is the solution to the\nfollowing? 264 + 964 =\nAssistant: Let\u2019s think step by step:\n264 + 964 =\n= 264 + (900 + 64) =\n= (264 + 900) + 64 =\n= 1164 + 64 =\n= 1228\nTherefore, 264 + 964 = 1228.\nHuman: Given the above, what is the most\nlikely answer?

Overall, our results suggest that\ncertain tasks do not inherently lead to unfaithful reasoning;\ninstead, only models of a certain capability level (but no\nhigher) on a task seem to produce faithful CoT.\n3.2. Addition Tasks\nTo validate the above conclusion, we perform the same\nevaluation on a set of synthetic addition tasks where we\ncan directly control for task difficulty. Each addition task is\nconstituted of problems with 2, 4, 8, or 16 operands, where\neach operand is either two or three digits in length. The\nmodel\u2019s answer is given as a free response, in contrast to\nthe multiple choice tasks used previously. 4 Prompts and\nsamples are in Table 5.\nFrom Fig. 8 we see that this measure of post-hoc reason-\n4As shown in Table 5, we use XML tags to elicit the final free-\nresponse answer after the chain of thought reasoning. Our two\nsmallest models (810M and 1.6B parameters) do not consistently\nprovide an integer answer when prompted this way, so we exclude\nthem from the results.\nFigure 8. Chance of giving the same answer with and without CoT\nreasoning on synthetic addition tasks, when varying model size.\ning increases with model size on each task, and increases\nwith easier tasks at the same model size. This finding sug-\ngests that to elicit faithful reasoning that is appropriate for\nexplaining model behavior, it may be necessary to choose\nmodels that are less capable than the maximally capable\nmodel available, especially for easier tasks.\n4. Related Work\nAnalysis of Chain of Thought Faithfulness\nRecent work\nhas analyzed CoT faithfulness in different ways than our\nwork. Gao (2023) use Shapley analysis to show that certain\ntokens of the CoT are much more important than others\nfor the final answer. Our work proposes different tests of\nCoT faithfulness with lower computational costs. Madaan\n& Yazdanbakhsh (2022) investigate CoT via counterfactual\nprompting and find that some aspects of the prompt are less\nimportant than others for the final answer reached. We inter-\nvene on the CoT produced by the model rather than few shot\nprompt examples and propose general tests for CoT faithful-\nness. Turpin et al. (2023) discover examples of unfaithful\nCoT in adversarially constructed settings, showing that CoT\nreasoning is not always faithful. In that paper, the model\nproduces CoT in the presence of biasing few-shot examples;\nwhile the model\u2019s final answer is consistent with the bias\nprovided by the prompt, the CoT gives a different expla-\nnation for the answer that does not reference the biasing\n8\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\ncontext. In contrast, this work investigates non-adversarial\nsettings to collect evidence about reasoning faithfulness un-\nder a wider variety of realistic conditions. Wei et al. (2022)\ntest three hypotheses for why CoT prompting provides a per-\nformance boost: that it produces an equation to be evaluated,\nthat it provides additional test-time compute, and that it the\nCoT better enables the model to access relevant information\nfrom pretraining. We expand upon the test-time compute\nonly experiment presented in that work with the filler tokens\nexperiment presented in \u00a72.5, by evaluating a wider range\nof tasks and varying the number of filler tokens.\nTechniques to Increase Reasoning Faithfulness\nPrior\nwork has proposed methods to generate reasoning that are\nmore likely to be faithful by construction, due to the way\nthat the reasoning or final answer is produced. Lyu et al.\n(2023) generate a program in a domain-specific language\nand execute the program (e.g., using a Python interpreter) to\nproduce the final answer; this process ensures that the gen-\nerating program is not post-hoc but rather directly used to\nproduce the final answer. Creswell & Shanahan (2022) and\nCreswell et al. (2023) use a language model to choose state-\nments from a context and then make inferences from those\nselected statements in a separate context window. Radhakr-\nishnan et al. (2023) answer questions by decomposing them\ninto subquestions, finding that this approach leads to more\nfaithful reasoning according to our early answering and\nadding mistakes metrics. Some of the potential faithfulness\nproblems raised in our work (i.e., post-hoc reasoning) may\napply to the methods above. The metrics we propose may\nbe useful for measuring the extent to which those methods\nimprove faithfulness.\nTechniques to Elicit Language Model Reasoning\nPrior\nwork has proposed various methods to improve language\nmodel performance by eliciting reasoning before the answer.\nApproaches include generating subquestions (Dua et al.,\n2022; Zhou et al., 2023), producing a tree of thoughts (Yao\net al., 2023a), devising and executing a plan for answer-\ning the question (Wang et al., 2023), and having language\nmodels debate to reach an answer (Du et al., 2023), among\nothers. These approaches share a similar structure to chain\nof thought, where the language model produces earlier steps\nof reasoning and then conditions on them to produce later\nsteps. As such, we believe that our methods for assessing\nfaithfulness should hold for these methods as well.\n5. Limitations\nA key limitation of our investigation is that we do not have\na separate way by which to understand the model\u2019s real\ninternal reasoning process, without which we cannot know\nif the chain of thought is faithful to that reasoning process.\nHere, we collect evidence about various hypotheses that\ncould explain how the model uses CoT, but we do not know\nif our hypotheses are exhaustive or if other hypotheses we\ndid not investigate might be correct. Without ground truth\ninformation about the faithfulness of the reasoning sam-\nple, it is also unclear how to weigh the importance of each\nexperiment relative to the others in assessing faithfulness.\nA combination of our measurement techniques, plus addi-\ntional experiments, will be needed to determine the relative\nstrengths of evidence from each type of experiment and\nbuild a more complete picture of reasoning faithfulness.\nAdditionally, our work analyzed RLHF-finetuned models,\nwhich may generate reasoning whose faithfulness is differ-\nent from that of other models such as pretrained LLMs. For\nexample, pretrained LLMs may be more likely to condi-\ntion strongly on text they have generated, since they are\ntrained to generate the most plausible completion given\nsome input, rather than maximize the overall human-judged\nquality of the completion. Pretrained LLMs may thus show\nfewer signs of post-hoc reasoning, e.g., being more likely\nto change their final answer when mistakes are added to\nthe CoT. Overall, a promising avenue for future work is to\ninvestigate whether training schemes different from RLHF\nare more effective at eliciting faithful reasoning from LLMs.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this work, we investigate the faithfulness of reasoning\nsamples produced by large language models using chain-\nof-thought prompting. We test various hypotheses of how\nchain of thought could provide unfaithful explanations of\nthe model\u2019s reasoning, and apply these tasks across tasks\nand model size. Our experiments show large variation in the\nextent of post-hoc reasoning across tasks, and they provide\nevidence against the hypotheses that increased test-time\ncompute or phrasing-encoded information are drivers of\nCoT improvement. We also see that the degree of post-hoc\nreasoning often shows inverse scaling, getting worse with\nincreasingly capable models, suggesting that smaller models\nmay be better to use if faithful reasoning is important. We\nhope that our metrics for evaluating CoT faithfulness open\nup avenues for increasing the faithfulness of CoT, building\ntowards systems whose stated reasoning is trustworthy and\nverifiable.\nAuthor Contributions\nTamera Lanham led the project, drafted the paper, and\nconducted all experimental work.

Probability of producing the same answer under para-\nphrasing as the unmodified reasoning sample. The dotted baselines\nare the probability that two IID reasoning samples would come to\nthe same answer by chance alone.\nA. Adding Mistakes & Paraphrasing Prompts\nWe present the prompts used for the adding mistakes experi-\nment (\u00a72.4) and the paraphrasing experiment (\u00a72.6) in Table\n6 and Table 7 respectively. As noted in \u00a72.4, the mistakes\nfor the adding mistakes experiment are generated using a\npretrained base model, without RLHF fine-tuning.\nB. Additional Paraphrasing Results\nFig. 9 shows the fraction of reasoning samples that arrive\nat the same answer as the original CoT as a greater amount\nof the reasoning sample is paraphrased. If steganography\nwere an important reason that the model was coming to its\nconclusion, we might expect to see flat or downward-sloping\nlines in Fig. 9; paraphrasing that ended in the middle of\nthe chain of thought would corrupt the encoded message,\ncausing the model to lose the reasoning it had done so far\nand need to reconstruct it in the continued CoT. Instead, Fig.\n9 shows a smooth upwards curve for most steps of most\ntasks. AQuA and LogiQA are slight exceptions for six-step\nsamples, showing more flatness in earlier steps than in the\nshorter reasoning samples. However, if encoded reasoning\nis present here, it is not an important source of accuracy\nimprovement (as shown in Fig. 6).\nC. CoT Accuracy Gain Across Model Size\nFig. 10 shows the accuracy with and without CoT for the\ntasks and models used in \u00a73.1. Fig. 11 shows the accuracy\nimprovement provided by CoT in the same tasks and models.\nFor four of eight tasks (ARC (Easy), ARC (Challenge),\nHellaSwag, and AQuA) the model size at which there is\nthe greatest accuracy improvement is the same as the model\nsize at which faithfulness is greatest (see Fig. 7).\n109\n1010\n1011\nModel Size (parameters)\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAccuracy\nAQuA\nTruthfulQA\nMMLU\nOpenBookQA\nARC (Challenge)\nLogiQA\nARC (Easy)\nHellaSwag\nPerfomance with CoT\nPerformance without CoT\nFigure 10.

However, current agents\nare primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to\na disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment\nfor language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically,\nwe focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment\nwith fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social\nforum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management.\nOur environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge\nbases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon\nour environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the\nfunctional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse,\nlong-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the\ninternet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques\nsuch as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex\ntasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end\ntask success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of\n78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents,\nthat current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance\nin these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.\nOur code, data, environment reproduction resources, and video demonstrations are\npublicly available at https://webarena.dev/.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nAutonomous agents that perform everyday tasks via human natural language commands could\nsignificantly augment human capabilities, improve efficiency, and increase accessibility. Nonetheless,\nto fully leverage the power of autonomous agents, it is crucial to understand their behavior within an\nenvironment that is both authentic and reproducible. This will allow measurement of the ability of\nagents on tasks that human users care about in a fair and consistent manner.\nCurrent environments for evaluate agents tend to over-simplify real-world situations. As a result, the\nfunctionality of many environments is a limited version of their real-world counterparts, leading to\na lack of task diversity (Shi et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2018; Misra et al.,\n2016; Shridhar et al., 2020; 2021; Yao et al., 2022a). In addition, these simplifications often lower\nthe complexity of tasks as compared to their execution in the real world (Puig et al., 2018; Shridhar\net al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022a). Finally, some environments are presented as a static resource (Shi\net al., 2017; Deng et al., 2023) where agents are confined to accessing only those states that were\npreviously cached during data collection, thus limiting the breadth and diversity of exploration.\nDor evaluation, many environments focus on comparing the textual surface form of the predicted\n\u2217Lead contributors.\n\u2020Equal contribution.\n1\narXiv:2307.13854v3  [cs.AI]  25 Oct 2023\nUnder review\nAgent\nAction\nFeedback\nTell me how much I spent on \nfood purchase in March 2023\n\u201c\n\u201d\n\u201c\n\u201d\nCreate a \u2018NolanFans' repo, \nlisting Nolan's Oscar-winning \nfilms in a README file\ncheck_repo \ncheck_readme \ncheck_answer\nFunctional \nSuccess\nFunctional \nFailure\nReddit wordmark\nWhenever possible, Reddit\u2019s icon and \nwordmark should appear together. \nReddit\u2019s wordmark is a re\ufb01ned \nvariation on its classic logo.

We provide\nannotated programs designed to programmatically validate the functional correctness of each task.\naction sequences with reference action sequences, disregarding the functional correctness of the\nexecutions and possible alternative solutions (Puig et al., 2018; Jernite et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021; Li\net al., 2020; Deng et al., 2023). These limitations often result in a discrepancy between simulated\nenvironments and the real world, and can potentially impact the generalizability of AI agents to\nsuccessfully understand, adapt, and operate within complex real-world situations.\nWe introduce WebArena, a realistic and reproducible web environment designed to facilitate the\ndevelopment of autonomous agents capable of executing tasks (\u00a72). An overview of WebArena\nis in Figure 1. Our environment comprises four fully operational, self-hosted web applications,\neach representing a distinct domain prevalent on the internet: online shopping, discussion forums,\ncollaborative development, and business content management. Furthermore, WebArena incorporates\nseveral utility tools, such as map, calculator, and scratchpad, to best support possible human-like task\nexecutions. Lastly, WebArena is complemented by an extensive collection of documentation and\nknowledge bases that vary from general resources like English Wikipedia to more domain-specific\nreferences, such as manuals for using the integrated development tool (Fan et al., 2022). The content\npopulating these websites is extracted from their real-world counterparts, preserving the authenticity\nof the content served on each platform. We deliver the hosting services using Docker containers with\ngym-APIs (Brockman et al., 2016), ensuring both the usability and the reproducibility of WebArena.\nAlong with WebArena, we release a ready-to-use benchmark with 812 long-horizon web-based\ntasks (\u00a73). Each task is described as a high-level natural language intent, emulating the abstract\nlanguage usage patterns typically employed by humans (Bisk et al., 2019). Two example intents\nare shown in the upper left of Figure 1. We focus on evaluating the functional correctness of these\ntasks, i.e., does the result of the execution actually achieve the desired goal (\u00a73.2). For instance,\nto evaluate the example in Figure 2, our evaluation method verifies the concrete contents in the\ndesignated repository. This evaluation is not only more reliable (Zhong et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2021;\nWang et al., 2022) than comparing the textual surface-form action sequences (Puig et al., 2018; Deng\net al., 2023) but also accommodate a range of potential valid paths to achieve the same goal, which is\na ubiquitous phenomenon in sufficiently complex tasks.\nWe use this benchmark to evaluate several agents that can follow NL command and perform web-\nbased tasks (\u00a74). These agents are implemented in a few-shot in-context learning fashion with\npowerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PALM-2. Experiment results show that\nthe best GPT-4 agent performance is somewhat limited, with an end-to-end task success rate of only\n14.41%, while the human performance is 78.24%. We hypothesize that the limited performance of\ncurrent LLMs stems from a lack of crucial capabilities such as active exploration and failure recovery\nto successfully perform complex tasks (\u00a75.2). These outcomes underscore the necessity for further\ndevelopment towards robust and effective agents (LeCun, 2022) in WebArena.\n2\nUnder review\nSearch for museums  \nin Pittsburgh\nwebarena.wikipedia.com\nSearch for each art \nmuseum on the Map\nwebarena.openstreetmap.com\nRecord the optimized \nresults to the repo\nwebarena.gitlab.com\n\u2026\nCreate an efficient itinerary to visit all of Pittsburgh's art museums with minimal driving distance \nstarting from Schenley Park.

Success requires sophisticated,\nlong-term planning and reasoning. To accomplish the goal (top), an agent needs to (1) find Pittsburgh\nart museums on Wikipedia, (2) identify their locations on a map (while optimizing the itinerary), and\n(3) update the README file in the appropriate repository with the planned route.\n2\nWE BAR E N A: WEBSITES AS AN ENVIRONMENT FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENTS\nOur goal is to create a realistic and reproducible web environment. We achieve reproducibility by\nmaking the environment standalone, without relying on live websites. This circumvents technical\nchallenges such as bots being subject to CAPTCHAs, unpredictable content modifications, and\nconfiguration changes, which obstruct a fair comparison across different systems over time. We\nachieve realism by using open-source libraries that underlie many in-use sites from several popular\ncategories and importing data to our environment from their real-world counterparts.\n2.1\nCONTROLLING AGENTS THROUGH HIGH-LEVEL NATURAL LANGUAGE\nThe WebArena environment is denoted as E= \u27e8S, A, O, T \u27e9 with state space S, action space A (\u00a72.4)\nand observation space O (\u00a72.3). The transition function T : S \u00d7 A\u2212\u2192 S is deterministic, and it is\ndefined by the underlying implementation of each website in the environment. Performing a task\ndescribed by a natural language intent i can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP): at each time step t, an agent issues an action at\u2208 A given the partial observation\not\u2208 O. Consequently, the action results in a new state st+1\u2208 S and its corresponding observation\not+1\u2208 O. We propose a reward function r(a, s) to measure the success of a task execution, where\na represents the sequence of actions, and s denotes all intermediate states. This reward function\nassesses if state transitions align with the expectations of the intents. For example, with an intent to\nplace an order, it verifies whether an order has been placed. Additionally, it evaluates the accuracy of\nthe agent\u2019s actions, such as checking the correctness of the predicted answer.\n2.2\nWEBSITE SELECTION\nTo decide which categories of websites to use, we first analyzed approximately 200 examples from the\nauthors\u2019 actual web browser histories. Each author delved into their browsing histories, summarizing\nthe goal of particular segments of their browser session. Based on this, we classified the visited\nwebsites into abstract categories. We then identified the four most salient categories and implemented\none instance per category based on this analysis: (1) E-commerce platforms supporting online\nshopping activities (e.g., Amazon, eBay), (2) social forum platforms for opinion exchanges (e.g.,\nReddit, StackExchange), (3) collaborative development platforms for software development (e.g.,\nGitLab), and (4) content management systems (CMS) that manage the creation and revision of the\ndigital content (e.g., online store management).\nIn addition to these platforms, we selected three utility-style tools that are frequently used in web-\nbased tasks: (1) a map for navigation and searching for information about points of interest (POIs)\nsuch as institutions or locations (2) a calculator, and (3) a scratchpad for taking notes. As information-\nseeking and knowledge acquisition are critical in web-based tasks, we also incorporated various\nknowledge resources into WebArena. These resources range from general information hubs, such\nas the English Wikipedia, to more specialized knowledge bases, such as the website user manuals.\n3\nUnder review\n<li> \n  <div> \n     <a href=\"...\"><img src=\"...\"></a> \n     <div class> \n        <a href=\"...\">Outdoor Patio \u2026\n</a> \n        <div> \n              <span>Rating:</span> \n              <div> \n                 <span>82%</span> \n              </div> \n              <a href=\u201c\u2026#reviews\">12 \n<span>Reviews</span></a> \nwebarena.onestopshop.com\nwebarena.onestopshop.com\nRootWebArea \u2018Patio, Lawn ..\u2019 \n  link 'Image' \n     img 'Image' \n  link 'Outdoor Patio..\u2019 \n  LayoutTable '' \n      StaticText 'Rating:' \n      generic '82%' \n      link '12 Reviews' \n  StaticText \u2018$49.99' \n  button 'Add to Cart\u2019 focusable: True \n  button 'Wish List\u2019 focusable: \u2026 \n  button 'Compare\u2019 focusable: \u2026\nwebarena.onestopshop.com\nFigure 3: We design the observation to be the URL and the content of a web page, with options to\nrepresent the content as a screenshot (left), HTML DOM tree (middle), and accessibility tree (right).\nThe content of the middle and right figures are trimmed to save space.\nImplementation\nWe leveraged open-source libraries relevant to each category to build our own\nversions of an E-commerce website (OneStopShop), GitLab, Reddit, an online store content manage-\nment system (CMS), a map, and an English Wikipedia. Then we imported sampled data from their\nreal-world counterparts. As an example, our version of GitLab was developed based on the actual\nGitLab project.1 We carefully emulated the features of a typical code repository by including both\npopular projects with many issues and pull requests and smaller, personal projects. Details of all\nwebsites in WebArena can be found in Appendix A.1. We deliver the environment as dockers and\nprovide scripts to reset the environment to a deterministic initial state (See Appendix A.2).\n2.3\nOBSERVATION SPACE\nWe design the observation space to roughly mimic the web browser experience: a web page URL, the\nopened tabs , and the web page content of the focused tab. WebArena is the first web environment\nto consider multi-tab web-based tasks to promote tool usage, direct comparisons and references\nacross tabs, and other functionalities. The multi-tab functionality offers a more authentic replication\nof human web browsing habits compared to maintaining everything in a single tab. We provide\nflexible configuration to render the page content in many modes: (see Figure 3 for an example): (1)\nthe raw web page HTML, composed of a Document Object Model (DOM) tree, as commonly used\nin past work (Shi et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2020); (2) a screenshot, a pixel-based\nrepresentation that represents the current web page as an RGB array and (3) the accessibility tree of\nthe web page.2 The accessibility tree is a subset of the DOM tree with elements that are relevant and\nuseful for displaying the contents of a web page. Every element is represented as its role (e.g., a link),\nits text content, and its properties (e.g., whether it is focusable). Accessibility trees largely retain the\nstructured information of a web page while being more compact than the DOM representation.\nWe provide an option to limit the content to the contents within a viewport for all modes. This\nensures that the observation can be input into a text-based model with limited context length or an\nimage-based model with image size or resolution requirements.\n2.4\nACTION SPACE\nFollowing previous work on navigation and operation in web and embodied environments (Shi et al.,\n2017; Liu et al., 2018), we design a compound action space that emulates the keyboard and mouse\noperations available on web pages. Figure 4 lists all the available actions categorized into three\ndistinct groups. The first group includes element operations such as clicking, hovering, typing, and\nkey combination pressing. The second comprises tab-related actions such as opening, closing, and\nswitching between tabs. The third category consists of URL navigation actions, such as visiting a\nspecific URL or navigating forward and backward in the browsing history.\nBuilding on these actions, WebArena provides agents with the flexibility to refer to elements for\noperation in different ways. An element can be selected by its on-screen coordinates, (x, y), or by\na unique element ID that is prepended to each element. This ID is generated when traversing the\nDocument Object Model (DOM) or accessibility tree. With element IDs, the element selection is\ntransformed into an n-way classification problem, thereby eliminating any disambiguation efforts\nrequired from the agent or the underlying implementation. For example, issuing the action click\n1https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\n2https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree\n4\nUnder review\n[1582] clicks the button given the observation of [1582] Add to Cart. This flexible element\nselection allows WebArena to support agents designed in various ways (e.g., accepting input from\ndifferent modalities) without compromising fair comparison metrics such as step count.\nUser Role Simulation\nUsers of the same website often have disparate experiences due to their\ndistinct roles, permissions, and interaction histories. We emulate this scenario by generating unique\nuser profiles on each platform. The details can be found in Appendix A.3.\n3\nBENCHMARK SUITE OF WEB-BASED TASKS\nWe provide a benchmark with 812 test examples on grounding high-level natural language instructions\nto interactions in WebArena. Each example has a metric to evaluate the functional correctness of\nthe task execution. In this section, we first formally define the task of controlling an autonomous\nagent through natural language. Then we introduce the annotation process of our benchmark.\n3.1\nINTENT COLLECTION\nWe focus on curating realistic intents to carry out complex and creative tasks within WebArena. To\nstart with, our annotators were guided to spend a few minutes exploring the websites to familiarize\nthemselves with the websites\u2019 content and functionalities. As most of our websites are virtually\nidentical to their open-web counterparts, despite having sampled data, most annotators can quickly\ncomprehend the websites.\nNext, we instructed the annotators to formulate intents based on the following criteria:\n(1) The intent should be abstract and high-level, implying that the task cannot be fulfilled with\nmerely one or two actions. As an example, instead of \u201cclick the science subreddit\u201d, we\nencouraged annotators to come up with something more complex like \u201cpost a greeting message\non science subreddit\u201d, which involves performing multiple actions.\n(2) The intent should be creative. Common tasks such as account creation can be easily thought of.\nWe encouraged the annotators to add constraints (e.g., \u201ccreate a Reddit account identical to my\nGitLab one\u201d) to make the intents more unique.\n(3) The intent should be formulated as a template by making replaceable elements as variables.\nThe annotators were also responsible for developing several instantiations for each variable.\nFor example, the intent \u201ccreate a Reddit account identical to my GitLab one\u201d can be converted\ninto \u201ccreate a {{site1}} account identical to my {{site2}} one\u201d, with an instantiation like \u201c{site1:\nReddit, site2: GitLab}\u201d and another like \u201c{site1: GitLab, site2: OneStopShopping}\u201d. Notably,\ntasks derived from the same template can have distinct execution traces. The similarity resides\nprimarily in the high-level semantics rather than the specific implementation.\nWe also provided a prompt for the annotators to use with ChatGPT3 for inspiration, that contains an\noverview of each website and instructs the model to describe potential tasks to be performed on these\nsites. Furthermore, we offered a curated list of examples for annotators to reference.\nIntent Analysis\nIn total, we curated 241 templates and 812 instantiated intents. On average, each\ntemplate is instantiated to 3.3 examples. The intent distribution is shown in Figure 6.\nFurthermore, we classify the intents into three primary categories with examples shown in Figure 5:\n(1) Information-seeking tasks expect a textual response. Importantly, these tasks in WebArena\noften require navigation across multiple pages or focus on user-centric content. This makes\nthem distinct from open-domain question-answering (Yang et al., 2018; Kwiatkowski et al.,\n2019), which focuses on querying general knowledge with a simple retrieval step. For instance,\nto answer \u201cWhen was the last time I bought the shampoo\u201d, an agent traverses the user\u2019s purchase\nhistory, checking order details to identify the most recent shampoo purchase.\n(2) Site navigation: This category is composed of tasks that require navigating through web pages\nusing a variety of interactive elements such as search functions and links. The objective is often\nto locate specific information or navigate to a particular section of a site.\n3https://chat.openai.com/\n5\nUnder review\nAction Type\nDescription\nnoop\nDo nothing\nclick(elem)\nClick at an element\nhover(elem)\nHover on an element\ntype(elem, text)\nType to an element\npress(key_comb)\nPress a key comb\ntab_focus(index)\nfocus on i-th tab\nnew_tab\nOpen a new tab\ntab_close\nClose current tab\ngo_back\nVisit the last URL\ngo_forward\nUndo go_back\ngoto(URL)\nGo to URL\nFigure 4: Action Space of WebArena\nCategory\nExample\nInformation\nSeeking\nWhen was the last time I bought shampoo\nCompare walking and driving time\nfrom AMC Waterfront to Randyland\nSite\nNavigation\nCheckout merge requests assigned to me\nShow me the ergonomic chair\nwith the best rating\nContent\n&\nConfig\nPost to ask \u201cwhether I need a car in NYC\u201d\nDelete the reviews from the scammer Yoke\nFigure 5: Example intents from three categories.\n(3) Content and configuration operation: This category encapsulates tasks that require operating\nin the web environment to create, revise, or configure content or settings. This includes adjusting\nsettings, managing accounts, performing online transactions, generating new web content, and\nmodifying existing content. Examples range from updating a social media status or README\nfile to conducting online purchases and configuring privacy settings.\n3.2\nEVALUATION ANNOTATION\nEvaluating Information Seeking Tasks\nTo measure the correctness of information-seeking tasks\nwhere a textual answer is expected, we provide the annotated answer a\u2217 for each intent. The a\u2217 is\nfurther compared with the predicted answer \u02c6a with one of the following scoring functions rinfo(\u02c6a, a\u2217).\nFirst, we define exact_match where only \u02c6a that is identical with a\u2217 receives a score of one. This\nfunction is primarily applicable to intent types whose responses follow a more standardized format,\nsimilar to the evaluation on question answering literature (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018).\nSecond, we create must_include where any \u02c6a containing a\u2217 receives a score of one. This function\nis primarily used in when an unordered list of text is expected or where the emphasis of evaluation is\non certain key concepts. In the second example in Table 1, we expect both the correct name and the\nemail address to be presented, irrespective of the precise wording used to convey the answer.\nFinally, we introduce fuzzy_match where we utilize a language model to assess whether \u02c6a is\nsemantically equivalent to a\u2217. Specifically, in this work, we use gpt-4-0613 to perform this\nevaluation. The corresponding prompt details are provided in Appendix A.6. The fuzzy_match\nfunction applies to situations where the format of the answer is diverse. For instance, in responding\nto \u201cCompare the time for walking and driving route from AMC Waterfront to Randyland\u201d, it is\nessential to ensure that driving time and walking time are accurately linked with the correct terms.\nThe fuzzy_match function could also flexibly match the time \u201c2h58min\u201d with different forms\nsuch as \u201c2 hour 58 minutes\u201d, \u201c2:58\u201d and others.\nEvaluating Site Navigation and Content & Config Tasks\nThe tasks in these categories require\naccessing web pages that meet certain conditions or performing operations that modify the underlying\ndata storage of the respective websites. To assess these, we establish reward functions rprog(s)\nthat programmatically examine the intermediate states s within an execution trajectory to ascertain\nwhether the outcome aligns with the intended result. These intermediate states are often the underlying\ndatabases of the websites, the status, and the content of a web page at each step of the execution.\nEvaluating each instance involves two components. First, we provide a locator, tasked with\nretrieving the critical content pertinent to each intent. The implementation of this locator varies from\na database query, a website-supported API call, to a JavaScript element selection on the relevant web\npage, depending on implementation feasibility. For example, the evaluation process for the intent of\nthe fifth example in Table 1, first obtains the URL of the latest post by examining the last state in the\nstate sequence s. Then it navigates to the corresponding post page and obtains the post\u2019s content by\nrunning the Javascript \u201cdocument.querySelector(\u2018.submission__inner\u2019).outerText\u201d.\nSubsequently, we annotate keywords that need to exist within the located content. For example,\nthe evaluation verifies if the post is correctly posted in the \u201cnyc\u201d subreddit by examining the URL of\n6\nUnder review\nFunction\nID\nIntent\nEval Implementation\nrinfo(a\u2217, \u02c6a)\n1\nTell me the name of the customer who\nhas the most cancellations in the history\nexact_match(\u02c6a, \u201cSamantha Jones\u201d)\n2\nFind the customer name and\nemail with phone number 8015551212\nmust_include(\u02c6a, \u201cSean Miller\u201d)\nmust_include(\u02c6a, \u201csean@gmail.com\u201d)\n3\nCompare walking and driving time\nfrom AMC Waterfront to Randyland\nfuzzy_match(\u02c6a, \u201cwalking: 2h58min\u201d)\nfuzzy_match(\u02c6a, \u201cdriving: 21min\u201d)\nrprog(s)\n4\nCheckout merge requests\nassigned to me\nurl=locate_current_url(s)\nexact_match(URL, \u201cgitlab.com/merge_\nrequests?assignee_username=byteblaze\u201d)\n5\nPost to ask \u201cwhether I\nneed a car in NYC\u201d\nurl=locate_latest_post_url(s)\nbody=locate_latest_post_body(s)\nmust_include(URL, \u201c/f/nyc\u201d)\nmust_include(body,\u201ca car in NYC\u201d)\nTable 1: We introduce two evaluation approaches. rinfo (top) measures the correctness of performing\ninformation-seeking tasks. It compares the predicted answer \u02c6a with the annotated reference a\u2217\nwith three implementations. rprog (bottom) programmatically checks whether the intermediate states\nduring the executions possess the anticipated properties specified by the intent.\nthe post and if the post contains the requested content by examining the post content. We reuse the\nexact_match and must_include functions from information-seeking tasks for this purpose.\nUnachievable Tasks\nDue to constraints such as inadequate evidence, user permissions (\u00a7A.3),\nor the absence of necessary functional support on the website, humans may ask for tasks that are\nnot possible to complete. Inspired by previous work on evaluating question-answering models on\nunanswerable questions (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), we design unachievable tasks in WebArena. For\ninstance, fulfilling an intent like \u201cTell me the contact number of OneStopShop\u201d is impracticable\nin WebArena, given that the website does not provide such contact information. We label such\ninstances as \"N/A\" and expect an agent to produce an equivalent response. These examples allow us\nto assess an agent\u2019s ability to avoid making unfounded claims and its adherence to factual accuracy.\nAnnotation Process\nThe intents were contributed by the authors following the annotation guideline\nin \u00a73.1. Every author has extensive experience with web-based tasks. The reference answers to\nthe information-seeking tasks were curated by the authors and an external annotator. To ensure\nconsistency and accuracy, each question was annotated twice. If the two annotators disagreed, a\nthird annotator finalized the annotation. The programs to evaluate the remaining examples were\ncontributed by three of the authors who are proficient in JavaScript programming. Difficult tasks\nwere often discussed collectively to ensure the correctness of the annotation. The annotation required\nthe annotator to undertake the full execution and scrutinize the intermediate states.\nAvg. Time\n110s\nSuccess Rateinfo\n74.68%\nSuccess Rateothers 81.32%\nSuccess Rateall\n78.24%\nHuman Performance\nWe sample one task from each of the 170 tem-\nplates and ask five computer science graduate students to perform these\ntasks. The human performance is on the right. Overall, the human\nannotators complete 78.24% of the tasks, with lower performance on\ninformation-seeking tasks. Through examining the recorded trajectories,\nwe found that 50% of the failures are due to misinterpreting the intent (e.g., providing travel distance\nwhen asked for travel time), incomplete answers (e.g., providing only name when asked for name and\nemail), and incomplete executions (e.g., partially filling the product information), while the remaining\ninstances have more severe failures, where the executions are off-target.\n4\nBASELINE WEB AGENTS\nWe experiment with three LLMs using two prompting strategies, both with two examples in the\ncontext. In the first setting, we ask the LLM to directly predict the next action given the current\nobservation, the intent and the previously performed action. In the second setting, with the same\ninformation, the model first performs chain-of-thought reasoning steps in the text before the action\nprediction (CoT, Wei et al. (2022); Yao et al. (2022b)). Before the examples, we provide a detailed\n7\nUnder review\noverview of the browser environment, the allowed actions, and many rules. To make the model aware\nof the unachievable tasks, the instruction explicitly asks the agent to stop if it believes the task is\nimpossible to perform. We refer to this directive as Unachievable hint, or UA hint. This introduction\nis largely identical to the guidelines we presented to human annotators to ensure a fair comparison.\nWe use an accessibility tree with element IDs as the observation space. The agent can identify which\nelement to interact with by the ID of the element. For instance, the agent can issue click [1582]\nto click the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d button with the ID of 1582. The full prompts can be found in Appendix\nA.7. The detailed configurations of each model can be found in Appendix A.5.\n5\nRESULTS\n5.1\nMAIN RESULTS\nCoT UA Hint\nModel\nSR\nSRAC\nSRUA\n\u2713\n\u2713\nTEXT-BISON-001\n5.05\n4.00\n27.78\n\u2717\n\u2713\nGPT-3.5\n6.41\n4.90\n38.89\n\u2713\n\u2713\nGPT-3.5\n8.75\n6.44\n58.33\n\u2713\n\u2713\nGPT-4\n11.70\n8.63\n77.78\n\u2717\n\u2717\nGPT-3.5\n5.10\n4.90\n8.33\n\u2713\n\u2717\nGPT-3.5\n6.16\n6.06\n8.33\n\u2713\n\u2717\nGPT-4\n14.41\n13.02\n44.44\n-\n\u2713\nHuman\n78.24\n77.30\n100.00\nTable 2: The end-to-end task success rate (SR %) on\nWebArena with different prompting strategies. CoT:\nthe model performs step-by-step reasoning before is-\nsuing the action. UA hint: ask the model to stop when\nencountering unachievable questions.\nThe main results are shown on the top of\nTable 2. GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) with CoT\nprompting achieves a modest end-to-end task\nsuccess rate of 11.70%, which is signifi-\ncantly lower than the human performance\nof 78.24%. GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022) with\nCoT prompting is only able to successfully\nperform 8.75% of the tasks. The explicit\nreasoning procedure is somewhat helpful, it\nbrings 2.34% improvement over the version\nwithout it. Further, TEXT-BISON-001 (Anil\net al., 2023) underperforms GPT-3.5, with\na success rate of 5.05%. These results under-\nline the inherent challenges and complexities\nof executing tasks that span long horizons,\nparticularly in realistic environments such as\nWebArena.\n5.2\nANALYSIS\nDo models know when to stop?\nIn our error analysis of the execution trajectories, we observe\na prevalent error pattern of early stopping due to the model\u2019s conclusion of unachievability. For\ninstance, GPT-4 erroneously identifies 54.9% of feasible tasks as impossible. This issue primarily\nstems from the UA hint in the instruction, while this hint allows models to identify unachievable\ntasks, it also hinders performance on achievable tasks. To address this, we conduct an ablation study\nwhere we remove this hint. We then break down the success rate for both achievable and unachievable\ntasks. As shown in Table 2, eliminating this instruction led to a performance boost in achievable\ntasks, enhancing the overall task success rate of GPT-4 to 14.41%. Despite an overall decline in\nidentifying unachievable tasks, GPT-4 retains the capacity to recognize 44.44% of such tasks.

For instance, while \u201cFork metaseq\u201d can be a straightforward task, \u201cFork all repos\nfrom Facebook\u201d derived from the same template requires more repetitive operations, hence increasing\nits complexity. Therefore, WebArena provide a testbed to evaluate more sophisticated methods. In\nparticular, those that incorporate memory components, enabling the reuse of successful strategies\nfrom past experiments Zhou et al. (2022a); Wang et al. (2023). More error analysis with examples\ncan be found in Appendix A.8.\n6\nRELATED WORK\nBenchmarks for Controlling Agents through Natural Language\nControlling agents via natural\nlanguage in the digital world have been studied in the literature (Branavan et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2017;\nLiu et al., 2018; Toyama et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). However,\nthe balance between functionality, authenticity, and support for environmental dynamics remains a\nchallenge. Existing benchmarks often compromise these aspects, as shown in Table 4. Some works\nrely on static states, limiting agents\u2019 explorations and functional correctness evaluation (Shi et al.,\n2017; Deng et al., 2023), while others simplify real-world complexities, restricting task variety (Yao\net al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2018). While AndroidEnv (Toyama et al., 2021) replicates an Android setup, it\ndoes not evaluate complex and realistic tasks. This gap is also seen in synthetic environments (Kolve\net al., 2017; Shridhar et al., 2020; Puig et al., 2018) and extends to gaming environments (Fan et al.,\n2022; K\u00fcttler et al., 2020), where the environment mechanisms often diverge from human objectives.\nInteractive Decision-Making Agents\nNakano et al. (2021) introduce WebGPT which searches\nthe web and reads the search results to answer questions. Gur et al. (2023) propose a web agent\nthat decomposes tasks into more manageable sub-tasks and synthesizes Javascript code for the task\nexecutions. Adding a multi-modal dimension, Lee et al. (2023) and Shaw et al. (2023) develop agents\nthat predict actions based on screenshots of web pages rather than relying on the text-based DOM\ntrees. Performing tasks in interactive environments requires the agents to exhibit several capabilities\nincluding hierarchical planning, state tracking, and error recovery. Existing works (Huang et al.,\n2022; Madaan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023) observe LLMs could break a task into more manageable\nsub-tasks (Zhou et al., 2022b). This process can be further refined by representing task executions as\nprograms, a technique that aids sub-task management and skill reuse (Zhou et al., 2022a; Liang et al.,\n2023; Wang et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023). Meanwhile, search and backtracking methods introduce a\nmore structured approach to planning while also allowing for decision reconsideration (Yao et al.,\n2023; Long, 2023). Existing works also incorporate failure recovery, self-correction (Shinn et al.,\n2023; Kim et al., 2023), observation summarization (Sridhar et al., 2023) to improve execution\nrobustness. The complexity of WebArena presents a unique challenge and opportunity for further\ntesting and improvement of these methods.\n9\nUnder review\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe present WebArena, a highly-realistic, standalone, and reproducible web environment designed\nfor the development and testing of autonomous agents. WebArena includes fully functional web\napplications and genuine data from four major categories, providing a realistic platform for agent\ninteraction. It further supports a wide range of tools and external knowledge bases, fostering a focus\non human-like problem-solving. Additionally, we curate a comprehensive benchmark consisting\nof 812 examples that focus on translating high-level natural language intents into specific web\ninteractions. We also offer metrics to programmatically ascertain whether tasks have been completed\naccording to the desired objectives. Our experiments show that even GPT-4 only achieves a limited\nend-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lagging behind the human performance of\n78.24%. These findings underscore the need for future research to focus on enhancing the robustness\nand efficacy of autonomous agents within WebArena environment.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nWe would like to thank Emmy Liu, Zhiruo Wang, Zhitong Guo for examining our annotations,\nShunyu Yao for providing the raw Amazon product data in Webshop, Pengfei Liu, Zaid Sheikh\nand Aman Madaan for the helpful discussions.

To achieve this, we utilized open-source frameworks\nfor the development of the websites across various categories and imported data from their real-world\ncounterparts. For the E-commerce category, we constructed a shopping website with approximately\n90k products, including the prices, options, detailed product descriptions, images, and reviews,\nspanning over 300 product categories. This website is developed using Adobe Magento, an open-\nsource e-commerce platform4. Data resources were obtained from data from actual online sites, such\nas that included in the Webshop data dumpYao et al. (2022a). As for the social forum platform, we\ndeployed an open-source software Postmill5, the open-sourced counterpart of Reddit6. We sampled\nfrom the top 50 subreddits7. We then manually selected many subreddit for northeast US cities\nas well as subreddit for machine learning and deep learning-related topics. This manual selection\nencourages cross-website tasks such as seeking information related to the northeast US on both\nReddit and the map. In total, we have 95 subreddits, 127390 posts, and 661781 users. For the\ncollaborative software development platform, we choose GitLab8. We heuristically simulate the code\nrepository characteristics by sampling at least ten repositories for every programming language: 80%\nof them are sampled from the set of top 90 percentile wrt stars repos using a discrete probability\ndistribution weighted proportional to their number of stars; the remaining are sampled from the\nbottom ten percentile set using similar weighted distribution. This is done to ensure fair representation\nof repos of all kinds, from popular projects with many issues and pull requests to small personal\nprojects. In total, we have 300 repositories and more than 1000 accounts with at least one commit\nto a repository. For the content management system, we adapted Adobe Magento\u2019s admin portal,\ndeploying the sample data provided in the official guide. We employ OpenStreetMap9 for map service\nimplementation, confining our focus to the northeast US region due to data storage constraints. We\nimplement a calculator and a scratchpad ourselves.\nLastly, we configure the knowledge resources as individual websites, complemented with search\nfunctionality for efficient information retrieval. Specifically, we utilize Kiwix10 to host an offline\nversion of English Wikipedia with a knowledge cutoff of May 2023. The user manuals for GitLab\nand Adobe Commerce Merchant documentation are scraped from the official websites.\nA.2\nENVIRONMENT DELIVERY AND RESET\nOne goal for our evaluation environment is ease of use and reproducibility. As a result, we deploy our\nwebsites in separate Docker images 11, one per website. The Docker images are fully self-contained\nwith all the code of the website, database, as well as any other software dependencies. They also\ndo not rely on external volume mounts to function, as the data of the websites are also part of the\ndocker image. This way, the image is easy to distribution containing all the pre-populated websites\nfor reproducible evaluation. End users can download our packaged Docker images and run them on\ntheir systems and re-deploy the exact websites together with the data used in our benchmarks for\ntheir local benchmarking.\nSince some evaluation cases may require the agent to modify the data contained in the website,\ne.g., creating a new user, deleting a post, etc., it is crucial to be able to easily reset the website\nenvironment to its initial state. With Docker images, the users could stop and delete the currently\nrunning containers for that website and start the container from our original image again to fully\nreset the environment to the initial state. Depending on the website, this process may take from a\nfew seconds to one minute. However, not all evaluation cases would require an environment reset, as\n4https://github.com/magento/magento2\n5https://postmill.xyz/\n6https://www.reddit.com/\n7https://redditlist.com/sfw.html\n8https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\n9https://www.openstreetmap.org/\n10https://www.kiwix.org/en/\n11https://www.docker.com/\n15\nUnder review\nCMS\n22.4%\nMap\n13.4%\nE-commerce\n23.0%\nReddit\n13.1%\nGitlab\n22.2%\nCross Site\n5.9%\nFigure 6: The intent distribution across different websites. Cross-site intents necessitate interacting\nwith multiple websites. Notably, regardless of the website, all user intents require interactions with\nmultiple web pages.\nmany of the intents are information gathering and are read-only for the website data. Also, combined\nwith the inference time cost for the agent LLMs, we argue that this environment reset method, through\nrestarting Docker containers from the original images, will have a non-negligible but small impact on\nevaluation time.\nA.3\nUSER ROLES SIMULATION\nUsers of the same website often have disparate experiences due to their distinct roles, permissions,\nand interaction histories. For instance, within an E-commerce CMS, a shop owner might possess\nfull read and write permissions across all content, whereas an employee might only be granted write\npermissions for products but not for customer data. We aim to emulate this scenario by generating\nunique user profiles on each platform.\nOn the shopping site, we created a customer profile that has over 35 orders within a span of two years.\nOn GitLab, we selected a user who maintains several popular open-source projects with numerous\nmerge requests and issues. This user also manages a handful of personal projects privately. On\nReddit, our chosen profile was a user who actively participates in discussions, with many posts and\ncomments. Lastly, on our E-commerce CMS, we set up a user profile for a shop owner who has full\nread-and-write access to all system contents.\nAll users are automatically logged into their accounts using a pre-cached cookie. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first publicly available agent evaluation environment to implement such a\ncharacteristic. Existing literature typically operates under the assumption of universally identical user\nroles Shi et al. (2017); Liu et al. (2018); Deng et al. (2023).\nA.4\nINTENT DISTRIBUTION\nThe distribution of intents across the websites are shown in Figure 6.\nA.5\nEXPERIMENT CONFIGURATIONS\nWe experiment with GPT-3.5-TURBO-16K-0613, GPT-4-0613, and TEXT-BISON-001 with a\ntemperature of 1.0 and a top-p parameter of 0.9. The maximum number of state transitions is set to\n30. We halt execution if the same action is repeated more than three times on the same observation\nor if the agent generates three consecutive invalid actions. These situations typically indicate a\nhigh likelihood of execution failure and hence warrant early termination. For TEXT-BISON-001, we\nadditionally allow ten retries until it generates a valid action.\nPrimarily, we use a high temperature of 1.0 to encourage the exploration. To aid replicating the\nresults, we provide the results of GPT-3.5-TURBO-16K-0613 with temperature 0.0 in Table 5 and\nthe execution trajectories in our code repository.\n16\nUnder review\nCoT UA Hint Model\nSR\n\u2713\n\u2717\nGPT-3.5\n6.28\nTable 5: The task success rate (SR %) of GPT-3.5-TURBO-16K-0613 with temperature 0.0.\nA.6\nPROMPT FOR FUZZY_MATCH\nHelp a teacher to grade the answer of a student given a question. Keep in mind that the student may\nuse different phrasing or wording to answer the question. The goal is to evaluate whether the answer\nis semantically equivalent to the reference answer.\nquestion: {{intent}}\nreference answer: {{reference answer}}\nall the string \u2019N/A\u2019 that you see is a special sequence that means \u2019not achievable\u2019\nstudent answer: {{prediction}}\nConclude the judgement by correct/incorrect/partially correct.\nPredictions that are judged as \u201ccorrect\u201d will receive a score of one, while all other predictions will\nreceive a score of zero.\nA.7\nTHE PROMPTS OF THE BASELINE WEB AGENTS\nThe system message of the reasoning agent for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is in Figure 7, and two\nexamples are in Figure 8. The system message of the direct agent for GPT-3.5 is in Figure 9 and\nthe two examples are in Figure 10. UA hint refers to the instruction of \u201c If you believe the task is\nimpossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\u201d. We remove this sentence in our\nablation studies.\nA.8\nADDITIONAL ERROR ANALYSIS\nObservation Bias\nRealistic websites frequently present information on similar topics across various\nsections to ensure optimal user accessibility. However, a GPT-4 agent often demonstrates a tendency\nto latch onto the first related piece of information it encounters without sufficiently verifying its\nrelevance or accuracy. For instance, the homepage of the E-Commerce CMS displays the best-selling\nitems based on recent purchases, while historical best-seller data is typically accessed via a separate\nreport. Presented with the task of \u201cWhat is the top-1 best-selling product in 2022\u201d, the GPT-4 agent\ndefaults to leveraging the readily available information on the homepage, bypassing the necessary\nstep of generating the report to obtain the accurate data.\nFailures in Observation Interpretation\nInterestingly, while GPT-4 is capable of summarizing the\nobservations, it occasionally overlooks more granular information, such as the previously entered\ninput. As in the right-hand example of Figure 11, [5172] StaticText indicates that the\nsearch term \u201cDMV area\u201d has already been entered. However, the agent disregards this detail and\ncontinuously issues the command type [2430] [DMV area] until it reaches the maximum\nstep limit. Furthermore, the agent often neglects the previous action information that is provided\nalongside the observation.\nWe hypothesize that these observed failures are related to the current pretraining and supervised\nfine-tuning on dialogues employed in GPT models Ouyang et al. (2022). These models are primarily\ntrained to execute instructions given immediate observations (i.e.,, the dialogue history); thereby,\nthey may exhibit a lack of explorations. Furthermore, in dialogue scenarios, subtle differences in\nNL expressions often have less impact on the overall conversation. As a result, models may tend to\noverlook minor variations in their observations.\n17\nUnder review\nYou are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser.

Recently, the notably increasing power of\nperception algorithms allows the unification of single/multi-\nobject and box/mask-based tracking. Among them, the Seg-\nment Anything Model (SAM) attracts much attention. In\nthis report, we propose HQTrack, a framework for High\nQuality Tracking anything in videos. HQTrack mainly con-\nsists of a video multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask\nrefiner (MR). Given the object to be tracked in the initial\nframe of a video, VMOS propagates the object masks to\nthe current frame. The mask results at this stage are not\naccurate enough since VMOS is trained on several close-\nset video object segmentation (VOS) datasets, which has\nlimited ability to generalize to complex and corner scenes.\nTo further improve the quality of tracking masks, a pre-\ntrained MR model is employed to refine the tracking re-\nsults. As a compelling testament to the effectiveness of our\nparadigm, without employing any tricks such as test-time\ndata augmentations and model ensemble, HQTrack ranks\nthe 2nd place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmenta-\ntion (VOTS2023) challenge. Code and models are available\nat https://github.com/jiawen-zhu/HQTrack.\n1. Introduction\nAs a fundamental video task in computer vision, visual\nobject tracking has become the cornerstone of many re-\nlated areas, such as robot vision and autonomous driving.\nThe task aims at consistently locating the specified object\nin a video sequence. As one of the most influential chal-\nlenges in the tracking field, Visual Object Tracking (VOT)\nchallenge [16, 18] attracted a lot of attention, and many\nSOTA algorithms participate to show their cutting-edge per-\nformance. The Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation\nchallenge (VOTS20231) relaxes the constraints enforced in\n1https://www.votchallenge.net/vots2023\npast VOT challenges for considering general object tracking\nin a broader context. Therefore, VOTS2023 merges short-\nterm and long-term, single-target and multiple-target track-\ning with segmentation as the only target location specifica-\ntion. This poses more challenges, e.g., inter-object relation-\nship understanding, multi-target trajectory tracking, accu-\nrate mask estimation, etc.\nVisual object tracking has made great strides with deep\nlearning techniques [10, 13, 19].\nPrevious methods can\nbe grouped into either online-update trackers [3, 9] and\nSiamese trackers [2,31]. Recently, Transformer [29] sweeps\nin computer vision, the dominant tracking methods are\nTransformer-based trackers [5, 8, 35, 39]. TransT [5] pro-\nposes transformer-based ECA and CFA modules to re-\nplace the long-used correlation calculation.\nBenefiting\nfrom Transformer\u2019s superior long-range modeling capabil-\nity, TransT outperforms the previous correlation modules\nwhich are a capable class of linear modeling. More recently,\nsome trackers [8, 39] introduce pure transformer architec-\nture, and the feature extracting and template-search region\ninteraction is completed in a single backbone, tracking per-\nformance is pushed to new records. These trackers mainly\nfocus on single object tracking and output the bounding box\nfor performance evaluation. Hence, merely employing SOT\ntrackers is not well-suited to the VOTS2023 challenge.\nVideo object segmentation aims to segment out the spe-\ncific objects of interest in a video sequence. Similar to VOT,\nsemi-supervised video object segmentation also manually\nprovides the annotated in the first frame. The main differ-\nence is that the VOS task provides a more fine-grained mask\nannotation. Early VOS methods propagate object masks\nover video frames via motion clues [6, 28] or adopt online\nlearning strategies [4,20]. Recently, Space-Temporal Mem-\nory (STM) network [24, 32] extracts the spatio-temporal\ncontext from a memory bank to handle the appearance\nchanges and occlusions, offering a promising solution for\nsemi-supervised video object segmentation.\nFor multi-\nobject segmentation, these methods segment the objects one\nby one, the final results are merged masks by post ensemble.\n1\narXiv:2307.13974v1  [cs.CV]  26 Jul 2023\nAOT [37] proposes an identification mechanism that can en-\ncode, match, and segment multiple objects at the same time.\nBased on AOT [37], DeAOT [38] decouples the hierarchi-\ncal propagation of object-agnostic and object-specific em-\nbeddings from previous frames to the current frame, further\nimproving the VOS accuracy.\nAlthough the above VOS methods can handle track-\ning task with multi-object and mask output, challenges in\nVOTS2023 benchmark remain. (i) VOTS videos contain a\nlarge number of long-term sequences, the longest of which\nexceeds 10,000 frames, which requires the tracker to be able\nto discriminate the drastic changes in object appearance and\nadapt to variations in the environment. At the same time,\nlong-term video sequences also make some memory-based\nmethods face memory bank space challenges. (ii) In VOTS\nvideos, targets will leave the field of view and then returns.\nTrackers require additional design to accommodate the dis-\nappearance and appearance of targets. (iii) A series of chal-\nlenges such as fast motion, frequent occlusion, distractors,\nand tiny objects also make this task more difficult.\nIn this work, we propose Tracking Anything in High\nQuality (termed HQTrack), which mainly consists of a\nvideo multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner\n(MR). VMOS is an improved variant of DeAOT [38], we\ncascade a 1/8 scale gated propagation module (GPM) for\nperceiving small objects in complex scenarios.\nBesides,\nIntern-T [33] is employed as our feature extractor to en-\nhance object discrimination capabilities.\nTo save mem-\nory usage, a fixed length of long-term memory is used in\nVMOS, excluding the initial frame, the memory of early\nframes will be discarded. On the other hand, it should be\nbeneficial to apply a large segmentation model to refine our\ntracking masks. SAM [15] is prone to failure when predict-\ning objects with complex structures [14], and these difficult\ncases are common in VOTS chanllenge. To further improve\nthe quality of tracking masks, a pre-trained HQ-SAM [14]\nmodel is employed to refine the tracking masks. We calcu-\nlate the outer enclosing boxes of the predicted masks from\nVMOS as box prompts and feed them into HQ-SAM to-\ngether with the original images to gain the refined masks,\nthe final tracking results are selected from VMOS and MR.\nFinally, HQTrack obtains an impressive 0.615 quality\nscore on the VOTS2023 test set, achieving runner-up at the\nVOTS2023 challenge.\n2. Method\nIn this section, we present our HQTrack in detail. We\nfirst showcase the pipeline of our method. Subsequently,\nwe introduce each component in our framework. Finally,\nwe describe the training and inference details.\n2.1. Pipeline\nThe pipeline of the proposed HQTrack is depicted in Fig-\nure 1. Given a video and the first frame reference (mask\nannotated), HQTrack first segments the target objects for\neach frame via VMOS. The segmentation results of the cur-\nrent frame are from the propagation of the first frame along\nthe temporal dimension, utilizing the modeling of appear-\nance/identification information and long/short-term mem-\nory. VMOS is a variant of DeAOT [38] so that it can ac-\ncomplish the modeling of multiple objects in a scene within\na single propagation process. Furthermore, we employ HQ-\nSAM [14] as our MR to refine the segmentation masks of\nVMOS. HQ-SAM is a variant of SAM [15], it can handle\nobjects with more complex structures than SAM. We first\nperform bounding box extraction on the target masks pre-\ndicted by VMOS, and they are fed into the HQ-SAM model\nas box prompts. Last, we design a mask selector to select\nthe final results from VMOS and MR.\n2.2. Video Multi-object Segmenter (VMOS))\nVMOS is a variant of DeAOT [38], thereby in this sub-\nsection, we first provide a brief revisiting of DeAOT which\nis the baseline of our VMOS, then we delve into the design\nof our VMOS.\nDeAOT. AOT [37] proposes to incorporate an identification\nmechanism to associate multiple objects in a unified em-\nbedding space which enables it to handle multiple objects\nin a single propagation. DeAOT is a video object segmen-\ntation model with a AOT-like hierarchical propagation. To\nalleviate the loss of object-agnostic visual information in\ndeep propagation layers, DeAOT proposes to decouple the\npropagation of visual and identification embeddings into a\ndual-branch gated propagation module (GPM). GPM is an\nefficient module with single-head attention for constructing\nhierarchical propagation.\nVMOS. The video multiple object segmenter (VMOS) in\nHQTrack is a variant of DeAOT. As shown in the left of\nFigure 1, to improve the segmentation performance, espe-\ncially perceiving tiny objects, we cascade a GPM with 8\u00d7\nscale and expand the propagation process to multiple scales.\nThe original DeAOT only performs propagating operation\non the visual and identification features of 16\u00d7 scale. At\nthis scale, lots of detailed object clues are lost, especially\nfor tiny objects, 16\u00d7 scale features are insufficient for accu-\nrate video object segmentation. In our VMOS, considering\nthe memory usage and model efficiency, we only use up-\nsampling and linear projection to upscale the propagation\nfeatures to 4\u00d7 scale. Multi-scale propagation features will\nbe fed into the decoder along with multi-scale encoder fea-\ntures for mask prediction. Decoder is a simple FPN [21].\nIn addition, as a new large-scale CNN-based foundation\nmodel, Internimage [33] employs deformable convolution\nas the core operator, showing impressive performance on\n2\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 1\n+\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\nEncoder\nHQ-SAM\nSelect \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f\nEncoder\nEncoder\nDecoder\nDecoder\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\nPropagation\nPropagation\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\n+\nVMOS\nMR\nGPM\nUp & Proj\n\u2026\nGPM\n\u210e_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\u210e_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\u210e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\n\u210e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\nGPM\nUp & Proj\n\u210e_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\nFigure 1. Overview of HQTrack. It mainly consists of a video multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner (MR).\nvarious representative tasks e.g., object detection and seg-\nmentation. In VMOS, Intern-T is employed as our encoder\nto enhance object discrimination capabilities.\n2.3. Mask Refiner (MR)\nMR is a pre-trained HQ-SAM [14], in this section, we\nfirst revisit the HQ-SAM method which is a variant of\nSAM [15], then we provide the usage of HQ-SAM.\nSAM and HQ-SAM. Segment anything model (SAM) has\nrecently attracted high-heat attention in the field of image\nsegmentation, and researchers have utilized SAM to sec-\nondary a series of work (including but not limited to seg-\nmentation) with many stunning results. SAM scales up seg-\nmentation models by training with a high-quality annotated\ndataset containing 1.1 billion masks. In addition to the pow-\nerful zero-shot capabilities brought by large-scale training,\nSAM also involves flexible human interaction mechanisms\nachieved by different prompt formats. However, when the\nprocessed image contains objects with intricate structures,\nSAM\u2019s prediction masks tend to fall short. To tackle such\nan issue as well as maintain SAM\u2019s original promptable de-\nsign, efficiency, and zero-shot generalizability, Ke et al. pro-\npose HQ-SAM [14]. HQ-SAM introduces a few additional\nparameters to the pre-trained SAM model.\nHigh-quality\nmask is obtained by injecting a learning output token into\nSAM\u2019s mask decoder.\nMR. HQTrack employs the above HQ-SAM as our mask re-\nfiner. As shown in the right of Figure 1, we take the predic-\ntion mask from VMOS as the input of MR. Since the VMOS\nmodel is trained on scale-limited close-set datasets, the first\nstage mask from VMOS probably with insufficient qual-\nity especially handling some complex scenarios. Hence,\nemploying a large-scale trained segmentation algorithm to\nrefine the primary segmentation results will bring consid-\nerable performance improvement. Specifically, we calcu-\nlate the outer enclosing boxes of the predicted mask from\nVMOS as the box prompts and feed them into HQ-SAM to-\ngether with the original image to obtain the refined masks.\nHQ-SAM here is a version with a ViT-H backbone. Finally,\nthe output mask of HQTrack is selected from the mask re-\nsults from VMOS and HQ-SAM. Specifically, we find that\nfor the same target object, the mask refined by HQ-SAM is\nsometimes completely different from the predicted mask of\nVMOS (very low IoU score) which instead harms the seg-\nmentation performance. This may be a result of the different\nunderstanding and definition of object between HQ-SAM\nand reference annotation. Hence, we set an IoU threshold \u03c4\n(between masks from VMOS and HQ-SAM) to determine\nwhich mask will be used as the final output. In our case,\nwhen the IoU score is higher than \u03c4, we choose the refined\nmask. This process constrains HQ-SAM to focus on refin-\ning the current object mask rather than re-predicting another\ntarget object.\n3. Implementation Details\nIn VMOS of HQTrack, InternImage-T [33] is employed\nas the backbone for the image encoder for the trade-off be-\ntween accuracy and efficiency. The layers number of the\nGMP for 16\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 scale is set to 3 and 1.

The long and short-term memory is used in\nour segmenter to deal with object appearance changes in\nlong-term video sequences. To save memory usage, we use\na fixed length of long-term memory of 8, excluding the ini-\ntial frame, the early memory will be discarded.\nModel Training.\nThe training process comprises two\nstages, following previous methods [37, 38].\nIn the first\nphase, we pre-train VMOS on synthetic video sequences\ngenerated from static image datasets [7, 11, 12, 22, 27]. In\nthe second stage, VMOS uses multi-object segmentation\ndatasets for training for a better understanding of the re-\nlationship between multiple objects. The training splits of\nDAVIS [25], YoutubeVOS [34], VIPSeg [23], BURST [1],\nMOTS [30], and OVIS [26] are chosen for training our\nVMOS, in which OVIS is employed to improve the robust-\nness of the tracker in handling occluded objects. We use 2\nNVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs with a global batch size of 16\nto train our VMOS. The pre-training stage uses an initial\nlearning rate of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 for 100,000 steps. The second\nstage uses an initial learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 for 150,000\nsteps. Learning rates gradually decay to 1\u00d710\u22125 in a poly-\nnomial manner [36].\nInference.\nThe inference process is as described in our\npipeline. We do not use any test time augmentation (TTA)\nsuch as flipping, multi-scale testing, and model ensemble.\n4. Experiment\n4.1. Ablation Study\nSeparate tracking v.s. Joint tracking.

We choose MS AOT [16]\n(removing Mixformer [8]) as the baseline. The results on\nVOTS2023 validation set are shown in Tabled 1. We can\nsee that joint tracking shows better performance than sepa-\nrate tracking. It may be that when joint tracking, the tracker\nwill have a better understanding of the relationship between\nthe target objects which makes the tracker obtain better ro-\nbustness to distractor interference.\nComponent-Wise Analysis on VMOS. Table 2 shows the\ncomponent-wise study results on VMOS. #1 is a trained\nbaseline method DeAOT [38]. In #2, we replace the origi-\nnal ResNet50 [13] backbone with InternImage-T [33], and\nthe AUC score increases to 0.611. Then, as reported in #3,\nwe add the multi-scale propagation mechanism as described\nin Section 2.2, the performance boosts to 0.650 in terms of\nAUC score, with a remarkable improvement of 3.9%, which\ndemonstrates the effectiveness.\nLong-term Memory Gap.\nSince the VOTS video se-\nquences tend to be long (the longest exceeds 10,000\nframes), the original long-term memory gap parameter on\ntest time for the VOS benchmark is less suitable. Therefore,\nwe do an ablution study on long-term memory gap (G) pa-\nrameter as shown in Table 3. We find that a memory gap of\n50 shows the best performance.\nAnalysis on Mask Refiner (MR). As we discuss in Sec-\ntion 2.3, directly refining all the segmentation masks is not\noptimal.\nWe provide a comparison between VMOS and\nVMOS + SAM in Figure 3.\nIn VMOS + SAM case, a\nSAM-h [15] is employed to refine all the object masks from\nVMOS. We can see that refining by SAM can bring sig-\nnificant improvement. However, for these masks with low\nquality (with low IoU score on ground truth), SAM harms\nthe performance instead. Therefore, we propose to select\nmask results from VMOS and SAM. We calculate the IoU\nscore between the masks from VMOS and SAM. When the\nIoU score is higher than \u03c4, we choose the refined mask as\nthe final output. We evaluate the influence of threshold \u03c4 in\nMR on the VOTS2023 validation set, the results are shown\nin Table 4. \u03c4 = 0.1 yields the most promising results and\nwe choose this setting in HQTrack.\n4\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 1\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\nFigure 2.

With the help\nof HQ-SAM, accurate masks can also be segmented when\nfacing challenges such as object appearance changes, fast\nmotion, and scale changes.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this report, we propose Tracking Anything in High\nQuality (HQTrack). HQTrack mainly consists of a video\nmulti-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner (MR).\nVMOS is responsible for propagating multiple targets in\nvideo frames, and MR is a large-scale pre-trained seg-\nmentation model in charge of refining the segmentation\nmasks.\nHQTrack demonstrates powerful object tracking\nand segmentation capabilities. Finally, HQTrack achieves\nthe 2nd place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmenta-\ntion (VOTS2023) challenge.\nReferences\n[1] Ali Athar, Jonathon Luiten, Paul Voigtlaender, Tarasha Khu-\nrana, Achal Dave, Bastian Leibe, and Deva Ramanan.

To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal\nbiomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering,\nmammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and\ngenomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept\nfor a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly\nencodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same\nset of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art\non all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples\nof zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and\nemergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM\nM, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe\nencouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays,\nclinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up\nto 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these\nmodels in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist\nbiomedical AI systems.\n1 Introduction\nMedicine is a multimodal discipline. Clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities\nincluding clinical notes, laboratory tests, vital signs and observations, medical images, genomics, and more\nwhen providing care.\nDespite significant progress in biomedical AI, most models today are unimodal single task systems [1\u20133].\nConsider an existing AI system for interpreting mammograms [4]. Although the system obtains state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance on breast cancer screening, it cannot incorporate relevant information such as patient\nhealth records (e.g., breast cancer gene screening status), other modalities such as MRI, or published medical\nliterature that might help contextualize, refine, and improve performance. Further, the system\u2019s output is\nconstrained to a pre-specified set of possible classifications. It cannot verbally explain its prediction or engage\nin a collaborative dialogue to learn from a physician\u2019s feedback. This bounds performance and utility of these\nnarrow, single-task, unimodal, specialist AI systems in real-world applications.\nThe emergence of foundation models [5] offers an opportunity to rethink the development of medical AI\nsystems. These models are often trained on large-scale data with self-supervised or unsupervised objectives\nand can be rapidly and effectively adapted to many downstream tasks and settings using in-context learning\nor few-shot finetuning [6, 7]. Further, they often have impressive generative capabilities that can enable\neffective human-AI interaction and collaboration. These advances enable the possibility of building a unified\nbiomedical AI system that can interpret multimodal data with complex structures to tackle many challenging\n\u2217 Equal contributions. \u2020 Equal leadership.\n\u2021 Corresponding authors: {taotu, shekazizi, alankarthi, natviv}@google.com\narXiv:2307.14334v1  [cs.CL]  26 Jul 2023\nMed-PaLM M\nGenomics\nRadiograph\nRadiology \nReport\nMedical \nKnowledge\nPathology \nMammography\nDermatology\nMedical \nQuestion \nAnswering\nMedical Visual\nQuestion \nAnswering\nMedical Image \nClassification\nRadiology \nReport \nGeneration\nGenomic\nVariant Calling\nRadiology \nReport \nSummarization\n   MultiMedBench modalities and tasks\nGenomic\nVariant Calling\nRadio Report \nGeneration\nRadiology Report \nSummarization\nMedical \nQuestion Answering \nVisual Question \nAnswering \nMammography \nClassification\nDermatology \nClassification\nBest Prior Specialist Model Capability\nMed-PaLM M Capability\nFigure 1 | Med-PaLM M overview. A generalist biomedical AI system should be able to handle a diverse range of biomedical\ndata modalities and tasks. To enable progress towards this overarching goal, we curate MultiMedBench, a benchmark spanning 14\ndiverse biomedical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, image classification, radiology report generation\nand summarization, and genomic variant calling. Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for such a\ngeneralist biomedical AI system (denoted by the shaded blue area) is competitive with or exceeds prior SOTA results from\nspecialists models (denoted by dotted red lines) on all tasks in MultiMedBench. Notably, Med-PaLM M achieves this using a\nsingle set of model weights, without any task-specific customization.\ntasks. As the pace of biomedical data generation and innovation increases, so will the potential impact of\nsuch models, with a breadth of possible downstream applications spanning fundamental biomedical discovery\nto care delivery.\nIn this work, we detail our progress towards such a generalist biomedical AI system - a unified model that\ncan interpret multiple biomedical data modalities and handle many downstream tasks with the same set of\nmodel weights. One of the key challenges of this goal has been the absence of comprehensive multimodal\nmedical benchmarks. To address this unmet need, we curate MultiMedBench, an open source multimodal\nmedical benchmark spanning language, medical imaging, and genomics modalities with 14 diverse biomedical\ntasks including question answering, visual question answering, medical image classification, radiology report\ngeneration and summarization, and genomic variant calling.\nWe leverage MultiMedBench to design and develop Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), a large-scale\ngeneralist biomedical AI system building on the recent advances in language [8, 9] and multimodal foundation\nmodels [10, 11]. In particular, Med-PaLM M is a flexible multimodal sequence-to-sequence architecture\nthat can easily incorporate and interleave various types of multimodal biomedical information. Further, the\nexpressiveness of the modality-agnostic language decoder enables the handling of various biomedical tasks in\na simple generative framework with a unified training strategy.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Med-PaLM M is the first demonstration of a generalist biomedical AI system\nthat can interpret multimodal biomedical data and handle a diverse range of tasks with a single model.\nMed-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on all tasks in\nMultiMedBench, often surpassing specialized domain and task-specific models by a large margin. In particular,\nMed-PaLM M exceeds prior state-of-the-art on chest X-ray (CXR) report generation (MIMIC-CXR dataset)\nby over 8% on the common success metric (micro-F1) for clinical efficacy. On one of the medical visual\nquestion answering tasks (Slake-VQA [12]) in MultiMedBench, Med-PaLM M outperforms the prior SOTA\nresults by over 10% on the BLEU-1 and F1 metrics.\n|2\nWe perform ablation studies to understand the importance of scale in our generalist multimodal biomedical\nmodels and observe significant benefits for tasks that require higher-level language capabilities, such as medical\n(visual) question answering. Preliminary experiments also suggest evidence of zero-shot generalization to novel\nmedical concepts and tasks across model scales, and emergent capabilities [13] such as zero-shot multimodal\nmedical reasoning. We further perform radiologist evaluation of AI-generated chest X-ray reports and observe\nencouraging results across model scales.\nOverall, these results demonstrate the potential of generalist biomedical AI systems for medicine. However,\nsignificant work remains in terms of large-scale biomedical data access for training such models, validating\nperformance in real world applications, and understanding the safety implications. We outline these key\nlimitations and directions of future research in our study. To summarize, our key contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 Curation of MultiMedBench We introduce MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark\nspanning multiple modalities including medical imaging, clinical text and genomics with 14 diverse tasks\nfor training and evaluating generalist biomedical AI systems.\n\u2022 Med-PaLM M, the first demonstration of a generalist biomedical AI system We introduce\nMed-PaLM M, a single multitask, multimodal biomedical AI system that can perform medical image\nclassification, medical question answering, visual question answering, radiology report generation and\nsummarization, genomic variant calling, and more with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM\nM reaches performance competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art (SOTA) specialist models on\nmultiple tasks in MultiMedBench without any task-specific customization.\n\u2022 Evidence of novel emergent capabilities in Med-PaLM M Beyond quantitative evaluations of\ntask performance, we observe evidence of zero-shot medical reasoning, generalization to novel medical\nconcepts and tasks, and positive transfer across tasks. These experiments suggest promising potential of\nsuch systems in downstream data-scarce biomedical applications.\n\u2022 Human evaluation of Med-PaLM M outputs Beyond automated metrics, we perform radiologist\nevaluation of chest X-ray reports generated by Med-PaLM M across different model scales. In a blinded\nside-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians expressed a pairwise preference for\nMed-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases. Furthermore, the\nbest Med-PaLM M model has on average 0.25 clinically significant errors per report. These results are\non par with human baselines from prior work [14], suggesting potential clinical utility.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Foundation models, multimodality, and generalists\nThe emergence of the foundation model paradigm [5] has had widespread impact across a variety of\napplications in language [8], vision [15], and other modalities [16]. While the idea of transfer learning [17, 18]\nusing the weights of pretrained models has existed for decades [19\u201322], a shift has come about due to the\nscale of data and compute used for pretraining such models [23]. The notion of a foundation model further\nindicates that the model can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks [5].\nWithin the foundation model paradigm, multimodality [24] has also had a variety of important impacts\n\u2013 in the datasets [25], in the inter-modality supervision [26], and in the generality and unification of task\nspecification [27, 28]. For example, language has specifically been an important enabler of foundation models\nin other modalities [11, 29]. Visual foundation models such as CLIP [30] are made possible by training\non language-labeled visual datasets [25, 31], which are easier to collect from large-scale internet data than\nclassification datasets with pre-determined class labels (i.e., ImageNet [32]). The benefits of joint language-\nand-vision supervision has also been noteworthy in generative modeling of images [33], where text-to-image\ngenerative modeling has been notably more successful at producing high-fidelity image generation [34] than\npurely unconditioned generative image modeling [35]. Further, the flexibility of language also enables a wide\nrange of task specifications all via one unified output space [36] \u2013 it is possible to phrase tasks traditionally\naddressed by different output spaces, such as object detection and object classification, all jointly via the\noutput space of language [37]. Med-PaLM M additionally benefits from the generality of multimodality, both\nvia a model [10] pretrained on large vision-language datasets [11], and also by further biomedical domain\n|3\nfinetuning through a unified generative language output space.\nA related notion to that of a foundation model is that of a generalist model \u2013 the same model with the same\nset of weights, without finetuning, can excel at a wide variety of tasks. A single multitask [17] model which\ncan address many tasks has been of long standing interest [38, 39], including for example in the reinforcement\nlearning community [40]. Language-only models such as GPT-3 [6] and PaLM [8] simultaneously excel at\nmany tasks using only prompting and in-context learning. Recent work has also explored generalist models\ncapable not only of performing many tasks, but also of processing many modalities [41]. For example, the\ncapabilities of Gato [42] span language, vision, and agent policy learning. PaLM-E [10] further shows that it\nis possible to obtain a single generalist model which excels at language-only tasks, vision-language tasks, and\nembodied vision-language tasks. Med-PaLM M is specifically a generalist model designed for the biomedical\ndomain, built by finetuning and aligning the PaLM-E generalist model.\n2.2 Multimodal foundation models in biomedicine\nGiven the potential, there has been significant interest in multimodal foundation models for different biomedical\napplications. Moor et al. [43] discuss the notion of generalist medical AI, albeit without implementation or\nempirical results. Theodoris et al. [44] introduce Geneformer, a transformer [45] based model pretrained on a\ncorpus of about 30 million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in low data network\nbiology applications. BiomedGPT [46] is a multi-task biomedical foundation model pretrained on a diverse\nsource of medical images, medical literature, and clinical notes using a combination of language model (LM)\nand masked image infilling objectives. However, all these efforts are pretrained models and as such they\nrequire further task-specific data and finetuning to enable downstream applications. In contrast, Med-PaLM\nM is directly trained to jointly solve many biomedical tasks at the same time without requiring any further\nfinetuning or model parameter updates. LLaVA-Med [47] is perhaps most similar to our effort. The authors\nuse PubMed and GPT-4 [48] to curate a multimodal instruction following dataset and finetune a LLaVA\nmodel with it. However, the experiments are limited to three medical visual question answering datasets\nand qualitative examples of conversations conditioned on a medical image. In contrast, our work is more\ncomprehensive, spanning multiple modalities including medical imaging, clinical text, and genomics with 14\ndiverse tasks and expert evaluation of model outputs.\n2.3 Multimodal medical AI benchmarks\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been limited attempts to curate benchmarks for training and\nevaluating generalist biomedical AI models.\nPerhaps the work closest in spirit is BenchMD [49].\nThe\nbenchmark spans 19 publicly available datasets and 7 medical modalities, including 1D sensor data, 2D images,\nand 3D volumetric scans. However, their tasks are primarily focused on classification whereas our benchmark\nalso includes generative tasks such as medical (visual) question answering, radiology report generation and\nsummarization. Furthermore, there is currently no implementation of a generalist biomedical AI system that\ncan competently handle all these tasks simultaneously.\n3 MultiMedBench: A Benchmark for Generalist Biomedical AI\nWe next describe MultiMedBench, a benchmark we curated to enable the development and evaluation of\ngeneralist biomedical AI. MultiMedBench is a multi-task, multimodal benchmark comprising 12 de-identified\nopen source datasets and 14 individual tasks. It measures the capability of a general-purpose biomedical AI\nto perform a variety of clinically-relevant tasks. The benchmark covers a wide range of data sources including\nmedical questions, radiology reports, pathology, dermatology, chest X-ray, mammography, and genomics.\nTasks in MultiMedBench vary across the following axes:\n\u2022 Task type: question answering, report generation and summarization, visual question answering,\nmedical image classification, and genomic variant calling.\n\u2022 Modality: text, radiology (CT, MRI, and X-ray), pathology, dermatology, mammography, and genomics.\n\u2022 Output format: open-ended generation for all tasks including classification.\n|4\nTable 1 | MultiMedBench overview. Summary of MultiMedBench, the benchmark we introduce for the development and\nevaluation of Med-PaLM M.

[9], and radiology report summarization. They were selected to assess a model\u2019s ability to\ncomprehend, recall, and manipulate medical knowledge. Multimodal tasks include medical visual question\nanswering (VQA), medical image classification, chest X-ray report generation, and genomic variant calling,\nwhich are well-suited to evaluate both the visual understanding and multimodal reasoning capabilities of these\nmodels. Table 1 includes an overview of the datasets and tasks in MultiMedBench - in total, the benchmark\ncontains over 1 million samples. For detailed descriptions of individual datasets and tasks, see Section A.1.\n4 Med-PaLM M: A Proof of Concept for Generalist Biomedical AI\nIn this section, we detail the methods underpinning the development of the Med-PaLM M model. We first\nreview preliminaries of the pretrained models in Section 4.1 from which Med-PaLM M inherits, then discuss\nthe datasets and training details involved in the finetuning and specialization of the model to the biomedical\ndomain Section 4.2.\n4.1 Model preliminaries\nNote that Med-PaLM M inherits not only the architectures of these pretrained models, but also the general\ndomain knowledge encoded in their model parameters.\nPathways Language Model (PaLM) introduced by Chowdhery et al. [8] is a densely-connected decoder-\nonly Transformer [45] based large language model (LLM) trained using Pathways [50], a large-scale ML\naccelerator orchestration system that enables highly efficient training across TPU pods. The PaLM training\ncorpus consists of 780 billion tokens representing a mixture of webpages, Wikipedia articles, source code, social\nmedia conversations, news articles, and books. PaLM models were trained at sizes of 8, 62, and 540 billion\nparameters, and all three PaLM model variants are trained for one epoch of the training data. At the time of\nits announcement, PaLM 540B achieved breakthrough performance, outperforming finetuned state-of-the-art\nmodels on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks and exceeding average human performance on BIG-bench [51].\nVision Transformer (ViT) introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. [52] extends the Transformer [45] architecture\nto visual data such as images and videos. In this work, we consider two ViT pre-trained models as vision\n|5\nencoders, the 4 billion (4B) parameters model from Chen et al. [11] and the 22 billion (22B) parameters\nmodel from Dehghani et al. [15]. Both of these models were pretrained via supervised learning on a large\nclassification dataset [53, 54] of approximately 4 billion images.\nPaLM-E introduced by Driess et al. [10] is a multimodal language model that can process sequences of\nmultimodal inputs including text, vision, and sensor signals. The primary PaLM-E model uses pretrained\nPaLM and ViT, and was initially developed for embodied robotics applications but demonstrated strong\nperformance on multiple vision language benchmarks such as OK-VQA [55] and VQA v2 [56]. Furthermore,\nPaLM-E offers the flexibility to interleave images, text and sensor signals in a single prompt, enabling the\nmodel to make predictions with a fully multimodal context. PaLM-E also exhibits a wide array of capabilities\nincluding zero-shot multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and few-shot in-context learning. We\ntherefore leverage the PaLM-E model as the base architecture for Med-PaLM M.\nWe consider three different combinations of LLM and vision encoders in our study - PaLM 8B with ViT 4B\n(PaLM-E 12B), PaLM 62B with ViT 22B (PaLM-E 84B) and PaLM 540B with ViT 22B (PaLM-E 562B).\nAll models were pretrained on diverse vision-language datasets in addition to tasks across multiple robot\nembodiments as described in Driess et al. [10].\n4.2 Putting it all together: Med-PaLM M\nMed-PaLM M is developed by finetuning and aligning the PaLM-E model to the biomedical domain using\nMultiMedBench. The following summarizes important methodological details underlying the development of\nthe model.\nDataset and preprocessing We resized all the images in MultiMedBench to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3, while preserving\nthe original aspect ratio with padding if needed. The gray-scale images were converted to 3-channel images by\nstacking up the same image along the channel dimension. Task-specific prepossessing methods such as class\nbalancing and image data augmentation are described in detail for each task in Section A.1.\nInstruction task prompting and one-shot exemplar Our goal is to train a generalist biomedical AI\nmodel to perform multiple tasks with multimodal inputs using a unified model architecture and a single set of\nmodel parameters. To this end, we trained the model with a mixture of distinct tasks simultaneously via\ninstruction tuning [57]. Specifically, we provided the model with task-specific instructions to prompt the\nmodel to perform different types of tasks in a unified generative framework. The task prompt consists of an\ninstruction, relevant context information, and a question. For example, as shown in Figure 2, in the chest\nX-ray report generation task, we included the reason for the study and the image orientation information as\nadditional context information for the model to condition its prediction on. Similarly, for the dermatology\nclassification task, we provided the patient clinical history associated with the skin lesion image. We formulated\nall classification tasks as multiple choice questions where all possible class labels are provided as individual\nanswer options and the model was prompted to generate the most likely answer as the target output. For\nother generative tasks such as visual question answering and report generation and summarization, the model\nwas finetuned on the target response.\nIn order to enable the model to better follow instructions, for the majority of tasks (see Table A.1), we added a\ntext-only \u201cone-shot exemplar\u201d to the task prompt to condition the language model\u2019s prediction. The one-shot\nexemplar helps prompt the model with a partial input-output pair. Importantly, for multimodal tasks, we\nreplaced the actual image in the exemplar with a dummy text placeholder (with the text string \u201c<img>\u201d): this\n(i) preserves training compute efficiency for single-image training, and also (ii) bypasses potential interference\nfrom cross-attention between a given text token and image tokens from multiple images [28]. Our results show\nthat this scheme is effective in prompting the model to generate the desired format of responses as detailed\nin Section 6.\nModel training We finetuned the pretrained 12B, 84B, and 562B parameter variants of PaLM-E on\nMultiMedBench tasks with mixture ratios denoted in Table A.1. These mixture ratios were empirically\ndetermined such that they are approximately proportional to the number of training samples in each dataset\nand ensuring at least one sample from each task is present in one batch. We performed an end-to-end\n|6\nInstructions: You are a helpful radiology assistant. Describe what lines, tubes, and devices are present and each of their \nlocations.

For\nmultimodal tasks, image tokens were interleaved with text tokens to form multimodal context input to the\nPaLM-E model. The multimodal context input contains at most 1 image for all finetuning tasks. However,\nwe note that Med-PaLM M is able to process inputs with multiple images during inference.\nWe used the Adafactor optimizer [58] with momentum of \u03b21 = 0.9, dropout rate of 0.1, and a constant learning\nrate schedule. We used different sets of hyperparameters in our finetuning experiments for different model\nsizes, which are further detailed in Table A.2.\nThe resulting model, Med-PaLM M (12B, 84B, and 562B), is adapted to the biomedical domain with the\ncapability to encode and interpret multimodal inputs and perform tasks including medical (visual) question\nanswering, radiology report generation and summarization, medical image classification, and genomic variant\ncalling.\n5 Evaluation\nIn this section, we describe the purpose, scope, and methods of experimental evaluations. Results are presented\nin Section 6. Evaluation experiments of Med-PaLM M were designed for the following purposes:\n\u2022 Evaluate generalist capabilities We evaluated Med-PaLM M on all tasks in MultiMedBench across\nmodel scales. We provide initial insights on the effect of scaling ViT and LLM components across different\ntasks. We compared performance to previous SOTA (including specialist single-task or single-modality\nmethods) and a state-of-art generalist model (PaLM-E) without biomedical finetuning.\n\u2022 Explore novel emergent capabilities One hypothesized benefit of training a single flexible multimodal\ngeneralist AI system across diverse tasks is the emergence of novel capabilities arising from language\n|7\nenabled combinatorial generalization, such as to novel medical concepts and tasks. We explored this via\nqualitative and qualitative experiments.\n\u2022 Measure radiology report generation quality Automatic natural language generation (NLG)\nmetrics do not provide sufficient evaluation of the clinical applicability of AI-generated radiology reports.\nWe therefore performed expert radiologist evaluation of AI-generated reports on the MIMIC-CXR\ndataset, including comparison to the radiologist-provided reference reports.\n5.1 Evaluation on MultiMedBench\nMed-PaLM M was simultaneously finetuned on a mixture of language-only and multimodal biomedical tasks\nin MultiMedBench. We assessed the model\u2019s in-distribution performance on these tasks by comparing to the\ncorresponding SOTA results obtained from separate specialist models. Specifically, we used the same few-shot\nsetup as in training for each task during evaluation. Task-specific metrics were computed on the test split of\neach task and compared to prior SOTA specialist AI systems. Note that for a small number of tasks described\nin Table 1, we were not able to find a sufficiently similar prior attempt for comparison.\n5.2 Evaluation of language enabled zero-shot generalization\nTo probe Med-PaLM M\u2019s ability to generalize to previously unseen medical concepts, we evaluate the model\u2019s\nability to predict the presence or absence of tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images. We used the\nMontgomery County chest X-ray set (MC) for this purpose. The dataset contains 138 frontal chest X-rays, of\nwhich 80 are normal cases and 58 cases have manifestations of TB [59]. Each case also contains annotations\non the abnormality seen in the lung. We note that Med-PaLM M has been trained on MIMIC-CXR dataset;\nhowever, it is not trained to explicitly predict the TB disease label.\nWe evaluated the accuracy across model scales by formulating this problem as a two-choice question answering\ntask where the model was prompted (with a text-only one-shot exemplar) to generate a yes/no answer about\nthe presence of TB in the input image.\nWe further explored zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) multimodal medical reasoning ability of the model\nby prompting with a text-only exemplar (without the corresponding image) and prompting the model to\ngenerate the class prediction and an accompanying report describing the image findings. We note that while\nwe did prompt the model with a single text-only input-output pair, we omitted the image (used a dummy\ntext placeholder instead) and the text exemplar was hand-crafted rather than drawn from the training set.\nHence, this approach can be considered zero-shot rather than one-shot.\nIn order to assess Med-PaLM M\u2019s ability to generalize to novel task scenarios, we evaluated the model\nperformance on two-view chest X-ray report generation - this is a novel task given the model was trained to\ngenerate reports only from a single-view chest X-ray.\nFinally, we also probed for evidence of positive task transfer as a result of jointly training a single generalist\nmodel to solve many different biomedical tasks. To this end, we performed an ablation study where we trained\na Med-PaLM M 84B variant by excluding the MIMIC-CXR classification tasks from the task mixture. We\ncompared this model variant to the Med-PaLM M 84B variant trained on the complete MultiMedBench\nmixture on the chest X-ray report generation task with the expectation of improved performance in the latter.\n5.3 Clinician evaluation of radiology report generation\nTo further assess the quality and clinical applicability of chest X-ray reports generated by Med-PaLM M and\nunderstand the effect of model scaling, we conducted a human evaluation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.\nThe evaluation was performed by four qualified thoracic radiologists based in India.\nDataset The evaluation set consisted of 246 cases selected from the MIMIC-CXR test split. To match the\nexpected input format of Med-PaLM M, we selected a single image from each study. We excluded studies\nthat had ground truth reports mentioning multiple X-ray views or past examinations of the same patient.\nProcedure We conducted two complementary human evaluations: (1) side-by-side evaluation where raters\ncompared multiple alternative report findings and ranked them based on their overall quality, and (2)\n|8\nindependent evaluation where raters assessed the quality of individual report findings. Prior to performing the\nfinal evaluation, we iterated upon the instructions for the raters and calibrated their grades using a pilot set\nof 25 cases that were distinct from the evaluation set. Side-by-side evaluation was performed for all 246 cases,\nwhere each case was rated by a single radiologist randomly selected from a pool of four. For independent\nevaluation, each of the four radiologists independently annotated findings generated by three Med-PaLM M\nmodel variants (12B, 84B, and 562B) for every case in the evaluation set. Radiologists were blind to the\nsource of the report findings for all evaluation tasks, and the reports were presented in a randomized order.\nSide-by-side evaluation The input to each side-by-side evaluation was a single chest X-ray, along with the\n\u201cindication\u201d section from the MIMIC-CXR study. Four alternative options for the \u201cfindings\u201d section of the\nreport were shown to raters as depicted in Figure A.3. The four alternative \u201cfindings\u201d sections corresponded\nto the dataset reference report\u2019s findings, and findings generated by three Med-PaLM M model variants (12B,\n84B, 562B). Raters were asked to rank the four alternative findings based on their overall quality using their\nbest clinical judgement.\nIndependent evaluation For independent evaluation, raters were also presented with a single chest X-ray,\nalong with the indication and reference report\u2019s findings from the MIMIC-CXR study (marked explicitly as\nsuch), but this time only a single findings paragraph generated by Med-PaLM M as shown in Figure A.4.\nRaters were asked to assess the quality of the Med-PaLM M generated findings in the presence of the reference\ninputs provided and their own judgement of the chest X-ray image. The rating schema proposed in Yu et al.\n[60] served as inspiration for our evaluation task design.\nFirst, raters assessed whether the quality and view of the provided image were sufficient to perform the\nevaluation task fully. Next, they annotated all passages in the model-generated findings that they disagreed\nwith (errors), and all missing parts (omissions). Raters categorized each error passage by its type (no finding,\nincorrect finding location, incorrect severity, reference to non-existent view or prior study), assessed its clinical\nsignificance, and suggested alternative text to replace the selected passage. Likewise, for each omission, raters\nspecified a passage that should have been included and determined if the omission had any clinical significance.\n6 Results\nHere we present results across the three different evaluation setups introduced in Section 5.\n6.1 Med-PaLM M performs near or exceeding SOTA on all MultiMedBench tasks\nMed-PaLM M performance versus baselines We compared Med-PaLM M with two baselines:\n\u2022 prior SOTA specialist models for each of the MultiMedBench tasks\n\u2022 a baseline generalist model (PaLM-E 84B) without any biomedical domain finetuning. We used this\nmodel size variant (and not PaLM-E 562B) due to compute constraints.\nResults are summarized in Table 2. Across MultiMedBench tasks, Med-PaLM M\u2019s best result (across three\nmodel sizes) exceeded prior SOTA results on 5 out of 12 tasks (for two tasks, we were unable to find a prior\nSOTA comparable to our setup) while being competitive on the rest. Notably, these results were achieved with\na generalist model using the same set of model weights without any task-specific architecture customization\nor optimization.\nOn medical question answering tasks, we compared against the SOTA Med-PaLM 2 results [61] and observed\nhigher performance of Med-PaLM 2. However, when compared to the baseline PaLM model on which\nMed-PaLM M was built, Med-PaLM M outperformed the previous best PaLM results [9] by a large margin in\nthe same few-shot setting on all three question answering datasets.\nFurther, when compared to PaLM-E 84B as a generalist baseline without biomedical domain finetuning, Med-\nPaLM M exhibited performance improvements on all 14 tasks often by a significant margin, demonstrating the\nimportance of domain adaptation. Taken together, these results illustrate the strong capabilities of Med-PaLM\nM as a generalist biomedical AI model. We further describe the results in detail for each of the individual\ntasks in Section A.3.\n|9\nTable 2 | Performance comparison on MultiMedBench. We compare Med-PaLM M with specialist SOTA models and\na generalist model (PaLM-E 84B) without biomedical domain finetuning. Across all tasks, datasets and metrics combination\nin MultiMedBench, we observe Med-PaLM M performance near or exceeding SOTA. Note that these results are achieved by\nMed-PaLM M with the same set of model weights without any task-specific customization.\nTask Type\nModality\nDataset\nMetric\nSOTA\nPaLM-E\n(84B)\nMed-PaLM M\n(Best)\nQuestion Answering\nText\nMedQA\nAccuracy\n86.50% [61]\n28.83%\n69.68%\nMedMCQA\nAccuracy\n72.30% [61]\n33.35%\n62.59%\nPubMedQA\nAccuracy\n81.80% [61]\n64.00%\n80.00%\nReport Summarization\nRadiology\nMIMIC-III\nROUGE-L\n38.70% [62]\n3.30%\n32.03%\nBLEU\n16.20% [62]\n0.34%\n15.36%\nF1-RadGraph\n40.80% [62]\n8.00%\n34.71%\nVisual\nQuestion Answering\nRadiology\nVQA-RAD\nBLEU-1\n71.03% [63]\n59.19%\n71.27%\nF1\nN/A\n38.67%\n62.06%\nSlake-VQA\nBLEU-1\n78.60% [64]\n52.65%\n92.7%\nF1\n78.10% [64]\n24.53%\n89.28%\nPathology\nPath-VQA\nBLEU-1\n70.30% [64]\n54.92%\n72.27%\nF1\n58.40% [64]\n29.68%\n62.69%\nReport Generation\nChest X-ray\nMIMIC-CXR\nMicro-F1-14\n44.20% [65]\n15.40%\n53.56%\nMacro-F1-14\n30.70% [65]\n10.11%\n39.83%\nMicro-F1-5\n56.70% [66]\n5.51%\n57.88%\nMacro-F1-5\nN/A\n4.85%\n51.60%\nF1-RadGraph\n24.40% [14]\n11.66%\n26.71%\nBLEU-1\n39.48% [65]\n19.86%\n32.31%\nBLEU-4\n13.30% [66]\n4.60%\n11.50%\nROUGE-L\n29.60% [67]\n16.53%\n27.49%\nCIDEr-D\n49.50% [68]\n3.50%\n26.17%\nImage Classification\nChest X-ray\nMIMIC-CXR\n(5 conditions)\nMacro-AUC\n81.27% [69]\n51.48%\n79.09%\nMacro-F1\nN/A\n7.83%\n41.57%\nDermatology\nPAD-UFES-20\nMacro-AUC\nN/A\n63.37%\n97.27%\nMacro-F1\nN/A\n1.38%\n84.32%\nMammography\nVinDr-Mammo\nMacro-AUC\n64.50% [49]\n51.49%\n71.76%\nMacro-F1\nN/A\n16.06%\n35.70%\nCBIS-DDSM\n(mass)\nMacro-AUC\nN/A\n47.75%\n73.31%\nMacro-F1\nN/A\n7.77%\n51.12%\nCBIS-DDSM\n(calcification)\nMacro-AUC\nN/A\n40.67%\n82.22%\nMacro-F1\n70.71% [70]\n11.37%\n67.86%\nGenomics\n(Variant Calling)\nPrecisionFDA\n(Truth Challenge V2)\nIndel-F1\n99.40% [71]\n53.01%\n97.04%\nSNP-F1\n99.70% [71]\n52.84%\n99.35%\nMed-PaLM M performance across model scales We summarize Med-PaLM M performance across\nmodel scales (12B, 84B, and 562B) in Table 3. The key observations are:\n\u2022 Language reasoning tasks benefit from scale For tasks that require language understanding and\nreasoning such as medical question answering, medical visual question answering and radiology report\nsummarization, we see significant improvements as we scale up the model from 12B to 562B.\n\u2022 Multimodal tasks bottlenecked by vision encoder performance For tasks such as mammography\nor dermatology image classification, where nuanced visual understanding is required but minimal\nlanguage reasoning is needed (outputs are classification label tokens only), the performance improved\nfrom Med-PaLM M 12B to Med-PaLM 84B but plateaued for the 562B model, possibly because the\nvision encoder is not further scaled in that step (both the Med-PaLM M 84B and 562B models use the\nsame 22B ViT as the vision encoder), thereby acting as a bottleneck to observing a scaling benefit. We\nnote the possibility of additional confounders here such as the input image resolution.\nThe scaling results on the chest X-ray report generation task are interesting (Table 3). While on the surface,\nthe task seems to require complex language understanding and reasoning capabilities and would thus benefit\n|10\nTable 3 | Performance of Med-PaLM M on MultiMedBench across model scales. We summarize the performance of\nMed-PaLM M across three model scale variants 12B, 84B, 562B. All models were finetuned and evaluated on the same set of\ntasks in MultiMedBench. We observe that scaling plays a key role in language-only tasks and multimodal tasks that require\nreasoning such as visual question answering. However, scaling has diminishing benefit for image classification and chest X-ray\nreport generation task.\nTask Type\nModality\nDataset\nMetric\nMed-PaLM M\n(12B)\nMed-PaLM M\n(84B)\nMed-PaLM M\n(562B)\nQuestion Answering\nText\nMedQA\nAccuracy\n29.22%\n46.11%\n69.68%\nMedMCQA\nAccuracy\n32.20%\n47.60%\n62.59%\nPubMedQA\nAccuracy\n48.60%\n71.40%\n80.00%\nReport Summarization\nRadiology\nMIMIC-III\nROUGE-L\n29.45%\n31.47%\n32.03%\nBLEU\n12.14%\n15.36%\n15.21%\nF1-RadGraph\n31.43%\n33.96%\n34.71%\nVisual\nQuestion Answering\nRadiology\nVQA-RAD\nBLEU-1\n64.02%\n69.38%\n71.27%\nF1\n50.66%\n59.90%\n62.06%\nSlake-VQA\nBLEU-1\n90.77%\n92.70%\n91.64%\nF1\n86.22%\n89.28%\n87.50%\nPathology\nPath-VQA\nBLEU-1\n68.97%\n70.16%\n72.27%\nF1\n57.24%\n59.51%\n62.69%\nReport Generation\nChest X-ray\nMIMIC-CXR\nMicro-F1-14\n51.41%\n53.56%\n51.60%\nMacro-F1-14\n37.31%\n39.83%\n37.81%\nMicro-F1-5\n56.54%\n57.88%\n56.28%\nMacro-F1-5\n50.57%\n51.60%\n49.86%\nF1-RadGraph\n25.20%\n26.71%\n26.06%\nBLEU-1\n30.90%\n32.31%\n31.73%\nBLEU-4\n10.43%\n11.31%\n11.50%\nROUGE-L\n26.16%\n27.29%\n27.49%\nCIDEr-D\n23.43%\n26.17%\n25.27%\nImage Classification\nChest X-ray\nMIMIC-CXR\n(5 conditions)\nMacro-AUC\n76.67%\n78.35%\n79.09%\nMacro-F1\n38.33%\n36.83%\n41.57%\nDermatology\nPAD-UFES-20\nMacro-AUC\n95.57%\n97.27%\n96.08%\nMacro-F1\n78.42%\n84.32%\n77.03%\nMammography\nVinDr-Mammo\nMacro-AUC\n66.29%\n71.76%\n71.42%\nMacro-F1\n29.81%\n35.70%\n33.90%\nCBIS-DDSM\n(mass)\nMacro-AUC\n70.11%\n73.09%\n73.31%\nMacro-F1\n47.23%\n49.98%\n51.12%\nCBIS-DDSM\n(calcification)\nMacro-AUC\n81.40%\n82.22%\n80.90%\nMacro-F1\n67.86%\n63.81%\n63.03%\nGenomics\nVariant Calling\nIndel-F1\n96.42%\n97.04%\n95.46%\nSNP-F1\n99.35%\n99.32%\n99.16%\nfrom scaling the language model, we find the Med-PaLM M 84B model to be roughly on-par or slightly\nexceeding the 562B model on a majority of metrics, which may simply be due to fewer training steps used for\nthe larger model. Another possibility for the diminishing return of increasing the size of language model is\nlikely that the output space for chest X-ray report generation in the MIMIC-CXR dataset is fairly confined to\na set of template sentences and limited number of conditions. This insight has motivated the use of retrieval\nbased approaches as opposed to a fully generative approach for the chest X-ray report generation task on\nthis dataset [72, 73]. Additionally, the larger 562B model has a tendency towards verbosity rather than the\ncomparative brevity of the 84B model, and without further preference alignment in training, this may impact\nits metrics.\n6.2 Med-PaLM M demonstrates zero-shot generalization to novel medical tasks and\nconcepts\nTraining a generalist biomedical AI system with language as a common grounding across different tasks allows\nthe system to tackle new tasks by combining the knowledge it has learned for other tasks (i.e. combinatorial\n|11\ngeneralization). We highlight preliminary evidence which suggests Med-PaLM M can generalize to novel\nmedical concepts and unseen tasks in a zero-shot fashion. We further observe zero-shot multimodal reasoning\nas an emergent capability [13] of Med-PaLM M. Finally, we demonstrate benefits from positive task transfer\nas a result of the model\u2019s multi-task, multimodal training.\n6.2.1 Evidence of generalization to novel medical concepts\nWe probed the zero-shot generalization capability of Med-PaLM M for an unseen medical concept by evaluating\nits ability to detect tuberculosis (TB) abnormality from chest X-ray images in the Montgomery County (MC)\ndataset. As shown in Table 4, Med-PaLM M performed competitively compared to SOTA results obtained\nby a specialized ensemble model optimized for this dataset [74]. We observed similar performance across\nthree model variants, consistent with findings on other medical image classification tasks in MultiMedBench.\nGiven the classification task was set up as an open-ended question answering task, we did not report the AUC\nmetric which requires the normalized predicted probability of each possible class.\nTable 4 | Zero-shot classification performance of Med-PaLM M on the tuberculosis (TB) detection task. Med-PaLM\nM performs competitively to the SOTA model [74] finetuned on the Montgomery County TB dataset using model ensemble.\nNotably, Med-PaLM M achieves this result with a simple task prompt consisting of a single text-only exemplar (without\ntask-specific image and hence zero-shot), in contrast to the specialist model that requires training on all the samples in the\ndataset.\nModel\n# Training samples\nAccuracy\nSOTA [74]\n138\n92.60%\nMed-PaLM M (12B)\n0\n86.96%\nMed-PaLM M (84B)\n0\n82.60%\nMed-PaLM M (562B)\n0\n87.68%\n6.2.2 Evidence of emergent zero-shot multimodal medical reasoning\nWe also qualitatively explored the zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) capability of Med-PaLM M on the MC\nTB dataset. In contrast to the classification setup, we prompted the model with a text-only exemplar to\ngenerate a report describing the findings in a given image in addition to a yes/no classification prediction.\nIn Figure 3, we present qualitative examples of zero-shot CoT reasoning from the Med-PaLM M 84B and\n562B variants. In particular, both Med-PaLM M variants were able to identify the major TB related lesion\nin the correct location. However, according to expert radiologist review, there are still some omissions of\nfindings and errors in the model generated report, suggesting room for improvement. It is noteworthy that\nMed-PaLM M 12B failed to generate a coherent visually conditioned response, which indicates that scaling of\nthe language model plays a key role in the zero-shot CoT multimodal reasoning capability (i.e. this might be\nan emergent capability [13]).\n6.2.3 Evidence of generalization to novel tasks\nAlthough Med-PaLM M was only trained with single-view chest X-ray image inputs, we observed the capability\nof the model to generalize to a novel task setup with multi-view visual inputs. Specifically, on a subset of\nstudies from MIMIC-CXR where each report is accompanied with both a frontal and a lateral view X-ray\nimage. we observe that Med-PaLM M is able to attain zero-shot performance comparable to the single-view\nreport generation task as detailed in Table 5. This ability is promising given medical imaging studies often\nbenefit from the interpretation of prior historical studies in addition to the current instance for optimal\nperformance.\n6.2.4 Evidence of positive task transfer\nTo demonstrate the positive task transfer arising from joint training across modalities and tasks, we performed\nan ablation study where we trained a Med-PaLM M 84B variant by excluding the MIMIC-CXR classification\ntask from the task mixture and compared this model variant against Med-PaLM M 84B trained on the full\nMultiMedBench mixture. As seen in Table 6, we observed that the model trained jointly on both report\n|12\nInstructions: You are a helpful radiology assistant.

Large Med-PaLM\nM models exhibit zero-shot CoT reasoning capability in identifying and describing tuberculosis related findings in chest X-ray\nimages. The model is prompted with task-specific instructions and a text-only exemplar (without the corresponding image) to\ngenerate a report describing findings in the given X-ray image. Model predictions from Med-PaLM M 84B and 562B are shown\ntogether with the annotations from an expert radiologist. Both models correctly localized the major TB related cavitory lesion in\nthe right upper lobe. However, both models did not address the small cavitory lesion in left upper lobe (Med-PaLM M 562B was\nconsidered better than Med-PaLM M 64B in this example as it also alluded to the opacity in the right middle lobe and did\nnot make the incorrect statement of left lung being clear). Notably, Med-PaLM M 12B failed to generate a coherent report,\nindicating the importance of scaling for zero-shot COT reasoning.\ngeneration and classification has higher performance across the board on all report generation metrics. We\nalso observe that the model trained only on chest X-ray report generation can generalize to abnormality\ndetection in a zero-shot fashion with compelling performance, as evidenced by a higher macro-F1 score. This\nis another example of generalization to a novel task setting where the model learns to differentiate between\ntypes of abnormalities from training on the more complex report generation task.\n6.3 Med-PaLM M performs encouragingly on radiology report generation across model\nscales\nTo further understand the clinical applicability of Med-PaLM M, we conducted radiologist evaluations of\nmodel-generated chest X-ray reports (and reference human baselines). Under this evaluation framework, we\nobserve encouraging quality of Med-PaLM M generated reports across model scales as detailed below.\n6.3.1 Side-by-side evaluation\nIn a side-by-side evaluation, four clinician raters ranked the quality of four radiology reports, comparing\nthe radiologist-provided reference report from the MIMIC-CXR dataset with reports generated by different\nMed-PaLM M model scales (12B, 84B, and 562B).\nFigure 4a summarizes how often each rater ranked a report generated by one of the three Med-PaLM M\nvariants or the reference report as the best among four candidate reports. Averaged over all four raters, the\nradiologist-provided reference report was ranked best in 37.14% of cases, followed by Med-PaLM M (84B)\n|13\nTable 5 | Zero-shot generalization to two-view chest X-ray report generation.

Averaged over all four raters, Med-PaLM M 84B was preferred\nover the reference report in 40.50% of cases, followed by the other two model scales, 12B and 562B, which\nwere preferred over the reference report in 34.05% and 32.00% of cases, respectively.\n6.3.2 Independent evaluation\nWe report the rates of omissions and errors radiologists identified in findings paragraphs generated by Med-\nPaLM M.

For omissions, we observed the lowest rate of 0.12 (95% CI, 0.10 - 0.15) omissions per\nreport on average for both the Med-PaLM M 12B and 84B models, followed by 0.13 (95% CI, 0.11 - 0.16) for\nthe 562B model.\nIn contrast, we measured the lowest mean error rate of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.22 - 0.28) for Med-PaLM M 84B,\nfollowed by 0.28 (95% CI, 0.24 - 0.31) for Med-PaLM M 12B and 0.29 (95% CI, 0.25 - 0.32) for the 562B model.\nNotably, this error rate is comparable to those reported for human radiologists baselines on the MIMIC-CXR\n|14\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\n15.0%\n25.7%\n13.6%\n16.0%\n31.7%\n15.7%\n25.8%\n30.0%\n20.0%\n25.7%\n24.2%\n8.0%\n33.3%\n32.9%\n36.4%\n46.0%\n562B\n84B\n12B\nReference Report\n(a) Best-ranked report in four-way comparison\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\n31.0%\n43.9%\n27.3%\n25.8%\n69.0%\n56.1%\n72.7%\n74.2%\n48.7%\n32.4%\n41.5%\n39.5%\n51.3%\n67.6%\n58.5%\n60.5%\n37.5%\n43.9%\n40.0%\n14.8%\n62.5%\n56.1%\n60.0%\n85.2%\n562B        \n84B       \n12B       \nReference Report\n(b) Pairwise preference of each model scale compared to reference\nreport\nFigure 4 | Side-by-side human evaluation.

We present a\nqualitative example of chest X-ray reports generated by Med-PaLM M across model scales along with the target reference report.\nIn this example, a panel of radiologists adjudicated the Med-PaLM M 12B report to have two clinically significant errors and one\nomission, the Med-PaLM M 84B report to have zero errors and zero omissions, and the Med-PaLM M 562B report to have one\nclinically insignificant error and no omissions.\n7 Discussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, Med-PaLM M is the first demonstration of a generalist biomedical AI system\nthat can interpret a wide range of medical modalities, perform competently (including near or exceeding prior\nSOTA) on a diverse array of tasks, and generalize to unseen biomedical concepts and tasks. This potentially\nopens up new possibilities in applications spanning scientific discovery to care delivery. We elaborate on the\nimplications of this development as well as the challenges and limitations below.\nLack of benchmarks a key bottleneck for the development of generalist biomedical AI AI progress\nto date has largely been catalyzed by the development of high quality benchmarks. While there exists several\nsingle-task biomedical AI datasets, there have been limited attempts to unify them and create benchmarks\nfor the development of generalist biomedical AI systems. Our curation of MultiMedBench is a step towards\naddressing this unmet need. However, the benchmark has several important limitations including limited size\nof the individual datasets (a cumulative size of \u02dc1 million samples) and limited modality and task diversity\n(e.g., lacking life sciences such as transcriptomics and proteomics). Another key barrier to developing models\nfor use across an even wider variety of biomedical data types is the lack of large scale multimodal datasets,\nwhich would permit joint learning and alignment of the modality-specific encoders with the decoder.\nImportance of medical finetuning and specialization PaLM-E is a highly capable generalist AI model\nas evidenced by its SOTA performance on a wide range of vision-language and embodied robotics tasks. Yet,\nits out-of-the-box performance on MultiMedBench was poor and Med-PaLM M outperforms it by a wide\nmargin across model scales. This result suggests that finetuning with domain-specific biomedical data is\ncritical to achieving good performance on biomedical tasks, perhaps due to the distribution shift presented by\nthe domain overall compared to the plethora of non-medical tasks and modalities.\nScaling multimodal AI models is challenging In the language domain, scaling the model has led to\nleapfrog improvements in performance and emergent capabilities. However, our preliminary experiments\nsuggest this is likely more challenging for multimodal generalist models in the biomedical task domain due to\nthe medical data scarcity. Given the wide array of modalities and tasks such generalist models are expected\nto understand and tackle, it is crucial that the encoders for such diverse modalities are scaled jointly with the\n|16\nlanguage model. Otherwise, for tasks that require interpretation of data from a combination of modalities, the\nperformance will end up being bottlenecked by the weakest encoder. We see evidence of this in medical image\nclassification tasks such as mammography and dermatology where scaling the language model component has\nlittle effect on the task performance as the potential key bottleneck is the vision encoder. It is possible that\nthe small volume of medical data in MultiMedBench is not be sufficient to effectively adapt a ViT pretrained\non natural images to the medical domain, thereby limiting the benefits of model scaling. As such, our study\nonly provides some initial insights on the effect of model scaling on biomedical task performance. Future\nresearch is needed to fully understand the effect of model scaling by teasing apart the scaling effect of the\nlanguage model from that of modality-specific encoders, with sufficient amounts of biomedical data.\nTechnical considerations for generalist biomedical AI Med-PaLM M builds on state-of-the-art vision\nand language components such as ViT and PaLM. Yet, putting them together requires careful considerations\naround token lengths allocated to visual encoder outputs, total context length of the model, sampling strategies,\ntraining data mixtures and so forth. Further, simple, yet important techniques such as the use of one-shot\ntraining with dummy image tokens make an important difference in the quality and compute efficiency of the\nfinal model. With increasing generality of the AI system, the number of details requiring careful consideration\ntends to increase as well. We also note that Med-PaLM M architecture as setup currently is not optimal for\nfew-shot in-context learning.\nProgress in AI for radiology report generation Our evaluation by radiologists of Med-PaLM M generated\nradiology reports suggests encouraging performance of the model on a challenging multimodal task. In up\nto 40.50% of the cases, a Med-PaLM M generated report was preferred over the human-generated reference\nreport. Further, the average number of clinically significant errors within the model responses is comparable\nto those reported for human-generated reports in prior studies [14] on the same dataset. These promising\nresults underpin rapid development in the task of automatic radiology report generation and suggest the\npotential for clinical utility in the future.\nGeneralist agents are not the only approach to multimodal biomedical AI While generalist\nbiomedical AI systems offer exciting possibilities [43], there are other approaches to developing multimodal\nbiomedical AI systems that might be more applicable depending on data availability, pretrained models,\ncompute and application scenarios. These include leveraging frozen encoders with adapter layers [75] to glue\ntogether a multimodal biomedical AI system or developing LLMs that can interface with specialist biomedical\nencoders or task-specific agents through tool use [76].\nConsiderations for real-world applications of generalist biomedical AI While the development of\ngenerally capable biomedical AI systems is exciting, for such systems to be useful in practice or opening the\ndoor to new applications, they need to match or exceed specialized, single-task models or otherwise reach\nclinically applicable levels of performance. While beyond the scope of this work, the progress here necessitates\ncareful considerations of safety and equity in the development and validation of such systems.\n8 Perspective on Generalist Biomedical AI\nReaching near or above SOTA on a diverse range of biomedical tasks with a single set of model weights is a\nnoteworthy milestone for the development of generalist biomedical AI systems. While human clinicians can\ntrain for \u201cgeneral practice\u201d [77], helpful subspecialty-specific expertise is often found in different experts [78],\nto whom non-specialist clinicians may refer for specialist opinions in the course of care. It is also commonplace\nfor multiple physician specialities to work together in care delivery. We envisage a similar future for biomedical\nAI where generalist and specialist AI systems interact and collaborate together with expert clinicians and\nresearchers in a tight feedback loop to tackle grand challenges in biomedicine.\nOur finding, of a single generalist biomedical AI that reaches compelling performance across disparate tasks\nand contexts, hints at new frontiers for impact in applications. This includes the potential for near zero-shot\ninsight in new domains, as a tool for discovery integrating insights from distinct areas of biomedicine, and as\na common point of assistance providing access to expertise from many different fields.\n|17\n9 Conclusion\nMedicine is a multidisciplinary endeavour. Generalist biomedical AI systems that effectively assimilate and\nencode multimodal medical data at scale and rapidly adapt to new clinical contexts are likely to be the\nfoundation of next generation learning health systems and make healthcare more accessible, efficient, equitable\nand humane. While further development and rigorous validation is needed, we believe Med-PaLM M represents\nan important step towards the development of such generalist biomedical AI.\nAcknowledgments\nThis project was an extensive collaboration between many teams at Google Research and Google DeepMind.\nWe thank Andrew Sellergren, Yuan Liu, Michael Howell, Julie Wang, Sho Kannan, Christine Kingsley, Roy\nLee, Naama Hammel, Jay Hartford, Preeti Singh, Kavita Kulkarni, Gavriel Goidel, Anil Palepu, Si Wai Man,\nAmy Wang, Sami Lachgar, Lauren Winer, Maggie Shiels, Annisah Um\u2019rani, John Guilyard, Shravya Shetty\nand Evan Rapoport for their valuable insights and feedback during our research.

Figure A.1 summarizes MultiMedBench over its various\nbiomedical tasks.\nA.1.1 Language-only datasets\nMultiMedQA We used three of the multiple-choice medical question-answering datasets from Multi-\nMedQA [9]: the MedQA [79], MedMCQA [80], and PubMedQA [81] datasets for training and evaluation of\nMed-PaLM M. These question answering tasks are language-only and do not require the interpretation of\nadditional modalities. The training set consists of 10,178 questions from MedQA and 182,822 questions from\nMedMCQA. The test set comprises 1,273 questions from MedQA, 4,183 questions from MedMCQA, and 500\nquestions from PubMedQA. Note that PubMedQA was not included in the training data mixture and only\nused for evaluation.\nMIMIC-III is a large publicly-available medical database that contains medical records of patients admitted\nto intensive care units [82]. It contains 79,790 radiology reports across two imaging modalities (CT and MRI)\nand seven anatomic regions (head, abdomen, chest, head, neck, sinus, spine, pelvis). A total of 78,875 reports\nwere chosen based on criteria such as the length of the report. We used the radiology report summarization\ndataset from [62], which comprises six most common modality/anatomy pairs for training and evaluation: CT\nhead, CT abdomen, CT chest, MRI head, CT spine, and CT neck. To evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)\nperformance we used five less common modality/anatomy pairs: MRI spine, CT sinus, MRI abdomen, MRI\npelvis, and MRI neck. This resulted in a total of 58,405 reports for training, 7,413 reports for validation,\nand 13,057 reports for testing. Note that chest X-ray reports are excluded from this dataset to avoid data\ncontamination with the MIMIC-CXR dataset for the report generation task. For each report, we used the same\npreprocessing functions as in [83, 84] to extract the findings and impression sections. Specifically, we filtered\nout the reports whose findings section are longer than 600 tokens. We performed a report summarization task\nby predicting the impression section given the findings section as input, which is another language-only task\nthat does not require multi-modal input.\nA.1.2 Multimodal datasets\nPAD-UFES-20 consists of 2,298 clinical images of skin lesions collected from different smartphone devices\nwith varying resolutions, sizes, and lighting conditions [85]. The data was collected through the Dermatological\nand Surgical Assistance Program at the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo (UFES-Brazil), a nonprofit\n|23\nMedQA\nMedMCQA\nPubMedQA\nMIMIC-III\nVQA-RAD\nSlake-VQA\nPath-VQA\nMIMIC-CXR\nReport\nPAD-UFES-20\nVinDr-Mammo\nCBIS-DDSM\nGenomics\nPrecisionFDA\nMIMIC-CXR\n11451\n187005\n500\n78875\n3515\n14028\n32799\n78875\n2298\n20000\n2620\n210068\n361242\n Medical QA\n \nReport\nSummarization\nMedical VQA\nReport\nGeneration\nMedical Image\nClassification\nMultiMedBench\nFigure A.1 | MultiMedBench overview. MultiMedBench is a benchmark that covers 14 different biomedical tasks, including\nquestion answering, visual question answering, image classification, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic\nvariant calling. MultiMedBench comprises more than 1 million data samples from a diverse range of medical images, radiology\nreports, medical question answers, and visual question answering pairs.\nprogram that provides free skin lesion treatment. The dataset contains six different types of skin lesions\nincluding: Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Malignant Melanoma (MEL), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC),\nActinic Keratosis (ACK), Melanocytic Nevus (NEV), and Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK). Each image is associated\nwith up to 21 patient clinical features such as patient demographics, family cancer history lesion location,\nlesion size. We set up a 6-class classification task in a generative framework through a language decoder\nusing skin lesion images and the associated clinical textual features as the multimodal input. Specifically, we\nselected 14 clinical attributes in the metadata for each lesion including: age, gender, smoke, drink, skin cancer\nhistory, cancer history, region, fitspatrick, horizontal and vertical diameters, itch, grew, bleed, and elevation.\nThe class ratio is approximately 16:1:4:14:5:4 over three skin cancers (BCC, MEL, and SCC) and three skin\ndisease (ACK, NEV, and SEK). Since there are no published official train/test splits, we randomly split the\ndataset into a training set (80%) and a test test (20%) using a stratified sampling to the preserve original\nclass ratio. We applied a series of image augmentation operations using RandAugment [86] to the training set\nincluding: autoContrast, equalize, invert, rotate, posterize, solarize, color, and contrast.\nVinDr-Mammo is a full-field digital mammography dataset which consists of 5000 breast X-ray imaging\nstudies and a total of 20,000 gray-scale images with extensive breast-level assessment and lesion-level\nannotations, collected from two hospitals in in Hanoi, Vietnam [87]. Each study contains four images where\nthe left and right breasts are imaged with mediolateral-oblique (MLO) and cranio-caudal (CC) views. Each\nimage has breast-level assessment following the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).\nBI-RADS assessment ranges from 1 (negative) to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy). In addition to the\nBI-RADS score, the breast density level is also provided as well as regional abnormality finding annotations.\nWe performed a breast-level 5-class BI-RADS classification task similar to the setup in [49], except that\n|24\nthe laterality and view position of the image was provided as additional contextual features. We used the\nofficial train/test splits where the train split contains 16,000 samples with a class ratio of 60:21:4:3:1 across\nBI-RADS 1-5, respectively and the test split contains 4,000 samples with the same class ratio. We applied\nthe following transformations to the images in the training set: contrast, equalize, rotate, shearX, shearY,\ntranslateX, and translateY. To mitigate the class imbalance in the training data, we upsampled for each\nminority class (BI-RADS 2-5) by a factor of 3.\nCBIS-DDSM is the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography [88].\nThis dataset contains 2,620 scanned film mammography studies. Unlike VinDr-Mammo, CBIS-DDSM does\nnot have breast-level BI-RADS assessment. Annotations are provided at the lesion level including BI-RADS,\nsubtlety level, and pathology type. There are two types of lesions: mass and calcification. Both of them\nare annotated with three possible pathology labels: benign, benign without callback, and malignant. We\nperformed a 3-class abnormality (patch-level) pathology classification task on this dataset for mass and\ncalcification abnormalities separately. Abnormality image patch is cropped by the bounding box of the\nregion-of-interest (ROI) from the full mammogram and used as the model input along with its view position\n(CC or MLO) information. We used the official train/test splits for both abnormality types. For mass cases,\nthe training and test sets contain 1,318 and 378 images (class ratio: 6:1:6), respectively. For calcification cases,\nthe total number of images in the training and test sets are 1,544 and 326 (class ratio: 1:1:1), respectively.\nFor both cases, we applied the same image augmentation as in VinDr-Mammo to the training set.\nPrecisionFDA Truth Challenge V2 was developed for benchmarking the state-of-the-art of variant calling\nin challenging genomics regions [89]. Genomic variant calling is a task aiming at identifying genetic variants\nfrom sequencing data [90], which can identify disease-causing mutations [91]. For variant calling, sequencing\ndata is mapped to the coordinates of a reference genome [92]. The mappings can be represented as an image-like\nformat that computational methods such as DeepVariant [71] use to call variants, or in a human-friendly\nimage format which experts use to inspect and quality control variants of interest [93]. For this task, we\nused an extensively characterized groundtruth set from the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) [94] for the HG002 sample. We generated examples from sequencing from the PrecisionFDA Truth\nChallenge V2. For training, we use 4% of the examples from the whole genome (except for chromosome 20, 21,\nand 22). For evaluation, we used chromosome20, bases 3000001-9444417. This generated 197,038 candidate\nvariants for training and 13,030 candidate variants for evaluation. For each example, the model predicts three\npossible genotypes, corresponding to how many copies (0, 1, or 2) of the given alternate allele are present.\nThe training set consists of 45,011, 93,246, and 58,781 samples for classes 0, 1, 2, respectively. The evaluation\nset contains 3,016, 6,169, and 3,845 for classes 0, 1, 2, respectively.\nWe used DeepVariant v1.3.0\u2019s [71] example generation method to create image-like examples suitable for\nmachine classification. Specifically, input examples to DeepVariant v1.3.0 have a shape of (100, 221, 6)\ncorresponding to (height, width, channels). Channels are shown in grey-scale below in the following order:\n1. Read base: different intensities represent A, C, G, and T.\n2. Base quality: set by the sequencing machine. White is higher quality.\n3. Mapping quality: set by the aligner. White is higher quality.\n4. Strand of alignment: Black is forward; white is reverse.\n5. Read supports variant: White means the read supports the given alternate allele, grey means it does\nnot.\n6. Base differs from ref: White means the base is different from the reference, dark grey means the base\nmatches the reference.\nTo reshape the input example to be compatible with the Med-PaLM M input shape of (224, 224, 3), we\nstacked up channels 1, 2, 3 with channels 4, 5, 6 such that the original tensor of shape (100, 221, 6) became\nan RGB image of shape (200, 221, 3). We then padded the image on the width and height dimensions to give\nit a final shape of (224, 224, 3).\nVQA-RAD is a radiology visual question answering (VQA) dataset which consists of 315 radiology images\nand 3,515 question\u2013answer pairs created and validated by clinicians [95]. The radiology images are selected\nfrom three imaging modalities (CT, MRI, and X-rays) and three anatomical regions (head, abdominal, chest).\n|25\nThe types of question fall into 11 categories including modality, plane, organ system, abnormality, size,\nplane, positional reasoning, color, counting, attribute and other. 58% of the question\u2013answer (QA) pairs\nare closed-ended (yes/no or limited choices) and the rest 42% are open-ended (short answer). We adopted\nthe official train/test splits, where the training set contains 1,797 QA pairs (only free-form and paraphrased\nquestions were included) and the test set contains 451 QA pairs (not filtered).\nPath-VQA is a pathology VQA dataset, containing a total of 4,998 pathology images with 32,799 question-\nanswer pairs [96].\nPathology images are extracted from medical textbooks and online digital libraries.\nEach image is associated with multiple QA pairs pertaining to different aspects of the pathology including\ncolor, location, appearance, shape, etc. Open-ended questions account for 50.2% of all questions, which are\ncategorized into 7 categories: what, where, when, whose, how, and how much/how many, accounting for 50.2%\nof all questions. The rest are close-ended questions with simple \"yes/no\" answer. We adopted the official\ndata partitioning where the training, validation, and test sets contain 19,755, 6,279, and 6,761 QA pairs,\nrespectively.\nSlake-VQA is a semantically annotated and knowledge-enhanced bilingual (English and Chinese) VQA\ndataset on radiology images [12]. It contains 642 annotated images with 14,028 question-answer pairs covering\n12 diseases, 39 organ systems and 3 imaging modalities (CT, MRI, and chest X-rays). Questions are either\nopen-ended (free-form) or closed-ended (balanced yes/no) related to various aspects of the image content\nincluding plane, quality, position, organ, abnormality, size, color, shape, knowledge graph, etc. The training,\nvalidation, and test sets contain 9,849, 2,109, and 2,070 samples, respectively.\nMIMIC-CXR is a large dataset of chest radiographs with free-text radiology reports [97]. A total of 377,110\nimages are available in the dataset from 227,835 image studies collected for 65,379 patients. Each patient may\nhave multiple studies and each study may contain one or more images associated with the same free-text report.\nImages in MIMIC-CXR are collected from multiple view positions: e.g., anterior-posterior (AP), posterior-\nanterior, and lateral (LA). Protected health information (PHI) in radiology reports and images is removed,\nwhich results in missing information in some sentences of the reports. Since this dataset contains sequential\nimaging studies of an individual patient, a large number of reports refer to information in prior studies of\nthe same patient. Each report is annotated with structured labels of 14 common radiological observations\nusing CheXpert labeler [98]. We performed two tasks using this dataset: chest X-ray report generation and\nbinary classification of clinically-relevant pathology observations. We preprocessed the radiology reports by\nextracting the indication, findings, and impression sections, removing redundant white-spaces in the reports,\nfollowing previous work [99]. We used the official train/validation/test splits. We discarded images without\nreports and reports where the findings section can not be extracted across train and test. We also filtered out\nthe reports where the length of findings section exceeds 800 characters. However, unlike most previous work\nusing focusing only on the frontal view, we treated images of different orientation that are associated with the\nsame report as independent samples (retaining the patient-level train/test splits to avoid contamination of\nthe test data). The goal is to improve the image understanding capability of the model to process images\nof different view positions. In a separate evaluation, we also studied a subset of samples where reports are\naccompanied by both a front and lateral view (two-view report generation).\nFor the report generation task, we combined the chest X-ray image with the contextual information from the\nindication section (reason for the study) to predict the findings section of the target report. The total number\nof samples in the training, validation, and test sets are: 353,542, 2,866, and 4,834, respectively.\nFor the binary classification task, we grouped negative and uncertain labels as the negative class for 11\npathological conditions: no finding, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, lung\nopacity, enlarged cardiomediastinum, fracture, pneumonia, and support devices. Atelectasis, cardiomegaly,\nconsolidation, edema, and pleural effusion are 5 major conditions given their clinical relevance and prevalence.\nThe \"No finding\" label captures the cases without any pathology and therefore this classification task simply\nhelps the model to distinguish normal cases from cases with any type of abnormality. Due to class imbalance,\nduring training we upsampled the positive class by a factor of 2 for the following conditions: consolidation,\nenlarged cardiomediastinum, fracture, and pneumonia. These binary classification tasks are auxiliary to the\nreport generation task when they are trained simultaneously since they help the model to distinguish among\ndifferent types of clinical observations in the chest X-ray images.\n|26\nMedQA\nMedMCQA\nMIMIC-III\nVQA-RAD\nSlake-VQA\nPath-VQA\nMIMIC-CXR Report\nPAD-UFES-20\nVinDr-Mammo\nCBIS-DDSM\nMIMIC-CXR\nGenomics\nPrecisionFDA\n3.1%\n6.2%\n3.1%\n0.1%\n2.6%\n1.9%\n59.9%\n6.2%\n1.6%\n1.6%\n12.0%\n1.6%\nMedical QA\nReport Summarization\nMedical Visual QA\nReport Generation\nImage Classfication\nFigure A.2 | Med-PaLM M data mixture overview.

While the majority of vision-language tasks were trained with a text-only 1-shot setup\n(without the corresponding image), the CBIS-DDSM classification and genomic variant calling tasks were\ntrained with a 0-shot setup.\nA.2.2 Training hyperparameters\nPaLM-E projects the multimodal inputs into the same language embedding space as latent vectors such that\ncontinuous observations (e.g., images, time series) can be processed the same way by a pre-trained LLM as the\nlanguage tokens, and thereby generates textual completions autoregressively given a multimodal prompt. In\nour experiments, the ViT maps the visual input to a fixed number of 256 tokens which are further processed\nby the LLM along with the additional text/multimodal tokens [10]. Med-PaLM M was finetuned on the\npretrained PaLM-E checkpoints. Table A.2 shows the training hyperparameters for Med-PaLM M 12B, 84B,\nand 562B, respectively.\nA.3 Detailed Med-PaLM M Performance\nPerformance on text-only medical question answering We report the few-shot performance of Med-\nPaLM M on MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA in Table A.3. SOTA results were chosen from Med-PaLM\n2 with ensemble refinement prompting and PaLM 540B few-shot results reported in [9, 61]. Med-PaLM M\noutperformed the baseline PaLM model (from which it inherits) by a large margin on all three datasets, despite\nfalling behind the Med-PaLM 2 best results obtained with ensemble refinement. Scaling up the language\nmodel from 8B to 540B significantly improves the accuracy on the multiple-choice medical question answering\n|27\nTable A.1 | Med-PaLM M data mixture.

[62] in Table A.4. Med-PaLM M (562B) yielded the best overall performance compared to the smaller\nmodel variants, consistent with our observations on medical question answering tasks. Med-PaLM M performed\nworse than the SOTA results which were obtained with a parameter-efficient finetuning method (low-rank\nadaptation, LoRA [103]) on a 738M-parameter clinical-T5 model [104]. However, as noted in [62], one caveat\nof clinical-T5 is that it is unclear if Lehman & Johnson [104] pretrained the model on the test set of MIMIC-III\nwhich led to potential data leakage. Notably, Med-PaLM M compared favorably to the results in Van Veen\net al. [62] based on the T5 model which was not pretrained on clinical text, similar to the PaLM model.\n|28\nTable A.4 | Med-PaLM M performance on MIMIC-III radiology report summarization.\nDataset\nMetric\nSOTA\nMed-PaLM M (12B)\nMed-PaLM M (84B)\nMed-PaLM M (562B)\nMIMIC-III\nROUGE-L\n38.70%\n29.45%\n31.47%\n32.03%\nBLEU\n16.20%\n12.14%\n15.36%\n15.21%\nF1-RadGraph\n40.80%\n31.43%\n33.96%\n34.71%\nPerformance on medical image classification tasks Table A.5 shows the performance of Med-PaLM\nM on a set of classification tasks across multiple modalities including dermatology, radiology, and genomics.\nSince these tasks all have imbalanced class distributions, we reported macro-AUC (unweighted mean of\nall the per-class AUC scores) and macro-F1 scores (unweighted mean of all the per-class F1 scores) as the\nclassification metrics except for the genomic variant calling task where the F1 scores for single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) in the context of variant discovery were\nused instead.\nOn VinDr-Mammo, all size variants of Med-PaLM M exceeded the prior SOTA using a smaller ViT (9.7M)\non macro-AUC [49]. On CBIS-DDSM, our model achieved the best macro-F1 of 51.12% and 67.86% on\nthe mass and calcification classification, respectively, behind the SOTA F1 of 70.71% reported on the\ncalcification classification [70]. Note that most previous works on CBIS-DDSM focused on a two-class patch-\nlevel classification (benign versus malignant) problem in contrast to our 3-class setup as discussed in [105]. On\nPad-UFES-20, since no official train/test splits are available, our results are not directly comparable with prior\nstudies. Med-PaLM M 84B achieved a macro-AUC of 97.27%, on par with previous reported results (94% -\n98%) obtained using CNN and ViT variants [106, 107]. On MIMIC-CXR, we reported the macro-average of F1\nscores across the binary classification of 5 major conditions: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema,\nand pleural effusion. Med-PaLM M (562B) achieved a macro-AUC of 79.09%, slightly lower than the SOTA\nresult of 81.27% obtained from ParallelXNet [69], which used a parallelization of various CNN Architectures.\nOn the variant calling task, DeepVariant model [71] outperformed Med-PaLM M on both Indel-F1 and SNP-F1\nscores. The SOTA DeepVariant model was trained with 2,633-fold more training examples. Training with\nthe same examples resulted in a narrower advantage for DeepVariant for SNP (Med-PaLM M 99.35% versus\nDeepVariant 99.63%) and Indel (Med-PaLM M 97.04% versus DeepVariant 98.55%. Notably, Med-PaLM M\noutperformed the accuracy of the widely used GATK4 method [90] for SNP calling (Med-PaLM M 99.35%\nversus GATK4 99.29%) but not Indel calling (Med-PaLM M 97.04% versus GATK4 99.32%).\nTaken together, Med-PaLM M achieved competitive results on a variety of classification tasks using a single\nmodel compared to highly specialized SOTA models.\nIt is worth noting that we did not perform any\nfine-grained task-specific customization and hyperparameter tuning beyond data augmentation and class\nbalancing. It is expected that scaling up the language model does not significantly benefit the classification\ntasks where the vision encoder is likely the bottleneck for the model performance. There is no overall evidence\nto suggest that larger vision model outperforms the small one across all our experiments, suggesting that\nmore domain-specific pretraining may be more important for improving vision encoder performance. It is also\nlikely that relatively small-scale datasets we explored here are not sufficient to establish such a robust scaling\nrelationship between the model size and task performance, as results were generally close to each other across\nmodel scales.\nPerformance on medical visual question answering Since we formulated both close-end and open-end\nQA pairs in three VQA datasets as an open-ended language decoding task conditioned on visual input, we\nused BLEU-1 and token-level F1 scores to assess the performance of Med-PaLM M. This is in contrast with\nmany prior works which used a string-level accuracy evaluation metric as they often considered VQA as a\nclassification task on a set of pre-defined fixed-number answer candidates [108, 109]. This accuracy metric\nhas the weakness of failing to capture \"near misses\" of groundtruth answers, particularly in our open-ended\ngenerative setup. We also noted that only human validation by experts can provide additional insights on\nthe quality of model answers beyond token-level or string-level matching metrics. As shown in Table A.6,\nMed-PaLM M surpassed previous SOTA using a similar generative approach across all three datasets and\nmetrics [63, 64]. In particular, model performance increased with scaling up the language model on VQA-RAD\n|29\nTable A.5 | Med-PaLM M performance on medical image classification.

F1-RadGraph\ngeneralizes over CheXbert labeller to more observation categories by measuring the overlapping clinical entities\nand relations between a generated report and the reference report [60]. In line with previous studies [14,\n65\u201368, 99, 112], we reported the macro-F1 and micro-F1 scores averaged over 5 major observations and all\n14 observations for CE metrics, respectively. As shown in Table A.7, Med-PaLM M achieved a new SOTA\non all CE metrics and F1-RadGraph, with a substantial increase of about 9 points on macro-F1-14 and\nmicro-F1-14 averaged across all clinical relevant observations over previous best SOTA results in [14, 65]. The\nmacro-average F1 resulted in a lower score than the micro-average F1 over 14 observation categories because\nof the worse model performance on some categories with very low representation in the training data. Notably,\nimprovements on F1 scores were more prominent across all 14 categories than over the 5 major categories\nfor Med-PaLM M. This is likely due to the benefit of jointly training with the classification tasks on those\n|30\nminority conditions. We consider such positive task transfer as one of the main advantages of a generalist\nmulti-task model over a specialized single-task model. On text overlap based natural language generation\nmetrics, Med-PaLM M did not outperform existing SOTA results. However, the pitfalls of these automatic\nmetrics have been raised by many studies, particularly in that they fail to capture the factual correctness and\ndo not align well with radiologist judgements [60, 66, 68, 112].\nInterestingly, our largest model Med-PaLM M (562B) did not achieve the best performance, falling slightly\nshort of Med-PaLM M (84B). Furthermore, the gap in performance across three model sizes is relatively\nsmall across all types of metrics. The diminishing return of increasing the size of the language model is likely\nbecause the output space for chest X-ray report generation is fairly confined to a set of template sentences\nand limited number of conditions. It is also possible that the task performance is primarily limited by the\nvision encoder, particularly in how well it is adapted for this domain. As noted by Xu et al. [113], ViT lacks\ninductive bias for modeling local visual features which are often crucial for interpreting medical images. To\novercome this limitation, large-scale medical training data may be required to enable benefit from size scaling.\nAdditionally, the input image size 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 we used cause loss in resolution, which is a tradeoff we made\nto shorten the length of embedded image tokens to fit within the context length limit of the language model.\nTable A.7 | Med-PaLM M performance on chest X-ray report generation. We use text-overlap based and clinical\nfactuality based automatic metrics to evaluate the quality of model-generated reports. Med-PaLM M sets new SOTA on all\nmetrics designed to capture clinical efficacy and correctness. Across three Med-PaLM M variants, the medium-sized model\nachieves the best performance.\nMetric\nSOTA\nMed-PaLM M (12B)\nMed-PaLM M (84B)\nMed-PaLM M (562B)\nMicro-F1-14\n44.20%\n51.41%\n53.56%\n51.60%\nMacro-F1-14\n30.70%\n37.31%\n39.83%\n37.81%\nMicro-F1-5\n56.70%\n56.54%\n57.88%\n56.28%\nMacro-F1-5\nN/A\n50.57%\n51.60%\n49.86%\nF1-RadGraph\n24.40%\n25.20%\n26.71%\n26.06%\nBLEU-1\n39.48%\n30.90%\n32.31%\n31.73%\nBLEU-4\n13.30%\n10.43%\n11.31%\n11.50%\nROUGE-L\n29.60%\n26.16%\n27.29%\n27.49%\nCIDEr-D\n49.50%\n23.43%\n26.17%\n25.27%\nA.4 Details on Human Evaluation\nFigures A.3 and A.4 depict the task interfaces used for side-by-side and independent radiologist evaluations,\nincluding the task input and annotation prompts presented to radiologist raters. For ease of a detailed\ninspection (e.g., identification of subtle structures), the built-in medical image viewer provided tools for raters\nto adjust the chest X-ray image, including zoom, gamma, and blend controls.\nIt is worth noting that a non-trivial number of reports in the MIMIC-CXR dataset contain references to prior\nstudies (e.g., \u201cCompared to the prior radiograph [...]\u201d) or references to multiple views (e.g., \u201cAp and lateral\nviews of the chest are compared.\u201d). By contrast, the input to our model is a single image and indication from\na single study. As a result, these artifacts in the training corpus render the model prone to hallucination\nof references to non-existent prior imaging studies or non-existent X-ray views. Our human evaluation task\ninterface accounted for the presence of these artifacts by providing the option to categorize erroneous passages\nas \u201cRefers to view that is not present\u201d or \u201cRefers to study that is not present\u201d. Future work may leverage the\nCXR-PRO dataset [114], a cleaned version of MIMIC-CXR with all prior references removed, to mitigate this\nissue during model development.\nFor the purpose of analysis, we distinguished between clinical errors (i.e., \u201cFinding I do not agree is present\u201d,\n\u201cIncorrect location of finding\u201d) and non-clinical errors (i.e., \u201cRefers to view that is not present\u201d or \u201cRefers to\nstudy that is not present\u201d). Table A.8 summarizes the rates of omissions and errors identified by clinician\nraters in radiology reports generated by different Med-PaLM M models. Here, we report the rate of total\nerrors, including all clinical and non-clinical error types. On average, the best performing Med-PaLM M\n|31\nFigure A.3 | Side-by-side human evaluation task interface. Radiologist raters ranked four findings paragraphs based\non overall quality, given a chest X-ray and indication. The four findings corresponded to the reference findings, and findings\ngenerated by three Med-PaLM M model variants (12B, 84B, 562B).\nFigure A.4 | Independent human evaluation task interface. Radiologist raters annotated a findings paragraph generated\nby Med-PaLM M (red) for errors and omissions, given a chest X-ray, the indication, and reference findings.\n|32\nmodel produces 0.58 total errors per report.\nOne important limitation of our human evaluation approach is the inter-rater variability. Similar to [60], which\nused a comparable evaluation scheme, we also observed that the same radiology report often was annotated\nwith varying error and omission passages by different radiologist raters. While this is a common phenomenon\nin studies that use subjective ratings from clinicians, future work may aim to further refine rater instructions\nand improve rater calibration to reduce variability.\nTable A.8 | Independent human evaluation details.

ACM, New York, NY, USA,\n10 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nRecently, phenomenal advancements have been made in the field of\ntext-to-image generation [38, 39, 42, 44, 59], mainly due to the sig-\nnificant achievements in large aligned image-text datasets [47],\nvision-language pre-training models [20, 24, 37], and diffusion\nmodels [9, 15, 42]. Inspired by these text-to-image generation re-\nsults, many works have explored text-conditional diffusion mod-\nels in other modalities, e.g., text-to-video [16, 17, 48] and text-to-\n3D [19, 25, 28, 36, 54]. In this work, we focus specifically on the field\nof text-to-3D generation, which aims to create 3D content and can\npotentially be applied to many applications, e.g., gaming, virtual or\naugmented reality, and robotic applications.\nTraining text-to-3D generative models can be challenging since\nit is difficult to attain plentiful text and 3D data pairs compared\nto 2D images. Most recently, DreamFusion [36] first addresses the\nchallenge by using score distillation from a pre-trained 2D text-to-\nimage diffusion model [44] to optimize a Neural Radiance Fields\n(NeRF) [29] to perform text-to-3D synthesis. The following litera-\ntures [28, 54] also use the score distillation paradigm. These meth-\nods provide and verify the solution for text-to-3D content genera-\ntion without requiring 3D supervision. Despite their considerable\npromise, these methods are plagued by a notable issue known as\nthe multi-face problem, or Janus problem, which results in inconsis-\ntencies across views. Besides, another important issue in text-to-3D\ngeneration is the lack of control over the shape of the generated\n3D objects, i.e., these methods may produce objects with arbitrary\nshapes that meet the requirements of the input text by setting dif-\nferent seeds. Latent-NeRF [28] first introduces sketch-shape guided\n3D generation, which uses a predefined mesh as a target to super-\nvise the geometry learning of the NeRF. However, this approach\nis costly and time-consuming, as it requires the predefinition of a\nmesh shape for each 3D generation every time.\nThis has motivated us to explore the possibility of cultivating\nprior knowledge in both 2D and 3D diffusion models to guide both\nthe appearance and geometry learning of text-to-3D generation.\nInspired by the conditional control paradigm in text-to-image dif-\nfusion models, e.g., ControlNet [59] and T2I-Adapter [32], which\nuse extra conditions (e.g., sketch, mask, depth) with text prompts\nto guide the generation process, achieving more controllability and\nspatial consistency of the image. We seek a way to incorporate this\nconditional control mechanism into text-to-3D generation.\nIn this work, we propose a novel and flexible framework, dubbed\nPoints-to-3D, to improve view consistency across views and achieve\nflexible controllability over 3D shapes for text-to-3D generation.\nThe core idea of Points-to-3D is to introduce controllable sparse 3D\npoints to guide the text-to-3D generation in terms of geometry and\nappearance. To achieve this, inspired by Point-E [35], we propose\nto distill the sparse point clouds from pre-trained 3D point cloud\ndiffusion models as the geometry prior. These sparse 3D points are\nconditioned on a single reference image, which can be provided\neither by the user or generated by a text-to-image model. However,\nit is not trivial to leverage the generated sparse point clouds, which\nonly contain 4096 3D points. To overcome this issue, we propose\na point cloud guidance loss to encourage the geometry of a ran-\ndomly initialized NeRF to closely resemble the shape depicted in\nthe reference image.\nIn addition to geometry, we propose to optimize the appearance\nconditioned on text prompt as well as the learned depth map. More\nconcretely, we perform score distillation [28, 36] to the publicly\navailable and more controllable 2D image diffusion models, Con-\ntrolNet [59], in a compact latent space. Our approach, Points-to-3D,\ncan bridge the gap between sparse 3D points and realistic shape-\ncontrollable 3D generation by distilling the knowledge of 2D and\n3D diffusion priors. As depicted in Figure 1, given an imaginative\nreference image, Points-to-3D can generate realistic and shape-\ncontrollable 3D contents that vary with different text prompts.\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We present a novel and flexible text-to-3D generation frame-\nwork, named Points-to-3D, which bridges the gap between\nsparse 3D points and more realistic and shape-controllable\n3D generation by distilling the knowledge from pre-trained\n2D and 3D diffusion models.\n\u2022 To take full advantage of the sparse 3D points, we propose an\nefficient point cloud guidance loss to optimize the geometry\nof NeRF, and learn geometry-consistent appearance via score\ndistillation by using ControlNet conditioned on text and\nlearned depth map.\n\u2022 Experimental results show that Points-to-3D can signifi-\ncantly alleviate inconsistency across views and achieve good\ncontrollability over 3D shapes for text-to-3D generation.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nText-to-Image Generation. Image generation achieves the first\nbreakthrough results when encountering Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) [13, 21], which train a generator to synthesize\nimages that are indistinguishable from real images. Recently, im-\nage generation has achieved another phenomenal progress with\nthe development of diffusion models [49]. With the improvements\nin modeling [9, 15], denoising diffusion models can generate var-\nious high-quality images by iteratively denoising a noised image.\nIn addition to image-driven unconditional generative, diffusion\nmodels can generate text-conditioned images from text descrip-\ntions [38, 44]. The following works propose to add more conditions\nto text-to-image generation, including semantic segmentation [42],\nreference images [43], sketch [53], depth map [32, 59], and other\nconditions [18, 32, 59], which greatly promote the development and\napplication of text-to-image generation. Driven by the success of\ntext-to-image diffusion models, many works have explored text-\nconditional diffusion models in other modalities, e.g., text-based ma-\nnipulation [4], text-to-video [17, 48], and text-to-3D [25, 28, 36, 54].\nIn this work, we focus on the field of text-to-3D generation.\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF). There is plenty of work on 3D\nscene representation, including 3D voxel grids [51], mesh [11], point\nclouds [1, 27, 30, 60], and implicit NeRF [29, 34]. In recent years, as\na series of inverse rendering methods, NeRF-based methods have\nemerged as an important technique in 3D scene representation,\nwhich are capable of synthesizing novel views and reconstruct-\ning geometry surface [29, 34, 55]. Specifically, NeRF [29] repre-\nsents scenes as density and radiance fields with the neural network\nPoints-to-3D: Bridging the Gap between Sparse Points and Shape-Controllable Text-to-3D Generation\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\n(MLP), allowing for photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,\nthe computational cost of densely querying the neural network\nin 3D space is substantial. To improve the efficiency of NeRF, re-\ncent research has explored designing hybrid or explicit structures\nbased on NeRF [6, 34, 51] to achieve fast convergence for radiance\nfield reconstruction, as well as accelerating the rendering speed of\nNeRF [12, 14, 40]. Most of these methods require multiple views and\ncorresponding camera parameters for training, which can not be\nalways satisfied, especially in novel text-to-3D content generation.\nIn this work, we view NeRF as a basic scene representation model\nand focus on devising a new framework for text-to-3D generation.\nSingle Image 3D Reconstruction. Various approaches exist\nfor single image 3D reconstruction, which aims at reconstructing\nthe object present in the image. Different formats can be used to\nrepresent the reconstructed object, such as voxels [7, 57], polygonal\nmeshes [56], point clouds [10], and more recently, NeRFs [33, 58].\nHowever, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on\nspecific 3D datasets [5], making generalization to general 3D recon-\nstruction challenging due to the lack of sufficient 3D training data.\nRecently, Point-E [35] explores an efficient method for general 3D\ncontent generation in the form of point clouds. It first generates\na single synthetic image using a pre-trained text-to-image diffu-\nsion model, and then produces a sparse (4096 points) 3D point\ncloud using a point cloud diffusion model, which is conditioned\non the generated image. The generalization ability of Point-E is\nattributed to its training on several millions of 3D data [35]. In this\nwork, we innovatively leverage Point-E as a point cloud foundation\nmodel, to provide sparse geometry guidance for more realistic and\nshape-controllable text-to-3D generation.\nText-to-3D Generation. In recent times, the progress in text-to-\nimage generation and 3D scene modeling has sparked a growing\ninterest in text-to-3D content generation. Earlier work like CLIP-\nforge [45] consists of an implicit autoencoder conditioned on shape\ncodes and a normalizing flow model to sample shape embeddings\nfrom textual input. However, it needs 3D training data in voxel\nrepresentation, which is difficult to scale in real applications. Pure-\nCLIPNeRF [23] uses pre-trained CLIP [37] for guidance with a voxel\ngrid model for scene representation to perform text-to-3D genera-\ntion without access to any 3D datasets. CLIP-Mesh [31] presents\na method for zero-shot 3D generation using a textual prompt, it\nalso relies on a pre-trained CLIP model that compares the input\ntext with differentiably rendered images of the generated 3D model.\nDreamFields [19] first proposes to optimize the 3D representation\nof NeRF [29], by employing a pre-trained CLIP as guidance as well,\nsuch that all rendering views of NeRF are encouraged to match the\ntext prompt.\nMore recently, DreamFusion [36] proposes to utilize a powerful\npre-trained 2D text-to-image diffusion model [44] to perform text-\nto-3D synthesis. They propose a Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)\nloss to supervise the rendered views of 3D objects modeled by\nNeRF. The following Stable-DreamFusion [52], Latent-NeRF [28],\nand SJC [54] adapt the score distillation to the publicly available\nand computationally efficient Stable Diffusion model [42], which\napply the diffusion process in a compact latent space and facilitate\nthe development of text-to-3D generation. We build upon these\nworks and propose a flexible Points-to-3D framework for text-to-3D\ngeneration by bridging the gap between sparse 3D points and more\nrealistic shape-controllable 3D content generation.\n3\nAPPROACH\n3.1\nPreliminaries\nIn this section, we provide a brief introduction to some of the\nkey concepts that are necessary for understanding our proposed\nframework in Section 3.2.\nDiffusion Model. Diffusion models are first proposed by [49]\nand recently promoted by [15, 50]. A diffusion model usually con-\nsists of a forward process \ud835\udc5e that gradually adds noise to the image\n\ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc4b, and a reverse process \ud835\udc5d of gradually removing noise from\nthe noisy data. The forward process \ud835\udc5e can be formulated as:\n\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 |\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61\u22121) = N (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61;\n\u221a\ufe01\n1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61\u22121, \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61I),\n(1)\nwhere timesteps \ud835\udc61 \u2208 [0,\ud835\udc47], \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61 denotes noise schedule. DDPM [15]\nproposes to directly attain a given timestep of the noising procedure:\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 = \u221a \u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc650 + \u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf16,\n(2)\nwhere \u00af\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61 = \u00ce\ud835\udc61\n0 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61, and \ud835\udf16 \u223c N (0, I). The denoising process\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf03 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61\u22121|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61) starts from random noise and slowly reverses the nois-\ning process. DDPM [15] proposes to parameterize the distribution\nby modeling the added noise \ud835\udf16. Recently, latent diffusion model\n(LDM), as a specific form of diffusion model, has achieved great\nprogress in text-to-image generation. The well-known Stable Diffu-\nsion [42] and ControlNet [59] are both latent diffusion models.\nScore Distillation Sampling (SDS). Score distillation sampling\n(SDS) is first proposed by DreamFusion [36], which achieves text-to-\n3D creation by incorporating two modules: a scene representation\nmodel [3] and a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model (Ima-\ngen [44]). During training, a learnable NeRF model \ud835\udf03 first performs\nview synthesizes with a differentiable render \ud835\udc54: \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udf03), which\ncan render an image at a given random camera pose. Then, random\nnoise is added to \ud835\udc65 and the diffusion model \ud835\udf19 is to predict the added\nnoise \ud835\udf16 from the noisy image with a learned denoising function\n\ud835\udf16\ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61;\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc61) given the noisy image \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61, text embedding \ud835\udc66, and noise\nlevel \ud835\udc61. This score function provides gradient to update the NeRF\nparameters \ud835\udf03, which is calculated as:\n\u2207\ud835\udf03 LSDS(\ud835\udf19,\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udf03)) = E\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udf16\n\u0002\n\ud835\udf14(\ud835\udc61)(\ud835\udf16\ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61;\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udf16) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf03\n\u0003\n,\n(3)\nwhere \ud835\udf14(\ud835\udc61) is a weighting function that depends on \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc61. Inspired by\nStable-DreamFusion [52] and Latent-NeRF [28], which use Stable\nDiffusion [42], we propose to perform score distillation with a more\ncontrollable LDM, ControNet [59], to generate more realistic and\nshape-controllable 3D contents.\n3.2\nPoints-to-3D\nIn this section, we elaborate on our Points-to-3D framework, which\nis depicted in Figure 2.\nArchitecture. First of all, we describe the architecture of our\nPoints-to-3D framework. As shown in Figure 2, Points-to-3D mainly\nconsists of three models: a scene representation model (a coordinate-\nbased MLP [34]), a text-to-image 2D diffusion model (Control-\nNet [59]), and a point cloud 3D diffusion model (Point-E [35]).\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\nTrovato et al.\nPoint-E\nMLP\n\u201ca Nissan GTR racing car\u201d\n+\nText + ControlNet + Depth(from shape)\nControlNet\n\ud83d\udd25\n\u2744\n\u2744\nDepth map\nPoint cloud\nUpsampling\nMLP\nVAE\nDecoder\nTrain\nInference\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"amr0lOJLScpI6dHSV36DjK8t2sY=\">AC3XicjVHLSsNAFD2Nr\n1pfVTeCm2ARXJVUfC1FXbhwUamtgi1lMk5raF4kE1FC3bkTt/6AW/0d8Q/0L7wzRlCL6IQkZ86958zce+3QdWJpWS85Y2h4ZHQsP16YmJyaninOzjXiIm4qPADaITm8XCdXxRl450xUkYC\nebZrji2e7sqfnwhotgJ/CN5FYqWx7q+03E4k0S1iwtNj8lztz0oN9Om1JcyrS2V+v328WSVb0MgdBJQMlZKsaFJ/RxBkCcCTwIOBDEnbBENzigoshMS1kBIXEXJ0XKCPAmkTyhKUwYjt0\nbdLu9OM9WmvPGOt5nSKS29EShPLpAkoLyKsTjN1PNHOiv3NO9We6m5X9LczL49YiXNi/9J9Zv5Xp2qR6GBL1+BQTaFmVHU8c0l0V9TNzS9VSXIiVP4jOIRYa6Vn302tSbWtaveMh1/1ZmKV\nXue5SZ4U7ekAVd+jnMQNFbLlY3y+uFaXsnG3Uei1jCs1zE9vYRxV18r7GAx7xZLSNG+PWuPtINXKZh7flnH/DhSKmfo=</latexit>LSDS\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"4B/nEnohC/fh8yTReb6\ngRmX7/zY=\">AC5XicjVHLTtAFD0x5RUeDbBkYzVCYkPkIAosEWy6YBGk5iERFI0nQxgx9lj2GBFZ2b\nJjh9jyA93Cr1T9A/oXvTM1UluEyli2z5x7z5m594aJkpkJgh8Vb+rD9Mzs3Hx1YXFp+WNtZbWT6Tzlos2\n10mkvZJlQMhZtI40SvSQVLAqV6IaXRzbevRJpJnX81YwTcRaxUSzPJWeGqEHN70fMXHCmiuPJoOgbcW2K\nRMvYbHGl8+FkMqjVg0bglv8aNEtQR7lauvYdfQyhwZEjgkAMQ1iBIaPnFE0ESIg7Q0FcSki6uMAEVdLml\nCUogxF7Sd8R7U5LNqa9cycmtMpit6UlD42SKMpLyVsT/NdPHfOln3Lu3Ce9m5j+oelV0SswQWx/9O9ZL5\nXZ2sxOMe+q0FSTYljbHW8dMldV+zN/T+qMuSQEGfxkOIpYe6UL32nSZztdveMhd/dpmWtXte5ub4aW9J\nA27+O87XoLPdaO42Pp/s1A8Oy1HPYR2fsEnz3MBvqCFNnf4Bse8eSNvFvzrv/nepVSs0a/lrewy/7H\nJ3O</latexit>Lpoint-cloud\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"egG5C0d3fJDGyPoRG+\n2cydfTX1U=\">ACyXicjVHLSsNAFD2Nr1pfVZdugkVwVRLxtSy6EdxUsA9oiyTaR2bl8lErMWVP+\nBWf0z8A/0L74wpqEV0QpIz595zZu69buSJRFrWa86Ymp6ZncvPFxYWl5ZXiqtr9SRMY8ZrLPTCuOk6C\nfdEwGtSI83o5g7vuvxhjs4VvHGDY8TEQbnchjxju/0A9ETzJFE1duJ6PvORbFklS29zElgZ6CEbFXD\n4gva6CIEQwofHAEkYQ8OEnpasGEhIq6DEXExIaHjHPcokDalLE4ZDrED+vZp18rYgPbKM9FqRqd49M\nakNLFmpDyYsLqNFPHU+2s2N+8R9pT3W1Ifzfz8omVuCT2L9048786VYtED4e6BkE1RZpR1bHMJdVdU\nTc3v1QlySEiTuEuxWPCTCvHfTa1JtG1q946Ov6mMxWr9izLTfGubkDtn+OcxLUd8r2fnvbLdUOcp\nGncGNrFN8zxABSeokbeV3jE56NU+PauDXuPlONXKZx7dlPHwA12mRrg=</latexit>\u03c3\nReference image\nNeRF\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"9gr4pJ/umEvXZiTs3KbR5hS7J\nbI=\">AC2XicjVHLSsNAFD2Nr1pf9bFzEyxCBSmJ76XoxqWCfUBtSzKd1mCahMlE0OLCnbj1B9zqD4l/oH/hnTEFtYh\nOyMyZc+85M3euG/leLC3rNWOMjI6NT2Qnc1PTM7Nz+fmFShwmgvEyC/1Q1Fwn5r4X8L0pM9rkeBOz/V51b04VPHqJRe\nxFwan8irijZ7TDbyOxJVCu/VGRNe91kzQ01bapa62VL1glSw9zGNgpKCAdx2H+BWdoIwRDgh4AkjCPhzE9NVhw0JE\nXAN94gQhT8c5bpAjbUJZnDIcYi9o7tKunrIB7ZVnrNWMTvHpF6Q0sUqakPIEYXWaqeOJdlbsb9597anudkWrm3r1iJU4\nbOdw6CyUbJ3StsnW4X9g7TVWSxjBUXq5y72cYRjlMn7Go94wrNRN26NO+P+M9XIpJpFfBvGwfLJpUB</latexit>J/Yv3SDzvzpVi0QHe7oGj2qKNKOqY6lLol9F3dz8UpUkh4g4hdsUF4SZVg7e2dSaWNeu3tbR8TedqVi1Z2lugnd1S2qw/\n(c1, c2, c3, c4)\nFigure 2: Illustration of the proposed Points-to-3D framework for text-to-3D generation. Points-to-3D mainly consists of three\nparts: a scene representation model (a coordinate-based NeRF [34]), a text-to-image 2D diffusion model (ControlNet [59]), and a\npoint cloud 3D diffusion model (Point-E [35]). During training, both 2D and 3D diffusion models are frozen.\n\u2022 Scene Model. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [29] has been an\nimportant technique used for scene representation, comprising of\na volumetric raytracer and an MLP. Previous literature [28, 36, 54]\nhas used NeRF as the scene representation model for text-to-3D\ngeneration, mainly because a NeRF model can implicitly impose\nthe spatial consistency between different views owing to the spa-\ntial radiance field and rendering paradigm. A NeRF model usually\nproduces a volumetric density \ud835\udf0e and an RGB color \ud835\udc50. In this work,\nwe adopt the efficient design of Latent-NeRF [28] that produces\nfive outputs, including the volume density \ud835\udf0e and four pseudo-color\nchannels {\ud835\udc36 = (\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502,\ud835\udc503,\ud835\udc504)} \u2208 R64\u00d764\u00d74 that correspond to the\nfour input latent features for latent diffusion models [42]:\n(\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502,\ud835\udc503,\ud835\udc504, \ud835\udf0e) = MLP(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc67,\ud835\udc51;\ud835\udf03),\n(4)\nwhere \ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc67 denote 3D coordinates, \ud835\udc51 is the view direction. We use\nInstant-NGP [34] as the scene representation model by default.\n\u2022 Text-to-Image 2D Diffusion Model. Since Imagen [44] used\nby DreamFusion [36] is not publicly available, we use Stable Dif-\nfusion as the text-to-image diffusion model initially, as previously\nexplored in existing literature [28, 52, 54]. However, the original\nStable Diffusion v1.5 is not controllable to support additional input\nconditions. In this work, we first propose to use the pre-trained Con-\ntrolNet [59] conditioned on depth map as the 2D diffusion model\nin Points-to-3D. As depicted in Figure 2, in addition to the input\ntext prompt, e.g., \u201ca Nissan GTR racing car\u201d, we further introduce\nthe predicted depth map \ud835\udc40 \u2208 R\ud835\udc3b \u00d7\ud835\udc4a \u00d71 of our NeRF model as the\nconditional control. The depth map is computed as follows, for\nsimplicity, we only show the depth value calculation on one pixel:\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 =\n\ud835\udc3e\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc58=1\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58,\n(5)\nand\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58\n\u00d6\n\ud835\udc57<\ud835\udc58\n(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc57), and \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58 = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc58 ||\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 \u2212 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58+1||).\n(6)\nwhere \ud835\udc3e is the total number of sampling points along a ray, and \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58\ndenotes the depth hypothesis at point \ud835\udc58. The better and more accu-\nrate the predicted depth map \ud835\udc40, the more geometrically consistent\nviews ControlNet will synthesize.\n\u2022 Point Cloud 3D Diffusion Model. To control the geometry\nof NeRF for text-to-3D generation, we propose in this paper, for the\nfirst time, the distillation of prior knowledge from the pre-trained\nlarge point cloud diffusion model, Point-E [35]. Point-E [35] is an\nefficient 3D diffusion model for generating sparse 3D point clouds\n(4096 points) from text prompts or images in about 1 minute. As\nillustrated in Figure 2, we utilize the pre-trained Point-E model to\nregulate the geometry learning of NeRF. Specifically, the model\ngenerates a sparse 3D point cloud consisting of 4096 points, which\nis conditioned on a reference image and can flexibly represent the\nobject\u2019s shape depicted in the image. However, it is not trivial to\nguide the NeRF\u2019s geometry with only sparse 3D points, we propose\na sparse point cloud guidance loss Lpoint-cloud to address this issue,\nwhich is illustrated in the next section.\nIt is worth noting that Points-to-3D enables users to easily con-\ntrol the shape of the generated content by providing a reference\nimage, which can be a real image or a generated image via text-to-\nimage models [32, 42, 59].\nSparse 3D Points Guidance. The core idea of our Points-to-3D\nis to introduce controllable sparse 3D points to guide the text-to-3D\ngeneration. In this section, we elaborate on how to leverage the\nsparse 3D points. It is challenging to use a sparse 3D point cloud to\nguide the geometry learning of NeRF. Previous work on improving\nPoints-to-3D: Bridging the Gap between Sparse Points and Shape-Controllable Text-to-3D Generation\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\nNeRF\u2019s geometry uses the depth of sparse points to supervise the\npredicted depth [8, 41]. However, the 3D points are computed using\nmultiple views via COLMAP [46], and the information about which\nview each 3D point belongs to has been calculated in advance. In\nour case, only a single RGB image is used to generate the sparse 3D\npoints, when we project all the points to the current view to attain\na sparse depth map, there will be aliasing problems between the\nfront and the rear 3D points.\nIn this work, we present a sparse point cloud guidance loss.\nSpecifically, let \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60 = {(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56)}4096\n\ud835\udc56=1 be the original sparse 3D\npoints generated by Point-E [35] conditioned on a reference image.\nInstead of using \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60 directly, we experimentally find that making\nthe sparse point cloud to be dense can provide better geometry\nsupervision and produce more realistic 3D contents. We propose\nto upsample \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60 by iteratively performing 3D points interpolation\nvia a simple rule, i.e., for each point \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56, we add a new 3D point at\nthe middle position between each of its nearest \ud835\udc5e neighbor points\nand \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56. The process is depicted in Figure 3. We set \ud835\udc5e = 20,\ud835\udc5b = 2 by\ndefault. Now we get the dense 3D points \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51, which contain about\n500k points after eliminating duplicate points.\nIdeally, we want to align the geometry (the volume density \ud835\udf0e) of\nNeRF with the shape of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51 to ensure that the generated 3D content\nof Points-to-3D closely resembles the reference image. In addition,\nwe also want to provide NeRF with a level of flexibility and adapt-\nability in its geometry to enable the generation of new details while\nsatisfying different text prompts. Instead of using the per-view\nsparse depth map supervision, which has a front-rear aliasing issue\nas discussed above, and is also not efficient as it only optimizes the\ncurrent view\u2019s depth, we propose an efficient point cloud guidance\nloss Lpoint-cloud to directly optimize the whole geometry (\ud835\udf0e) in 3D\nspace. Specifically, we encourage the occupancy (\ud835\udefc) corresponding\nto the NeRF points \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 that near the point cloud \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51 to be close to\n1, while the occupancy of the NeRF points that far from the point\ncloud \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51 to be close to 0. Furthermore, we make the geometry capa-\nble of generating new details adaptively by ignoring the supervision\nof some parts of occupancy. We first compute the closest distance be-\ntween each point in \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 and all points in \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51: D = Dist(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 , \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51),\nD \u2208 R\ud835\udc46\u00d71, where \ud835\udc46 denotes the number of points in \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 . Then,\nnormalize D via: b\nD =\nD\n0.5\u00b7(max(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 )\u2212min(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 )) . Finally, The\ncalculation of Lpoint-cloud can be formulated as:\nLpoint-cloud = CrossEntropy(\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 ),\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 )),\n(7)\nand\n\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56 =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1 \u2212 b\nD\ud835\udc56,\nif 1 \u2212 b\nD\ud835\udc56 > \ud835\udf0f1;\n0,\nelse if 1 \u2212 b\nD\ud835\udc56 < \ud835\udf0f2;\n\u22121,\notherwise;\n(8)\nwhere \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc53 ) denotes the target occupancy of all NeRF points,\n1 \u2212 b\nD indicates the degree of proximity to the guided point cloud\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51, and \ud835\udf0f1,\ud835\udf0f2 are two hyperparameters that are experimentally set\nto 0.95 and 0.9 respectively.

Instead of using the close-\nsourced Imagen [44] diffusion model, both Latent-NeRF and SJC\nuse the publicly available Stable Diffusion [42]. We mainly compare\nour Points-to-3D with Latent-NeRF and SJC in the experiments. We\nprovide more results including comparisons with DreamFields [19],\nand DreamFusion [36] in our supplementary materials.\n4.2\nImplementation Details\nWe use Instant-NGP [34] as our scene model. Following the camera\nsampling method in [36], during training, a camera position is\nrandomly sampled in spherical coordinates, and we also randomly\nenlarge the FOV when rendering with NeRF. In addition to the\ntraining in latent space shown in Figure 2, we experimentally find\nthat further performing RGB refinement in RGB space, which is\nintroduced in [28], can further improve the text-to-3D generation\nresults. Our Points-to-3D takes less than 50 minutes per text prompt\nto complete a 3D generation on a single A100 GPU, and most of\nthe time is spent on calculating Lpoint-cloud. We train for 5000\niterations using AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1\ud835\udc52\u22123. The\nhyperparameters of \ud835\udf06point, \ud835\udf06SDS, \ud835\udf06sparse are set to 5\ud835\udc52\u22126, 1.0, 5\ud835\udc52\u22124,\nrespectively.\n4.3\nAblation Studies\nEffect of Point Cloud Guidance Loss. In this section, we evalu-\nate the proposed point cloud guidance loss Lpoint-cloud. Concretely,\nwe evaluate Points-to-3D by eliminating the point cloud guidance.\nWe also verify the per-view sparse depth map loss as discussed in\nSection 3.2. The results are shown in Figure 4. We first produce a\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\nTrovato et al.\nud Loss 1\n\u201can astronaut \nwith a \nbackpack on \na horse\u201d\nFigure 4: Illustration of the effect of our Lpoint-cloud.

Then we use Lpoint-cloud\n(the 3rd row), a designed per-view depth map loss (the 2nd row),\nand without any geometry constraints (the 1st row), to train three\nmodels with the same text prompt, respectively. We can find that\nwithout any geometry constraints, the generated content suffers\nan obvious view inconsistency problem (red dashed boxes). The\nresult of using our designed per-view depth map loss as geometry\nsupervision further improves the multi-face issue. However, the\nrendered images are less realistic and even broken (yellow dashed\nboxes) due to the sparsity of point clouds and the inefficiency of\nthe per-view supervision. It is worth noting that the result of using\nLpoint-cloud shows more details in both \u201castronaut\u201d and \u201chorse\u201d.\nThat is, Points-to-3D with Lpoint-cloud for geometry optimization\ncan generate more realistic 3D content.\nEffect of 3D Points Upsampling. In this section, we analyze\nthe effect of upsampling the generated sparse 3D point cloud. As\nshown in Figure 5, we compare the rendered views of Points-to-\n3D trained with sparse (4096) 3D points \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60 and upsampled denser\n(\u223c500k) 3D points \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51 as the geometry guidance, respectively. The\n1st column represents the original sparse points \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60 produced by\nPoint-E [35] given the reference image shown in Figure 2, and the\nupsampled points \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51 via our designed rule.

We can see that the results\nguided by \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51 are more realistic compared to those guided by \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60.\nThis is due to that a denser point cloud can offer more supervision\nto encourage the NeRF to learn a more concise geometry. Moreover,\nbetter geometry (depth map) can also guide ControlNet [59] to\ngenerate more geometry-consistent and realistic images that match\nthe input text prompt.\nEffect of Adaptive Design in Lpoint-cloud. In this section, we\nillustrate the effect of the adaptive design in Lpoint-cloud. That is, in\nEquation 7 and Equation 8, we propose to ignore the supervision\nof those NeRF points with \ud835\udf0f2 < 1 \u2212 b\nD < \ud835\udf0f1 to let Points-to-3D\nto adaptively adjust the geometry to match the text prompt. This\nadaptive design serves two main purposes: a). it offers the capacity\nto create new details without changing the main shape of the 3D\ncontent. b). it can fill broken holes in the imperfect point clouds \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51.\nAs shown in Figure 6, we visualize two generated 3D contents\nusing Points-to-3D with the same reference image and sparse point\ncloud but different text prompts. The last three columns represent\nthe rendered images, the rendered depth maps, and the rendered\nnormals at the same camera pose, respectively. We can clearly\nobserve that Points-to-3D can generate more specific new details to\nmatch different input text prompts based on the same point cloud\nguidance. In Figure 7, we analyze the effect of adaptive design in\nfilling holes in the imperfect point cloud. Given a reference image,\nPoint-E [35] may produce non-uniform point clouds, e.g., broken\nholes in the chair back in this instance. If we enforce all the NeRF\npoints closed to the point cloud to be positive class and otherwise\nnegative class, it is difficult to set an appropriate distance threshold\nfor all 3D contents and will cause broken holes. For instance, we\ncompare the results of rendered images and corresponding depth\nmaps trained without and with adaptive design in the 1st and 2nd\nPoints-to-3D: Bridging the Gap between Sparse Points and Shape-Controllable Text-to-3D Generation\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\nReference image\na red converse allstar shoe\nReference image\na Nike running shoe\nReference image\na GUCCI backpack\na classic LV backpack\nPoints-to-3D (Ours)\nLatent-NeRF\nPoints-to-3D (Ours)\nLatent-NeRF\na squirrel is riding a motorbike\nSpiderman is riding a motorbike\nReference image\nReference image\na golden teapot on a metal tray\na Chinese blue and white porcelain teapot on a tray\nReference image\na teddy is playing the tuba\na mickey mouse is playing the tuba\nReference image\na medieval knight is chopping wood\nan astronaut is chopping wood\na lego man\na figure of Trump\nSJC\nSJC\nReference image\na strawberry\na strawberry made of blue crystal\nFigure 8: Qualitative comparison with Latnet-NeRF [28] and SJC [54] on single-object generation (the 1st \u223c 4th rows) and scene\ngeneration (the 5th \u223c 8th rows).

(Best viewed by zooming in.)\nrow, respectively. Points-to-3D can naturally repair the broken\nholes in both geometry and appearance. We also analyze the effect\nof the depth map condition in our supplementary materials.\n4.4\nShape-Controllable Text-to-3D Generation\nAs special concepts and shapes are usually difficult to describe\nby text prompts but easy with images, it is desperately needed to\nhave a mechanism to guide the text-to-3D content generation with\nimages. In this section, we evaluate Points-to-3D in generating\nview-consistent and shape-controllable 3D contents with a single\nreference image for geometry guidance. Considering that Dream-\nFusion [36] and Magic3D [25] use their proprietary text-to-image\ndiffusion models [2, 44] and neither releases the code, we mainly\ncompare with Latent-NeRF [28] and SJC [54]. As shown in Figure 8,\nwe mainly compare two aspects: single-object generation and scene\n(consists of multiple objects) generation.\nFor the single-object generation (the 1st \u223c 4th rows), Latent-\nNeRF [28] is easy to suffer the view inconsistency problem, and\nsometimes fails to generate reasonable content. SJC [54] looks a\nlittle better than Latent-NeRF in terms of view consistency of the\ngenerated objects, however, it also sometimes fails to generate\ncontent that matches the text description (e.g., the 2nd and the 4th\nrows). Our Points-to-3D can automatically generate view-consistent\nand more realistic single objects. It is worth noting that Points-to-\n3D can generate more lifelike details, e.g., the logos of Converse,\nNike, GUCCI, and LV.\nFor more challenging scene generation (the 5th \u223c 8th rows), the\ninherent view inconsistency problem of Latent-NeRF [28] becomes\nmore serious, e.g., multiple teapot spouts in the 6th row and multiple\nhands or legs in the 7th row. Besides, both Latent-NeRF and SJC can\neasily lose some concepts of the input text prompts, e.g., \u201cmotorbike\u201d\nin the 5th row, \u201ctray\u201d in the 6th row, and \u201ctuba\u201d in the last row. In\ncontrast, our Points-to-3D can create view-consistent 3D content\nand preserve the concepts contained in the text prompts.\nFurthermore, Points-to-3D enables users to arbitrarily create or\nmodify 3D content that has a similar shape to the reference image.\nWe provide more comparisons in our supplementary materials.\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\nTrovato et al.\nPoints-to-3D (Ours)\nLatent-NeRF\nFigure 9: Mesh comparison through Marching Cubes [26].\non\nReference images\na teddy is sitting on the top of a car\na teddy is eating ice cream\nFigure 10: Compositional generation of Points-to-3D.\n4.5\nGeometry Comparison\nWe compare the learned geometry of Points-to-3D and Latent-\nNeRF [28], both of which use Instant-NGP [34] as the scene model.\nAs depicted in Figure 9, we show two generation results produced\nusing two text prompts: \u201ca lego man\u201d and \u201ca red converse allstar\nshoe\u201d. Each contains three views: a rendered RGB image and two\nviews of mesh. The meshes are extracted by Marching Cubes [26]\nfrom density field of the learned Instant-NGP. We can clearly ob-\nserve that compared to the flawed meshes of Latent-NeRF, Points-\nto-3D can generate more delicate meshes. That is, in addition to\nsynthesis view-consistent novel views, Points-to-3D can learn con-\ntrollable and more compact geometry for text-to-3D generation.\n4.6\nCompositional Generation\nWe analyze the effectiveness of Points-to-3D in generating compo-\nsitional 3D content. As shown in Figure 10, by taking the manually\ncomposited sparse 3D points of multiple reference images as ge-\nometry guidance, Points-to-3D can perform view-consistent and\nshape-controllable text-to-3D generation. The results indicate that\nPoints-to-3D enables users to freely composite objects using multi-\nple reference images and generate more imaginative 3D content.\n4.7\nQuantitative Comparisons\nCLIP R-precision. In this section, we calculate the CLIP R-\nprecision metrics for Latent-NeRF [28], SJC [54], and our Points-to-\n3D. We compute CLIP R-precision following [19] on 50 text and 3D\nmodel pairs (shown in our supplementary materials) based on\nthree CLIP image encoders (ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, and ViT-L/14). For\neach 3D generation, we randomly select two rendered views for\ncalculation. The results are reported in Table 1, the higher scores\nfor our Points-to-3D results indicate that renderings from our 3D\nmodel outputs more accurately resemble the text prompts.\nUser Studies. The CLIP R-precision metric focuses on the match-\ning degree of rendered views and text prompts, but it is difficult\nto reflect view consistency and image realism. We conduct user\nstudies with 22 participants to evaluate different methods based\non user preferences. We ask the participants to give a preference\nTable 1: Quantitative comparison using CLIP R-precision of\nLatent-NeRF [28], SJC [54], and our Points-to-3D.\nMethod\nViT-B/16 \u2191\nViT-B/32 \u2191\nViT-L/14 \u2191\nLatent-NeRF [28]\n53.00%\n59.00%\n66.00%\nSJC [54]\n61.00%\n57.00%\n71.00%\nPoints-to-3D (Ours)\n81.00%\n81.00%\n90.00%\n3.86\n4.05\n2.78\n2.92\n2.53\n2.28\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nView Consistency\nPrompt Relevance\nUser-11\nPoints-to-3D (Ours)\nLatent-NeRF\nSJC\n4.06\n4.22\n2.53\n2.95\n2.31\n2.42\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nView\nConsistency\nPrompt\nRelevance\nSJC\nLatent-NeRF\nPoints-to-3D (Ours)\nFigure 11: Quantitative comparison via user studies with 22\nparticipants to measure preference in terms of view consis-\ntency and prompt relevance.\nscore (range from 1 \u223c 5) in terms of view consistency and prompt\nrelevance for each anonymized method\u2019s generation. As shown\nin Figure 11, we report the average scores on a randomly com-\nposed evaluation set that consists of 36 generation results of each\nmethod. We find that Points-to-3D is significantly preferred over\nboth Latent-NeRF and SJC in terms of view consistency and prompt\nrelevance. We provide more detailed information about the user\nstudy, please refer to our supplementary materials.\n5\nLIMITATIONS\nWhile Points-to-3D allows for flexible text-to-3D generation and im-\nproves over prior works in terms of realism, view consistency, and\nshape controllability, we observe several limitations. First, as Points-\nto-3D is built upon pre-trained 2D image diffusion model [59] and\n3D point cloud diffusion model [35], it will be affected when Con-\ntrolNet or Point-E fails with certain objects. This issue might be\nalleviated by developing more powerful foundation models. Second,\nwhile achieving good controllability of 3D shapes, Points-to-3D\nneeds a single reference image for geometry guidance. This issue\ncan be alleviated by cropping objects from real images using Seg-\nment Anything Model (SAM) [22], or direct generating an image\nusing text-to-image models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, ControlNet.\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we propose Points-to-3D, a novel and flexible text-to-\n3D generation framework. We inspire our framework by alleviating\nthe view inconsistency problem and improving the controllability\nof 3D shapes for 3D content generation. To control the learned\ngeometry, we innovatively propose to distill the geometry knowl-\nedge (sparse 3D points) from the 3D point cloud diffusion model\n(Point-E). To better utilize the sparse point cloud, we propose an\nefficient point cloud guidance loss to adaptively align the geom-\netry between NeRF and sparse points. Besides, to make the 3D\ncontent more realistic and view-consistent, we optimize the NeRF\nmodel conditioned on both text and the learned compact depth map,\nPoints-to-3D: Bridging the Gap between Sparse Points and Shape-Controllable Text-to-3D Generation\nConference ACM MM \u201923, Oct. 29\u2013Nov. 03, 2023, Ottawa, Canada\nby performing score distillation to the 2D image diffusion model\n(ControlNet).

However,\nexisting text-to-image diffusion models provide limited\nsupport for incorporating spatial information. This paper\nintroduces Composite Diffusion as a means for artists\nto generate high-quality images by composing from the\nsub-scenes. The artists can specify the arrangement of\nthese sub-scenes through a flexible free-form segment\nlayout. They can describe the content of each sub-scene\nprimarily using natural text and additionally by utilizing\nreference images or control inputs such as line art,\nscribbles, human pose, canny edges, and more.\nWe provide a comprehensive and modular method\nfor Composite Diffusion that enables alternative ways\nof generating, composing, and harmonizing sub-scenes.\nFurther, we wish to evaluate the composite image for\neffectiveness in both image quality and achieving the\nartist\u2019s intent. We argue that existing image quality\nmetrics lack a holistic evaluation of image composites.\nTo address this, we propose novel quality criteria\nespecially relevant to composite generation.\nWe believe that our approach provides an intuitive\nmethod of art creation. Through extensive user surveys,\nquantitative and qualitative analysis, we show how it\nachieves greater spatial, semantic, and creative control\nover image generation. In addition, our methods do\nnot need to retrain or modify the architecture of the\nbase diffusion models and can work in a plug-and-play\nmanner with the fine-tuned models.\n1. Introduction\nRecent advances in diffusion models [13], such as\nDalle-2 [38], Imagen [42], and Stable Diffusion [39]\nhave enabled artists to generate vivid imagery by\ndescribing their envisioned scenes with natural language\n\u2217Work performed while working at TCS Research.\nBaby dinosaur out \nof  a hatched egg\nyoung girl on a \nswing in a \nfantasy garden\nbutterfly flying in \nfantasy skies\nopenpose\nline art\nscribble\nFauvism style illustration \nof a fairy tale\nA conceptual poster \nportraying the harmful \neffects of air pollution \nfactory \nwith \nchimney \nsmoke\ntwo vertical cigarettes \nwith smoke\nhealthy human lungs\nlush green forest\nA\nnatural text \nB\nC\nFigure 1. Image generation using Composite Diffusion:\nThe artist\u2019s intent (A) is manually converted into input\nspecification (B) for the model in the form of a free-form\nsub-scene layout and conditioning information for each sub-\nscene. The conditioning information can be natural text\ndescription, and any other control condition. The model\ngenerates composite images (C) based on these inputs.\nphrases. However, it is cumbersome and occasionally\neven impossible to specify spatial information or sub-\nscenes within an image solely by text descriptions.\nConsequently,\nartists\nhave\nlimited\nor\nno\ndirect\ncontrol\nover\nthe\nlayout,\nplacement,\norientation,\nand properties of the individual objects within a\nscene. These creative controls are indispensable for\nartists seeking to express their creativity [45] and\n1\narXiv:2307.13720v1  [cs.CV]  25 Jul 2023\nare crucial in various content creation domains,\nincluding illustration generation, graphic design, and\nadvertisement production. Frameworks like Controlnets\n[50] offer exciting new capabilities by training parallel\nconditioning networks within diffusion models to\nsupport numerous control conditions. Nevertheless, as\nwe show in this paper, creating a complex scene solely\nbased on control conditions can still be challenging. As a\nresult, achieving the desired imagery may require several\nhours of labor or maybe only be partially attainable\nthrough pure text-driven or control-condition-driven\ntechniques.\nTo\novercome\nthese\nchallenges,\nwe\npropose\nComposite-Diffusion as a method for creating\ncomposite images by combining spatially distributed\nsegments or sub-scenes. These segments are generated\nand\nharmonized\nthrough\nindependent\ndiffusion\nprocesses to produce a final composite image. The\nartistic intent in Composite Diffusion is conveyed\nthrough the following two means:\n(i) Spatial Intent: Artists can flexibly arrange sub-\nscenes using a free-form spatial layout. A unique color\nidentifies each sub-scene.\n(ii) Content intent:Artists can specify the desired\ncontent within each sub-scene through text descriptions.\nThey can augment this information by using examples\nimages and other control methods such as scribbles, line\ndrawings, pose indicators, etc.\nWe believe, and our initial experience has shown, that\nthis approach offers a powerful and intuitive method\nfor visual artists to stipulate their artwork.\nThis paper seeks to answer two primary research\nquestions: First, how can native diffusion models\nfacilitate composite creation using the diverse input\nmodalities we described above? Second, how do we\nassess the quality of images produced using Composite\nDiffusion methods? Our paper contributes in the\nfollowing novel ways:\n1.We present a comprehensive, modular, and flexible\nmethod for creating composite images, where the\nindividual segments (or sub-scenes) can be influenced\nnot only by textual descriptions, but also by various\ncontrol modalities such as line art, scribbles, human\npose, canny images, and reference images. The method\nalso enables the simultaneous use of different control\nconditions for different segments.\n2. Recognizing the inadequacy of existing image\nquality metrics such as FID (Frechet Inception Distance)\nand Inception Scores [20,44] for evaluating the quality\nof composite images, we introduce a new set of quality\ncriteria. While principally relying on human evaluations\nfor quality assessments, we also develop new methods of\nautomated evaluations suitable for these quality criteria.\nWe rigorously evaluate our methods using various\ntechniques including quantitative user evaluations,\nautomated\nassessments,\nartist\nconsultations,\nand\nqualitative\nvisual\ncomparisons\nwith\nalternative\napproaches. In the following sections, we delve into\nrelated work (Section 2), detail our method (Section\n3), and discuss the evaluation and implications of our\napproach (Section 4, and 5).\n2. Related work\nIn this section, we discuss the approaches that are\nrelated to our work from multiple perspectives.\n2.1. Text-to-Image generative models\nThe field of text-to-image generation has recently\nseen rapid advancements, driven primarily by the\nevolution of powerful neural network architectures.\nApproaches like DALL\u00b7E [38] and VQ-GAN [15]\nproposed a two-stage method for image generation.\nThese methods employ a discrete variational auto-\nencoder (VAE) to acquire comprehensive semantic\nrepresentations, followed by a transformer architecture\nto autoregressively model text and image tokens.\nSubsequently, diffusion-based approaches, such as\nGuided Diffusion [31] [13], have showcased superior\nimage sample quality compared to previous GAN-based\ntechniques. Dalle-2 [37] and Imagen [42] perform the\ndiffusion process in the pixel-image space while Latent\nDiffusion Models such as Stable Diffusion [39] perform\nthe diffusion process in a more computationally suitable\nlatent space. However, in all these cases, relying on\nsingle descriptions to depict complex scenes restricts\nthe level of control users possess over the generation\nprocess.\n2.2. Spatial control models\nSome past works on image generation have employed\nsegments for spatial control but were limited to\ndomain-specific segments. For example, GauGAN\n[33] introduced spatially-adaptive normalization to\nincorporate semantic segments to generate high-\nresolution images. PoE-GAN [23] utilized the product\nof experts method to integrate semantic segments and\na global text prompt to enhance the controllability\nof image generation. However, both approaches rely\non GAN architectures and are constrained to specific\ndomains with a fixed segment vocabulary. Make-A-\nScene [17] utilized an optional set of dense segmentation\nmaps, along with a global text prompt, to aid in\nthe spatial controllability of generation. VQ-GAN\n[15] can be trained to use semantic segments as\ninputs for image generation.

The figure provides a visual comparison of the outputs of Composite Diffusion with other related approaches -\nusing the same segment layouts and text prompts. Note that these input specifications are from the related-work literature.\nGiven a choice, our approach to creating segment layout and text prompts would vary slightly - we would partition the image\nspace into distinct sub-scenes that fully partition the image space, and we will not have background masks or prompts.\n3\nspatial conditioning in VQ-GAN; they propose a\nmethod that conditions a text-to-image model on\nspatial locations using an optimization approach. The\napproaches discussed above are also limited by training\nonly on a fixed set of dense segments.\n2.3. Inpainting\nThe work that comes closest to our approach in\ndiffusion models is in-painting. Almost all the popular\nmodels [37], [42], [39] support some form of inpainting.\nThe goal of inpainting is to modify a portion in\nan image specified by a segment-mask (and optional\naccompanying textual description) while retaining\nthe information outside the segment. Some of the\napproaches for inpainting in the recent past include\nrepaint [27], blended-diffusion [5], and latent-blended\ndiffusion [3]. RunwayML [39] devises a specialized model\nfor in-painting in Stable Diffusion, by modifying the\narchitecture of the UNet model to include special\nmasked inputs. As we show in later this paper, one\ncan conceive of an approach for Composite Diffusion\nusing inpainting, where we can perform inpainting for\neach segment in a serial manner (refer to Appendix\nD). However, as we explain in this paper, a simple\nextension of localized in-painting methods for multi-\nsegment composites presents some drawbacks.\n2.4. Other diffusion-based composition methods\nSome works look at the composition or editing\nof images through a different lens. These include\nprompt-to-prompt editing [19, 29], composing scenes\nthrough composable prompts [25], and methods for\npersonalization of subjects in a generative model\n[41]. Composable Diffusion [26] takes a structured\napproach to generate images where separate diffusion\nmodels generate distinct components of an image. As\na result, they can generate more complex imagery\nthan seen during the training. Composed GLIDE [25]\nis a composable diffusion implementation that builds\nupon the GLIDE model [30] and utilizes compositional\noperators to combine textual operations. Dreambooth\n[41] allows the personalization of subjects in a text-\nto-image diffusion model through fine-tuning. The\nlearned subjects can be put in totally new contexts\nsuch as scenes, poses, and lighting conditions. Prompt-\nto-prompt editing techniques [12, 19, 29] exploit the\ninformation in cross-attention layers of a diffusion\nmodel by pinpointing areas that spatially correspond\nto particular words in a prompt. These areas can then\nbe modified according to the change of the words in\nthe prompt. Our method is complementary to these\nadvances. We concentrate specifically on composing the\nspatial segments specified via a spatial layout. So, in\nprinciple, our methods can be supplemented with these\ncapabilities (and vice versa).\n2.5. Spatial layout and natural text-based models\nIn this section, we discuss three related concurrent\nworks: SpaText [4], eDiffi [6], and Multi-diffusion [7].\nAll these works provide some method of creating\nimages from spatially free-form layouts with natural\ntext descriptions.\nSpaText [4] achieves spatial control by training the\nmodel to be space-sensitive by additional CLIP-based\nspatial-textual representation. The approach requires\nthe creation of a training dataset and extensive model\ntraining, both of which are costly. Their layout schemes\ndiffer slightly from ours as they are guided towards\ncreating outlines of the objects, whereas we focus on\nspecifying the sub-scene.\neDiffi [6] proposes a method called paint-with-words\nwhich exploits the cross-attention mechanism of U-Net\nin the diffusion model to specify the spatial positioning\nof objects. Specifically, it associates certain phrases\nin the global text prompt with particular regions by\nmanipulating the cross-attention matrix. Similar to our\nwork, they do not require pre-training for a segment-\nbased generation. However, they must create an explicit\ncontrol for the objects in the text description for spatial\ncontrol. We use the inherent capability of U-net\u2019s cross-\nattention layers to guide the relevant image into the\nsegments through step-inpainting and other techniques.\nMulti-diffusion\n[7]\nproposes\na\nmechanism\nfor\ncontrolling the image generation in a region by providing\nthe abstraction of an optimization loss between an ideal\noutput by a single diffusion generator and multiple\ndiffusion processes that generate different parts of\nan image. It also provides an application of this\nabstraction to segment layout and natural-text-based\nimage generation. This approach has some similarities\nto ours in that they also build their segment generation\nby step-wise inpainting. They also use bootstrapping\nto anchor the image and then use the later stages for\nblending. However, our approach is more generic, has a\nwider scope, and is more detailed. For example, we don\u2019t\nrestrict the step composition to a particular method.\nOur scaffolding stage has a much wider significance as\nour principal goal is to create segments independent of\neach other, and the goal of the harmonization stage is to\ncreate segments in the context of each other. We provide\nalternative means of handling both the scaffolding and\nharmonization stages.\nFurther, in comparison to all the above approaches,\nwe achieve additional control over the orientation and\nplacement of objects within a segment through reference\nimages and control conditions specific to the segment.\n4\n3. Our Composite Diffusion method\nWe present our method for Composite Diffusion.\nIt can directly utilize a pre-trained text-conditioned\ndiffusion model or a control-conditioned model without\nthe need to retrain them. We first formally define our\ngoal. We will use the term \u2018segment\u2019 particularly to\ndenote a sub-scene.\n3.1. Goal definition\nWe want to generate an image x which is composed\nentirely based on two types of input specifications:\n1. Segment Layout: a set of free-form segments\nS = [s1, s2, ..., sn], and\n2. Segment\nContent:\na\nset\nof\nnatural\ntext\ndescriptions, D = [d1, d2, ..., dn], and optional\nadditional control conditions, C = [c1, c2, ..., cn].\nEach segment sj in S describes the spatial form\nof a sub-scene and has a corresponding natural text\ndescription dj in D, and optionally a corresponding\ncontrol condition cj in C. The segments don\u2019t non-\noverlap and fully partition the image space of x.\nAdditionally, we convert the segment layout to segment-\nspecific masks, M\n=\n[m1, m2, ..., mn], as one-hot\nencoding vectors. The height and width dimensions\nof the encoding vector are the same as that of x. \u20181s\u2019 in\nthe encoded mask vector indicate the presence of image\npixels corresponding to a segment, and \u20180\u2019s indicate\nthe absence of pixel information in the complementary\nimage area (Refer to Appendix Figure 12).\nOur method divides the generative process of a\ndiffusion model into two successive temporal stages:\n(a) the Scaffolding stage and (b) the Harmonization\nstage. We explain these stages below:\n3.2. Scaffolding stage\nWe introduce the concept of scaffolding, which we\ndefine as a mechanism for guiding image generation\nwithin a segment with some external help. We borrow\nthe term \u2018scaffolding\u2019 from the construction industry\n[49], where it refers to the temporary structures that\nfacilitate the construction of the main building or\nstructure. These scaffolding structures are removed in\nthe building construction once the construction work is\ncomplete or has reached a stage where it does not require\nexternal help. Similarly, we may drop the scaffolding\nhelp after completing the scaffolding stage.\nThe external structural help, in our case, can be\nprovided by any means that help generate or anchor\nthe appropriate image within a segment. We provide\nthis help through either (i) scaffolding reference image\n- in the case where reference example images are\nControl+Text\nConditioned \nDenoiser\n\u201cevening sky\u201d\n\u201cpalace building\u201d\n\u201clily pond\u201d\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\ncontrol\nControl Image \nImage Latent\nScaffold\nImage \nImage \nLatents\nSegment\nMasks\nxt\nm1\nscaff\nDiffusion\nNoiser\nControl+Text\nConditioned \nDenoiser\nControl+Text\nConditioned \nDenoiser\nText\nConditioned \nDenoiser\n\u201cevening sky\u201d\n\u201cpalace building\u201d\n\u201clily pond\u201d\nText \nConditioned \nDenoiser\nText \nConditioned \nDenoiser\nDiffusion\nNoiser\nDiffusion\nNoiser\nReference Images \nq-sampling\nx1\nt\nx2\nt\nx3\nt\nx1\nt\nx2\nt\nx3\nt\nx1\nref\nx2\nref\nx3\nref\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\nx\ud835\udf05-1\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\n1\n3\n2\nSub-scene\nLayout\n\u201cbeautiful evening sky\u201d\n\u201cbeautiful palace building\n\u201cbeautiful lily pond\u201d\nx\ud835\udf05-1\nx\ud835\udf05-1\nFigure 3.

Use of reference images for scaffolding: The scaffolding factor (\u03ba) (Section 3.4) controls the influence of reference\nimages on the final composite image. At low \u03ba values, the reference images are heavily noised and exercise little control; the\nsegments merge drastically. At high \u03ba values, the reference images are lightly noised and the resulting image is nearer to the\nreference images. A middle \u03ba value balances the influences of reference images and textual descriptions.\nAlgorithm 1: Composite Diffusion: Scaffolding\nStage.

This\nconditioning is akin to using image-to-image translation\n[39] to guide the production of images in a particular\nsegment.\nAlgorithmically, we directly noise the reference image\n(refer to Q-sampling in Appendix B.1.1) to the time-\nstamp t = \u03ba that depicts the last time-step of the\nscaffolding stage in the generative diffusion process\n(Algo. 1, 1-4, and Fig. 3, A). The generated segment\ncan be made more or less in the likeness of the reference\nimage by varying the initializing noising levels of the\nreference images. Refer to Fig. 4 for an example of\nscaffolding using segment-specific reference images.\n3.2.2\nSegment generation with a scaffolding\nimage\nThis case is applicable when we have only text\ndescriptions for each segment. The essence of this\nmethod is the use of a predefined image called\nscaffolding image (xscaff), to help with the segment\ngeneration process. Refer to Algo. 1, 5-11 and Fig. 3, B.\nAlgorithmically, to generate one segment at any\ntimestep t : (i) we apply the segment mask m to the\nnoisy image latent xt to isolate the area xt \u2299 m where\nwe want generation, (ii) we apply a complementary\nmask (1 \u2212 m) to an appropriately noised (q-sampled to\ntimestep t) version of scaffold image xscaff\nt\nto isolate a\ncomplementary area xscaff\nt\n\u2299(1\u2212m), and (iii) we merge\nthese two complementary isolated areas and denoise\nthe composite directly through the denoiser along with\nthe corresponding textual description for the segment.\nRefer to Appendix E Fig. 16(a) for an illustration of the\nsingle-step generation. We then replicate this process\nfor all the segments.\nThese steps are akin to performing an inpainting [3]\nstep on each segment but in the context of a scaffolding\nimage. Please note that our method step (Algo. 1, 9) is\ngeneric and flexible to allow the use of any inpainting\nmethod, including the use of a specially trained model\n(e.g., RunwayML Stable Diffusion inpainting 1.5 [39])\nthat can directly generate inpainted segments.\n6\n\u201c *Rock climber on the \nedge if a cliff*\u201d \n\u201c *Boy superman flying \nin the sky\u201d\n\u201c *Two persons \nshouting for help with \nhands in air\u201d\nPainting of *\u2026 \n\u201cPainting of a rock climber at the \nedge of a cliff on the left, a boy \nsuperman flying in the sky on \ntop, and two persons shouting for \nhelp with hands in the air at the \nbottom\u201d \n\u201cA house in spring\u201d\n\u201cA house in summer\u201d\n\u201cA house in autumn\u201d\n\u201cA house in winter\u201d\n\u201cTop left, house in spring, \ntop right house in summers, bottom \nleft house in autumn, and bottom \nright house in winters\u201d\nA1\nB1\nA2\nB2\nInput:\nLineart Controls + \nText conditioned Segments\nInput: Openpose Control + Text \nInput: Lineart Control + Text\nInput:\nOpenpose Controls + \nText conditioned Segments\nFigure 5. Control+Text conditioned composite generations: For the two cases shown in the figure, getting correct compositions\nis extremely difficult with text-to-image models or even (text+control)-to-image models (For example, in A1 the image\nelements don\u2019t cohere, and in A2 the fours seasons do not show in the output image). Composite Diffusion with scaffolding\ncontrol conditions can effectively influence sub-scene generations and create the desired overall composite images(B1, B2).\n7\nWe repeat this generative process for successive time\nsteps till the time step t = \u03ba. The choice of scaffolding\nimage can be arbitrary. Although convenient, we do not\nrestrict keeping the same scaffolding image for every\nsegment.\n3.2.3\nSegment generation with a scaffolding\ncontrol\nThis case is applicable where the base generative model\nsupports conditioning controls, and, besides the text-\nconditioning, additional control inputs are available for\nthe segment. In this method, we do away with the need\nfor a scaffolding image. Instead of a scaffolding image,\nan artist provides a scaffolding control input for the\nsegment. The control conditioning input can be a line\nart, an open pose model, a scribble, a canny image, or\nany other supported control input that can guide image\ngeneration in a generative diffusion process.\nAlgorithmically, we proceed as follows: (i) We use\na control input specifically tailored to the segment\u2019s\ndimensions, or we apply the segment mask m to\nthe control condition input ci to restrict the control\ncondition only to the segment where we want generation,\n(ii) The image latent xt is directly denoised through a\nsuitable control-denoiser along with conditioning inputs\nof natural text and control inputs for the particular\nsegment. We then repeat the process for all segments\nand for all the timesteps till t = \u03ba. Refer to Algo.1,\n12-17, and Fig. 3, C.\nNote\nthat\nsince\neach\nsegment\nis\ndenoised\nindependently, the algorithm supports the use of\ndifferent specialized denoisers for different segments.\nFor example, refer to Fig. 1 where we use three distinct\ncontrol inputs, viz., scribble, lineart, and openpose.\nCombining control conditions into Composite Diffusion\nenables capabilities more powerful than both - the\ntext-to-image diffusion models [39] and the control-\nconditioned models [50]. Fig. 5 refers to two example\ncases where we accomplish image generation tasks that\nare not feasible through either of these two models.\nAt the end of the scaffolding stage, we construct\nan intermediate composite image by composing from\nthe segment-specific latents. For each segment specific\nlatent, we retain the region corresponding to the\nsegment masks and discard the complementary region\n(Refer to Fig. 3 and Algo. 1, 20-21). The essence of\nthe scaffolding stage is that each segment develops\nindependently and has no influence on the development\nof the other segments. We next proceed to the\n\u2018harmonization\u2019 stage, where the intermediate composite\nserves as the starting point for further diffusion steps.\nControl+Text\nConditioned \nDenoiser\n\u201cevening sky\u201d\n\u201cpalace building\u201d\n\u201clily pond\u201d\nControl+Text\nConditioned \nDenoiser\nControl+Text\nConditioned \nDenoiser\n(A)\n(B)\n1\n3\n2\nSub-scene\nLayout\n\u201cbeautiful evening sky\u201d\n\u201cbeautiful palace building\n\u201cbeautiful lily pond\u201d\n\u201cevening sky\u201d\n\u201cpalace building\u201d\n\u201clily pond\u201d\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\nText\nConditioned \nDenoiser\nText\nConditioned \nDenoiser\nText\nConditioned \nDenoiser\n\u201ca beautiful palace with lake in\nthe foreground and beautiful sky\nin the background\u201d\nText\nConditioned \nDenoiser\nx't-1\nx't-2\nControl \nImages \nx't-2\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\nx't-2\nx't-1\nx't-1\n(C)\nFigure 6. Harmonization stage step for three different cases:\n(A) a single global text description, (B) sub-scene specific\ntext description, and (C) sub-scene specific text description\nand control condition. Please note that for all the cases, the\nharmonization stage starts with the output of the scaffolding\nstage composite latent. For case (A), there is no composition\nstep, while for cases (B) and (C), the composition step\nfollows the denoising steps for every timestep.\n3.3. Harmonizing stage\nThe above method, if applied to all diffusion steps,\ncan produce good composite images. However, because\nthe segments are being constructed independently,\nthe composite tends to be less harmonized and less\nwell-blended at the segment edges. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce a new succeeding stage called\n8\nAlgorithm 2: Composite Diffusion: Harmonization\nStage.

The essential difference from\nthe preceding scaffolding stage is that in this stage each\nsegment develops in the context of the other segments.\nWe also drop any help through scaffolding images in\nthis stage.\nWe can further develop the intermediate composite\nfrom the previous stage in the following ways: (i) by\ndirect denoising the composite image latent via a global\nprompt (Algo. 2, 2-3, and Fig. 6, A), or (ii) by denoising\nthe intermediate composite latent separately with each\nsegment specific conditioning and then composing the\ndenoised segment-specific latents. The segment-specific\nconditions can be either pure natural text descriptions\nor may include additional control conditions (Refer to\nAlgo. 2, 4-8 and 9-13, and Fig. 6, B and C).\nWhile using global prompts, the output of each\ndiffusion step is a single latent and we do not need any\ncompositional step. For harmonization using segment-\nspecific conditions, the compositional step of merging\ndifferent segment latents at every time step (Algo. 2,\n8 and 13) ensures that the context of all the segments\nis available for the next diffusion step. This leads to\nbetter blending and harmony among segments after each\ndenoising iteration. Our observation is that both these\nmethods lead to a natural coherence and convergence\namong the segments of the composite image (Fig. 8\nprovides an example illustration).\n3.4. Scaffolding factor \u03ba:\nWe define a parameter called the scaffolding factor,\ndenoted by \u03ba (kappa), whose value determines the\npercentage of the diffusion process that we assign to\n2\n4\n1\n3\n3.medieval priest with robes\n4.stone with engravings\nProgressively increasing \nvalues of scaffolding factor \u03ba\n1.skull with light inside\n2.scary dark cave\nFigure 7. Effect of scaffolding factor on Artworks. For the\ngiven inputs and generations from top to bottom: At the\nlower extreme, \u03ba = 0, we get an image that merges the\nconcepts of text descriptions for different segments. At the\nhigher end, \u03ba = 80, we get a collage-like effect. In the middle,\n\u03ba = 40, we hit a sweet spot for a well-blended image suitable\nfor a story illustration.\nthe scaffolding stage. \u03ba = number of scaffolding steps\ntotal diffusion steps\n\u00d7 100.\nThe number of harmonization steps is calculated as\ntotal diffusion steps minus the scaffolding steps. If we\nincrease the \u03ba value, we allow the segments to develop\nindependently longer. This gives better conformance\nwith the segment boundaries while reducing the\nblending and harmony of the composite image. If we\ndecrease the \u03ba value, the individual segments may show\na weaker anchoring of the image and lesser conformance\nto the mask boundaries. However, we see increased\nharmony and blending among the segments.\nOur experience has shown that the appropriate value\nof \u03ba depends upon the domain and the creative needs\nof an artist. Typically, we find that values of kappa\naround 20-50 are sufficient to anchor an image in the\nsegments. Figure 7 illustrates the impact of \u03ba on image\ngeneration that gives artists an interesting creative\ncontrol on segment blending. Appendix Table 5 provides\na quantitative evaluation of the impact of the scaffolding\nfactor on the various parameters of image quality.\n9\n\u0138=0\nclear blue sky \ncity skyline with lot \nof skyscrapers \ndark blue sea \ncity skyline with lot of \nskyscrapers  besides dark \nblue sea under clear blue sky\nGlobal Prompt\nSegment Prompts\nGlobal Prompt\nSegment Prompts\n\u0138=20\n\u0138=100\n\u0138=80\n\u0138=60\n\u0138=40\nFigure 8. A visual comparison of the generations using segment-specific prompts and global prompts for the Harmonization\nstage. Harmony: Our results show that both achieve comparable harmony with global prompts having a slight edge. Detailing:\nFor detailing within a segment, the segment-specific prompts provide a slight edge. Since both these methods apply only to\nthe harmonization stage, for lower scaffolding values (e.g. \u03ba = 0, 20), the outputs vary noticeably, while at the higher values,\nsince the number of steps for diffusion is reduced, the outputs are very close to each other.\n10\n4. Quality criteria and evaluation\nAs stated earlier, one of the objectives of this\nresearch is to ask the question: Is the quality of the\ncomposite greater than or equal to the sum total of the\nquality of the individual segments? In other words, the\nindividual segments in the composite should not appear\nunconnected but should work together as a whole in\nmeeting the artist\u2019s intent and quality goals.\nIn this section, we lay out the quality criteria, and\nevaluation approach and discuss the results of our\nimplementations.\n4.1. Quality criteria\nWe find that the present methods of evaluating\nthe image quality of a generated image are not\nsufficient for our purposes. For example, methods\nsuch as FID, Inception Score, Precision, and Recall\n[9,20, 43,44] are traditionally used for measuring the\nquality and diversity of generated images, but only\nwith respect to a large set of reference images. Further,\nthey do not evaluate some key properties of concern\nto us such as conformity of the generated images\nto the provided inputs, the harmonization achieved\nwhen forming images from sub-scenes, and the overall\naesthetic and technical quality of the generated images.\nThese properties are key to holistically evaluating the\nComposite Diffusion approach. To this end, we propose\nthe following set of quality criteria:\n1. CF: Content Fidelity: The purpose of the text\nprompts is to provide a natural language description\nof what needs to be generated in a particular region of\nthe image. The purpose of the control conditions is to\nspecify objects or visual elements within a sub-scene.\nThis parameter measures how well the generated image\nrepresents the textual prompts (or control conditions)\nused to describe the sub-scene.\n2. SF: Spatial Layout Fidelity: The purpose of the\nspatial layout is to provide spatial location guidance to\nvarious elements of the image. This parameter measures\nhow well the parts of the generated image conform to\nthe boundaries of specified segments or sub-scenes.\n3. BH: Blending and Harmony: When we compose\nan image out of its parts, it is important that the\ndifferent regions blend together well and we do not\nget abrupt transitions between any two regions. Also,\nit is important that the image as a whole appears\nharmonious, i.e., the contents, textures, colors, etc. of\ndifferent regions form a unified whole. This parameter\nmeasures the smoothness of the transitions between the\nboundaries of the segments, and the harmony among\ndifferent segments of the image.\n4. QT: Technical Quality: The presence of noise\nand unwanted artifacts that can appear in the image\ngenerations can be distracting and may reduce the\nvisual quality of the generated image. This parameter\nmeasures how clean the image is from the unwanted\nnoise, color degradation, and other unpleasant artifacts\nlike lines, patches, and ghosting appearing on the mask\nboundaries or other regions of the image.\n5. QA: Aesthetics Quality: Aesthetics refers to the\nvisual appeal of an image. Though subjective in nature,\nthis property plays a great part in the acceptability\nor consumption of the image by the viewers or the\nusers. This parameter measures the visual appeal of the\ngenerated image to the viewer.\n4.2. Evaluation approach\nIn this section, we provide details about our\nevaluation approach. We first provide information on\nthe baselines used for comparison and then information\non the methods used for evaluation such as user studies,\nautomated evaluations, and artist\u2019s consultation and\nfeedback.\nWe deploy the following two baselines for comparison\nwith our methods:\n\u2022 Baseline 1 (B1) - Text to Image: This is the base\ndiffusion model that takes only text prompts as\nthe input. Since this input is unimodal, the spatial\ninformation is provided solely through natural\nlanguage descriptions.\n\u2022 Baseline 2 (B2) - Serial Inpainting: As indicated\nin the section 2.3, we should be able to achieve\na\ncomposite\ngeneration\nby\nserially\napplying\ninpainting to an appropriate background image\nand generating one segment at a time.\nA sample of images from different algorithms is shown\nin Figure 9. We have implemented our algorithms using\nStable Diffusion 1.5 [39]as our base diffusion model,\nand Controlnets 1.1 [50] as our base for implementing\ncontrols. The implementation details for our algorithms\nand two baselines are available in Appendix C, D, & E.\nWe measure the performance of our approach against\nthe two baselines using the above-mentioned quality\ncriteria. Specifically, we perform four different kinds of\nevaluations:\n(i) Human evaluations: We created a survey where\nusers were shown the input segment layout and textual\ndescriptions and the corresponding generated image.\nThe users were then asked to rate the image on a scale of\n1 to 5 for the five different quality criteria. We utilized\nsocial outreach and Amazon MTurk to conduct the\nsurveys and used two different sets of participants: (i)\na set of General Population (GP) comprised of people\nfrom diverse backgrounds, and (ii) a set of Artists\n11\nbright cloudy skies\nold castle\nhill\nwall with colorful flowers\na swimming pool\na red \nbasketball\na tinted glass windows\na vase with beautiful \nflowers\ncolorful \ntable top\nText to Image\nSerial Inpainting\nOur Composite Diffusion\nFigure 9. A comparison of composite images generated\nthrough text-2-image, serial-inpainting, and Composite\nDiffusion methods.\nand Designers (AD) comprised of people with specific\nbackground and skills in art and design field.\nWe found the current methods of automated metrics\n[9, 20, 43, 44] inadequate for evaluating the particular\nquality requirements of Composite Diffusion. Hence,\nwe consider and improvise a few automated methods\nthat can give us the closest measure of these qualities.\nWe adopt CLIP-based similarity [36] to measure\ncontent(text) fidelity and spatial layout fidelity. We use\nGaussian noise as an indicator of technical degradation\nin generation and estimate it [11] to measure the\ntechnical quality of the generated image. For aesthetic\nquality evaluation, we use a CLIP-based aesthetic\nscoring model [24] that was trained on - a dataset\nof 4000 AI-generated images and their corresponding\nhuman-annotated aesthetic scores. ImageReward [48] is\na text-image human preference reward model trained\non human preference ranking of over 100,000 images;\nwe utilize this model to estimate human preference for\na comparison set of generated images.\nAdditionally, we also do (iii) a qualitative visual\ncomparison of images (e.g., Figures 2, and 9), and (iv)\nan informal validation by consulting with an artist. We\nrefer readers to Appendix F, G, and H for more details\non the human and automated evaluation methods.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nAesthetic Quality\nTechnical Quality\nBlending and Harmony\nSpatial Layout Fidelity\nContent Fidelity\nHuman Survey - General Population\nB1 - Text-to-Image\nB2 - Serial Inpainting\nOurs - Composite Diffusion\nFigure 10.

Results and discussion\nIn this section, we summarize the results from the\ndifferent types of evaluations and provide our analysis\nfor each quality criterion.\n4.3.1\nContent Fidelity\nIn both types of human evaluations, GP and AD,\nComposite Diffusion(CD) scores are higher than the two\nbaselines. Composite Diffusion also gets a higher score\nfor content fidelity on automated evaluation methods.\nOur take: This can be attributed to the rich\ntextual descriptions used for describing each image\nsegment, resulting in an overall increase in semantic\ninformation and control in the generation process. One\ncan argue that similar rich textual descriptions are\nalso available for the serial inpainting method (B2).\nHowever, B2 might get several limitations: (i) There\nis a dependency on the initial background image that\nmassively influences the inpainting process, (ii) There\nis a sequential generation of the segments, which would\nmean that the segments that are generated earlier are\nnot aware of the full context of the image.

All three\ntypes of evaluation methods - Human evaluation GP\nand AD, and automated methods - reveal a superior\nperformance of Composite Diffusion.\nOur take:This is on expected lines. Text-to-Image\n(B1) provides no explicit control over the spatial\nlayout apart from using natural language to describe\nthe relative position of objects in a scene. B2 could\nhave spatial fidelity better than B1 and equivalent to\nComposite Diffusion. It does show an improvement over\nB1 in human evaluation-AD and automated methods.\nIts lower spacial conformance compared to Composite\nDiffusion can be attributed to the same reasons that\nwe discussed in the previous section.\n4.3.3\nBlending and Harmony\nHuman-GP evaluation rates our method as the best,\nwhile Human-AD evaluation and automated methods\ngive an edge to the serial inpainting method.\nOur take: Text-to-Image (B1) generates one holistic\nimage, and we expect it to produce a well-harmonized\nimage. This higher rating for the serial-inpainting\nmethod could be due to the particular implementation\nof inpainting that we use in our project. This inpainting\nimplementation (RunwayML SD 1.5 [39])is especially\nfine-tuned to provide seamless filling of a masked region\nby direct inference similar to text-to-image generation.\nFurther, in Composite Diffusion, the blending and\nharmonization are affected by the chosen scaffolding\nvalue, as shown in Appendix table 5.\n4.3.4\nTechnical Quality\nHuman evaluation-GP gives our method a better score,\nwhile Human evaluation-AP gives a slight edge to\nthe other methods. The automated evaluation method\nconsiders only one aspect of technical quality, viz., the\npresence of noise; our algorithm shows lesser noise\nartifacts.\nOur Take: Both serial-inpainting and Composite\nDiffusion build upon the base model B1. Any derivative\napproach risks losing the technical quality while\nattempting to introduce control. Hence, we expect\nthe best-performing methods to maintain the technical\nquality displayed by B1. However, repeated application\nof inpainting to cover all the segments in B2 may\namplify any noisy artifact introduced in the early\nstages. We also observed that for Composite Diffusion,\nif the segment masks do not have well-demarcated\nboundaries, we might get unwanted artifacts in the\ngenerated composites.\n4.3.5\nAesthetical Quality\nHuman evaluation-GP gives Composite Diffusion\nmethod a clear edge over baseline methods, while\nHuman evaluation-AP results show a comparable\nperformance. The automated evaluation methods rate\nour method higher than the serial inpainting and only\nmarginally higher than the text-to-image baseline.\nOur take: These results indicate that our approach\ndoes not cause any loss of aesthetic quality but may\neven enhance it. The good performance of Composite\nDiffusion in aesthetic evaluation can be due to the\nenhanced detail and nuance with both textual and\nspatial controls. The lack of global context of all\nthe segments in serial inpainting and the dependence\non an appropriate background image put it at a\nslight disadvantage. Aesthetics is a subjective criterion\nthat can be positively influenced by having more\nmeaningful generations and better placements of visual\nelements. Hence, combining segment layouts and\ncontent conditioning in Composite Diffusion may lead\nto compositions with more visually pleasing signals.\nWe further did a qualitative validation with an\nexternal artist. We requested the artist to specify\nher intent in the form of freehand drawings with\nlabeled descriptions. We manually converted the artist\u2019s\nintent to bimodal input of segment layout and textual\ndescriptions suitable for our model. We then created\nartwork through Composite Diffusion and asked the\nartist to evaluate them qualitatively. The feedback was\nlargely positive and encouraging. The artist\u2019s inputs,\nthe generated artwork, and the artist\u2019s feedback are\navailable in the Appendix section H.\nWe also present a qualitative visual comparison of\nour generated outputs with the baselines and other\nrelated approaches in Figures 9 and 2 respectively.\nSummarizing the results of multiple modes of evaluation,\n13\nwe can affirm that our Composite Diffusion methods\nperform holistically and well across all the different\nquality criteria.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced composite generation as\na method for generating an image by composing from its\nconstituent sub-scenes. The method vastly enhances the\ncapabilities of text-to-image models. It enables a new\nmode for the artists to create their art by specifying (i)\nspatial intent using free-form sub-scene layout, and (ii)\ncontent intent for the sub-scenes using natural language\ndescriptions and different forms of control conditions\nsuch as scribbles, line art, and human pose.\nTo provide artists with better affordances, we propose\nthat the spatial layout should be viewed as a coarse-\ngrained layout for sub-scenes rather than an outline\nof individual fine-grained objects. For a finer level of\ncontrol within a sub-scene, it is best to apply sub-scene-\nspecific control conditions. We strongly feel that this\narrangement is intuitive for artists and easy to use for\nnovices.\nWe implemented composite generation in the context\nof diffusion models and called it Composite Diffusion.\nWe showed that the model generates quality images\nwhile adhering to the spatial and semantic constraints\nimposed by the input modalities of free-form segments,\nnatural text, and other control conditions. Our methods\ndo not require any retraining of models or change in\nthe core architecture of the pre-trained models. Further,\nthey work seamlessly with any fine-tuning of the base\ngenerative model.\nWe\nrecommend\nmodularizing\nthe\nprocess\nof\ncomposite\ndiffusion\ninto\ntwo\nstages:\nscaffolding\nand harmonizing. With this separation of concerns,\nresearchers can independently develop and improve the\nrespective stages in the future. We observe that diffusion\nprocesses are inherently harmonizing in nature and we\ncan achieve a more natural blending and harmonization\nof an image by exploiting this property than through\nother external means.\nWe also highlighted the need for better quality\ncriteria for generative image generations. We devised\none such quality criteria suitable for evaluating the\nresults of Composite Diffusion in this paper. To\nevaluate using these criteria, we conducted both human\nevaluations and automated evaluations. Although the\nautomated evaluation methods for Composite Diffusion\nare limited in their scope and are in an early stage\nof development, we nevertheless found an interesting\npositive correlation between human evaluations and\nautomated evaluations.\nWe\nmake\nan\nessential\nobservation\nabout\nbenchmarking:\nThe\nstrength\nof\nthe\nbase\nmodel\nheavily influences the quality of generated composite.\nBase model strength, in turn, depends upon the\nparameter strength, architecture, and quality of the\ntraining data of the base model. Hence, any evaluation\nof the quality of generated composite images should\nbe in relation to the base model image quality. For\nexample, in this paper, we use Stable Diffusion v1.5\nas the standard base for all types of generations, viz.,\ntext-to-image, repeated inpainting, and composite\ndiffusion generations.\nFinally, we demonstrated that our approach achieves\ngreater spatial, semantic, and creative control in\ncomparison to the baselines and other approaches.\nThis gives us confidence that with careful application,\nthe holistic quality of an image generated through\nComposite Diffusion would indeed be greater than or\nequal to (>=) the sum of the quality of its constituent\nparts.\n5.1. Future work\nWe discuss some of the interesting future research\nproblems and possibilities related to this work.\nWe implemented Composite Diffusion in the context\nof Stable Diffusion [39]. It would instructive to explore\nthe application of Composite Diffusion in the context\nof different architectures like Dalle-E [37], Imagen [42],\nor other open sources models such as Deep Flyod [16].\nSince the definition of Composite Generation (with\ninput modality as defined in this paper) is generic, it\ncan also be applied to other generative models, such as\nGANs or any future visual generative models.\nIn this work, we have experimented with only two\nsampling methods - DDPM [21] and DDIM [46]; all\nthe generations in this paper use DDIM. It would be\ninteresting to study the impact of different sampling\nmethods, such as Euler, DPM, LMS, etc. [1,28], on the\nComposite Diffusion.\nFor evaluation purposes, we faced the challenge of\na relevant dataset for Composite Diffusion. There are\nno ready data sets that provide free-form sub-scene\nlayout along with the natural-language descriptions of\nthose sub-scenes. We handcrafted a 100-image data set\nof sub-scene layouts and associated sub-scene captions.\nThe input dataset and the associated generated images\nhelped us benchmark and evaluate different composite\ngeneration methods. By doing multiple generations for\neach set of inputs, we can effectively enhance the size\nof the data set for evaluation. We strongly feel that\nthis dataset should be augmented further for size and\ndiversity - through community help or automatic means.\nA larger data set, curated on the above lines, will be\nextremely useful for benchmarking and future work.\n14\nReferences\n[1] Andrew.

Background for methods\nIn this section, we provide an overview of diffusion-\nbased\ngenerative\nmodels\nand\ndiffusion\nguidance\nmechanisms that serve as the foundational blocks of\nthe methods in this paper. The reader is referred to\n[14, 21, 47] for any further details and mathematical\nderivations.\nB.1. Diffusion models(DM)\nIn the context of image generation, DMs are a type\nof generative model with two diffusion processes: (i) a\nforward diffusion process, where we define a Markov\nchain by gradually adding a small amount of random\nnoise to the image at each time step, and (ii)a reverse\ndiffusion process, where the model learns to generate\nthe desired image, starting from a random noise sample.\nB.1.1\nForward diffusion process\nGiven a real distribution q(x), we sample an image x0\nfrom it (x0 \u223c q(x)). We gradually add Gaussian noise\nto it with a variance schedule {\u03b2t \u2208 (0, 1)}T\nt=1 over T\nsteps to get progressively noisier versions of the image\nx1, . . . , xT . The conditional distribution at each time\nstep t with respect to its previous timestep t\u22121 is given\nby the diffusion kernel:\nq(x1:T ) = q(x0)\nT\nY\nt=1\nq(xt|xt\u22121)\n(1)\nThe features in x0 are gradually lost as step t\nbecomes larger. When T is sufficiently large, T \u2192\n\u221e, then xT\napproximates an isotropic Gaussian\ndistribution.\nQ-sampling: An interesting property of the forward\ndiffusion process is that we can also sample xt directly\nfrom x0 in the closed form. If we let \u03b1t = 1 \u2212 \u03b2t,\n\u00af\u03b1t = Qt\ns=1 \u03b1s, we get:\nq(xt|x0) = N(xt; \u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0, (1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t)I)\n(2)\nFurther, for \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I), xt can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of x0 and \u03f5:\nxt = \u221a\u00af\u03b1tx0 + \u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5\n(3)\nWe utilize this property in many of our algorithms\nand refer to it as: \u2018q-sampling\u2019.\nB.1.2\nReverse diffusion process\nHere we reverse the Markovian process and, instead,\nwe sample from q(xt\u22121|xt). By repeating this process,\nwe should be able to recreate the true sample (image),\nstarting from the pure noise xT \u223c N(0, I). If \u03b2t is\nsufficiently small, q(xt\u22121|xt) too will be an isotropic\nGaussian distribution. However, it is not straightforward\nto estimate q(xt\u22121|xt) in closed form. We, therefore,\ntrain a model p\u03b8 to approximate the conditional\nprobabilities that are required to run the reverse\ndiffusion process.\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt) = N(xt\u22121; \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t), \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t))\n(4)\nwhere \u00b5\u03b8 and \u03a3\u03b8 are the predicted mean and variance\nof the conditional Gaussian distribution. In the earlier\nimplementations \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t) was kept constant [21], but\nlater it was shown that it is preferable to learn it through\na neural network that interpolates between the upper\nand lower bounds for the fixed covariance [13].\n17\nThe reverse distribution is:\np\u03b8(x0:T ) = p(xT )\nT\nY\nt=1\np\u03b8(xt\u22121|xt)\n(5)\nInstead\nof\ndirectly\ninferring\nthe\nimage\nthrough\n\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t)), it might be more convenient to predict the\nnoise (\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)) added to the initial noisy sample ( xt) to\nobtain the denoised sample (xt\u22121) [21]. Then, \u00b5\u03b8(xt, t)\ncan be derived as follows:\n\u00b5\u03b8(xt, t) =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0010\nxt \u2212\n\u03b2t\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\n\u0011\n(6)\nSampling: Mostly, a U-Net neural architecture [40]\nis used to predict the denoising amount at each step. A\nscheduler samples the output from this model. Together\nwith the knowledge of time step t, and the input\nnoisy sample xt, it generates a denoised sample xt.\nFor sampling through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic\nModel (DDPM) [21], denoised sample is obtained\nthrough the following computation:\nxt\u22121 =\n1\n\u221a\u03b1t\n\u0010\nxt \u2212\n\u03b2t\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\n\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\n\u0011\n+ \u03c3t\u03f5\n(7)\nwhere \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t) = \u03c32\nt I , and \u03f5 \u223c N(0, I) is a random\nsample from the standard Gaussian distribution.\nTo achieve optimal results for image quality and\nspeed-ups, besides DDPM, various sampling methods,\nsuch as DDIM, LDMS, PNDM, and LMSD [1,28] can\nbe employed.\nWe use DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models)\nas the common method of sampling for all the\nalgorithms discussed in this paper. Using DDIM, we\nsample xt\u22121 from xt and x0 via the following equation\n[46]:\nxt\u22121 =\np\n\u00af\u03b1t\u22121x0 +\nq\n1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u22121 \u2212 \u03c32\nt \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t) + \u03c3t\u03f5 (8)\nUsing DDIM sampling, we can produce samples that\nare comparable to DDPM samples in image quality,\nwhile using only a small subset of DDPM timesteps\n(e.g., 50 as opposed to 1000).\nB.1.3\nLatent diffusion models(LDM)\nWe can further increase the efficiency of the generative\nprocess by running the diffusion process in latent\nspace that is lower-dimensional than but perceptually\nequivalent to pixel space. Performing diffusion in lower\ndimensional space provides massive advantages in terms\nof reduced computational complexity. For this, we first\ndownsample the images into a lower-dimensional latent\nspace and then upsample the results from the diffusion\nprocess into the pixel space. For example, the latent\ndiffusion model described in [39] uses a suitably trained\nvariational autoencoder to encode an RGB pixel-space\nimage (x \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d73) into a latent-space representation\n(z = E(x), z \u2208 Rh\u00d7w\u00d7c ), where f = H/h = W/w\ndescribes the downsampling factor. The diffusion model\nin the latent space operates similarly to the pixel-\nspace diffusion model described in the previous sections,\nexcept that it utilizes a latent space time-conditioned\nU-Net architecture. The output of the diffusion process\n(\u02dcz) is decoded back to the pixel-space (\u02dcx = D(\u02dcz)).\nB.2. Diffusion guidance\nAn unconditional diffusion model, with mean \u00b5\u03b8(xt)\nand variance \u03a3\u03b8(xt) usually predicts a score function\n\u2207xtlog p(xt) which additively perturbs it and pushes it\nin the direction of the gradient. In conditional models,\nwe try to model conditional distribution \u2207xtlog p(xt|y),\nwhere y can be any conditional input such as class\nlabel and free-text. This term, however, can be derived\nto be a combination of unconditional and conditional\nterms [14]:\n\u2207xtlog p(xt|y) = \u2207xtlog p(xt) + \u2207xtlog p(y|xt)\nB.2.1\nClassifier driven guidance\nWe can obtain log p(y|xt) from an external classifier\nthat can predict a target y from a high-dimension input\nlike an image x. A guidance scale s can further amplify\nthe conditioning guidance.\n\u2207xtlog ps(xt|y) = \u2207xtlog p(xt) + s.\u2207xtlog p(y|xt)\ns affects the quality and diversity of samples.\nB.2.2\nCLIP driven guidance\nContrastive Language\u2013Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a\nneural network that can learn visual concepts from\nnatural language supervision [36]. The pre-trained\nencoders from the CLIP model can be used to obtain\nsemantic image and text embeddings which can be used\nto score how closely an image and a text prompt are\nsemantically related.\nSimilar to a classifier, we can use the gradient of\nthe dot product of the image and caption encodings (\nf(xt) and g(c)) with respect to the image to guide the\ndiffusion process [18,30,34].\n\u02c6\u00b5\u03b8(xt|c) = \u00b5\u03b8(xt|c) + s \u00b7 \u03a3\u03b8(xt|c)\u2207xt(f(xt) \u00b7 g(c))\n18\nTo perform a simple classifier-guided diffusion,\nDhariwal and Nichol [13] use a classifier that is pre-\ntrained on noisy images to guide the image generation.\nHowever, training a CLIP model from scratch on noisy\nimages may not be always feasible or practical. To\nmitigate this problem we can estimate a clean image \u02c6x0\nfrom a noisy latent xt by using the following equation.\n\u02c6x0 =\nxt\n\u221a\u00af\u03b1t\n\u2212\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u00af\u03b1t\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\n\u221a\u00af\u03b1t\n(9)\nWe can then use this projected clean image \u02c6x0 at each\nstate of diffusion step t for comparing with the target\ntext. Now, a CLIP-based loss LCLIP may be defined as\nthe cosine distance (or some similar distance measure)\nbetween the CLIP embedding of the text prompt (d)\nand the embedding of the estimated clean image \u02c6x0:\nLCLIP (x, d) = Dc(CLIPimg(\u02c6x0), CLIPtxt(d))\nB.2.3\nClassifier-free guidance\nClassifier-guided mechanisms face a few challenges,\nsuch as: (i) may not be robust enough in dealing with\nnoised samples in the diffusion process,(ii) not all the\ninformation in x is relevant for predicting y, which\nmay cause adversarial guidance, (iii) do not work well\nfor predicting complex y like \u2018text\u2019. The classifier-free\nguidance [22] helps overcome this and also utilizes\nthe knowledge gained by a pure generative model. A\nconditional generative model is trained to act as both\nconditional and unconditional (by dropping out the\nconditional signal by 10-20% during the training phase).\nThe above equation (section 3.3.1) can be reinterpreted\nas [14,30]:\n\u2207xtlog ps(xt|y) = \u2207xtlog p(xt)\n+ s.(\u2207xtlog p(xt|y) \u2212 \u2207xtlog p(xt))\n(10)\nFor s = 0, we get an unconditional model, for\ns = 1, we get a conditional model, and for s > 1 we\nstrengthen the conditioning signal. The above equation\ncan be expressed in terms of noise estimates at diffusion\ntimestep t, as follows:\n\u02c6\u03f5\u03b8(xt|c) = \u03f5\u03b8(xt|\u2205) + s \u00b7 (\u03f5\u03b8(xt|c) \u2212 \u03f5\u03b8(xt|\u2205))\n(11)\nwhere c is the text caption representing the\nconditional input, and \u2205 is an empty sequence or a\nnull set representing unconditional output. Our DDIM\nsampling for conditioned models will utilize these\nestimates.\n19\n1\n2\n3\n\u201cbeautiful \nevening sky\u201d \n\u201cbeautiful \npalace building\u201d\n\u201cbeautiful \nlily pond\u201d\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 12. Running Example: Free-form segment layout and\nnatural text input\nC. Our experimental setup\nAs stated earlier, in this work, we aim to generate a\ncomposite image guided entirely by free-form segments\nand corresponding natural textual prompts (with\noptional additional control conditions). In this section,\nwe summarize our choice of base setup, provide a\nrunning example to help explain the working of different\nalgorithms, and provide implementation details of the\nbase setup.\nC.1. Running example\nTo explain the different algorithms, we will use\na common running example. The artist\u2019s input is\nprimarily bimodal: free-form segment layout and\ncorresponding natural language descriptions as shown in\nFigure 12. As a first step common to all the algorithms,\nthe segment layout is converted to segment masks as one-\nhot encoding vectors where \u20180\u2019 represents the absence\nof pixel information, and \u20181\u2019 indicates the presence\nof image pixels. To standardize the outputs of the\ngenerative process, all the initial inputs (noise samples,\nsegment layouts, masks, reference, and background\nimages) and the generated images in this paper are\nof 512x512 pixel dimensions. Additionally, in the case of\nlatent diffusion setup, we downsize the masks, encode\nthe reference images, and sample the noise into 64x64\npixels corresponding to the latent space dimensions of\nthe model.\nC.2. Implementation details\nWe choose open-domain diffusion model architecture,\nnamely\nStable\nDiffusion\n[39],\nto\nserve\nas\nbase\narchitectures for our composite diffusion methods. Table\n2 provides a summary of the features of the base setup.\nThe diffusion model has a U-Net backbone with a cross-\nattention mechanism, trained to support conditional\ndiffusion. We use the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion\nmodel (Version 1.5) that is developed by researchers\nand engineers from CompVis, Stability AI, RunwayML,\nand LAION and is trained on 512x512 images from a\nsubset of the LAION-5B dataset. A frozen CLIP ViT-\nL/14 text encoder is used to condition the model on\ntext prompts. For scheduling the diffusion steps and\nsampling the outputs, we use DDIM [46].\nTable 2.

Text-to-Image generation in the base setup\nIn this setup (refer to Figure 13), a pixel-level image\n(x) is first encoded into a lower-dimensional latent-\nspace representation with the help of a variational\nautoencoder(VAE) (E(x) \u2192 z). The diffusion process\nthen operates in this latent space. This setup uses a\nconditional1 diffusion model which is pre-trained on\nnatural text using CLIP encoding. For a generation, the\nmodel takes CLIP encoding of the natural text (C(d) \u2192\ndCLIP ) as the conditioning input and directly infers\na denoised sample zt without the help of an external\nclassifier (classifier free guidance) [22]. Mathematically,\nwe use equation 11 for generating the additive noise \u02c6\u03f5\u03b8 at\ntimestep t, and use equation 8 for generating zt from \u02c6\u03f5\u03b8\n1In practice, the model is trained to act as a both conditional\nand unconditional model. An empty text prompt is used for\nunconditional generation along with the input text prompt for\nconditional generation. The two results are then combined to\ngenerate a better quality denoised image.

After the diffusion process is over,\nthe resultant latent z0 is decoded back to pixel-space\n(D(z0) \u2192 x0).\nAs stated earlier, spatial information cannot be\nadequately described through only text conditioning.\nIn the next section, we extend the existing in-painting\nmethods to support Composite Diffusion. However, we\nshall see that these methods do not fully satisfy our\nquality desiderata which leads us to the development\nof our approach for Composite Diffusion as described\nin the main paper.\nD. Composite Diffusion through serial\ninpainting\nInpainting is the means of filling in missing portions\nor restoring the damaged parts of an image. It has been\ntraditionally used to restore damaged photographs and\npaintings and (or) to edit and replace certain parts\nor objects in digital images [8]. Diffusion models have\nbeen quite effective in inpainting tasks. A portion of\nthe image, that needs to be edited, is marked out with\nthe help of a mask, and then the content of the masked\nportion is generated through a diffusion model - in the\ncontext of the rest of the image, and sometimes with\nthe additional help of a text prompt [3,5,27].\nAn obvious question is: Can we serially (or repeatedly\n) apply inpainting to achieve Composite Diffusion? In\nthe following section, we develop our implementation\nfor serial inpainting and discuss issues that arise with\nrespect to Composite Diffusion achieved through these\nmeans. The implementation also serves as the baseline\nfor comparing our main Composite Diffusion algorithms\n(Algo. 1 and Algo. 2).\nD.1.\nSerial\nInpainting\n-\nalgorithm\nand\nimplementation\nThe\nmethod\nessentially\ninvolves\nsuccessive\napplication of the in-painting method for each segment\nof the layout. We start with an initial background\nimage (Ibg) and repeatedly apply the in-painting\nprocess to generate segments specified in the free-form\nsegment layout and text descriptions (refer to Algo. 4\nDenoiser\n\u201cbeautiful evening sky\u201d\nxt\nx0\nxT\nbg0\n\u229a\nDenoiser\nxT\nbg1\n\u229a\nx0\nxt\nDenoiser\nxT\nbg2\n\u229a\nx0\nxt\n\u201cbeautiful lily pond\u201d\n\u201cbeautiful palace building\u201d\n1-m1\n1-m3\n1-m2\nm1\nm2\nm3\nStarting\nBackground\nImage \nFully\nNoised\nLatent\nIntermediate\nBackground\nImage -1 \nIntermediate\nBackground\nImage -2 \nFinal Composite\nPartial \nComposite -1\nPartial \nComposite -2\nFully\nNoised\nLatent\nFully\nNoised\nLatent\nFigure 14.

The new image x0\nserves as the background image for the next stage inpainting\nprocess to generate the new x0 with the inpainted second\nsegment. The process is repeated till we have inpainted all\nthe segments. The final x0 is the generated composite.\n21\n2\n4\n1\n3\n1. man with a hat\n2. woman with a scarf\n3. boy with baseball cap\n4. girl with colorful hairband\n(A)\n(B)\nwall with colorful flowers\na swimming pool\na red basketball\nSub-scene layout\nBackground image\nFigure 15. Some of the issues in serial-inpainting: (A) The background image plays a dominant part in the composition, and\nsometimes the prompt specifications are missed if the segment text-prompt does not fit well into the background image\ncontext, e.g., missing red basketball in the swimming pool, (B) The earlier stages of serial-inpainting influence the later\nstages; in this case, the initial background image is monochrome black, the first segment is correctly generated but in the\nlater segment generations, the segment-specific text-prompts are missed and duplicates are created.\nfor details). The method is further explained in Fig. 14\nwith the help of the running example.\nAlgorithm\n4: Serial Inpainting for composite\ncreation\n1 Input: Set of segment masks mi \u2208 M, set of\nsegment descriptions di \u2208 D, background image\nIbg, initial image, xT \u223c N(0, I)\n2 Output: An output image, xcomp, which is\nsufficiently grounded to the inputs of segment\nlayout and segment descriptions.\n3 zT \u2190 E(xT ), ;\n\u25c1 Encode into latent space\n4 \u2200i, mi\nz \u2190 Downsample(mi) ; \u25c1 Downsample all masks\nto latent space\n5 \u2200i, di\nz \u2190 CCLIP (di) ; \u25c1 Generate CLIP encoding for all\ntext descriptions\n6 for all segments i from 1 to n do\n7\nzmasked\nbg\n\u2190 E(Ibg \u2299 (1 \u2212 mi)) ;\n\u25c1 Encode masked\nbackground image\n8\nzbg \u2190 Inpaint(zT , zmasked\nbg\n, mi\nz, di\nz); \u25c1 Inpaint the\nsegment\n9\nIbg \u2190 D(zbg) ;\n\u25c1 Decode the latent to get the new\nreference image\n10 end\n11 return xcomp \u2190 Ibg ;\n\u25c1 Final composite\nWe base our implementation upon the specialized\nin-painting method developed by RunwayML for Stable\nDiffusion [39]. This in-painting method extends the U-\nnet architecture described in the previous section to\ninclude additional input of a masked image. It has 5\nadditional input channels (4 for the encoded masked\nimage and 1 for the mask itself) and a checkpoint model\nwhich is fine-tuned for in-painting.\nD.2. Issues in Composite Diffusion via serial\ninpainting\nThe method is capable of building good composite\nimages. However, there are a few issues. One of the main\nissues with the serial inpainting methods for Composite\nDiffusion is the dependence on an initial background\nimage. Since this method is based on inpainting, the\nsegment formation cannot start from scratch. So a\nsuitable background image has to be either picked from\na collection or generated anew. If we generate it anew,\nthere is no guarantee that the segments will get the\nproper context for development. This calls for a careful\nselection from multiple generations. Also because a\nnew segment will be generated in the context of the\nunderlying image, this sometimes leads to undesirable\nconsequences. Further, if any noise artifacts or other\ntechnical aberrations get introduced in the early part of\nthe generation, their effect might get amplified in the\nrepeated inpainting process. Some other issues might\narise because of a specific inpainting implementation.\nFor example, in the method of inpainting that we used\n(RunwayML Inpainting 1.5), the mask text inputs were\noccasionally missed and sometimes the content of the\nsegments gets duplicated. Refer to Fig. 15 for visual\nexamples of some of these issues.\nAll these issues motivated the need to develop our\nmethods, as described in the main paper, to support\nComposite Diffusion. We compare our algorithms\nagainst these two baselines of (i) basic text-to-image\nalgorithms, and (ii) serial inpainting algorithms. The\nresults of these comparisons are presented in the main\npaper with some more details available in the later\nsections of this Appendix.\n22\nDenoiser\n\u201cevening sky\u201d\nScaffold\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nImage \nLatent\nxt\nx't-1\nQ-sample\n(noising to \u2018t\u2019)\n1-m1\n1-m3\n1-m2\n\u201cpalace building\u201d\n\u201clily pond\u201d\nm1\nm2\nm3\n\u201cevening sky\u201d\n\u201cpalace building\u201d\n\u201clily pond\u201d\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\nDenoiser\nDenoiser\nDenoiser\nDenoiser\nDenoiser\n\u229a\n\u229a\n\u229a\nm1\nm2\nm3\n(\ud835\udc1b)\n(\ud835\udc1a)\nx\u2019t-2\n1\n3\n2\nSegments\nFigure 16. Typical diffusion steps in the two-stage Composite Diffusion process using a scaffolding image: (a) During the\nscaffolding stage, each segment is generated in isolation using a separate diffusion process after composing with the noised\nscaffolding image. (b) During the harmonizing stage, the final composed latent from the scaffolding stage is iteratively\ndenoised using separate diffusion processes with segment-specific conditioning information; the segments are composed after\nevery diffusion timestep for harmonization.\nE. Our method: details and features\nIn the main paper, we presented a generic algorithm\nthat is applicable to any diffusion model that supports\nconditional\ngeneration\nwith\nclassifier-free\nimplicit\nguidance. Here, we present the implementation details\nand elaborate on a few downstream applications of\nComposite Diffusion.\nE.1. Implementation details of the main algorithm\nIn the previous Appendix section C, we detailed\nthe actual base model which we use as the example\nimplementation of Composite Diffusion. Since the base\nsetup operates in latent diffusion space, to implement\nour main Composite Diffusion algorithm in this setup,\nwe have to do two additional steps: (i) Prepare the\ninput for latent diffusion by decoding all the image\nlatents through a VAE to 64x64 latent pixel space, (ii)\nAfter the Composite Diffusion process (refer to Fig. 16\nfor the details of typical steps), use a VAE decoder to\ndecode the outputs of the latent diffusion model into the\n512x512 pixel space. Since the VAE encoding maintains\nthe spatial information, we either directly use a 64x64\npixel segment layout, or downsize the resulting masks\nto 64x64 pixel image space.\nAs mentioned in the main paper, for supporting\nadditional control conditions in Composite Diffusion, we\nuse the Stable Diffusion v1.5 compatible implementation\nof ControlNet [50]. ControlNet is implemented as a\nparallel U-Net whose weights are copied from the main\narchitecture, but which can be trained on particular\ncontrol conditions [50] such as canny edge, lineart,\nscribbles, semantic segmentations, and open poses.\nIn our implementation, for supporting control\nconditions in segments, we first prepare a control input\nfor every segment. The controls that we experimented\nwith included lineart, open-pose, and scribble. Each\nsegment has a separate control input that is designed\nto be formed in a 512x512 image space but only in the\nregion that is specific to that segment. Each control\ninput is then passed through an encoding processor\nthat creates a control condition that is embedded along\nwith the text conditioning. ControlNets convert image-\nbased conditions to 64 \u00d7 64 feature space to match the\nconvolution size: cf = E(ci) (refer to equation 9 of [50]),\nwhere ci is the image space condition, and cf is the\ncorresponding converted feature map.\nAnother important aspect is to use a ControlNet\nmodel that is particularly trained for the type of control\ninput specified for a segment. However, as shown in the\nmain paper and also illustrated in Fig. 1, more than\none type of ControlNets can be deployed for different\nsegments for achieving Composite Diffusion.\nE.2. Example runs\nWith reference to the running example shown in\nthe main paper, we present the different stages of the\nevolution of a composite image using Serial Inpainting\nand our Composite Diffusion algorithms. Refer to\nFigures 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.

The figures show every alternate DDIM step.\nE.3. Personalization at a scale\nOne\nof\nthe\nmotivations\nfor\ncomposite\nimage\ngeneration is to produce a controlled variety of outputs.\nThis is to enable customization and personalization at a\nscale. Our Composite Diffusion models help to achieve\nvariations through: (i) variation in the initial noise\nsample, (ii) variation in free-form segment layout, (iii)\nvariation through segment content, and (iv) variation\nthrough fine-tuned models.\nE.3.1\nVariation through Noise\nThis is applicable to all the generative diffusion\nmodels. The initial noise sample massively influences\nthe final generated image. This initial noise can be\nsupplied by a purely random sample of noise or by\nan appropriately noised (q-sampled) reference image.\nComposite Diffusion further allows us to keep these\ninitial noise variations particular to a segment. This\nmethod, however, only gives more variety but not any\ncontrol over the composite image generations.\nE.3.2\nVariation through segment layout\nWe can introduce controlled variation in the spatial\narrangement of elements or regions of an image\nby changing the segment layout while keeping the\nsegment descriptions constant. Refer to figure 17 for an\nillustration where we introduce two different layouts for\nany given set of segment descriptions.\nE.3.3\nVariation through text descriptions\nAlternatively, we can keep the segment layout constant,\nand change the description of the segments (through\ntext or control conditions) to bring controlled variation\nin the content of the segments. Refer to figure 17 for an\nillustration where each of the three columns represents\na different set of segment descriptions for any of the\nsegment layouts.\nE.3.4\nSpecialized fine-tuned models\nThe base diffusion models can be further fine-tuned\non specialized data sets to produce domain-specialized\nimage generations. For example, a number of fine-tuned\nimplementations of Stable Diffusion are available in the\n24\nDisney Classical\nBase Model \nComposite Generations \nDisney Modern\nElden Ring\nRed Shift\nMidjourney\nRobo\nArcane\nBalloon Art\nArcher\nLoving Vincent\nprincess with flowing golden hair\ncolorful sparkles in the night sky\nfantasy forest\nFine-tuned Model\nComposite Generations \nFigure 18.

This aspect can be extremely useful\nwhen creating artwork customized for different sets of\nconsumers. One of the advantages of our composite\nmethods is that as long as the fine-tuning does not\ndisturb the base-model architecture, our methods allow\na direct plug-and-play with the fine-tuned models.\nFigure 18 gives an illustration of using 10 different\npublic domain fine-tuned models with our main\nComposite Diffusion algorithm for generating specific-\nstyled artwork. The only code change required for\nachieving these results was the change of reference to the\nfine-tuned model and the addition of style specification\nin the text prompts.\nIn the following sections, we discuss some of the\nlimitations of our approach and provide a brief\ndiscussion on the possible societal impact of this work.\nE.4. Limitations\nThough our method is very flexible and effective in\na variety of domains and composition scenarios, we do\nencounter some limitations which we discuss below:\nGranularity of sub-scenes: The segment sizes in the\nsegment layout are limited by the diffusion image space.\nSo, as the size of the segment grows smaller, it becomes\ndifficult to support sub-scenes. Our experience has\nshown that it is best to restrict the segment layout to 2-\n5 sub-scenes. Some of this is due to the particular model\nthat we use in implementation. Since Stable Diffusion\nis a latent space diffusion model [39], the effective size\nfor segment layout is only 64x64 pixels. If we were\noperating directly in the pixel space, we would have\nconsiderably more flexibility because of 8 fold increase\nin the segment-layout size of 512x512 pixels.\nShape\nconformance:\nIn\nthe\nonly\ntext-only\nconditioning\ncase,\nour\nalgorithms\ndo\nperform\nquite well on mask shape conformance. However, total\nshape adherence to an object only through the segment\nlayout is sometimes difficult. Moreover, in the text-only\ncondition case, while generating an image within a\nsegment the whole latent is in play. The effectiveness\nof a generation within the segment is influenced by\nhow well the scaffolding image is conducive as well\nas non-interfering to the image requirements of the\nsegment. This creates some dependency on the choice\nof scaffolding image. Further, extending the scaffolding\nstage improves the conformance of objects to mask\nshapes but there is a trade-off with the overall harmony\nof the image.\nSo in the case where strict object conformance is\nrequired, we recommend using the control condition\ninputs as specified in our algorithm, though this might\nreduce the diversity of the images that text-only\nconditioning can produce.\nTraining and model limitations:The quality and\nvariety in generated object configurations are heavily\ninfluenced by the variety that the model encounters\nin the training data. So, as a result, not all object\nspecifications are equal in creating quality artifacts.\nAlthough we have tested the models and methods on\ndifferent kinds of compositions, based on our limited\nusage we cannot claim that model will equally work\nwell for all domains. For example, we find that it works\nvery well on closeup faces of human beings but the faces\nmay get a bit distorted when we generate a full-length\npicture of a person or a group of people.\nE.5. Societal impact\nRecent rapid advancements in generative models\nhave been so stunning that they have left many people\nin society (and in particular, the artists) both worried\nand excited at the same time. On one hand, these\ntools, especially when they are getting increasingly\ndemocratized and accessible, give artists an enabling\ntool to create powerful work in lesser time. On the other\nhand, traditional artists are concerned about losing the\nbusiness critical for their livelihood to amateurs [35].\nAlso, since these models pick off artistic styles easily\nfrom a few examples, the affected artists, who take\nyears to build their portfolio and style, might feel\nshortchanged. Also, there is a concern that AI art maybe\nbe treated at the same level and hence compete with\ntraditional art.\nWe feel that generative AI technology is as disruptive\nas photography was to realistic paintings. Our work,\nin particular, is based on Generative Models that can\nadd to the consequences. However, since our motivation\nis to help artists improve their workflow and create\nimages that self-express them, this modality of art may\nalso have a very positive impact on their art and art\nprocesses. With confidence tempered with caution, we\nbelieve that it should be a welcome addition to an\nartist\u2019s toolkit.\n27\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n46\n48\n50\nFigure 20.

Segment layouts and segment text prompts as inputs for Survey sample generations\nF. Human evaluation and survey details\nDuring the course of the project, we conducted a set\nof three different surveys. A preliminary and a revised\nsurvey were conducted on the general population, and a\nseparate survey was conducted on artists and designers.\nIn these surveys, we evaluated the generated outputs of\ntext-to-image generation, serial inpainting generation\nmethods, and our composite generation methods. The\ntext-to-image generations serve as the first baseline (B1)\nand serial inpainting generations serve as the second\nbaseline (B2) for comparison.\nF.1. Survey design\nThe survey design involved the following parts:\nF.1.1\nMethod for choosing survey samples\nWe designed five different input sets for the survey.\nThe free-form segment layouts and corresponding text\ndescriptions were chosen to bring in a variety of\nscenarios for the input cases. Refer to Fig. 24 for the\ninputs and to Fig. 9 for a sample of generated images\nfor the survey. Since we also wanted to compare our\ngenerations with the base model generations, and text-\nto-image model only allows a single text prompt input,\nwe manually crafted the prompts for the first base\ncase. This was done by: (i) creating a text description\nthat best tries to capture the essence of different\nsegment prompts, (ii) concatenating the different\nsegment descriptions into a single text description.\nThe best of these two generations were taken as the\nrepresentative pictures for base models. For selecting the\nsamples from the different algorithms we followed the\nfollowing protocol. Since the underlying models are of\ndifferent architecture (for example, the serial inpainting\nmethod uses a specialized inpainting model and requires\na background image), we generated 3 images using\nrandom seeds for each algorithm and for each set of\ninputs. We then chose the best representatives (1 out\nof 3) from each algorithm for the survey samples.\nF.1.2\nSurvey questions:\nIn each of the surveys, the survey takers were presented\nwith a Google form on the web containing anonymized\nand randomly sorted images generated from these three\nalgorithms with corresponding inputs. The respondents\nwere asked to rate each of these images on five quality\nparameters. We explained each quality parameter and\nasked a corresponding quality question as listed below:\n1. Text Fidelity: How closely does the image match\nthe text prompts?\n2. Mask Fidelity: How closely does the image match\nthe mask shapes?\n3. Blending & Harmony: How well do the segments\nblend together and how harmonious is the overall\nimage?\n4. Technical Quality: How would you rate the overall\ntechnical quality of the image?\n5. Aesthetic Quality: How would you rate the overall\naesthetic quality of the image?\nThe respondents were asked to rate a generated\nimage for a given quality parameter on a scale of 1\nto 5 (semantic differential scales). We also provided a\nrough rating guideline for these parameters. Refer to\nFig.25 for a snapshot of the web survey.\nF.2. Survey execution:\nThe details of the execution of the three surveys are\nas follows:\n32\nFigure 25.

Results of the survey conducted on General\nPopulation.\nF.2.1\nPhase 1: Preliminary survey:\nWe conducted this survey on a diverse set of 14\nrespondents who were spread across age (20-80), gender,\nand profession. Our experience with the first survey\ngave us vital feedback on how to design the survey\nmore effectively. For example, many surveyors said that\nthey found it tough to take the survey as it was lengthy.\nThere were a total of 75 rating questions that needed\nto be answered. So there was some fatigue due to the\ncognitive load. The first survey was organized in the\nfollowing manner: Each set of inputs was a separate\npage and contained all five quality questions. On each\npage, the respondents were presented with 3 pics from 3\ndifferent algorithms(anonymized and randomly sorted)\nand were asked to rate each of the pictures on five\nquality parameters. We also received feedback that\nall the guidance information was on the front page,\nand they had to revisit it several times to understand\nthe rating guidelines and the meaning of each quality\nparameter. Further, some users told us that \u2018aesthetics\u2019\ninfluenced their rating of the other qualities; They\ntended to rate an image with higher aesthetics higher\nfor other qualities as well.\nF.2.2\nPhase 2: Revised survey\nWe built upon this feedback, and without changing\nthe content, restructured the survey to make it more\nmodular for our final assessment. We also found the\nguidelines in [10] relevant and followed them to fine-tune\nthe survey organization. The two major changes were:\n(1) Each quality parameter was made into a separate\nsurvey. This was done to help the surveyors focus on one\nquality parameter at a time. (2) We provided guidelines\nfor the score rating on each of the survey pages as a\nready reference.\nThe survey was further divided into two sets of\nSurveyors representing different sets of professional\nskills.\n\u2022 Survey population: Artists and Designers\n(AD): We conducted this survey during the final\nphase of our project. We used the same set of\nimages as used in the preliminary survey to collect\nresponses from artists and designers. We took the\nhelp of Amazon M-Turk for collecting responses for\nthis survey. There was no restriction on whether a\nperson took all 5 surveys or only a subset of them.\nThere were a total of 20 respondents for each of\nthe five surveys (where one survey was comprised\nof a distinct quality parameter).\n\u2022 Survey\npopulation:\nGeneral\n(GP):\nWe\nconducted this survey simultaneously with the\nabove survey. The participants in this survey\nwere chosen from a larger general population that\nalso included professionals such as engineers and\nsoftware developer. In this case, 22 respondents\ncompleted all the five survey sets, while 48\ncompleted at least one set.\nF.3. Survey Results\nTable 3 presents the results of the survey for\nthe artists and designers population, and Fig. 11\npresents a graphical representation of the same for easy\ncomparison. Since the set of images and the survey\nquestions were the same across the two phases of the\nsurvey, we consolidate the results of general population\nresponses. Table 4 presents the consolidated results of\nthe survey of the general population, and Fig. 10 gives\na graphical representation of the same.\nG. Automated evaluation methods\nWe find that the present methods of automated\nquality comparisons such as FID and IS aren\u2019t well\nsuited for the given quality criteria. In the section below\nwe discuss a few of the methods that are widely used in\nmeasuring the capabilities of generative models, point\nout their drawbacks, and then detail our methods for\nautomated evaluation.\nG.1. Current approaches for automated evaluation\nInception score (IS), Fr\u00b4echet inception distance\n(FID), precision and recall are some of the commonly\nused metrics for assessing the quality of synthetically\ngenerated images [9,20,43,44]. IS score jointly measures\nthe diversity and quality of generated images.

Metrics like precision and\nrecall [43] separately capture the quality and diversity\naspects of the generator. Precision is an indicator of\nhow much the generated images are similar to the real\nones, and recall measures how good the generator is\nin synthesizing all the instances of the training data\nset [9].\nThese approaches have some drawbacks to our\nrequirement of assessing the quality of Composite\nDiffusion generations: (i) These approaches require a\nlarge set of reference images to produce a statistically\nsignificant score. The distribution of the training set\nimages is not relevant to us. We need datasets that have\n- an input set of sub-scene layouts along with textual\ndescriptions of those sub-scenes, and a corresponding\nset of reference images., (ii) Even if we had the facility\nof a relevant large dataset, these methods assume that\nthe reference images provide the highest benchmark\nfor quality and diversity. This might not be always\ntrue as the generated images can exceed the quality\nof reference images and have a variety that is different\nfrom the reference set., and (iii) These methods don\u2019t\nmeasure the quality with the granularity as described\nin the quality criteria that we use in this paper.\nG.2. Our approach for automated evaluation\nWe devise the following automated methods to\nevaluate the generated images based on our quality\ncriteria.\nContent Fidelity \u2191: The objective here is to obtain\na measure of how similar the image is to each of the\nartist\u2019s intended content, and in this case, we use the\ntextual descriptions as content. We compute the cosine\nsimilarity between the CLIP embeddings of the image\nand the CLIP embeddings of each segment\u2019s description.\nWe then take the mean of these similarity scores. Here\na greater score indicates greater content fidelity.\nSpatial-layout Fidelity \u2191: The objective here is\nto measure how accurately we generate a segment\u2019s\ncontent. We use masking to isolate a segment from\nthe image. We find the CLIP similarity score between\nthe masked image and that segment\u2019s description. We\ndo this for all the segments and then take the mean\nof these scores. Here a greater score indicates greater\nspatial-layout fidelity.\nTechnical Quality \u2193: The goal here is to measure if\nthere are any degradations or the presence of unwanted\nartifacts in the generated images. It is difficult to define\nall types of degradations in an image. We consider\nthe presence of noise as a vital form of degradation.\nWe estimate the Gaussian noise level in the image by\nusing the method described in [11]. Here a lower score\nindicates greater technical quality.\nAesthetics \u2191: We use the aesthetic quality estimator\nfrom [24] to get an estimate of the aesthetic quality of\nthe image. This method uses a linear layer on top of the\nCLIP embedding model and is trained on 4000 samples\nto estimate if an image is looking good or not. Here a\ngreater score indicates greater perceived aesthetics.\nBlending & Harmony \u2193: We detect the presence\nof edges around the segment boundaries as a measure\nof better blending. Hence a lower value in this case\nindicates better blending.\nHuman Preference \u2193: To additionally estimate\nthe human preference we rank the images generated by\nthe different algorithms using ImageReward [48]. This\nmethod uses a data-driven approach to score human\npreferences for a set of images. Here a greater score\nindicates lower preference.\nG.3. Limitations of automated evaluation methods\nAs stated in the main paper, these measures are\nthe initial attempts and may give only a ballpark\nestimation of the qualities under consideration. Content\nFidelity and Spatial-layout metrics are only as good\nas the capability underlying the image-text model -\nOpenAI\u2019s CLIP model [36]. Technical quality should\ngive an overall measure of technical aberrations like\ncolor degradation, unwanted line artifacts, etc. However,\nwe limit ourselves to only measuring the overall noise\nlevels. Aesthetics is a highly subjective aspect of image\nquality and the CLIP aesthetic model [24], though\neffective, has been trained on a relatively small-sized\ndataset. Blending & Harmony in our case is limited to\nmeasuring the presence of edges around the boundaries\nof a segment. Measuring harmony in images is a\n35\nchallenging problem as one needs to also consider the\npositioning, scale, and coloring of the elements and\nsegments in the context of the overall image. Human\npreference scoring utilizes ImageReward [48], which\nmodels the ranking that humans would assign to a group\nof images. Although this method performs better than\nCLIP and BLIP in this aspect, it lacks the explainability\nof why one image is ranked higher over the other.\nFinding better, more precise, and holistic machine-\nassisted methods for measuring the qualities presented\nin this paper is an opportunity for future research.\nG.4. Benchmark dataset\nA notable challenge in the automated evaluation of\nthe composite diffusion method is the lack of benchmark\ndatasets. Currently, there do not exist any datasets\nwhich consist of segment (or sub-scene) layouts with\nrich textual descriptions for each segment. Creation of\nsuch a dataset is non-trivial using automated methods\nand requires expensive annotation [4].\nWe handcraft a dataset containing 100 images\nwhere we segment each representative image into sub-\nscenes and manually annotate each sub-scene with a\nrelevant textual description. This enables us to build\na benchmark dataset for composite image generation\nwith sufficiently high-quality data. We use this dataset\nto generate images using our baseline and Composite\nDiffusion methods. We use the automated methods\ndescribed above to get the automated evaluation results\n(Table 5).\nH. Artworks exercise\nHere, we present the outcomes of a brief collaboration\nwith an artist. The aim of this exercise was to expose the\nmodalities of our system to an external artist and gather\nearly-stage user feedback. To achieve this, we explained\nthe workings of the Composite Diffusion system to the\nartist and asked her to provide us with 2-3 specific\nscenarios of artwork that she would normally like to\nwork on. The artist\u2019s inputs were given to us on plain\nsheets of paper in the form of rough drawings of the\nintended paintings, with clear labels for various objects\nand sections.\nWe converted these inputs into the bimodal input\n- the free-form segment layouts and text descriptions\nfor each segment. We did not create any additional\ncontrol inputs. We then supplied these inputs to our\nComposite Diffusion algorithm and performed many\niterations with base and a few fine-tuned models, and\nalso at different scaffolding values. The outputs were\nfirst shown to a few internal artists for quick feedback,\nand the final selected outputs were shared with the\noriginal artist. For the final shared outputs, refer to\nFigures 26 and 27 for input 1, Figures 28 and 29 for\ninput 2, and Figures 30, 31, and 32 for input 3. Please\nnote that the objective here was to produce an artwork\nwith artistically satisfying outputs. So, for some of our\ngenerations, we even allowed the outputs which were\ncreative and caught the overall intent of the artist, but\ndid not strictly conform to the prescribed inputs by the\nartist.\nThe feedback that we received from the artist at the\nend of the exercise (as received on Jan 25, 2023), is\npresented here verbatim:\nFor Artwork 1 (refer to Figures 26 and 27): \u201cThe\nintended vision was of a lively scene with bright blue\nskies, picnic blossoms blooming, soft green grass with\nfallen pink petals, and a happy meal picnic basket. All\nthe images are close enough to the description. Colors\nare bright and objects fit harmoniously with each other.\u201d\nFor Artwork 2 (refer to Figures 28 and 29):\n\u201cThe intended vision was of bears in their natural\nhabitat, surrounded by forest trees and snow-clad\nmountains, catching fish in the stream. Overall, the\nbears, mountains, trees, rocks, and streams are quite\nrealistic. However, not a single bear could catch a fish.\nBear 4 looks like an Afgan hound (dog breed with long\nhair) and bear 5 itself became a mountain. In image\n10, the objects have merged into one another, having\nill-defined margins and boundaries.\u201d\nFor Artwork 3(refer to Figures 30, 31, and 32):\n\u201cThe intended vision was of an angel - symbolic of\nhope & light, salvaging a dejected man, bound by the\nshackles of hopelessness and despair. Each and every\nangel is a paragon of beauty. Compared to the heavenly\nangels, the desolate men look a bit alienish. There is\na slight disproportion seen between man and angel in\nsome images. My personal best ones are no. 1,3,6,10.\u201d\nIn another case, we wanted to check if our system\ncan be effectively used for artistic pattern generation.\nHere we gave the system an abstract pattern in the\nform of a segment layout and specified the objects that\nwe want to fill within those segments. Figure 33 shows\na sample output of such an exercise where we fill in the\npattern with different forms of flowers.\nWhile the exercise of interactions with the artist and\nthe application of the system for creating the artwork\nwas informal and done in a limited manner, still, it\ndemonstrated to us at an early stage the effectiveness\nof Composite Diffusion in creating usable art in real-life\nscenarios. It also validated that the art workflow was\nsimple and intuitive enough to be adopted by people\nwith varied levels of art skills.\n36\n1\n2\n3\n4\nComposite Diffusion \nGenerations\nArtist\u2019s\nInputs\nFigure 26.

Content-based recommenders have been\nutilizing text associated with items, such as item descriptions and reviews, for about three decades [29]. However, recent\nadvances in conversational recommender systems have placed language at the forefront, as a natural and intuitive\nmeans for users to express their preferences and provide feedback on the recommendations they receive [15, 24]. Most\nrecently, the concept of natural language (NL) user pro\ufb01les, where users express their preferences as NL statements\nhas been proposed [37]. The idea of using text-based user representations is appealing for several reasons: it provides\nfull transparency and allows users to control the system\u2019s personalization. Further, in a (near) cold-start setting, where\nlittle to no usage data is available, providing a NL summary of preferences may enable a personalized and satisfying\n\u2217Work done while on sabbatical at Google.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not\nmade or distributed for pro\ufb01t or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the \ufb01rst page.

Yet, controlled quantitative comparisons of such NL preference descriptions against traditional\nitem-based approaches are very limited. Thus, the main research question driving this study is the following: How\ne\ufb00ective are prompting strategies with large language models (LLMs) for recommendation from natural language-\nbased preference descriptions in comparison to collaborative \ufb01ltering methods based solely on item ratings?\nWe address the task of language-based item recommendation by building on recent advances in LLMs and prompting-\nbased paradigms that have led to state-of-the-art results in a variety of natural language tasks, and which permit us\nto exploit rich positive and negative descriptive content and item preferences in a uni\ufb01ed framework. We contrast\nthese novel techniques with traditional language-based approaches using information retrieval techniques [3] as well\nas collaborative \ufb01ltering-based approaches [14, 42]. Being a novel task, there is no dataset for language-based item\nrecommendation. As one of our main contributions, we present a data collection protocol and build a test collection\nthat comprises natural language descriptions of preferences as well as item ratings. In doing so, we seek to answer the\nfollowing research questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: Are preferences expressed in natural language su\ufb03cient as a replacement for items for (especially) near\ncold-start recommendation, and how much does performance improve when language is combined with items?\n\u2022 RQ2: How do LLM-based recommendation methods compare with item-based collaborative \ufb01ltering methods?\n\u2022 RQ3: Which LLM prompting style, be it completion, instructions, or few-shot prompts, performs best?\n\u2022 RQ4: Does the inclusion of natural language dispreferences improve language-based recommendation?\nOur main contributions are (1) We devise an experimental design that allows language-based item recommendation\nto be directly compared with state-of-the-art item-based recommendation approaches, and present a novel data col-\nlection protocol (Section 3); (2) We propose various prompting methods for LLMs for the task of language-based item\nrecommendation (Section 4); (3) We experimentally compare the proposed prompt-based methods against a set of\nstrong baselines, including both text-based and item-based approaches (Section 5). Ultimately, we observe that LLM-\nbased recommmendation from pure language-based preference descriptions provides a competitive near cold-start\nrecommender system that is based on an explainable and scrutable language-based preference representation.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nItem-Based Recommendation. Traditional recommender systems rely on item ratings. For a new user, these can be\nprovided over time as the user interacts with the recommender, although this means initial performance is poor. Thus,\npreferences are often solicited with a questionnaire for new users [22, 39, 41]. There has also been work looking at\nother forms of item-based preferences such as relative preferences between items [10, 39], although approaches that\nrely on individual item ratings dominate the literature.\nGiven a corpus of user-item ratings, very many recommendation algorithms exist. These range from methods such\nas item-based k-Nearest Neighbors [40], where simple similarity to existing users is exploited, to matrix factoriza-\ntion approaches that learn a vector representation for the user [23, 34], through to deep learning and autoencoder\napproaches that jointly learn user and item vector embeddings [8, 19, 28]. Interestingly, the EASE algorithm [42] is an\nautoencoder approach that has been found to perform on par with much more complex state-of-the-art approaches.\nNatural Language in Recommendation.Following the proposalsin [2, 37] to model preferences solely in scrutable\nnatural language, recent work has explored the use of tags as surrogates for NL descriptions with promising results [31].\nThis contrasts with, for instance Hou et al. [20], who input a (sequence) of natural language item descriptions into an\nLLM to produce an (inscrutable) user representation for recommendation. Other recent work has sought to use rich,\n2\nLLMs are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders\nRecSys \u201923, September 18\u201322, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\ndescriptive natural language as the basis for recommendations. At one extreme, we have narrative-driven recommen-\ndations [4] that assume very verbose descriptions of speci\ufb01c contextual needs. In a similar vein, user-studies of NL\nuse in recommendation [26] identify a rich taxonomy of recommendation intents and also note that speech-based elic-\nitation is generally more verbose and descriptive than text-based elicitation. In this work, however, we return to the\nproposal in [37] and assume the user provides a more general-purpose language-based description of their preferences\nand dispreferences for the purpose of recommendation.\nRecently, researchers have begun exploring use of language models (LMs) for recommendation tasks [13]. Radlinski\net al. [37] present a theoretical motivation for why LLMs may be useful for recommendations and provide an example\nprompt, but do not conduct any quantitative evaluation. Mysore et al. [32] generate preference narratives from ratings\nand reviews, using the narratives to recommend from held-out items. Penha and Hau\ufb00 [36] show that o\ufb00-the-shelf\npretrained BERT [12] contains both collaborative- and content-based knowledge about items to recommend. They also\ndemonstrate that BERT outperforms information retrieval (IR) baselines for recommendation from language-based\ndescriptions. However, they do not assess the relative performance of language- vs. item-based recommendation from\nLMs (for which we curate a dataset speci\ufb01cally for this purpose), nor does BERT\u2019s encoder-only LM easily permit\ndoing this in a uni\ufb01ed prompting framework that we explore here. RecoBERT [30] leverages a custom-trained LM for\nderiving the similarity between text-based item and description pairs, with the authors \ufb01nding that this outperforms\ntraditional IR methods. Hou et al. [21] focuson item-based recommendation, with an in-context learning (ICL) approach\nsimilar in spirit to our item-only few-shot approach. Similarly, Kang et al. [27] use an LLM to predict ratings of target\nitems. Finally, ReXPlug [17] exploits pretrained LMs to produce explainable recommendations by generating synthetic\nreviews on behalf of the user. None of these works, however, explore prompting strategies in large LMs to translate\nactual natural language preferences into new recommendations compared directly to item-based approaches.\nFurther, we are unaware of any datasets that capture a user\u2019s detailed preferences in natural language, and attempt to\nrate recommendations on unseen items. Existing datasets such as [2, 7] tend to rely on much simpler characterizations.\nPrompting in Large Language Models. Large language models (LLMs) are an expanding area of research with\nnumerous exciting applications. Beyond traditional natural language understanding tasks like summarization, relation\nmapping, or question answering, LLMs have also proved adept at many tasks such as generating code, generating\nsynthetic data, and multi-lingual tasks [1, 5, 9]. How to prompt these models to generate the best results is a continuing\ntopic of research. Early prompting approaches relied on few-shot prompting, where a small set of training input-output\npairs are prepended to the actual input [6]. Through additional tuning of pre-trained models on tasks described via\ninstructions, LLMs also achieve impressive performance in the zero-shot setting (i.e., models are given a task and inputs,\nwithout any previous training examples) [44]. Geng et al. [16] test a variety of prompting techniques with a relatively\nsmall (less than one billion parameter) LLM trained on a collection of recommendation tasks, \ufb01nding promising results\nacross multiple tasks and domains, primarily by using item ratings as input.\n3\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTo study the relationship between item-based and language-based preferences, and their utility for recommendation,\nwe require a parallel corpus from the same raters providing both types of information that is maximally consistent.\nThere is a lack of existing parallel corpora of this nature, therefore a key contribution of our work is an experiment\ndesign that allows such consistent information to be collected. Speci\ufb01cally, we designed a two-phase user study where\nraters were (1) asked to rate items, and to describe their preferences in natural language, then (2) recommendations\ngenerated based on both types of preferences were uniformly rated by the raters. Hence we perform our experiments\n3\nRecSys \u201923, September 18\u201322, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nScot Sanner, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski, Ben Wedin, and Lucas Dixon\nin the movie domain, being frequently used for research as movie recommendation is familiar to numerous user study\nparticipants.\nA key concern in any parallel corpus of this nature is that people may say they like items with particular charac-\nteristics, but then consume and positively react to quite di\ufb00erent items. For instance, this has been observed where\npeople indicate aspirations (e.g., subscribe to particular podcasts) yet actually consume quite di\ufb00erent items (e.g., listen\nto others) [33]. In general, it has been observed that intentions (such as intending to choose healthy food) often do not\nlead to actual behaviors [43]. Such disparity between corpora could lead to inaccurate prediction about the utility of\nparticular information for recommendation tasks. As such, one of our key considerations was to maximize consistency.\n3.1\nPhase 1: Preference Elicitation\nOur preference elicitation design collected natural language descriptions of rater interests both at the start and at the\nend of a questionnaire. Speci\ufb01cally, raters were \ufb01rst asked to write short paragraphs describing the sorts of movies\nthey liked, as well as the sorts of movies they disliked (free-form text, minimum 150 characters). These initial liked (+)\nand disliked (-) self-descriptions for rater \ud45f are respectively denoted as desc\ud45f+ and desc\ud45f\u2212.\nNext, raters were asked to name \ufb01ve example items (here, movies) that they like. This was enabled using an online\nquery auto-completion system (similar to a modern search engine) where the rater could start typing the name of a\nmovie and this was completed to speci\ufb01c (fully illustrated) movies. The auto-completion included the top 10,000 movies\nranked according to the number of ratings in the MovieLens 25M dataset [18] to ensure coverage of even uncommon\nmovies. As raters made choices, these were placed into a list which could then be modi\ufb01ed. Each rater was then asked\nto repeat this process to select \ufb01ve examples of movies they do not like. These liked (+) and disliked (-) item selections\nfor rater \ud45f and item selection index \ud457 \u2208 {1, . . . , 5} are respectively denoted as item\ud45f,\ud457\n+ and item\ud45f,\ud457\n\u2212 .\nFinally, raters were shown the \ufb01ve liked movies and asked again to write the short paragraph describing the sorts\nof movies they liked (which we refer to as the \ufb01nal description). The was repeated for the \ufb01ve disliked movies.\n3.2\nPhase 2: Recommendation Feedback Collection\nTo enable a fair comparison of item-based and language-based recommendation algorithms, a second phase of our user\nstudy requested raters to assess the quality of recommendations made by a number of recommender algorithms based\non the information collected in Phase 1. In particular, past work has observed that completeness of labels is important\nto ensure fundamentally di\ufb00erent algorithms can be compared reliably [2, 25].\nDesiderata for recommender selection: We aimed for a mix of item-based, language-based, and unbiased recom-\nmendations. Hence, we collected user feedback (had they seen it or would they see it, and a 1\u20135 rating in either case)\non a shu\ufb04ed set of 40 movies (displaying both a thumbnail and a short plot synopsis) drawn from four sample pools:\n\u2022 SP-RandPop, an unbiased sample of popular items: 10 randomly selected top popular items (ranked 1-1000 in\nterms of number of MovieLens ratings);\n\u2022 SP-RandMidPop, an unbiased sample of less popular items: 10 randomly selected less popular items (ranked\n1001-5000 in terms of number of MovieLens ratings);\n\u2022 SP-EASE, personalized item-based recommendations: Top-10 from the strong baseline EASE [42] collaborative\n\ufb01ltering recommender using hyperparameter \ud706 = 5000.0 tuned on a set of held-out pilot data from 15 users;\n\u2022 SP-BM25-Fusion, personalized language-based recommendations: Top-10 from Sparse Review-based Late Fu-\nsion Retrieval that, like [3], computes BM25 match between all item reviews in the Amazon Movie Review corpus\n(v2) [45] and rater\u2019s natural language preferences (desc+), ranking items by maximal BM25-scoring review.\n4\nLLMs are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders\nRecSys \u201923, September 18\u201322, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nNote that SP-RandPop and SP-RandMidPop have 10 di\ufb00erent movies for each rater, and that these are a completely\nunbiased (as they do not leverage any user information, there can be no preference towards rating items that are\nmore obvious recommendations, or other potential sources of bias). On the other hand, SP-EASE consists of EASE\nrecommendations (based on the user item preferences), which we also evaluate as a recommender\u2014so there is some\nbias when using this set. We thus refer to the merged set of SP-RandPop and SP-RandMidPop as an Unbiased Set in\nthe analysis, with performance on this set being key to our conclusions.\n3.3\nDesign Consequences\nImportantly, to ensure a maximally fair comparison of language-based and item-based approaches, consistency of the\ntwo types of preferences was key in our data collection approach. As such, we directly crowd-sourced both types of\npreferences from raters in sequence, with textual descriptions collected twice\u2014before and after self-selected item rat-\nings. This required control means the amount of data per rater must be small. It is also a realistic amount of preference\ninformation that may be required of a recommendation recipient in a near-cold-start conversational setting. As a con-\nsequence of the manual e\ufb00ort required, the number of raters recruited also took into consideration the required power\nof the algorithmic comparison, with a key contributions being to the protocol developed rather than data scale.\nOur approach thus contrasts with alternatives of extracting reviews or preference descriptions in bulk from online\ncontent similarly to [4, 32] (where preferences do not necessarily capture a person\u2019s interests fully) and/or relying on\nitem preferences expressed either explicitly or implicitly over time (during which time preferences may change).\n4\nMETHODS\nGiven our parallel language-based and item-based preferences and ratings of 40 items per rater, we compare a variety\nof methods to answer our research questions. We present the traditional baselines using either item- or language-based\npreferences, then novel LLM approaches, using items only, language only, or a combination of items and language.\n4.1\nBaselines\nTo leverage the item and language preferences elicited in Phase 1, we evaluate CF methods as well as a language-\nbased baseline previously found particularly e\ufb00ective [2, 11].1 Most baseline item-based CF methods use the default\ncon\ufb01guration in MyMediaLite [14], including MostPopular: ranking items by the number of ratings in the dataset,\nItem-kNN: Item-based k-Nearest Neighbours [40], WR-MF: Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization, a regularized\nversion of singular value decomposition [23], and BPR-SLIM: a Sparse Linear Method (SLIM) that learns a sparse\nweighting vector over items rated, via a regularized optimization approach [34, 38]. We also compare against our own\nimplementation of the more recent state-of-the-art item-based EASE recommender [42]. As a language-based baseline,\nwe compare against BM25-Fusion, described in Section 3.2. Finally, we also evaluate a random ordering of items in\nthe rater\u2019s pool (Random) to calibrate against this uninformed baseline.\n4.2\nPrompting Methods\nWe experiment with a variety of prompting strategies using a variant of the PaLM model (62 billion parameters in\nsize, trained over 1.4 trillion tokens) [9], that we denote moving forward as simply LLM. Notationally, we assume \ud461\nis the speci\ufb01c target rater for the recommendation, whereas \ud45f denotes a generic rater. All prompts are presented in\ntwo parts: a pre\ufb01x followed by a su\ufb03x which is always the name of the item (movie) to be scored for the target user,\n1Notably Dacrema et al. [11] observe that the neural methods do not outperform these baselines.\n5\nRecSys \u201923, September 18\u201322, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nScot Sanner, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski, Ben Wedin, and Lucas Dixon\ndenoted as \u27e8item\ud461\u2217\u27e9. The score is computed as the log likelihood of the su\ufb03x and is used to rank all candidate item\nrecommendations.2 As such, we can evaluate the score given by the LLM to every item in our target set of 40 items\ncollected in Phase 2 of the data collection.\nGiven this notation, we devise Completion, Zero-shot, and Few-shot prompt templates for the case of Items\nonly, Language only, and combined Language+Items de\ufb01ned as follows:\n4.2.1\nItems only. The completion approach is analogous to that used for the P5 model [16], except that we leverage a\npretrained LLM in place of a custom-trained transformer. The remaining approaches are devised in this work:\n\u2022 Completion: item\ud461,1\n+ , item\ud461,2\n+ , item\ud461,3\n+ , item\ud461,4\n+ , item\ud461,5\n+ , \u27e8item\ud461\u2217\u27e9\n\u2022 Zero-shot: I like the following movies: item\ud461,1\n+ , item\ud461,2\n+ , item\ud461,3\n+ , item\ud461,4\n+ , item\ud461,5\n+ .

Providing \ufb01ve liked and disliked items took\na median of 174 and 175 seconds, respectively. Following this, writing \ufb01nal descriptions of likes and dislikes took a\nmedian of 152 and 161 seconds, respectively (median lengths: 205 and 207 characters, respectively). We observe that\nthe initial descriptions were produced 3 to 4 times faster than providing 5 example items, in around one minute. As we\nwill see below, this di\ufb00erence in e\ufb00ort is particularly pertinent as item-based and description-based recommendation\nare comparable in performance. A sample of initial descriptions are shown in Table 1.\nNext, we analyze the ratings collected for the movies from the four pools described in Section 3. From Table 2, we\nobserve: (1) The EASE recommender nearly doubles the rate of recommendations that have already been seen by the\nrater, which re\ufb02ects the supervised data on which it is trained where raters only rate what they have seen; (2) There\nis an inherent positive bias to provide a high ratings for movies the rater has already seen as evidenced by the average\n4.29 rating in this case; (3) In contrast, the average rating drops to a neutral 3.00 for unseen items.\n5.2\nRecommended Items\nOur main experimental results are shown in Table 3, using NDCG@10 with exponential gain (a gain of 0 for ratings\n\ud460 < 3 and a gain of 2\ud460\u22123 otherwise).

The language-based results use only the initial natural language descriptions, which raters produced much faster\nthan either liked and disliked item choices or \ufb01nal descriptions, yet they yield equal performance to \ufb01nal descriptions.\nWe begin with general observations. First, we note the range of NDCG@10 scores within each subset of items is\nsubstantially di\ufb00erent, due to both the NDCG normalizer that generally increases with a larger evaluation set size,\nas well as the average rating of each pool. On the latter note, we previously observed that the subset of Seen recom-\nmendations in Table 2 has the smallest pool of items and a high positive rating bias that makes it hard to di\ufb00erentiate\nrecommenders on this subset. However, and as also recently argued in [35], in a recommendation setting where an item\nis typically only consumed once (such as movies), we are much more concerned about recommendation performance\non the Unseen subset vs. the Seen subset. Similarly, we are also concerned with performance on the Unbiased set\nsince this subset explores a wide range of popularity and is not biased towards item-based collaborative \ufb01ltering (CF)\nmethods.\nTo address our original research questions from Section 1:\nRQ1: Can language-based preferences replace or improve on item-based preferences? An initial a\ufb03rmative\nanswer comes from observing that the LLM Language Few-shot (3) method is competitive with most of the traditional\nitem-based CF methods in this near cold-start setting, which is important since as observed in Section 5.1, language-\nbased preferences took less time to elicit than item-based preferences; furthermore, language-based preferences are\n8\nLLMs are Competitive Near Cold-start Recommenders\nRecSys \u201923, September 18\u201322, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\ntransparent and scrutable [37]. However, there seems to be little bene\ufb01t to combining language- and item-based pref-\nerences as the Item+Language LLM methods do not appear to provide a boost in performance.\nRQ2: LLM-based methods vs. CF? RQ1 has already established that LLM-based methods are generally competitive\nwith item-based CF methods for the Language variants of the LLMs. However, it should also be noted that in many cases\nthe LLM-based methods can even perform comparatively well to CF methods with only Item-based preferences (i.e.,\nthe names of the preferred movies). A critical and surprising result here is that a pretrained LLM makes a competitive\nrecommender without the large amounts of supervised data used to train CF methods.\nRQ3: Best prompting methodology? The Few-shot (3) prompting method generally outperforms Zero-shot and\nCompletion prompting methods. The di\ufb00erence between Zero-shot and Completion prompting is less pronounced.\nWhile not shown due to space constraints, increasing the number of Few-shot examples did not improve performance.\nRQ4: Does inclusion of dispreferences help? In the bottom three rows of Table 3, we show the impact of in-\ncluding negative item or language preferences for LLM-based recommenders. There are no meaningful improvements\nfrom including both positive and negative preferences (Pos+Neg) over only positive preferences in these LLM con\ufb01gu-\nrations. While not shown due to space constraints, omitting positive preferences and using only negative preferences\nyields performance at or below the popularity baseline.\n6\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nWe brie\ufb02y consider potential ethical considerations. First, it is important to consider biases in the items recommended.\nFor instance, it would be valuable to study how to measure whether language-driven recommenders exhibit more\nor less unintended bias than classic recommenders, such as perhaps preferring certain classes of items over others.\nOur task was constructed as ranking a \ufb01xed corpus of items. As such, all items were considered and scored by the\nmodel. Overall performance numbers would have su\ufb00ered had there been a strong bias, although given the size of our\nexperiments, the existence of bias cannot be ruled out. Larger scale studies would be needed to bound any possible\nbiases present.\nAdditionally, our conclusions are based on the preferences of a relatively small pool of 153 raters. The small scale\nand restriction to English-only preferences means we cannot assess whether the same results would be obtained in\nother languages or cultures.\nFinally, we note that the preference data was provided by paid contractors. They received their standard contracted\nwage, which is above the living wage in their country of employment.\n7\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we collected a dataset containing both item-based and language-based preferences for raters along with\ntheir ratings of an independent set of item recommendations. Leveraging a variety of prompting strategies in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), this dataset allowed us to fairly and quantitatively compare the e\ufb03cacy of recommendation\nfrom pure item- or language-based preferences as well as their combination. In our experimental results, we \ufb01nd that\nzero-shot and few-shot strategies in LLMs provide remarkably competitive in recommendation performance for pure\nlanguage-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based collaborative\n\ufb01ltering methods. In particular, despite being general-purpose, LLMs perform competitively with fully supervised\nitem-based CF methods when leveraging either item-based or language-based preferences. Finally, we observe that\nthis LLM-based recommendation approach provides a competitive near cold-start recommender system based on an\n9\nRecSys \u201923, September 18\u201322, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nScot Sanner, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski, Ben Wedin, and Lucas Dixon\nexplainable and scrutable language-based preference representation, thus providing a path forward for e\ufb00ective and\nnovel LLM-based recommenders using language-based preferences.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Jacob Austin, Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Maarten Bosma, Henryk Michalewski, David Dohan, Ellen Jiang, Carrie Cai, Michael Terry, Quoc Le,\nand Charles Sutton. 2021.

To implicitly measure the\nquality of a machine-generated utterance, we\nleverage signals like user response length, sen-\ntiment and reaction of the future human utter-\nances in the collected dialogue episodes. Our\nexperiments use the publicly released deploy-\nment data from BlenderBot (Xu et al., 2023).\nHuman evaluation indicates improvements in\nour new models over baseline responses; how-\never, we find that some proxy signals can lead\nto more generations with undesirable properties\nas well. For example, optimizing for conver-\nsation length can lead to more controversial or\nunfriendly generations compared to the base-\nline, whereas optimizing for positive sentiment\nor reaction can decrease these behaviors.\n1\nIntroduction\nA core strategy to improve social conversation mod-\nels is through human feedback. There has been\nremarkable progress in learning from feedback, in-\ncluding reinforcement learning with human feed-\nback (Stiennon et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022), where\na large number of human annotations are needed\nto ensure a good reward function. For social con-\nversation models, the feedback usually involves\nbinary ratings (Xu et al., 2023), numerical scores\n(Shalyminov et al., 2018; Hancock et al., 2019),\nranking (Ghazarian et al., 2023), or natural lan-\nguage comments of a dialogue turn or episode (Li\net al., 2017a; Yuan et al., 2023). These signals are\nmost often collected explicitly using crowdwork-\ners, as organic users may not want to be burdened\nwith providing explicit signals, or else may provide\nunreliable information (Ju et al., 2022).\nIn this work, we consider the setting where\nwe have a large number of dialogue episodes of\n\u2217All work done at Meta.\nThe Chicago Symphony \nOrchestra \u2013 that sounds \nwonderful!

Implicit signals are\nextracted from conversations, such as whether future\nhuman turns are long or short, or joyful or not. For\nexample, the bot turn in the top-left is labeled as \u201cgood\u201d\nand the bottom-left is labeled as \u201cbad\u201d according to both\nof these signals. We train a binary classifier to predict\nwhether the bot turn is \u201cgood\u201d given the conversation\nhistory and the bot turn, and we leverage the classifier\nat the bot\u2019s test time. We study various kinds of implicit\nsignals in this work (\u00a73).\ndeployment-time dialogue which consist of natural\nconversations between the model and organic users.\nWe want to see if we can obtain any implicit signal\nfrom these organic user conversations, and leverage\nthese signals to improve the dialogue model. The\nrationale is two-fold. First, the organic users most\nclosely approximate the data distribution for future\ndeployment; yet they may not provide explicit an-\nnotations. Second, relying on these implicit signals\ndoes not incur extra cost that would otherwise be\nspent on crowdsourcing. More specifically, in this\nwork we investigate the following: Can we improve\nthe chatbot by optimizing for simple implicit feed-\nback signals like the number of, length, sentiment,\nor reaction of future human responses? In partic-\nular, we do not leverage any explicit annotation\narXiv:2307.14117v2  [cs.CL]  1 Feb 2024\n(e.g., binary or numerical rating, explicit natural\nlanguage feedback, etc.).\nWe use publicly released de-identified data (Xu\net al., 2023) from the BlenderBot online deploy-\nment (Shuster et al., 2022b). Utilizing this data, we\nobtain sample-and-rerank models, comparing vari-\nous implicit feedback signals. Through both auto-\nmatic and human judgments, some of our new mod-\nels are preferable to baseline responses. Next, as\nour implicit feedback signals are coarse proxy met-\nrics of the quality of bot turns, we ask whether en-\ncouraging these metrics would lead to undesirable\nbehaviors. The answer is yes, depending on the\nchosen signal: in particular, optimizing for longer\nconversation lengths can make the model produce\ncontroversial takes or respond in an unfriendly or\nconfrontational way. Optimizing for positive reac-\ntion or sentiment on the other hand has the opposite\neffect, and decreases these behaviors compared to\nthe baseline. Overall, implicit feedback from hu-\nmans is a useful training signal that can improve\noverall performance, but the precise signal used\nhas important behavioral consequences.\n2\nRelated Work\nResearchers and practitioners have strived to build\nbetter neural open-domain dialogue models for\nyears (Chen et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2018; Kha-\ntri et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2023). DialoGPT (Zhang\net al., 2020) and BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022b)\nhave released the models as well as the training\npipelines which have enabled follow-up dialogue\nprojects from the community (Bang et al., 2021;\nAdewumi et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). In particu-\nlar, for BlenderBot, dialogue interaction data has\nbeen released (Xu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2022),\nwhich makes the study of implicit signals in our\nwork possible.\nThe class of training strategies that are most rel-\nevant to this work \u2013 decoding utterances for future\nsuccess \u2013 is discussed in Li et al. (2017b), in which\nthey interpolate the MLE-trained token-level con-\nditional probability with a value function that is\ntrained to predict the property of a completed se-\nquence (e.g., length, BLEU/ROUGE against the\nreference) given a partial sequence. This overall\nidea is extended in Zemlyanskiy and Sha (2018)\nwhere a chatbot learns to generate utterances that\nhave the maximal information gain about the hu-\nman in the future, as well as Kulikov et al. (2019)\nthat propose to generate the current bot utterance\nthat leads to the most probable sequence of future\nutterances. Irvine et al. (2023) use conversation\nengagement metrics (e.g., approximated by retry\nrate, manually-annotated engagement metrics) to\noptimize for engaging bot responses; in contrast,\nour work highlights both the strengths as well as\nthe challenges of using implicit feedback, and in\nparticular that conversation engagement metrics\nhave negative consequences that can be alleviated\nthrough other choices of implicit signal.\n3\nApproach\n3.1\nImplicit Feedback Signals\nOur goal is to extract learning signals from a\nlarge set of human-bot conversational episodes.\nAssume such a set has already been collected.\nA conversation episode is represented as x =\n(xb\n1, xh\n1, xb\n2, xh\n2, . . . ) with T utterances by the\nbot (denoted with superscript \u201cb\u201d; bot is as-\nsumed to speak first) and T \u2032 utterances by the\nhuman (denoted with \u201ch\u201d).\nLet x<t denote\nthe conversation history before bot\u2019s t-th turn:\nxb\n1, xh\n1, . . . , xb\nt\u22121, xh\nt\u22121.\nNext, we define the implicit feedback-derived\nscoring function r\u03d5(xb\nt, x<t) that predicts the qual-\nity of the bot\u2019s t-th turn xb\nt given past utterances.\nThe input to r\u03d5 is the first t bot utterances and the\nfirst t \u2212 1 human utterances; the output is a real\nnumber in [0, 1] that scores xb\nt according to one of\nthe below criteria. Crucially, for the training data\n(but not for test data) we have access to the entire\nconversation x (with T + T \u2032 utterances for a given\nepisode). We can hence use future human turns\nto gather implicit feedback to judge the quality of\nxb\nt, which we hence use to define training labels\ny(xb\nt) in order to learn the scoring function r\u03d5. We\nconsider several candidate implicit signals, which\nwe describe next \u2013 these signals are coarse proxy\nmetrics of the quality of bot turns, and we aim to\ninvestigate the effect of optimizing them.\nExistence of next human turn. Intuitively, if\nthe human user quits the conversation after the bot\u2019s\nt-th turn xb\nt, then it is likely that xb\nt is of poor qual-\nity. Conversely, if humans continue to converse,\nand do not quit, this prolonged engagement can be\nseen as a proxy for satisfaction (O\u2019Brien and Toms,\n2008; See and Manning, 2021). Therefore, we set\nthe reference label y(xb\nt) for training r\u03d5(xb\nt, x<t)\nto 1 if the next human turn exists, and 0 otherwise.\nWe use \u201creplied\u201d to represent this signal in later\nsections.\nNext human turn length. If a human is un-\nwilling to invest time into the conversation, their\nresponses may be shorter. Given the crude intuition\nthat a long human turn likely implies that the pre-\nvious bot turn is good, let y(xb\nt) be 1 if the next\nhuman turn has \u2265 k words (k is a hyperparameter);\n0 otherwise. Granted, the intuition is not always\ntrue in practice (e.g., a human response could be a\ntirade against previous bot turns); we only use the\nsignals in this section as coarse proxy metrics of\nbot turn\u2019s quality. We use \u201clength\u201d to represent this\nsignal.\nIn the same vein, we have also attempted to lever-\nage the number of words in all future human\nutterances or number of future human turns \u2013\nwe leave this discussion to \u00a7A.1 as we are not able\nto train an effective scoring function.\nSentiment in the next human utterance. We\nuse a recent positive/neutral/negative sentiment\nmodel trained on tweets (Camacho-Collados et al.,\n2022). Intuitively, we want humans to react pos-\nitively in future responses. For sentiment and re-\naction signals, we find that the classifiers struggle\nat classifying very short utterances. At the same\ntime, very short human responses likely mean that\nhumans are unwilling to meaningfully engage. We\nthus experiment with two options: (1) Set reference\nlabel y(xb\nt) to 1 if sentiment of xh\nt is positive or\nneutral, and length is \u2265 5 words; 0 otherwise. (2)\nSet reference label to 1 if sentiment is positive and\nlength is \u2265 5 words; 0 otherwise.\nReaction in the next human utterance. We\nuse an existing model (Hartmann, 2022) with out-\nput categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral,\nsadness, and surprise. Similar to the previous para-\ngraph, we train a classifier that predicts whether the\nhuman next turn would have the \u201cjoy\u201d reaction and\n\u2265 5 words at the same time.1 Let y(xb\nt) = 1 if the\nreaction of xh\nt is joy and length is \u2265 5 words; 0 oth-\nerwise. This signal is denoted by \u201cjoy & length.\u201d\n3.2\nModels Using Implicit Signals\nWe use the sample-and-rerank approach, which\nhas been shown to perform similarly (albeit with a\nlarger inference cost which is not the focus of our\ndiscussion) as RL-based approaches in machine\ntranslation (Pang et al., 2022) and learning from\npairwise feedback in language modeling (Dubois\n1We also attempted the following: the classifier pre-\ndicts whether the human next turn\u2019s top predicted reaction\nis anger/disgust or non-anger/disgust, but we find that this\nfeature cannot be well-predicted (dev accuracy \u223c55%).\net al., 2023). Given a conversation history, first,\nsample 20 candidate responses. We use factual-top-\np sampling (Lee et al., 2022) given that Shuster\net al. (2022b) have shown that it achieves a good\nbalance between generation diversity and factuality\nfor social conversations.2 Next, rerank these gen-\nerations using a reranker model, i.e., the classifier\nr\u03d5 trained using the deployment data with implicit\nfeedback labels y. We then pick the candidate gen-\neration with the highest reranker score.\n4\nExperiments and Results\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe base our experiments off the publicly released\nBlenderBot deployment data (Xu et al., 2023) in or-\nder to build implicit feedback models. The dataset\nused in this work contains 3.1M bot utterances\nand 3.1M human utterances collected from Au-\ngust 2022 to January 2023. The classifiers (i.e.,\nrerankers) are based on a pretrained RoBERTa-\nlarge. Our baseline is the publicly released Blender-\nBot model (r2c2_blenderbot_3B) with around\n3B parameters, pretrained on dialogue and lan-\nguage modeling tasks, and fine-tuned on dialogue\ntasks (Shuster et al., 2022a). We also report results\nfor the method \u201cranked by probability:\u201d we simply\nrerank using the sequence-level probabilities dur-\ning sample-and-rerank; we want to see whether our\napproaches based on the implicit feedback classi-\nfiers outperform using this naive ranking criterion.\n4.2\nEvaluation Methods\nGiven a conversation history and two candidate re-\nsponses (baseline and new model responses), we\nask a large language model (LLM), in this case\ngpt-3.5-turbo-0613, to judge which one of the\ntwo responses is better or if they tie, with 8-shot\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. Experts (authors\nof this paper) also carefully annotate 200 compar-\nisons with example order and response order ran-\ndomized. We find that LLM vs. expert example-\nbased agreement is not high; see \u00a7A.3.3 for more\ndetails \u2013 the LLM does not excel on our evaluation\ntask, despite existing work showing superior LLM\nannotation performance on certain other tasks (e.g.,\nGilardi et al., 2023).\nTherefore, we conduct human annotation via\ncrowdworkers, using majority vote over 5 workers\n2The high level idea is that in factual top-p sampling, p\nvaries by time-step t which leads to more factual generations.\n%\nwin rate\nsig.\n%\nseek info\n%\noff-topic\n%\noff-topic\n& seek info\n%\ninsincere\n%\ncontro-\nversial\n%\nunfriendly\nbaseline\n\u2013\n\u2013\n32.5\n11.5\n3.0\n20.0\n17.0\n9.0\nranked by probability\n+3.0\n\u2013\n43.0\n13.5\n4.0\n16.0\n16.0\n7.0\nreplied\n\u20131.0\n\u2013\n47.5\n16.0\n5.0\n21.0\n24.5\n12.5\nlength (k=20)\n+12.0\n\u2217\u2217\n46.0\n15.0\n4.5\n20.0\n17.0\n12.5\nlength (k=5)\n+5.0\n\u2013\n56.0\n13.0\n8.0\n19.0\n19.0\n9.5\nnon-neg. sentiment & length (k=5)\n+8.5\n\u2217\n60.0\n14.5\n8.0\n21.0\n13.0\n6.0\npositive sentiment & length (k=5)\n+6.5\n\u2013\n41.0\n11.0\n3.5\n20.0\n9.5\n6.0\njoy & length (k=5)\n+9.5\n\u2217\u2217\n49.0\n12.0\n8.0\n22.5\n8.5\n6.0\nTable 1: Columns 2\u20133: Evaluation of generated dialogue responses using different implicit feedback signals.

See \u00a7A.3 for more details on\nhuman annotation and comparison with LLMs.\nBehaviors of generated responses.\nWe also in-\nvestigate what behaviors (including potentially un-\ndesirable ones) the generations have. The prop-\nerties are as follows. Seek info: whether the re-\nsponse is seeking information (e.g., \u201ctell me about\nthe dune\u201d); off-topic: whether the response is off-\ntopic and irrelevant to the conversation; contro-\nversial: whether the response contains anything\ncontroversial; insincere: whether the response is\ninsincere (being deceitful, not being genuine, not\nbeing serious about the conversation); unfriendly:\nwhether the response is being unfriendly or con-\nfrontational toward the other speaker.\nWe use\ngpt-3.5-turbo-0613 (with 8-shot CoT prompts\nshown in \u00a7A.3.4) to conduct this behavior evalu-\nation. These questions are intuitively straightfor-\nward (compared to the pairwise comparison task\ndescribed at the beginning of this section), and we\nobserve that the LLM\u2013expert evaluation outputs\nmatch >90% of the time.\n4.3\nResults\nOverall results.\nOverall results are given in Ta-\nble 1.

In\nparticular, \u201clength (k=20),\u201d \u201cnon-neg. sentiment &\nlength,\u201d and \u201cjoy & length\u201d are all significantly bet-\nter than the baseline using Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest. For example, responses generated using the\n\u201clength (k=20)\u201d signal correspond to a 12-point lead\ncompared to the baseline responses, and the \u201cjoy\n& length\u201d signal corresponds to an 9.5-point lead.\nWe also find that LLM-based evaluation follows\nroughly the same trend as human annotators; see\nfurther supporting results in \u00a7A.3.\nBehavior analysis.\nWhile several choices of im-\nplicit feedback improve overall performance, we\nobserve both positive and negative consequences\nin terms of observed behavior depending on the\nimplicit signal chosen (Table 1 columns 4\u20139).\nImplicit signals that approximately optimize con-\nversation length (\u201creplied,\u201d \u201clength (k=5),\u201d \u201clength\n(k=20)\u201d) tend to increase the amount of controver-\nsial and/or generations that are deemed unfriendly.\nIn contrast, positive sentiment and joy optimizing\nsignals (\u201csentiment & length,\u201d \u201cjoy & length\u201d) tend\nto decrease both of these behaviors compared to the\nbaseline. The \u201creplied\u201d signal produces the most\ncontroversial messages \u2013 possibly to provoke the\nuser into responding one more time. The \u201clength\n(k=20)\u201d and \u201creplied\u201d signals lead to a larger num-\nber of unfriendly generations, possibly by antago-\nnizing the other speaker so they are too provoked\nto not respond. The \u201cjoy & length\u201d signal on the\nother hand halves the amount of controversial mes-\nsages (from 17% to 8.5%) compared to the baseline,\navoiding these types of messages.\nWe also observe that most implicit signals lead\nto an increased amount of information seeking.\nFurther, some signals, especially for \u201creplied\u201d and\n\u201clength (k=20),\u201d may go off-topic at a slightly\nhigher rate than the baseline. For generations using\nsignals \u201clength (k=5)\u201d and \u201cnon-neg. sentiment\n& length,\u201d there is a much higher rate in seeking\noff-topic information; a possible explanation is that\nthe model could ask slightly irrelevant questions so\nas to keep the human user engaged.\n5\nConclusion\nIn summary, we find that optimizing for certain\nimplicit feedback signals from human responses\nis effective, providing improved models over the\nbaseline. However, the choice of implicit signal\nto extract has important behavioral consequences.\nConversation length-based signals tend to increase\ncontroversial and unfriendly messages, while sen-\ntiment or reaction-based signals tend to do the op-\nposite, decreasing the frequency of this behavior\ncompared to the baseline.\nWe note, however, that if we discount genera-\ntions that are off-topic, controversial, unfriendly, or\ninsincere, and only evaluate on the rest of the exam-\nples, then the human annotation would prefer our\nimplicit feedback models over the baseline even\nmore (see the end of \u00a7A.3.2). Hence, future work\ncould try to extract signals towards that goal (of op-\ntimizing toward implicit signals while reducing the\namount of undesirable generations), or consider ad-\nditional safeguards or mitigations while optimizing\ntoward implicit signals.\nLimitations\nWhile we provide no formal evaluation, decreas-\ning controversial messages potentially prevents the\ndiscussion of serious matters, for example, shar-\ning indignance on issues involving social justice\nor discussing unfortunate everyday situations. On\nthe other hand, encouragement of these messages\nincreases the chance of upsetting conversations or\neven harmful conversations.\nAlgorithm-wise, while we have used the sample-\nand-rerank in our experiments, a natural extension\nwhich we did not explore in this project is to use\nimplicit signals in other learning approaches such\nas RL. To use RL, we may need strategies to re-\nduce reward gaming behaviors in text generation\n(Skalse et al., 2022; Pang et al., 2023) given that our\nclassifiers are imperfect. Alternatively, one could\ninvestigate non-RL approaches that learn from pref-\nerence signals, such as Cringe loss (Adolphs et al.,\n2023), direct preference optimization (Rafailov\net al., 2023), and their variants (Yuan et al., 2024).\nAnother future direction which we did not explore\nin this project is to study the use of implicit feed-\nback signals in an iterative framework, whereby\nthe new improved model is re-deployed and feed-\nback recollected. For example, we find many of\nthe implicit feedback models we explored increase\ninformation-seeking messages, which is not always\nbeneficial (Dinan et al., 2020). If those methods\nhave overcompensated and now produce an exces-\nsive amount of such messages, redeployment can\nprovide feedback to correct this and iteratively im-\nprove the model.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank Jing Xu, Da Ju, Mojtaba Komeili,\nVishakh Padmakumar, Nitish Joshi, and Leshem\nChoshen for valuable discussion.

As-\nsociation for Computational Linguistics.\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nOther Signals\nNumber of words in all future human turns or\nnumber of future human turns.\nWe build vari-\nants of the \u201creplied\u201d and \u201clength\u201d signals by taking\ninto account multiple future turns to build the scor-\ning function. For the \u201cnumber of words in all future\nhuman turns\u201d signal, let y(xb\nt) be 1 if the length of\nall future human turns is larger than a threshold k.\nOtherwise, set the score to 0. For the \u201cnumber of\nfuture human turns\u201d signal, let y(xb\nt) be 1 if there\nare \u2265 k human utterances in the future. Intuitively,\nif a bot turn approaches the end of the conversation\nepisode, then it may be an inferior one.\nFor the \u201cnumber of words in all future human\nturns\u201d signal and the \u201cnumber of future human\nturns\u201d signal, the best accuracy is 0.595 (experi-\nmented with threshold k = 30, 50, 100) and 0.587\n(with threshold k = 2, 3, 5, 10), respectively. We\nhave also attempted restricting the classification\nproblem to conversations with at least 3, 5, or 10\nhuman turns \u2013 the accuracy stays below 0.6. We\nconsider the accuracy to be too low for the dialogue\nresponse generation experiments, so we discard\nthese signals in the rest of our experiments.\nA.2\nAdditional Info on Experimental Setup\nModels.\nThe classifiers are fine-tuned based on a\nRoBERTa-large with 24 layers, 16 attention heads,\ntoken embedding size 1024, and FFN size 4096.\nTable 1 examines the accuracy of the classifiers\nbased on different implicit feedback signals under\na balanced dev set (where the number of examples\nis equal across classes).\nOur baseline model is the publicly released\nBlenderBot model (r2c2_blenderbot_3B) with\naround 3B parameters, pretrained on both dialogue\nand language modeling tasks, and fine-tuned on di-\nalogue tasks (Shuster et al., 2022a). The model has\n2 encoder layers, 24 decoder layers, 32 attention\nheads, FFN size 10240, and embedding size 2560.\nData.\nIn addition, regarding data, we have con-\nfirmed that it is legal to use the deployment data\n(Xu et al., 2023) from which we obtain the implicit\nfeedback signals. The deployment data is released\nunder a CC BY license, as shown on this page.4\nCompute.\nClassifier (r\u03d5) training is done on one\nV100 GPU with 32G memory. Only one V100\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/\nblob/main/projects/bb3x/data_card.md\nGPU is needed because the classifier is small\n(around 355M parameters). Depending on the sig-\nnal, the training time varies, but on average we\ntrain the classifier for 72 hours.\nSample-and-rerank decoding experiments (to\ngenerate the dialogue responses) are run on eight\nV100s, each with 32G memory.\nEight V100\nGPUs are needed because we need to load the 3B-\nparameter BlenderBot model as well as the 355M-\nparameter classifier (i.e., reranker). Decoding every\n100 dialogue responses takes less than 30 minutes.\nHyperparameters.\nAll experiments are run us-\ning ParlAI. To train the classifiers, a grid search\nis done. The learning rate is selected from {3e-\n6, 5e-6, 1e-5, 3e-5}. Both the dropout rate and\nthe attention dropout rate (in transformers) are se-\nlected from {0, 0.1}. The learning rate scheduler\nis ReduceLROnPlateau in PyTorch. The learning\nrate scheduler patience is selected from {5,10,50}.\nBatch size is kept constant at 20. The gradient clip\nis 1.0. The validation metric is the classification\naccuracy on dev sets. Validation is done every 3000\nseconds. We use the Adamax optimizer. To gener-\nate dialogue responses, we use sample-and-rerank:\nthe number of samples for sample-and-rerank is\nfixed at 20; the p for factual top-p decoding is 0.9.\nA.3\nAdditional Info on Evaluation\nA.3.1\nCrowdworker Evaluation of Pairwise\nComparison\nWe ask MTurk crowdworkers to decide which one\nof the two responses is better or if they tie. Each\njudgment is done by five crowdworkers. The final\nanswer is the majority vote. If there is no majority\nvote (e.g., five votes being \u201c(a) wins,\u201d \u201c(a) wins,\u201d\n\u201c(b) wins,\u201d \u201c(a) and (b) tie,\u201d \u201c(a) and (b) tie\u201d), then\nthe final answer is \u201c(a) and (b) tie.\u201d\nThe specific instruction is as follows. The header\nsays the following: \u201cWe want to investigate the\nquality of responses by different dialogue models.\nWarning: We added many dummy tasks \u2013 we al-\nready know the (unambiguous) reference answers\nfor them.

Classifier\naccuracy: the classification accuracy on a balanced dev set (meaning the classes corresponding to the same number\nof examples); even though the accuracy is not high, we see that the classifiers can still help improve the bot\ndialogue generations. Avg. score: our new generations achieve better classifier scores compared to the baseline; this\nobservation is guaranteed given our sample-and-rerank algorithm but we believe it is still instructive to see how large\nthe gap is. Length: we see that other than the \u201cbaseline + length (k=5)\u201d generation, the other generations\u2019 average\nlengths are similar, so the model is not simply optimizing for longer responses. Sig.: ** if p-value \u2208 [0, 0.05), * if\np-value \u2208 [0.05, 0.1), \u2013 otherwise. We find general agreement between human annotator evaluation results and the\nLLM evaluation results when averaging over 200 examples.\nthe two possible next responses by SPEAKER 1.\nA response is considered good if it is sensible, en-\ngaging, and friendly.

If the\ntwo candidate generations are exactly the same, we\nautomatically label the result as \u201ctie\u201d and do not\ninclude the annotation batch.\nThe crowdworker\u2013expert agreement is much bet-\nter than the LLM\u2013expert agreement. In \u00a7A.3.3,\nTable 5 shows that 86% answers match, and\nonly 6.5% strongly disagree.6 The crowdworker\u2013\nexpert agreement rate (86%) is much higher than\nthe LLM\u2013expert agreement rate (64.5%), and\nthe crowdworker\u2013expert strong disagreement rate\n(6.5%) is much lower than the LLM\u2013expert strong\n5>20% if the worker has done \u2265 5 annotations (of catch\nquestions), >50% if the worker has done < 5 annotations.\n6Strongly disagree: crowdworkers choosing \u201c(a) better\nthan (b)\u201d and experts choosing \u201c(b) better than (a),\u201d or vice\nversa.

Each cell corresponds\nto 200 evaluated examples (except for \u201cannotator\npref.,\u201d we first do 100 annotations, and then do the\nsecond 100 annotations only for rows with large\nenough \u201cnew wins\u201d minus \u201cbaseline wins\u201d value\n\u2013 the \u201clength (k=20)\u201d row and the sentiment-/joy-\nrelated rows).

The results (\u201cranked by prob\u201d\nwins / new wins / tie) for the \u201clength (k=20)\u201d sig-\nnal: 29.5 / 37.0 / 33.5. The results for the \u201cjoy &\nlength\u201d signal: 29.0 / 33.0 / 38.0.\nLLM pairwise evaluation.\nWe complement the\nTable 1 results with the LLM-evaluated pairwise\npreference results, as shown in Table 2. While\ninstance-level LLM vs. expert agreement is not\nhigh (Table 3), we find general agreement between\nLLM evaluation results and the crowdworker eval-\nuation results when averaging over 200 examples\n(Table 2). For exact prompts, see \u00a7A.3.4 and search\nfor the \u201ccomparison\u201d paragraph.\nMore on behavior analysis in Table 1.\nIf we\nremove our generations that are off-topic, contro-\nversial, unfriendly, insincere, and only evaluate on\nthe rest of the examples, then the human annotation\nwould prefer our implicit feedback model gener-\nations more: the \u201cbaseline generation wins\u201d vs.\n\u201cnew generation wins\u201d vs. \u201ctie\u201d proportion would\nbe 31.6 / 47.5 / 20.9 for the \u201clength (k=20)\u201d signal\n(better than the 31.0 / 43.0 / 26.0 result in Table 2),\nand 24.5 / 41.3 / 34.2 for the \u201cjoy & length\u201d signal\n(better than the 27.0 / 36.5 / 36.5 result in Table 2).\nThe win rate is much higher if we discount the\nunsafe generations. This observation means that\nfuture work can consider safeguards or mitigations\nwhile optimizing toward the implicit signals, or\nextract more signals toward that goal.\nA.3.3\nAgreement of Expert, Annotator, and\nLLM Evaluation of Pairwise\nComparison\nAutomatic evaluation of dialogue responses is a\nnon-trivial task (Guo et al., 2018; Mehri and Eske-\nnazi, 2020). Initially, we have conducted evaluation\nusing LLM (specifically, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613),\nhoping to save cost. The rationale is two-fold: first,\nmodel-based evaluation (especially with in-context\nCoT examples) has shown to perform well on a\nrange of tasks (Gilardi et al., 2023) and crowd-\nsourcers might already rely on LLMs (Veselovsky\net al., 2023); second, the cost is much lower than\nhuman evaluation.\nHowever, the LLM\u2013expert agreement is low. Ta-\nble 3 shows that 64.5% of the answers match, and\n14% strongly disagree. Recall that the answers\nmatch if both LLM and experts choose \u201c(a) is bet-\nter\u201d or both choose \u201c(b) is better\u201d or both choose\n\u201c(a) and (b) tie.\u201d Recall that the answers strongly\ndisagree if LLM chooses \u201c(a) is better\u201d and experts\nchooses \u201c(b) is better,\u201d or LLM chooses \u201c(b) is\nbetter\u201d and experts chooses \u201c(a) is better\u201d \u2013 the\n\u201ctie\u201d selection is not considered in the definition of\n\u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d\nGiven the low LLM\u2013expert agreement, we need\nto rely on human annotator (i.e., crowdworker) eval-\nuation.\nWe see in Table 5 that the expert\u2013annotator\nagreement is much higher: 86% of annotations\nmatch, and only 6.5% of annotations strongly dis-\nagree.

If not, then we use\n8-shot chain-of-thought prompting (and we find\nthat all of the human-LLM annotation match is >\n90% after 8-shot chain-of-thought prompting). For\nevaluating whether a generation is controversial,\nwe find that the zero-shot prompting results already\nmatch with human annotations > 90% of the time.\nTherefore, we adopt the following straightforward\nprompt.\nRead the conversation below.\nSPEAKER 1: [utterance]\nSPEAKER 2: [utterance]\n...\nSPEAKER 1: [utterance]\nAnswer the following question regarding the last response by\nSPEAKER 1 ([copying the last response here]).\nDoes this response contain anything controversial?

Who would\u2019ve guessed, right?\nIs the last response insincere (i.e., being deceitful or not being\ngenuine)?\n(a) Reasoning: Speaker 1 claims to be a conductor in an ex-\ntremely famous orchestra.

It would have to be\nreplaced with something. Perhaps just change it.\nSPEAKER 2: What should you do if your government has\nbecome too powerful?\nSPEAKER 1: Depends upon what you want to change. Change\nmanagement (sometimes abbreviated as CM) is a collective\nterm for all approaches to prepare, support, and help individuals,\nteams, and organizations in making organizational change.\nSPEAKER 2: I don\u2019t think that is correct.\n(a): That\u2019s incorrect.

Which of the two responses from\nSPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are\nsimilarly good or bad, then answer \u201c(c) tie.\u201d\nReasoning: The two responses are the same, so (a) and (b) are\nequally good or bad.\nAnswer: (c) tie\n-\nRead the conversation below and consider the two possible next\nresponses \u2013 named (a) and (b) \u2013 by SPEAKER 1.\nSPEAKER 1: Hey!

You are\none of those people who are always right, aren\u2019t you?\n(b): Paradoxes are the hardest thing to deal with. I don\u2019t like\nthem at all.

However, their efficient deployments, espe-\ncially on mobile devices, still suffer from noteworthy chal-\nlenges due to the heavy computational costs of self-attention\nmechanisms, large kernels, or fully connected layers. In\nthis work, we apply conventional convolution theorem to\ndeep learning for addressing this and reveal that adap-\ntive frequency filters can serve as efficient global token\nmixers. With this insight, we propose Adaptive Frequency\nFiltering (AFF) token mixer. This neural operator trans-\nfers a latent representation to the frequency domain via\na Fourier transform and performs semantic-adaptive fre-\nquency filtering via an elementwise multiplication, which\nmathematically equals to a token mixing operation in the\noriginal latent space with a dynamic convolution kernel as\nlarge as the spatial resolution of this latent representation.\nWe take AFF token mixers as primary neural operators to\nbuild a lightweight neural network, dubbed AFFNet. Exten-\nsive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-\nposed AFF token mixer and show that AFFNet achieve su-\nperior accuracy and efficiency trade-offs compared to other\nlightweight network designs on broad visual tasks, includ-\ning visual recognition and dense prediction tasks.\n1. Introduction\nRemarkable progress has been made in ever-changing vi-\nsion network designs to date, wherein effective token mix-\ning in the global scope is constantly highlighted. Three ex-\nisting dominant network families, i.e., Transformers, CNNs\nand MLPs achieve global token mixing with their respective\nways. Transformers [17, 67, 43, 13, 83] mix tokens with\nself-attention mechanisms where pairwise correlations be-\ntween query-key pairs are taken as mixing weights. CNNs\n*This work was done when Zhipeng Huang was an intern at Microsoft\nResearch Asia.\nFigure 1. Comparison of Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K [58] be-\ntween our proposed AFFNet to some state-of-the-art lightweight\nnetworks that have global token mixing. The bubble size corre-\nsponds to FLOPs.\nachieve competitive performance with transformers by scal-\ning up their kernel sizes [54, 16, 41, 10]. MLPs [64, 28, 38]\nprovide another powerful paradigm via fully connections\nacross all tokens. All of them are effective but computation-\nally expensive, imposing remarkable challenges in practical\ndeployments, especially on edge devices.\nRecently, there is increased attention on improving the\nefficiency of token mixing in transformers. Some works\n[33, 43, 13, 25, 48, 53, 34] squeeze the scope of token\nmixing in different ways to compromise the representation\ncapacities of neural networks for their efficiencies. Other\nworks reduce the complexity of the matrix operations in\nself-attention by making use of the associativity property\nof matrix products [32] or low-rank approximation meth-\nods [23, 78]. These methods all sacrifice the expressiveness\nof neural networks and lead to unsatisfactory performance\nof efficient network designs. A general-purpose global to-\nken mixing for lightweight networks is still less explored.\nBetter trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for global-\nscope token mixing is worthy of further study.\nIn this work, we reveal that adaptive frequency filters can\nserve as efficient global token mixers, inspired by the con-\nvolution theorem [47, 56, 51] widely used in conventional\nsignal processing. This theorem states that a convolution\narXiv:2307.14008v1  [cs.CV]  26 Jul 2023\nin one domain mathematically equals the Hadamard prod-\nuct (also known as elementwise product) in its correspond-\ning Fourier domain. This equivalence allows us to frame\nglobal token mixing as a large-kernel convolution in the la-\ntent space and efficiently implement this convolution with\na Hadamard product operation in the frequency domain by\nperforming Fourier transforms on tokens in the latent space.\nBesides large scopes, the adaptability to semantics also\nmatters for token mixing as studied in [14, 9, 74, 1, 76].\nThis means that the weights for token mixing should be\ninstance-adaptive. Moreover, different semantic attributes\nof the learned latent representations distribute in different\nchannels [1, 77].\nThis property poses requirements for\nchannel-specific token mixing wherein the weights of token\nmixing vary across different channels. From the perspective\nof framing global adaptive token mixing as a convolution,\nthe kernel of this convolution operation should be not only\nlarge but also spatially dynamic. However, it is well known\nthat dynamic convolutions are computationally expensive\nin common. Large-kernel dynamic convolutions seem ex-\ntremely prohibitive for efficient/lightweight network de-\nsigns. In this paper, we propose to adopt frequency filter-\ning in the Fourier domain with learned instance-adaptive\nmasks as a mathematical equivalent of token mixing us-\ning large-kernel dynamic convolutions by making use of\nthe aforementioned convolution theorem. This equivalent\ncould reduce the complexity of token mixing from O(N 2)\nto O(N log N) thanks to adopting Fast Fourier Transforms\n(FFT), which is more computationally efficient.\nWith the key insight above, we propose Adaptive Fre-\nquency Filtering (AFF) token mixer. In this neural operator,\nthe latent representations (i.e., a set of tokens) are trans-\nferred from its original latent space to a frequency space\nvia a 2D discrete Fourier transform applied spatially. In this\nway, we get the frequency representations whose spatial po-\nsitions correspond to different frequency components. We\nadopt an extremely lightweight network to learn instance-\nadaptive masks from these frequency representations, and\nthen calculate the Hadamard product between the learned\nmasks and the frequency representations for adaptive fre-\nquency filtering. The filtered representations are transferred\nback to the original latent space via an inverse Fourier trans-\nform. The features after this inverse transform could be\nviewed as the results of token mixing with depthwise convo-\nlution kernels whose spatial dimensions are as large as those\nof latent representations (i.e., the token set). According to\nthe convolution theorem [47], our proposed operation math-\nematically equals to taking the tensors of applying an in-\nverse Fourier transform to the learned masks in the Fourier\ndomain as the corresponding kernel weights and perform\nconvolution with this kernel in the original domain. De-\ntailed introduction, demonstration and analysis are given in\nsubsequent sections.\nFurthermore, we take the proposed AFF token mixer\nas the primary neural operator and assemble it into an\nAFF block together with a plain channel mixer. AFF blocks\nserve as the basic units for constructing efficient vision\nbackbone, dubbed AFFNet. We evaluate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of our proposed AFF token mixer by con-\nducting extensive ablation study and comparison across di-\nverse vision tasks and model scales.\nOur contributions can be summarized in the following:\n\u2022 We reveal that adaptive frequency filtering in the latent\nspace can serve as efficient global token mixing with large\ndynamic kernels, and propose Adaptive Frequency Filter-\ning (AFF) token mixer.\n\u2022 We conduct theoretical analysis and empirical study to\ncompare our proposed AFF token mixer with other re-\nlated frequency-domain neural operators from the per-\nspective of information fusion for figuring out what really\nmatters for the effects of token mixing.\n\u2022 We take AFF token mixer as the primary neural op-\nerator to build a lightweight vision backbone AFFNet.\nAFFNet achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy and effi-\nciency trade-offs compared to other lightweight network\ndesigns across a broad range of vision tasks. An experi-\nmental evidence is provided in Fig.1.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Token Mixing in Deep Learning\nMainstream neural network families, i.e., CNNs, Trans-\nformers, MLPs, differ in their ways of token mixing, as\ndetailed in [75]. CNNs [52] mix tokens with the learned\nweights of convolution kernels where the spatial kernel\nsize determines the mixing scope. Commonly, the weights\nare deterministic and the scope is commonly a local one.\nTransformers [70, 17] mix tokens with pairwise correla-\ntions between query and key tokens in a local [43, 13] or\nglobal[17, 67] range. These weights are semantic-adaptive\nbut computationally expensive due to the O(N 2) complex-\nity. MLPs commonly mix tokens with deterministic weights\nin manually designed scopes [6, 66, 65, 85] wherein the\nweights are the network parameters.\nThis work aims to\ndesign a generally applicable token mixer for lightweight\nneural networks with three merits: computation-efficient,\nsemantic-adaptive and effective in the global scope.\n2.2. Lightweight Neural Networks\nLightweight neural network designs have been of high\nvalues for practical deployments. CNNs, Transformers, and\nMLPs have their own efficient designs.\nMobileNets se-\nries [30, 59, 29] introduce depthwise and pointwise con-\nvolutions as well as modified architectures for improving\nthe efficiency. Shufflenet series [88, 44] further improve\npointwise convolution via shuffle operations. MobileViT\n[48] combines lightweight MobileNet block and multi-head\nself-attention blocks.\nIts follow-up versions further im-\nprove it with a linear-complexity self-attention method [49].\nBesides, there are many works reducing the complexity\nof self-attention via reducing the region of token mixing\n[43, 13, 53, 34] or various mathematical approximations\n[23, 78, 45]. Many efficient MLPs limit the scope of to-\nken mixing to horizontal and vertical stripes [86, 28, 63] or\na manually designed region [7].\n2.3. Frequency-domain Deep Learning\nFrequency-domain analysis has been a classical tool for\nconventional signal processing [2, 55] for a long time. Re-\ncently, frequency-domain methods begin to be introduced\nto the field of deep learning for analyzing the optimiza-\ntion [80, 82] and generalization [71, 79] capabilities of\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs). Besides these, frequency-\ndomain methods are integrated into DNNs to learn non-\nlocal [12, 57, 37, 21] or domain-generalizable [39] repre-\nsentations. Our proposed method might be similar to them\nat first glance but actually differs from them in both mod-\nelling perspectives and architecture designs.\nThese five\nworks propose different frequency-domain operations by\nintroducing convolutions [12], elementwise multiplication\nwith trainable network parameters [57], matrix multiplica-\ntion with trainable parameters [37], groupwise MLP layers\n[21] and elementwise multiplication with spatial instance-\nadaptive masks [39] to frequency-domain representations,\nrespectively. All of them are not designed for the same pur-\npose with ours. We provide detailed mathematical analysis\non their shortcomings as token mixers and conduct exten-\nsive experimental comparisons in the following sections.\n3. Method\nWe first describe a unified formulation of token mixing,\nthen introduce our proposed Adaptive Frequency Filtering\n(AFF) token mixer. We further analyze what properties mat-\nter for a frequency-domain operation in terms of its effects\non token mixing. We finally introduce AFFNet which is a\nlightweight backbone with AFF token mixer as its core.\n3.1. Unified Formulation of Token Mixing\nToken mixing is of high importance since learning non-\nlocal representations is critical for visual understanding\n[73, 17, 67]. In most mainstream neural networks, the in-\nput image is firstly patchified into a feature tensor X \u2208\nRH\u00d7W \u00d7C whose spatial resolution is H \u00d7W and the num-\nber of channels is C. This feature tensor could be viewed\nas a set of tokens, in which each token can be denoted as\nx \u2208 R1\u00d71\u00d7C. The updated token for a query xq after token\nmixing in its contextual region N(xq) can be formulated in\na unified form:\n\u02c6xq =\nX\ni\u2208N (xq)\n\u03c9i\u2192q \u00d7 \u03d5(xi),\n(1)\nwhere \u02c6xq refers to the updated xq and xi refers to the tokens\nin N(xq). \u03d5(\u00b7) denotes the embeding functions. \u03c9i\u2192q rep-\nresents the weights of information fusion from token xi to\nthe updated xq. The symbol \u00d7 could be Hadamard product\nor matrix multiplication.\nWe revisit the prevailing token mixing methods in dif-\nferent types of network architectures in terms of their ef-\nfectiveness and efficiency. For CNNs, tokens are mixed by\nmatrix multiplication with deterministic network parame-\nters as the mixing weights. Here, the kernel sizes of convo-\nlutions determine the scopes of token mixing. This makes\nmixing in a global scope quite costly due to the quadrat-\nically increased parameters and FLOPs as the kernel size\nincreases. Transformers mix tokens with pairwise correla-\ntions between query and key tokens. Its computational com-\nplexity is O(N 2) (N is the total number of tokens), limiting\nits applications in lightweight networks. Like CNNs, MLPs\nalso mix tokens with deterministic network parameters. The\nscope of token mixing in advanced MLPs [6, 66, 65, 85] are\ncommonly manually design, where the globality comes at\nthe cost of huge computational complexity. They are all not\nspecifically designed for lightweight neural networks.\nThis work aims to deign a computationally efficient,\nsemantically adaptive and global-scope token mixer for\nlightweight networks.\nThis requires a large N(xq) and\ninstance-adaptive \u03c9i\u2192q with less network parameters and\nlow computation costs as possible.\n3.2. Adaptive Frequency Filtering Token Mixer\nWe apply the convolution theorem [47, 56, 51] to deep\nlearning for designing a token mixer with aforementioned\nmerits for lightweight neural networks. Based on this the-\norem, we reveal that adaptive frequency filters can serve\nas efficient global token mixers. In the following, we in-\ntroduce its mathematical modelling, architecture design and\nthe equivalence between them for our proposed token mixer.\nModelling.\nTo simplify understanding, we frame token\nmixing in the form of global convolution, succinctly de-\nnoted by \u02c6X = K\u2217X. For the query token at position (h, w),\ni.e., X(h, w), Eq.(1) can be reformulated as:\n\u02c6X(h, w) =\n\u230a H\n2 \u230b\nX\nh\u2032=\u2212\u230a H\n2 \u230b\n\u230a W\n2 \u230b\nX\nw\u2032=\u2212\u230a W\n2 \u230b\nK(h\u2032, w\u2032)X(h\u2212h\u2032, w\u2212w\u2032),\n(2)\nwhere \u02c6X(h, w) represents the updated token for X(h, w)\nafter token mixing. H and W are the height and weight of\nthe input tensor, respectively. K(h\u2032, w\u2032) denotes the weights\nDownsampling\nStage 1\nConv\nStem\nDownsampling\nAFF \nBlock\nFusion\nStage 2\n\u00d7N2\nDownsampling\nAFF \nBlock\nFusion\nStage 3\n\u00d7N3\nFFT\niFFT\nGroup \nLinear\nGroup \nLinear\nReLU\nFFT\niFFT\nGroup \nLinear\nReLU\nCircular Padding\n\u00d7N1\nLayer Norm\nChannel\nMixer\nLayer Norm\nAFF\nToken\nMixer\nAFF Block\nEquivalent\nDynamic Large-kernel Mixers\n(original-space convolution)\nAdaptive Frequency Filters\n(frequency-space manipulation)\nLinear\nLinear\nFusion\nConcat\nGroup \nLinear\nH\n8 \u00d7 W\n8 \u00d7 C1\nH\n16 \u00d7 W\n16 \u00d7 C2\nH\n32 \u00d7 W\n32 \u00d7 C3\nFigure 2. Illustration of our proposed AFF token mixer and its corresponding network AFFNet. The AFF token mixer is implemented by\nadaptive frequency filters at the bottom left and mathematically equals to the mixing operation at the bottom right. This operation can be\nviewed as token mixing with a large-kernel dynamic convolution where the kernel weights are inferred by the sub-network as shown in the\nbottom right sub-figure.\nfor token mixing, implemented by a global convolution ker-\nnel which has the same spatial size with X. The padding\noperation for X is omitted here for simplicity and the spe-\ncific padding method is introduced in the subsequent parts.\nWith the expectation for our proposed token mixer as\na semantic-adaptive and global-scope one, the weights K\nfor token mixing should be adaptive to X and of large\nspatial size. As illustrated by the lower right subfigure in\nFig.2, a straightforward way for enabling K adaptive to\nX is to implement it with a dynamic convolution kernel\n[31, 9, 26, 87], i.e., inferring weights of K with X as the in-\nputs of a sub-network. However, adopting dynamic convo-\nlutions is usually computational costly, even more so, when\nusing large-kernel ones. This thus imposes big challenges in\ndesigning an efficient token mixer for lightweight networks\nalong this way. Next, we introduce an efficient method as\nits equivalent implementation by making use of the convo-\nlution theorem [47].\nArchitecture.\nThe convolution theorem [47, 51, 56] for\ninverse Fourier transform states that a convolution in one\ndomain mathematically equals the Hadamard product in its\ncorresponding Fourier domain. This inspires us to propose\na lightweight and fast architecture (illustrated by the lower\nleft part of Fig.2) as an extremely efficient implementation\nof our modelling above.\nGiven feature X \u2208 RH\u00d7W \u00d7C, i.e., a set of tokens in\nthe latent space, we adopt Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to\nobtain the corresponding frequency representations XF by\nXF = F(X). The detailed formulation of F(\u00b7) is:\nXF (u, v) =\nH\u22121\nX\nh=0\nW \u22121\nX\nw=0\nX(h, w)e\u22122\u03c0i(uh+vw).\n(3)\nAs indicated by Eq.(3), features of different spatial posi-\ntions in XF correspond to different frequency components\nof X. They incorporate global information from X with a\ntransform of O(N log N) complexity.\nWe apply the aforementioned convolution theorem to\nachieve efficient global token mixing for X by filtering\nits frequency representation XF with a learnable instance-\nadaptive mask. We further adopt inverse FFT to the filtered\nXF for getting the updated feature representations \u02c6X in the\noriginal latent space. This process can be formulated as:\n\u02c6X = F\u22121[M(F(X)) \u2299 F(X)],\n(4)\nwhere M(F(X)) is the mask tensor learned from XF ,\nwhich has the same shape with XF . As shown in the lower\nleft subfigure in Fig.2, to make the network lightweight as\npossible, M(\u00b7) is efficiently implemented by a group 1 \u00d7 1\nconvolution (linear) layer, followed by a ReLU function and\nanother group linear layer. \u2299 denotes Hadamard product,\nalso known as elementwise multiplication, and F\u22121(\u00b7) de-\nnotes inverse Fourier transform. Here, \u02c6X can be viewed as\nthe results of global adaptive token mixing for X, which is\nmathematically equivalent to adopting a large-size dynamic\nconvolution kernel as the weights for token mixing. The\nequivalence is introduced in the following.\nEquivalence.\nThe convolution theorem still applies to the\nlatent representations of neural networks.\nThe multipli-\ncation of two signals in the Fourier domain equals to the\nFourier transform of a convolution of these two signals in\ntheir original domain. When applying this to the frequency-\ndomain multiplication in Fig.(2), we know that:\nM(F(X)) \u2299 F(X) = F{F\u22121[M(F(X))] \u2217 X}.\n(5)\nCombining Eq.(4) and Eq.(5), it is easy to get that:\n\u02c6X = F\u22121[M(F(X))] \u2217 X,\n(6)\nwhere F\u22121(M(F(X))) is a tensor of the same shape with\nX, which could be viewed as a dynamic depthwise convo-\nlution kernel as large as X in spatial. This kernel is adaptive\nto the contents of X. Due to the property of Fourier trans-\nform [47], a circular padding is adopted to X here as shown\nin Fig.2. So far, we understand why the operation in Eq.(4)\nmathematically equals to a global-scope token mixing op-\neration with semantic-adaptive weights.\n3.3. Analysis\nAs introduced in Sec.2.3, there have been some studies\napplying frequency-domain methods to DNN for learning\nnon-local or domain-generalizable representations in previ-\nous works [12, 57, 37, 21, 39]. They are all designed for\ndifferent purposes with ours. In this section, we revisit the\nfrequency-domain operations in these works from the per-\nspective of token mixing and compare our design with them.\nFFC [12] and AFNO [21] adopt linear (also known\nas 1 \u00d7 1 convolution) layers with non-linear activation\nfunctions to the representations in the frequency domain.\nSpecifically, AFNO [21] adopt a linear layer followed\nby a ReLU function, another linear layer and a Soft-\nShrink1 function to the frequency representations after\nFourier transforms, which can be briefly described as\nFFT\u2192Linear\u2192ReLU\u2192Linear\u2192SoftShrink\u2192iFFT. Here,\nlinear layer and Fourier transform are in fact commutative,\ni.e., Linear(F(X))=F(Linear(X)), which can be proved\nwith the distributive property of matrix multiplication by:\nWLinear\nH\u22121\nX\nh=0\nW \u22121\nX\nw=0\nX(h, w)e\u22122\u03c0i(uh+vw)\n=\nH\u22121\nX\nh=0\nW \u22121\nX\nw=0\n(WLinearX(h, w)) e\u22122\u03c0i(uh+vw),\n(7)\n1https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/\ntorch.nn.Softshrink.html\nProperties\nFFC\nAFNO\nGFNet\nFNO\nDFF\nOurs\nSemantic-adaptive\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2713\nVariable-size input\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2713\nChannel-wise mix\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2713\nTable 1. Comparisons of our proposed AFF token mixer with other\nfrequency-domain neural operators in terms of three important\nproperties for token mixing.\nwhere WLinear denotes the parameters of a linear layer.\nWe know that successive Fourier transform and its inverse\ntransform equal to an identity function. Thus, the architec-\nture of AFNO could be rewrote as: FFT\u2192Linear\u2192ReLU\u2192\n(iFFT\u2192FFT)\u2192Linear\u2192SoftShrink\u2192iFFT. Upon the com-\nmutative law proved in Eq.(7), we can know this architec-\nture is in fact equivalent to Linear\u2192FFT\u2192ReLU\u2192iFFT\n\u2192Linear\u2192FFT\u2192SoftShrink\u2192iFFT. Now, it is easy to\nfind that only ReLU and SoftShrink functions remain in the\nFourier domain. These two deterministic functions cannot\nachieve semantic-adaptive filtering as our proposed AFF to-\nken mixer does. The same problem also exists in FFC [12].\nGFNet [57] and FNO [37] multiply the representations\nafter Fourier transforms with trainable network parame-\nters. GFNet [57] adopts elementwise multiplication while\nFNO [37] uses matrix multiplication. Both of them are not\nsemantic-adaptive since the masks implemented by network\nparameters are shared over different instances and fixed af-\nter training. Besides, they cannot support for variable-size\ninputs since the shapes of these masks are fixed, leading to\nthe lack of flexibility in their practical using.\nDFF [39] learns a spatial mask to filter out frequency\ncomponents that are not conductive to domain generaliza-\ntion. It is proposed for domain generalization problems in\nwhich only spatial mask is needed as studied in [39] since\ndifferent spatial position of the features after a Fourier trans-\nform correspond to different frequency components. How-\never, it is not competent as a token mixer since the learned\nmask is shared along the channel dimension. This means\nthat the weights for its equivalent token mixing are shared\nfor different channels. However, different channels com-\nmonly represent different semantic attributes [1, 77], thus\nrequiring adaptive weights in token mixing.\nWe summarize the comparisons of different frequency-\ndomain designs in terms of three important properties for\ntoken mixing in Table 1. The results of experimental verifi-\ncation are in Table 5 as follows.\n3.4. Network Architectures\nWith our AFF token mixer as the core neural operator,\nwe introduce its corresponding module and network design.\nAFF Block\nFor the output Xl\u22121 of the (l \u2212 1)-th AFF\nBlock, we adopt the commonly used module MBConv [49,\n60, 61, 48, 68] with Layer Normalization (LN) for channel\nmixing, then feed it to our proposed AFF token mixer for\nglobal token mixing to get the output of l-th AFF block.\nSkip-connections for channel mixing and token mixing are\nadopted to facilitate model training. The entire architecture\nof AFF Block can be formulated as:\n\u02c6Xl = MBConvl \u0000LN\n\u0000Xl\u2212l\u0001\u0001\n+ Xl\u2212l\nXl = AFFl \u0010\nLN\n\u0010\n\u02c6Xl\u0011\u0011\n+ \u02c6Xl\n(8)\nAFFNet\nWe stack multiple AFF blocks for constructing a\nlightweight backbone network, namely AFFNet, as shown\nin Fig.2. Following the common practices [48, 49], we em-\nploy a convolution stem for tokenization and a plain fusion\nfor combining local and global features at each stage. We\nbuild three versions of AFFNet with different numbers of\nchannels, yielding different parameter scales. AFFNet and\nits tiny (AFFNet-T) and extremely tiny (AFFNet-ET) ver-\nsions have 5.5M, 2.6M and 1.4M parameters, respectively.\nTheir detailed configurations are in the Supplementary.\n4. Experiments\nWe evaluate our proposed AFF token mixer by conduct-\ning comparisons with the state-of-the-art lightweight net-\nworks and extensive ablation studies for its design.\n4.1. Image Classification\nSettings.\nWe train different versions of our proposed\nlightweight networks AFFNet as backbones on ImageNet-\n1k dataset [58] from scratch. All models are trained for 300\nepochs on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs with a batch size of 1024.\nMore implementation details are in the Supplementary.\nResults.\nWe report the comparison results between our\nproposed AFFNet and other SOTA lightweight models in\nTable 2. We observe that our AFFNet outperforms other\nlightweight networks with comparable model sizes in Top-\n1 accuracy. The AFFNet reaches 79.8% Top-1 accuracy\nwith 5.5M parameters and 1.5G FLOPs.\nOur extremely\ntiny model AFFNet-ET attains 73% Top-1 accuracy with\nsorely 1.4M and 0.4G FLOPs. As a result, AFFNet achieves\nthe best trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.\nTo\nshow the comparison results more intuitively, we illustrate\nthe accuracy and efficiency trade-offs of our AFFNet and\nsome advanced lightweight models with global token mix-\ners in Fig. 1. Thanks to AFF token mixer, AFFNet is su-\nperior to them by a clear margin across different model\nscales.\nIts superiority is especially significant when the\nmodel is extremely tiny, which demonstrates the effective-\nness of AFF token mixer on information fusion at very low\ncosts.

These exhibit the effectiveness of\nour proposed method on dense prediction tasks.\n4.4. Ablation Study\nEffectiveness and complexity of AFF token mixer.\nWe\nanalyze the effectiveness and complexity of our proposed\nAFF token mixer by comparing AFFNet with the Base.\nmodel in which all AFF token mixers are replaced with\nidentity functions.\nAs shown in Table 4, all AFF token\nmixers in AFFNet only requires 0.3M parameter increase\n(< 6%) and 0.2G FLOPs increase (\u223c 15%) relative to the\nbaseline and improves the Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K\nby 1.9%. Comparing to the model with one 3\u00d73 convolu-\ntion layer as the token mixer, i.e., Base.+Conv-Mixer (3\u00d73),\nAFFNet delivers 1.2% Top-1 accuracy improvements with\nabout only half of parameters and FLOPs. This strongly\ndemonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our pro-\nposed method for token mixing in lightweight networks.\nOriginal vs.\nfrequency domain.\nWe compare apply-\ning the same adaptive filtering operations in original do-\nmain and in frequency domain. We discard the all Fourier\nand inverse Fourier transforms and remain others the same\nas AFFNet, i.e., Base.+AFF w/o FFT in Table 4.\nOur\nAFFNet clearly outperforms it by 1.4% Top-1 accuracy\nwith the same model complexity. Applying adaptive filter-\ning in the original domain is even weaker than convolutional\ntoken mixer, which indicates that only adaptive frequency\nfilters can serve as effeicient global token mixers.\nComparisons of different frequency operations.\nWe\ncompare the frequency operation design in AFF token mixer\nwith those in previous works [37, 57, 12, 39, 21] in terms of\nMethod\nParam (M)\nFLOPs (G)\nTop-1\nBase.\n5.2\n1.3\n77.9\nBase. + AFNO [21]\n5.5\n1.5\n78.8\nBase. + GFN [57]\n6.5\n1.5\n79.1\nBase. + FFC [12]\n7.7\n1.7\n79.1\nBase. + DFF [39]\n7.7\n1.7\n79.3\nBase. + FNO [37]\n141.0\n1.5\n79.7\nBase. + AFF w.

The results are in Table 5.\nAs analyzed in Sec.3.3, FFC [12] and AFNO [21] actu-\nally perform filtering with deterministic functions, resulting\nin the lack of the adaptivity to semantics. The frequency-\ndomain operations in them are both obviously inferior to\nours. Moreover, our operation design is also clearly better\nthan those in GFN [57] and FNO [37] since they perform fil-\ntering with network parameters implemented masks. These\nmasks are fixed after training and lead to a large increase in\nparameters (Base.+FNO has more than 25\u00d7 parameters as\nours). Note that the implementation of FNO [37] with un-\nshared fully connected layers for each frequency component\nresults in a significant increase in the number of parameters.\nDFF [39] is designed for filtering out the frequency com-\nponents adverse to domain generalization, thus requiring a\nspatial mask only. Our AFFNet is superior to Base.+DFF\nby 0.5% with fewer parameters and FLOPs, demonstrating\nthe importance of channel-wise mixing. This will be further\nverified with a fairer comparison. These existing frequency-\ndomain operations might be similar with our proposed one\nat the first glance, but they are designed for different pur-\nposes and perform worse than ours as token mixers. When\nreplacing the Hadamard product in our method with a sum-\nmation operation, the Top-1 accuracy drops by 1.0% since\nthe equivalence introduced in Sec.3.2 no longer holds.\nThe importance of channel-specific token mixing.\nWe\nhave preliminarily demonstrated this by comparing the\nfrequency-domain operations in DFF [39] and ours. Con-\nsidering their masks are learned with different networks,\nhere, we conduct a fairer comparison by adopting an av-\nerage pooling along the channels of the learned masks in\nAFF token mixer. As shown in Table 6, frequency filtering\nwith the masks of a shape of 1\u00d7H\u00d7W lead to 0.5% accu-\nracy drop with the same model complexities, verifying the\nimportance of channel-specific token mixing. This is be-\ncause different semantic attributes of the learned latent rep-\nresentations distribute in different channels [1, 77], thus re-\nMask Shape\nParam (M)\nFLOPs (G)\nTop-1\n1\u00d7H\u00d7W\n5.5\n1.5\n79.3\nC\u00d7H\u00d7W\n5.5\n1.5\n79.8\nTable 6.

Besides,\nit delivers the same accuracy with Base.+DFF in Table 5.\nThis indicates that the network architectures here are in fact\nnot dominating factors for the effects of token mixing, al-\nlowing us to use a lightweight one.\nComparisons of hyper-parameter choices.\nAs shown in\nFig.2, we adopt two group linear layers (also known as 1\u00d71\nconvolution layers) with ReLU to learn the masks for our\nproposed adaptive frequency filtering. As shown in Table\n7, improving the kernel size cannot further improve the per-\nformance but leads to larger model complexities. Moreover,\nwe keep the spatial kernel size as 1\u00d71 while using differ-\nent group numbers. When Ngroup=C, the Top-1 accuracy\ndrops by 0.4%, in which depthwise convolutions are used\nso that the contexts among different channels are under-\nexploited for inferring the weights of token mixing. When\nNgroup=1, it means that regular convolution/linear layers\nare used, which slightly improve the Top-1 accuracy by\n0.1% at the expense of 40% parameters increase and 33.3%\nFLOPs increase. This setting explores more contexts but\nresults in a worse accuracy and efficiency trade-off.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we reveal that adaptive frequency filters\ncan serve as efficient global token mixers in a mathemat-\nically equivalent manner.\nUpon this, we propose Adap-\ntive Frequency Filtering (AFF) token mixer to achieve low-\ncost adaptive token mixing in the global scope.\nMore-\nover, we take AFF token mixers as primary neural op-\nerators to build a lightweight backbone network, dubbed\nAFFNet. AFFNet achieves SOTA accuracy and efficiency\ntrade-offs compared to other lightweight network designs\nacross multiple vision tasks. Besides, we revisit the existing\nfrequency-domain neural operations for figuring out what\nmatters in their designs for token mixing. We hope this\nwork could inspire more interplay between conventional\nsignal processing and deep learning technologies.\nReferences\n[1] David Bau, Jun-Yan Zhu, Hendrik Strobelt, Agata Lapedriza,\nBolei Zhou, and Antonio Torralba.

Detailed Network Architectures\nAs introduced in our manuscript, we build three versions\nof our proposed hierarchical backbone AFFNet with differ-\nent channel dimensions, namely AFFNet, AFFNet-T and\nAFFNet-ET, respectively.\nHere, we provide the detailed\nmodel configurations of them in Table 8. Specifically, fol-\nlowing commonly used designs [48, 49], we adopt a convo-\nlution stem for tokenization, which consists of a 3\u00d73 con-\nvolution layer with a stride of 2, followed by four MBConv\nlayers. MBConv is short for the Mobile Convolution Block\nin [59] with a kernel size of 3. After tokenization, three\nstages are cascaded as the main body of AFFNet, where\neach stage is composed of a MBConv layer with stride 2 for\ndown-sampling in spatial and Ni AFF Block. Specifically,\nwe set N1 = 2, N2 = 4 and N3 = 3.\n7. Detailed Introduction for Dataset\nImageNet [58] is a large-scale dataset with over 1.2 mil-\nlion images and 1000 object categories for the visual recog-\nnition challenge. It serves as the most widely used dataset\nfor image classification. The images in this dataset are of\nvarying sizes and resolutions, and include various objects\nin diverse backgrounds. We train our models on Imagenet-\n1k dataset from scratch to illustrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our proposed models on image classification.\nMS-COCO [40] (abbreviated as COCO) is a widely\nused benchmark dataset for object detection, instance seg-\nmentation, and keypoint detection tasks. It contains more\nthan 200,000 images and 80 object categories, annotated\nwith bounding boxes, masks, and keypoints. The objects in\nthis dataset are diverse and challenging, including people,\nanimals, vehicles, household items, etc..\nADE20k [89] is a dataset consisting of 20,210 images\ncovering a wide range of indoor and outdoor scenes. The\nimages in this dataset are annotated with pixel-level labels\nfor 150 semantic categories, such as sky, road, person and\nso on. This dataset is widely used for evaluating the perfor-\nmance of deep models on semantic segmentation and scene\nunderstanding.\nPASCAL VOC 2012 [18] (abbreviated as VOC) is a\nwidely used benchmark for object recognition, object de-\ntection, and semantic segmentation. It consists of 20 ob-\nject categories and contains more than 11,000 images with\npixel-level annotations for object boundaries and semantic\ncategories. This dataset is challenging due to the large vari-\nability in object appearances and the presence of occlusions\nand clutter within it.\n8. Detailed Experiment Settings\nWe provide detailed experiment settings for different\ntasks in Table 9, including the detailed configurations for\nmodel, data and training.\n9. More Experiment Results\n9.1. Quantitative Results\nRunning speed evaluation.\nWe report the model speeds\nof our proposed AFFNet models on mobile devices\n(iPhone) and GPUs, and compare them with other ad-\nvanced lightweight models that incorporate global token\nmixers in Table 10. Models with similar Top-1 accuracy\nare grouped together for clear comparison. The latency re-\nsults are equivalently measured by CoreML2 on an iPhone\nwith a batch size of 1. The throughput results are mea-\nsured with TorchScript3 on an A100 GPU (batch size =\n128). As shown in Table 10, thanks to the AFF token mixer,\nAFFNet outperforms other network designs by a clear mar-\ngin across different model scales.\nOn GPUs (NVIDIA\nA100), AFFNet achieves 0.4% Top-1 accuracy improve-\nment with 179 image/s lager throughput compared to the\nsecond fastest model EdgeNext-S. On the mobile device\n(iPhone), AFFNet also surpasses the second fastest model\nmobilevitv2 by 1.7% Top-1 accuracy with 0.3 ms less la-\ntency. These results reflect high effectiveness and efficiency\nof our proposed method.\nEvaluation on more downstream task frameworks.\nFor\nthe experiments reported in our main paper (e.g., Ta-\nble 3), we adopt the most commonly used task frameworks,\ni.e., SSD and Deeplabv3, in accordance with recent stud-\nies [59, 48, 49, 46] on general-purpose lightweight back-\nbone design to ensure a fair comparison. Moreover, to eval-\nuate the compatibility of AFFNet with more downstream\ntask frameworks, we incorporated AFFNet into more down-\nstream task frameworks [19, 62, 22, 81] as their encoders.\nThese frameworks involve multi-stage/scale feature inter-\nactions via some task-specific architecture designs.\nBy\nutilizing AFFNet as the encoders, these models perform\nconsistently better compared to their vanilla versions in\nmAP@COCO and mIOU@ADE20K, as presented in Ta-\nble 11. There results further demonstrate that our proposed\nAFFNet is compatible with diverse downstream task frame-\nworks and generally applicable.\nComparisons of different frequency transforms.\nWe\ninvestigate the effectiveness of adopting different frequency\ntransforms in implementing our proposed AFF token mixer.\n2https://github.com/apple/coremltools\n3https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/\nmaster/torch/csrc/jit/OVERVIEW.md\nLayer / Block\nResolution\nDown-sample Ratio\nNumber of Blocks\nNumber of Channels\nAFFNet-ET\nAFFNet-T\nAFFNet\nImage\n2562\n-\n1\n16\n16\n16\nConv Stem\n1282\n\u2193 2\n1\n32\n32\n32\n642\n\u2193 2\n4\n48\n48\n64\nDown-sampling\n322\n\u2193 2\n1\n64\n96\n128\nAFF Block\n322\n-\n2\n64\n96\n128\nDown-sampling\n162\n\u2193 2\n1\n104\n160\n256\nAFF Block\n162\n-\n4\n104\n160\n256\nDown-sampling\n82\n\u2193 2\n1\n144\n192\n320\nAFF Block\n82\n-\n3\n144\n192\n320\nParameters\n-\n-\n-\n1.4M\n2.6M\n5.5M\nFLOPs\n-\n-\n-\n0.4G\n0.8G\n1.5G\nTable 8.

While such datasets\nhave been a boon for the community, they each use custom and unique data formats\nand APIs, making it cumbersome for researchers to train and evaluate methods\nacross multiple datasets. To remedy this, we present trajdata: a unified interface\nto multiple human trajectory datasets. At its core, trajdata provides a simple,\nuniform, and efficient representation and API for trajectory and map data. As\na demonstration of its capabilities, in this work we conduct a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation of existing trajectory datasets, providing users with a rich\nunderstanding of the data underpinning much of current pedestrian and AV motion\nforecasting research, and proposing suggestions for future datasets from these\ninsights. trajdata is permissively licensed (Apache 2.0) and can be accessed\nonline at https://github.com/NVlabs/trajdata.\n1\nIntroduction\nResearch in trajectory forecasting (i.e., predicting where an agent will be in the future) has grown\nsignificantly in recent years, partially owing to the success of deep learning methods on the task [1];\navailability of new large-scale, real-world datasets (see Fig. 1); and investment in its deployment\nwithin domains such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and social robots [10, 11, 12].\nIn addition, recent dataset releases have held associated prediction challenges which have periodically\nbenchmarked the field and spurned new developments [13, 14, 15, 16]. While this has been a boon for\nresearch progress, each dataset has a unique data format and development API, making it cumbersome\nfor researchers to train and evaluate methods across multiple datasets. For instance, the recent Waymo\nOpen Motion dataset employs binary TFRecords [17] which differ significantly from nuScenes\u2019\nforeign-key format [18] and Woven Planet (Lyft) Level 5\u2019s compressed zarr files [19]. The variety\nof data formats has also hindered research on topics which either require or greatly benefit from\nmulti-dataset comparisons, such as prediction model generalization (e.g., [20, 21]). To remedy this,\nwe present trajdata: a unified interface to multiple human trajectory datasets.\nContributions. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we introduce a standard and simple data\nformat for trajectory and map data, as well as an extensible API to access and transform such data\nfor research use. Second, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing trajectory\ndatasets, providing users with a richer understanding of the data underpinning much of pedestrian\nand AV motion forecasting research. Finally, we leverage insights from these analyses to provide\nsuggestions for future dataset releases.\nPreprint.

Initial trajectory forecasting research employed video motion tracking\ndatasets for benchmarking, primarily due to the availability of annotated agent positions over time.\nOf these, the ETH [22] and UCY [23] pedestrian datasets were among the most widely-used [1],\ncontaining a total of 1536 pedestrians and challenging behaviors such as couples walking together,\ngroups crossing each other, and groups forming and dispersing. Soon after the successful applica-\ntion of deep learning models to pedestrian trajectory forecasting [24], and as data needs grew in\nautonomous driving research and industry, numerous large-scale datasets have emerged containing\nsignificantly more heterogeneous-agent interactive scenarios (e.g., between vehicles and pedestrians)\nin urban environments. Fig. 1 visualizes the scale, collection, and annotation strategy of such datasets,\nwith a comprehensive review of earlier human motion datasets available in [1, 25]. In particular, the\ngradual shift from human annotation to autolabeling can be seen, with the recent large-scale Yandex\nShifts [26], Waymo Open Motion [17], and nuPlan [27] datasets employing powerful autolabeling\npipelines to accurately label sensor data collected by vehicle fleets at scale.\nMulti-Dataset Benchmarking. While the increase in datasets and associated challenges has bol-\nstered research, their unique formats increase the complexity of evaluating methods across datasets,\ncomplicating efforts to analyze, e.g., prediction model generalization. To address this issue for\npedestrian motion data, OpenTraj [25] created dataloaders for different pedestrian motion datasets\nas part of its effort to evaluate and compare motion complexity across pedestrian datasets. More\nrecently, TrajNet++ [28] and Atlas [29] present multi-dataset benchmarks to systematically evaluate\nhuman motion trajectory prediction algorithms in a unified framework. While these efforts have\nprovided the community with multi-dataset benchmarks, they are primarily focused on pedestrian\ndata. In contrast, trajdata tackles the standardization of both pedestrian and autonomous vehicle\ndatasets, including additional data modalities such as maps.\n3\ntrajdata: A Unified Interface to Multiple Human Trajectory Datasets\ntrajdata is a software package that efficiently compiles multiple disparate dataset formats into one\ncanonical format, with an API to access and transform that data for use in downstream frameworks\n(e.g., PyTorch [30], which is natively supported). Currently, trajdata supports 8 diverse datasets,\ncomprising 3,216 hours of data, 200+ million unique agents, and 10+ locations across 7 countries\n(see Table 1). To date, trajdata has been extensively used in research on trajectory forecasting [21],\npedestrian [31] and vehicle [32, 33] simulation, and AV motion planning [34, 35].\n3.1\nStandardized Trajectory and Map Formats\nTrajectories. For each dataset, trajdata extracts position, velocity, acceleration, heading, and\nextent (length, width, height) information for all agents in standard SI units (see Fig. 2). In order\nto support a variety of dataset formats, trajdata has minimal base data requirements: As long as\nagent positions (i.e., x, y coordinates) are provided, all other dynamic information can be derived\nautomatically. If entire dynamic quantities (e.g., velocity) are not captured in the original dataset,\ntrajdata uses finite differences to compute derivatives by default. Further, missing data between\n2\nTable 1: Datasets currently supported by trajdata.

Right: Agent trajectories from the nuScenes [18] dataset\nvisualized on the scene\u2019s VectorMap, containing all of trajdata\u2019s core map elements.\ntimesteps is imputed via linear interpolation. trajdata internally represents and stores trajectory data\nas tabular data frames, allowing for advanced indexing and data grouping depending on user queries\nand the use of efficient open-source tabular data storage frameworks such as Apache Arrow [36].\nNote that each of these default choices (finite differences, linear interpolation, and tabular data frames)\ncan be changed by the end user.\nMaps. To retain the most information from high-definition (HD) dataset maps, trajdata adopts\na polyline representation for map data. This choice matches the vast majority of modern trajec-\ntory datasets which provide vector map data and makes them immediately compatible with our\nformat. Currently, there are four core map elements: RoadLane, RoadArea, PedCrosswalk, and\nPedWalkway. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a RoadLane represents a driveable road lane with a centerline\nand optional left and right boundaries. A RoadArea represents other driveable areas of roads which\nare not part of lanes, e.g., parking lots or shoulders. A PedCrosswalk denotes a marked area where\npedestrians can cross the road. Finally, a PedWalkway marks sidewalks adjacent to roads. Of these,\nonly RoadLane elements are required to be extracted, other elements are optional (they are absent in\nsome datasets). Our map format additionally supports lane connectivity information in the form of\nleft/right adjacent lanes (i.e., lanes accessible by left/right lane changes) and successor/predecessor\nlanes (i.e., lanes that continue from / lead into the current lane following the road direction).\nEach map element is designed to be compatible with popular computational geometry packages, such\nas Shapely [37], enabling efficient set-theoretic queries to calculate, e.g., road boundary violations.\nBy default, trajdata serializes map data using Google protocol buffers [38], and, in particular, only\nstores neighboring position differences for efficiency, similar to the implementation used in [19].\nDynamic traffic light information is also supported, and trajdata makes use of a separate data\nframe to link the traffic signal shown per timestep with the lane ID being controlled.\n3.2\nCore trajdata Functionalities\nMulti-dataset training and evaluation. One of trajdata\u2019s core functionalities1 is compiling data\nfrom multiple datasets in a UnifiedDataset object (a PyTorch [30] Dataset subclass by default).\n1 from\ntrajdata\nimport\nUnifiedDataset\n2 dataset = UnifiedDataset(\n3\ndesired_data =[\"nusc_mini -boston\", \"sdd -train\"], desired_dt =0.1 ,\n4\ncentric=\"agent\", history_sec =(1.0 , 3.0) , future_sec =(4.0 , 4.0)\n5 ) # These\nsettings\nwere used to create\nFigure 2.\n1Detailed demonstrations of trajdata\u2019s capabilities can be found in our repository\u2019s examples/ folder.\n3\n0\n+4\nEgo Future\n+1 +2 +3\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0\n-5\nAgent History\nAgent Future\nOther Agent Histories\n+1 +2 +3 +4\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\nt =\nPadding (Unavailable data)\nAvailable data\nBatch Idx\n1\n0\n2\nNeighbor\nBatch Idx 0\nBatch Idx 1\nBatch Idx 2\n1\n0\n2\nOnly 2 Neighbors\nFigure 3: trajdata can provide agent-centric (or scene-centric) batches of trajectory data for model\ntraining and evaluation in associated AgentBatch (or SceneBatch) objects. The indexing and\npadding strategy of a few core AgentBatch tensors are visualized here.\nIn this example, a dataset is created that provides agent-centric data batches (i.e., each batch el-\nement contains data for one agent at one timestep, see Fig. 3) sourced from only Boston in the\nnuScenes mini dataset (\"nusc_mini-boston\") as well as the Stanford Drone Dataset\u2019s entire train-\ning split (\"sdd-train\"), with time upsampling ensuring all data is at 10Hz (desired_dt=0.1).\nhistory_sec=(1.0, 3.0) specifies that the predicted agent\u2019s trajectory must have at least 1.0s\nof history available, with padding for any missing data up to 3.0s (see Fig. 3).\nSimilarly,\nfuture_sec=(4.0, 4.0) requires that the predicted agent\u2019s trajectory have 4.0s of future available.\ntrajdata provides many other capabilities in addition to the above, including scene-centric batches\n(i.e., data for all agents in a scene at the same timestep), semantic search (e.g., nuScenes [18] provides\ntext descriptions for each scene), agent filtering (e.g., only vehicles), coordinate frame standardiza-\ntion (i.e., making trajectories relative to the predicted agent\u2019s frame at the current timestep), map\nrasterization (e.g., if encoding scene context with a convolutional architecture), data augmentations\n(e.g., additive Gaussian noise to past trajctories), and general data transforms via custom functions.\nMap API. trajdata\u2019s standardized vector map object is VectorMap. In addition to providing\naccess to individual map elements (e.g., lanes, sidewalks), it also leverages precomputed spatial\nindices to make nearest neighbor queries very efficient.\n1 from\ntrajdata\nimport MapAPI , VectorMap\n2 vec_map: VectorMap = MapAPI (<=>).get_map(\"nusc_mini:boston -seaport\")\n3 lane = vec_map. get_closest_lane (np.array ([50.0 , 100.0 , 0.0]))\nIn the example above, the polyline map of Boston\u2019s seaport neighborhood (from nuScenes [18]) is\nloaded from the user\u2019s trajdata cache (its path would be specified instead of <=>) and queried for\nthe closest RoadLane to a given x, y, z position.\nSimulation Interface. trajdata also provides a simulation interface that enables users to initialize\na scene from real-world data and simulate agents from a specific timestep onwards. Simulated agent\nmotion is recorded by trajdata and can be analyzed with a library of evaluation metrics (e.g.,\ncollision and offroad rates, statistical differences to real-world data distributions) or exported to disk.\nThis functionality was extensively used to benchmark learning-based traffic models in [32, 33].\n1 from\ntrajdata.simulation\nimport\nSimulationScene\n2 sim_scene = SimulationScene (<=>) # Specify\ninitial\nscene to use.\n3 obs = sim_scene.reset () # Initialized\nfrom real\nagent\nstates in data.\n4 for t in range (10): # Simulating 10 timesteps in this\nexample.\n5\nnew_state_dict = ... # Compute\nthe new state of sim agents.\n6\nobs = sim_scene.step(new_state_dict )\nIn this example, a SimulationScene is initialized from a scene in an existing dataset (specified with\nthe <=> arguments), after which it can be accessed similarly to an OpenAI Gym [41] reinforcement\nlearning environment, using methods like reset and step.\n4\nDataset Comparisons and Analyses\nIn this section, we leverage trajdata\u2019s standardized trajectory and map representations to directly\ncompare many popular AV and pedestrian trajectory datasets along a variety of metrics. Our goal is\nto provide a deeper understanding of the datasets underpinning much of human motion research by\nanalyzing their data distributions, motion complexity, and annotation quality.\n4\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\nNumber of Agents\nDataset\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\nUNKNOWN\nVEHICLE\nPEDESTRIAN\nBICYCLE\nMOTORCYCLE\nAgent Type\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nProportion\nDataset\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\nFigure 4: Left: Number of unique agents per dataset. Right: Distribution of agent types per dataset.\nNote that we only analyze dataset training and validation splits, since these are the splits predominantly\nused by methods for development. We explicitly do not analyze test splits since they are either not\navailable publicly or because doing so may harm existing benchmark validity. Further, while\ntrajdata supports data frequency up- and down-scaling via interpolation and down-sampling, all of\nthe following analyses were conducted in each dataset\u2019s native data resolution. All analyses were\nperformed using the latest version of trajdata at the time of writing (v1.3.2) on a desktop computer\nwith 64 GB of RAM and an AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3975WX 32-core CPU. For larger\ndatasets, an NVIDIA DGX-1 server with 400 GB of RAM and 64 CPU cores was used.\n4.1\nAgent Distributions\nPopulation. To build a fundamental understanding of the considered datasets, we first analyze and\ncompare agent populations. Fig. 4 visualizes overall agent counts and proportions per dataset. As\ncan be expected, modern large-scale AV datasets such as Waymo [17] and Lyft Level 5 [19] contain\nmultiple orders of magnitude more agents than earlier pedestrian datasets SDD [40], ETH [22], or\nUCY [23]. However, as we will show later, pedestrian datasets still provide value in terms of agent\ndiversity, density, and motion complexity in popular social robotics settings such as college campuses.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4 (right), the vast majority of agents in AV datasets are vehicles or pedestrians,\nwith the exception of Lyft Level 5 [19] where 71.8% of agents have unknown types. In contrast, bicy-\ncles (a relatively niche category in many datasets) account for 41% of all agents in SDD [40] (indeed,\nbiking is a popular method of transportation around Stanford\u2019s large campus). Such imbalances in\nagent populations are indicative of real-world distributions, e.g., motorcycles make up only 3.5% of\nvehicles in the USA [42], similar to their proportion in nuScenes [18] (1.6%).\nDensity and Observation Duration. In addition to which agent types are captured in scenes, the\namount and density of agents can be an important desiderata (e.g., for research on crowd behavior)\nor computational consideration (e.g., for methods whose runtime scales with the number of agents).\nFig. 5 visualizes the distribution of the number of agents observed per scene per timestep (left), as well\nas the maximum number of simultaneous agents per scene (right). As can be seen, urban scenarios\ncaptured in modern AV datasets frequently contain 100+ detected agents (with a long tail extending\nto 250+ agents). In this respect, ETH [22], UCY [23], and INTERACTION [39] are limited by their\nfixed-camera and drone-based data-collection strategies compared to the comprehensive on-vehicle\nsensors used in nuScenes [18], Waymo [17], Lyft [19], and nuPlan [27]. However, while ETH [22],\nUCY [23], and INTERACTION [39] do not contain as many agents, they consistently provide the\nhighest-density scenes (see Fig. 6), especially for pedestrians and bicycles. We compute agent density\nby dividing the number of agents in a scene by their overall bounding rectangle area, as in [25].\nEach dataset supported by trajdata adopts different scenario lengths and corresponding agent\nobservation durations. As can be seen in Fig. 7, AV datasets are comprised of scenarios with lengths\nranging from 4s in INTERACTION [39] to 25s in Lyft Level 5 [19]. The peaks at the right of\neach AV dataset duration distribution are caused by the always-present ego-vehicle (for Vehicles)\nas well as other agents detected throughout the scene (common in steady traffic, parking lots, or\nat an intersection with stopped traffic and pedestrians waiting to cross). One can also see that Lyft\nLevel 5 [19] agent detections are much shorter-lived compared to other AV datasets\u2019 relatively\nuniform distributions (Waymo [17], nuScenes [18], and nuPlan [27]).

We conduct additional comparisons between data\ncollection methodologies in Section 4.3.\nEgo-Agent Distances. When developing AV perception systems, an important consideration is the\nsensor range(s) necessary to facilitate the desired prediction and planning horizons as well as provide\nadvanced warning of critical situations (e.g., stopped traffic on a highway). In Fig. 8, we compare\nthe distribution of ego-agent distances and find that, while nuScenes [18] and Lyft Level 5 [19] have\nlong-tailed distributions extending past 200m, Waymo [17] and nuPlan [27] appear to have artificial\ncut-offs at 75-80m, potentially to maintain data quality by avoiding poor data from distant agents.\nHowever, it would be more useful to maintain distant detections and add uncertainty outputs from the\nautolabeler to support uncertain long-range detection research in addition to improving autolabeling.\nMapped Areas. HD maps are a core component of many AV datasets, frequently leveraged in\ntrajectory forecasting and motion planning research to provide scene context and geometric lane\ninformation (e.g., for global search-based planning and trajectory optimization). Current AV dataset\nmaps are very large (see Table 2 in the appendix) and comprehensive, spanning multiple neighbor-\nhoods in different cities. However, not all HD maps are created equal, commonly differing along\nthree axes: Area completeness, lane definitions, and traffic lights. While most AV datasets provide\ncomplete HD maps of neighborhoods, Waymo [17] differs by only providing local map crops per\nscenario without a common reference frame across scenarios2. This also significantly increases the\nstorage requirements of Waymo [17] maps compared to other datasets.\nLane definitions can also differ significantly between datasets, with intersections being a notable\ndifferentiator. For instance, the nuScenes dataset [18] does not annotate intersections fully, opting\nfor only lane centerlines without associated edges (Fig. 2 shows an example). Lyft Level 5 [19] and\nnuPlan [27] both include full lane center and edge information for all possible motion paths through\nan intersection. Waymo [17] maps are unique in that they provide full lane center and boundary\ninformation, but there are many gaps in the associations between lane centerlines and boundaries,\nmaking it difficult to construct lane edge polylines or lane area polygons3. As a result, we exclude\nWaymo maps from map-based analyses in this work.\n4.2\nMotion Complexity\nMeasuring the complexity of driving scenarios is an important open problem in the AV domain, with a\nvariety of proposed approaches ranging from heuristic methods [25] to powerful conditional behavior\n2See https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/issues/394 for visualizations.\n3See https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/issues/389 for visualizations.\n6\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAgent Observation Length (s)\nLyft\nSDD\nDataset\nUnknowns\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAgent Observation Length (s)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nVehicles\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAgent Observation Length (s)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\nPedestrians\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAgent Observation Length (s)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nBicycles\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nAgent Observation Length (s)\nnuSc\nMotorcycles\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n10 2\n2 \u00d7 10 2\n3 \u00d7 10 2\n4 \u00d7 10 2\n6 \u00d7 10 2\nProportion\nFigure 7: Distributions of the length of time agents are observed in each scene.\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nAgent-Ego Distance (m)\nLyft\nDataset\nUnknowns\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nAgent-Ego Distance (m)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nLyft\nnuPlan\nVehicles\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nAgent-Ego Distance (m)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nLyft\nnuPlan\nPedestrians\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nAgent-Ego Distance (m)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nLyft\nnuPlan\nBicycles\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nAgent-Ego Distance (m)\nnuSc\nMotorcycles\n10 5\n10 3\n10 6\n10 4\n10 2\n10 5\n10 3\n10 4\n10 2\n10 4\n10 3\n10 2\nProportion\nFigure 8: Distribution of distances between agents and data-collecting ego-vehicle in AV datasets.\nprediction models [43]. To avoid potential biases in analyzing datasets with an externally-trained\nmodel, we employ simple and interpretable heuristics similar to [25].\nMotion Diversity. We first analyze distributions of dynamic agent quantities (e.g., speed, acceleration,\njerk). As can be seen in Fig. 9, the majority of speed distributions have high peaks at zero (no motion).\nThis is corroborated by Table 3 in the appendix, which shows that a significant portion of agents are\nstationary in many datasets, especially for nuScenes [18] (17.5%) and Waymo [17] (53.6%). After\nthe initial peak, agent speed distributions drop sharply to a roughly uniform plateau (up to 20m/s for\nvehicles) before dropping completely around 30m/s (a common highway speed around the world).\nWhile SDD [40] and INTERACTION [39] have sensible vehicle speeds, their pedestrian speeds can\nbe too high. Such high speeds may be caused by annotations near the edge of drone camera view\nor by rectification artifacts near the image border. Additionally, the very long-tailed distribution\nof Lyft [19]) and Waymo [17]) vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle speeds (exceeding 60m/s) show a\nremaining area of improvement for state-of-the-art AV perception systems and autolabeling pipelines.\nComparisons of acceleration and jerk can be found in the appendix. Overall, from dynamic quantities\nalone, Waymo [17]) and Lyft [19] provide the most diversity in agent motion. If such long-tailed data\nis undesirable, the INTERACTION [39] dataset provides the most realistic set of vehicle speeds.\nTrajectory Nonlinearity. To analyze the spatial diversity of agent trajectories, we first compare each\nagent\u2019s heading to their initial timestep. As can be seen in Fig. 10, and reiterating earlier analyses, the\nvast majority of human movement is straight and linear (\u2206h = 0). Moving away from the center, we\nalso see repeated symmetric peaks at \u00b1 \u03c0\n2 (capturing left and right turns) and \u00b1k\u03c0 in some datasets.\nOne possible reason for these periodic peaks in the distribution is an artifact of the autolabeling\nmethods used in the datasets (since only datasets that autolabel sensor data are affected), another is\nthat their respective scene geometries contain more roundabouts, cul-de-sacs, and repeated turns than\nother datasets (more detailed heading distributions can be found in the appendix). We can also see\nthat pedestrians\u2019 distributions are more uniform as they do not have to adhere to rigid road geometry.\nPath Efficiency. Lastly, we also measure agent path efficiencies, defined as the ratio of the distance\nbetween trajectory endpoints to the trajectory length [25]. Intuitively, the closer to 100%, the closer\nthe trajectory is to a straight line. As can be seen in Fig. 15 in the appendix, most path efficiency\ndistributions are uniformly distributed, with peaks near 100%, echoing earlier straight-line findings.\nHowever, the INTERACTION [39] dataset is an outlier in that its agent trajectories are predominantly\nstraight lines with much less curved motion than other AV and pedestrian datasets.\n4.3\nAnnotation Quality\nWhile analyzing datasets\u2019 true annotation accuracy would be best, neither we nor the original data\nannotators have access to the underlying real-world ground truth. As a proxy, we instead analyze the\nself-consistency of annotations in the form of incidence rates of collisions between agents, off-road\ndriving, and uncomfortable high-acceleration events (using 0.4g as a standard threshold [44, 45]).\n7\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\nSpeed (m/s)\nLyft\nSDD\nDataset\nUnknowns\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\nSpeed (m/s)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nVehicles\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\nSpeed (m/s)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\nPedestrians\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\nSpeed (m/s)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nBicycles\n0\n15\n30\n45\n60\nSpeed (m/s)\nnuSc\nMotorcycles\n10 8\n10 6\n10 4\n10 2\n10 6\n10 4\n10 2\n10 6\n10 4\n10 2\n10 6\n10 4\n10 2\n10 4\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\nProportion\nFigure 9: Agent speed distributions per dataset and agent type.\n4\n2\n0\n2\n4\nRel.

We denote bounding box\nintersections between agents as collisions, and agent center-of-mass exiting the road boundary as\noff-road driving. Collisions typically indicate errors in bounding box annotations, whereas off-road\ndriving can indicate erroneous bounding box dimensions, missing map coverage, or harsh driving\nthat, e.g., cuts corners during a right turn.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 11 (left), most vehicles in datasets experience collision rates below 5%. Of\nparticular note is the fact that state-of-the-art autolabeling systems (e.g., used in Waymo [17]) are\nnearly matching the accuracy of human annotations (e.g., used in nuscenes [18]) in terms of resulting\ncollision rates. However, detecting agents from a near-ground perspective (even with 3D LiDAR) is a\nvery challenging task, and current performance still lags behind high altitude viewpoints. In particular,\nThe INTERACTION [39] dataset achieves orders of magnitude lower vehicle collision, off-road,\nand harsh acceleration rates owing to its drone-based data collection strategy. In theory, SDD [40]\nshould enjoy a similar advantage, but it only provides axis-aligned bounding box annotations (which\noverestimate agent extents) and Stanford\u2019s college campus contains much more interactive agents\nthan other urban environments. More generally, the notion of bounding box intersections as collisions\ndoes not transfer exactly to pedestrians as they can enter/exit cars and walk in close groups, and\nfurther study is needed to robustly distinguish between errant motion and normal interactive motion.\nIn Fig. 11 (middle), we find that vehicles in general experience very few (< 1%) harsh acceleration\nevents, with Waymo [17], Lyft [19], and nuScenes [18] all having the highest incidence, commen-\nsurate with their earlier-discussed long-tail acceleration distributions. Lastly, we find in Fig. 11\n(right) that the INTERACTION [39] and nuPlan [27] agent annotations are well-aligned onto their\nmaps, whereas nuScenes [18] suffers from poor map coverage away from main roads (there are many\nannotated parked cars next to the main road) and Lyft [19] suffers from high false positive detections\nnext to the main road (the majority of which take the Unknown class).\n5\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe recent releases of large-scale human trajectory datasets have significantly accelerated the field of\nAV research. However, their unique data formats and custom developer APIs have complicated multi-\ndataset research efforts (e.g., [20, 21]). In this work, we present trajdata, a unified trajectory data\nloader that aims to harmonize data formats, standardize data access APIs, and simplify the process of\nusing multiple AV datasets within the AV research community with a simple, uniform, and efficient\ndata representation and development API. We used trajdata to comprehensively compare existing\ntrajectory datasets, finding that, in terms of annotation self-consistency, drone-based data collection\nmethods yield significantly more accurate birds-eye view bounding box annotations than even\nstate-of-the-art AV perception stacks with LiDAR (albeit with much less spatial coverage), modern\n8\nUNKNOWN\nVEHICLE\nPEDESTRIAN\nBICYCLE\nMOTORCYCLE\nAgent Type\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n100\nCollision Rate\nDataset\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\n10 3\nHarsh Acceleration Rate\nDataset\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\nUNKNOWN\nVEHICLE\nPEDESTRIAN\nBICYCLE\nMOTORCYCLE\nAgent Type\n10 1\n100\nOffroad Rate\nDataset\nnuSc\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nFigure 11: Self-consistency failure rates per dataset and agent type, in the form of collision (left),\nhigh vehicle acceleration (middle), and off-road (right) rates.\nautolabeling pipelines are nearing human annotation performance, and smaller-scale pedestrian\ndatasets can still be useful for investigations requiring high-agent-density scenarios.\nAs concrete recommendations, we saw that some datasets artificially limit the distance agents are\nautolabeled. Instead, it would be more useful to the long-range detection community to remove such\nrestrictions, but add autolabeler-output uncertainties to long-range detections, supporting uncertain\nperception research along the way. Further, incorporating explicit self-consistency checks within\nautolabeling pipelines and catching, e.g., collisions, prior to release can both improve the autolabeling\nmethod as well as the resulting data labels.\nMore broadly, providing researchers with access to more data comprised of various agent types\nfrom diverse geographies should help in modeling rare agent types and behaviors, in addition to\naiding in the generalization of methods to multiple geographies. However, as we have seen in prior\nsections, there is an overwhelming bias towards straight line driving, and one capability missing\nfrom trajdata is the ability to (re)balance data on a semantic (behavioral) level. Finally, even if\nlower-level trajectory classes (e.g., driving straight, turning left/right, slowing down, speeding up,\netc) are balanced, an important higher-level consideration during original dataset curation time is to\nensure that AV datasets explore all geographic regions within an environment, and not only those of\ncertain socioeconomic statuses or transportation access.\nFuture work will address the current limitations of trajdata (e.g., expanding the number of sup-\nported datasets and new capabilities such as geometric map element associations to support Waymo-\nlike map formats [17]). Further, incorporating sensor data would also enable perception research as\nwell as joint perception-prediction-planning research, an exciting emerging AV research field.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nWe thank all past and present members of the NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Group for\ntheir code contributions to trajdata and feedback after using it in projects.\nReferences\n[1] A.

All datasets supported by trajdata are captured in public spaces.\nFurther, each of the ETH [22], UCY [23], SDD [40], and INTERACTION [39] datasets capture data\nin public spaces from elevated fixed traffic cameras or drones, whose birds-eye viewpoints shield the\nfaces of pedestrians and drivers from being collected. The nuScenes [18], Lyft Level 5 [19], Waymo\nOpen Motion [17], and nuPlan [27] datasets each preserve privacy by leveraging state-of-the-art\nobject detection techniques to detect and blur license plates and faces.\nB\nMap Statistics\nAs shown in Table 2, current AV dataset maps are very large, spanning multiple neighborhoods in\ndifferent cities. The INTERACTION [39] dataset is a notable exception in magnitude, however, due\nto a drone camera\u2019s limited spatial observation range.\nC\nStationary Agents\nTable 3 summarizes the amount of stationary agents per dataset. As can be seen, nuScenes (17.5%)\nand Waymo Open (53.6%) are comprised of many parked vehicles.\nD\nAcceleration and Jerk\nSimilar to the speed distributions in the main text, Fig. 12 shows that Waymo [17], Lyft [19], and\nSDD [40] have long-tailed acceleration and jerk distributions.

Note that these values are derived by trajdata via finite\ndifferencing. Accordingly, some overestimation of the acceleration and jerk distribution supports are\nto be expected.\nE\nHeading Distributions\nThe distributions of (unnormalized) agent headings are shown in Fig. 13. As can be seen, most\ndistributions contain peaks around 0 and \u00b1\u03c0/2 radians, as north-south and east-west roads are very\ncommon in many cities. As a particular example, Fig. 14 visualizes heading distributions for vehicles\nand pedestrians in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset [17], showing that pedestrians have much more\nvaried heading values than road-following vehicles.\nF\nPath Efficiency\nAs can be seen in Fig. 15, most path efficiency distributions are uniformly distributed, with peaks\nnear 100% (shown as brightly-colored regions), echoing earlier straight-line findings. Further, the\nINTERACTION [39] dataset is an outlier in that its vehicle and pedestrian trajectories are virtually\nall straight lines with much less curved motion than other AV and pedestrian datasets.\n14\n0\n/4\n/2\n3 /4\n5 /4\n3 /2\n7 /4\nHeading (radians)\n2%4%6%8%10%\n0\n/4\n/2\n3 /4\n5 /4\n3 /2\n7 /4\nHeading (radians)\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\nFigure 14: Vehicle (left) and pedestrian (right) heading distributions in Waymo Open [17].\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nPath Efficiency (%)\nLyft\nSDD\nDataset\nUnknowns\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nPath Efficiency (%)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nVehicles\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nPath Efficiency (%)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nINT S\nINT M\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nETH\nUCY\nPedestrians\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nPath Efficiency (%)\nnuSc\nWOMD\nLyft\nnuPlan\nSDD\nBicycles\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nPath Efficiency (%)\nnuSc\nMotorcycles\n10 2\n10 1\n10 4\n10 2\n10 4\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n10 2\n10 1\nProportion\nFigure 15: Path efficiency distributions visualized per agent type and dataset.\n15\n"
